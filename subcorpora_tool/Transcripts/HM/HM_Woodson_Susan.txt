Speaker 1: What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Anything sweet is my favorite food, anything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Really, I think that what--I can really say this.  I like the Baptist church peach or apple cobbler.  But they have to be made by someone that really knows how to do apple and peach cobblers.
Speaker 1: And they know how to do that in the Baptist church?
Speaker 2: Baptist church.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue, I love blue because my son, when he was born, blue, everything around my son was blue.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring and fall are my favorite times of the year.  Spring, when life is opening up; fall when twilight (unclear) anew, is going into the dark, heavy days, winter.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I haven't traveled very much.  I--the biggest traveling was going out to Seattle [Washington], visiting my home.  But I'm not a traveler.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes.  But it's only between my son and I.  "The kitchen is closed."  This is something, a story my husband would tell us.  And he loved the--and while he was dying, one night he even said to me, "The kitchen is closed".  It meant don't go in the kitchen.  Don't mess up where it's been cleaned.  Leave it alone.

Speaker 1: What do you know about your family history or the origins of your family?  How far can you trace your family back?
Speaker 2: Someone else had to trace the origins of the family.  I had a complete family history that was, the diagram of it.  And I come in towards the end.  I'm the last of this generation, age-wise.  The next generation down would be represented by my son [Harold Woodson Jr.] who's about 50, and I guess, yeah, be '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s].  That's the next generation down.
Speaker 1: Well, how far back can you go?
Speaker 2: I can't go back very far other than to--I wasn't around when Senator [Hiram R.] Revels was alive.  I can go back to--
Speaker 1: Ma'am, I wanted to tell, I wanted you to tell us about anybody further back.  That's what I meant.
Speaker 2: Say that again.
Speaker 1: No, I wanted you tell us about him and other ancestors from the 19th--first of all, how far back can you go, and then I wanted you to tell us a little bit about him and some of the others.
Speaker 2: Okay, as far back as I can go is Senator Hiram Revels who was the first black senator of the United States Senate.  He took the seat of Jefferson Davis and finished out the term, his term.  He was not the first elected black senator, but he was the first senator.  I, the only thing I can remember a bit about him are some of the stories that his daughter, one of his daughters, Susie Revels [Cayton], would tell me.  I--let's see--help me.  Let's see what else.  Is this gonna be blocked out?
Speaker 1: No, just--you don't have to tell it in historical detail, but--
Speaker 2: I can't think--
Speaker 1: --any stories about him or things that are passed down, that's fine.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But people can read about him if they want to know all the details.
Speaker 2: These are stories that have never been told and they're directly from Mother [her grandmother, Susie Revels Cayton].  At dinnertime, they always sat down at the table to have dinner.  And particularly, on holidays, they'd have to wait in the back room and when dinner was called, they'd fly like angels.  They'd all fly in and take their seats.  And one of the sisters, Dora, stopped them.  She was mad at something.  And said, I'm the devil today, I'm the devil, and sat down like a devil.  That story doesn't mean too much, but it was--Mother enjoyed that story.  Then something else that I remember, there was not in history.  And I've often wondered about that.  Hiram Revels was on his way home one evening.  And he was on his horse.  And it was getting dark, and there was a young boy sitting on the road in his way, so I'm told.  And he must have been about 7 or 8 years old.  And he stopped the horse and said, boy, go home.  It's getting dark.  And he says, I don't have a home.  And he questioned him.  And finally, he pulled him up on the horse, put him on the back, the back of his horse, and they took him home.  He made a pad behind the, the heating system, well, near the stove.  And that's where he slept.  I don't know too much of how he became involved with the family, but all five sisters called him their little brother.  And he grew up in the Revels home and was put through school.  But no one--I know the story, but no one else knows this.  I tried to look it up and no one knows about this young man.  The next part of the family that I do remember is the family I grew up with.  And that's, that would be two brothers [uncles], Horace Cayton, a writer, wrote 'Black Metropolis,' along with St. Clair Drake, along with his own autobiography.  He became very--he contributed a lot to the Chicago [Illinois], to the South Side.  He was married to a white woman who was very interesting.  They both came to Chicago, and they couldn't find a place to live.  So they went to old Lincoln Center, where they didn't care what you were and lived there.  But the family, that marriage broke up because it was so hard for an interracial marriage to live in Chicago, socially even.  Bonnie could get jobs and Horace couldn't during that period.  The next in the family was Revels.  Revels became a labor leader.  He--
Speaker 1: This is Revels--
Speaker 2: Revels Cayton, yeah, a labor leader.  And he couldn't get jobs in Seattle [Washington].  Most of the black, young men of his time had to work on boats going from California to Seattle.  But he did become an organizer, worked under Harry--let's see, what was his name?  Harry Bridges, I don't think that's his first name, Harry Bridges--yes, it is.  Harry Bridges, became very high up in that, in that organization of--Revels became president of a black housing project down there, comparable, but large, comparable to what we have in Chicago.  That was his beginning.  Mayor [Joseph L.] Alioto was looking for a black man to sit on his board--
Speaker 1: That's the mayor of San Francisco [California]?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was the mayor at that time.  Yes.  The structure there is you have men behind you, 5 men behind--5 persons behind you.  And Revels really represented the black people in that, in San Francisco at that time, though he was fairly--he was still an organizer in his heart.  He told Mayor Alioto that, he said, you know, I am a, I have been a member of the Communist Party.  And he says, I don't care what you're a member of.  I want to see what you can do to help the city.  He helped--he stayed on that board for about a year or two years.  And at a certain age, I think 60 or 65, he had to get off.  I have a sister [aunt] named Lillie Cayton.  She has many--she had many children.  She's dead now.  The interest, important thing about Lillie, Lillie became a heavy drinker and got out of control.  She hit the bottom.  And the beautifully story is how she came up.  When she did die, A, Alcoholic--AA [Alcoholics Anonymous] I think it is, they contributed--they had organizations up and down from Seattle to California remember Lillie.  She preached, and she went up and down California, going to different meetings.  I went to the memorial, the original memorial.  And it was so interesting.  I sat there, and all these people, family people, all members of AA, all nationalities, there to remember her.  One young, one man got up on the stage, he was a doctor.  And they usually say all, I'm Lillie Cayton, I'm an alcoholic.  He said, I'm doctor so and so, I'm an alcoholic, and turned and said, and thank you Lillie for bringing to where I am today.  She, in the book, the Cayton book, she apparently comes out the strongest member of the Cayton family.  Madge Cayton never married.  She became a social worker in Chicago at Children's [Services] Division, and was head of it.  She died rather young, never getting married.  And then it's me.  I have--in 1985, I retired.  My husband and I both retired at the same time.  After a month of retirement, in his retirement, I could see that it wasn't gonna be a marriage the way you can really enjoy--he likes, he liked reading.  And I, I like, well, other things I like much more.  And that's where my art gallery started during that period.

Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us and her date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Don't know the date.  Are we on?  Are some of these being blacked out?
Speaker 1: No, we'll just keep going.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's okay.
Speaker 2: The only mother I know, Susie, S-U-S-I-E, Revels, R-E-V-E-L-S, Cayton.  She was born in Mississippi, and I'm not sure of the date.  She was really quite an interesting person.  What I knew of her during the Depression, people would be marching up and down Seattle [Washington]--
Speaker 1: Now, she--
Speaker 2: Water will help.
Speaker 1: She was a daughter of Hiram [R.] Revels.
Speaker 2: She was a daughter of Hiram Revels, one of the 5 daughters.  I don't know whether she was the oldest one or not.
Speaker 1: And she was raised in Alcorn, Mississippi, you said, or Hattie--
Speaker 2: Part of it.
Speaker 1: Holly Springs or--
Speaker 2: Holly Springs and Alcorn--you're going to have let me have some water.  What was I talking about?
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry.  I've just established the fact that she's a daughter of Hiram Revels.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: She grew up in Mississippi in--
Speaker 2: Yes, right.  She grew up in Mississippi, and she was--Dad [grandfather Horace Roscoe Cayton Sr.] had gone out to Seattle.  And he had a newspapers.  And she was sending stories to, writing stories, and he would publish them.  Finally, he asked her to marry him, and she--I used to laugh.  I said, you must have taken a stage coach.  It took her so long to get there.  She got in Seattle.  They did get married.  And she became--he was editor of the paper [Seattle Republican] and she was writing and putting the paper together and having a--raised, had a family at that time.  She was a very interesting woman, very formal.  She never--my dad would call me from outside.  And he said, go see what your mother's doing.  Go see Mrs. Cayton, see your mother, Mrs. Cayton.  Dad, Mother would say, to any of the children, go see your father, Mr. Cayton.  It was a very formal family.  We never knew whether they slept in the same room, but it was a very, very formal family.  They always said, you're a Cayton, act like a Cayton.  That was always stressed.  You're a Cayton, act like it.  I'm trying to think of some of the interesting things.  One of the things that shocked my father, that Mother was very liberal.  And Dad, at that time, was a Republican.  I remember when he, at the dinner table, I only remember Dad just said, I have something to announce today.  He was at the top of the table and everybody around.  And he stood up, and he said, today I voted the Democratic ticket.  And everybody applauded.  They were--Revels [Cayton] was a Communist, Mother was a Communist.  Horace [Cayton Jr.] was a Democrat.  So that this was a big step in our family for him to leave the Republican Party and become a Democrat.
Speaker 1: Was that during the Depression?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was born--I never knew any money in our family.  It was a very--they were very wealthy.  They had a home, a carriage and horses.  They had--I, I heard it, but then when I read it in the book, I was shocked.  But they lived very fabulously.  They lived wealthy.  They ate wealthy.  They went around with the social people.
Speaker 1: That was before you were born?
Speaker 2: Before I was born, and then--yes, before I was born, that's right because as the Caytons came down financially--what happened, Dad's paper was geared to the Republicans and to the politics of Seattle.  But what happened was that, when the lynchings started in the, down South, he would report the lynchings.  And the white people didn't like that.  They, and they'd withdraw their advertisements.  If things were happening in Seattle and he would announce that in the paper, and they took their ads away, and the paper died.  And he bought an apartment house and moved the family there.  And that's really where I, my life started, right there at the apartment house.
Speaker 1: Now, can you tell us more about your mother.  You said she was a liberal and she was a  (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Very liberal.  And I knew we were, we were very poor.  She had a nursery in the apart--in the back of the apartment house.  It was where children were taken from their families and put there, babies mostly, until they were adopted or other things that happened would happen to them.  That's how she made her living.  She also washed shirts for a very wealthy white doctor.  And that way, she was able to get health--Revels was very sick.  And they didn't have the money to send him to a doctor.  And this doctor took care of Revels.  And what else did Mother do?  Mother would go to the operas.  She would organize clubs that were sewing, making quilts.  They might be about 6 or 7 women making quilts.  And this was her standard of where she had studied politics and talk about politics and to read what's going on that was not in the papers.  She also became interested in the people on, on the waterfront.  Those were the slum areas.  They were unemployed and no place to go.  They, they had a meeting--there was a meeting house there that the people would meet every Sunday.  And Mother would go down there sometimes when they needed a speaker, a good speaker.  She would read poetry.  She'd read books and she'd talk about politics.  May Day, when they were marching down the street, every May Day--that was the workers all over the world would march.  Mother was in the front line.  She got old, and I can remember she took me down--in Seattle, down to First Avenue.  And the march was coming down.  And they were mostly Philippino.  They were cannery workers.  And Mother's standing beside me.  And they saw Mother, and the line stopped.  And Mother got in the front line.  And she couldn't walk very well, but she had these men carrying--walking down the street, keeping her up.  And Mother left me on the side.  She was a good labor, labor leader.  People--I know Paul Robeson, Langston Hughes, many of the--I can't think of all these names, they'd come out to Seattle just to sit and talk to her, just to sit and--and, those names that, at that time, they were in the Party.  In those days, I was a Young Communist League member.  But I had--there were no organizations to join to fight.  And so the Communist Party was a, a good stalwart organization to get in to express your anger.  Revels got out of it at the--Horace was not in the Communist--he was always a Democrat.  Revels got out of the Party, not because he didn't believe, but he couldn't make any money to survive to live on.  And I didn't realize--I wondered why he got out, until I read the Cayton book, that he had believed in what, some of the things that they did, but it was time to get out and make, try and make a living for his family.  He, Revels was very interesting, a very interesting person, self taught.  He read a lot.  He never had the chance to go to school.
Speaker 1: That's your brother [uncle]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, Horace did finish the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington].  So did Madge [Cayton] finish the University of Washington.  I don't know how they did it because we--there was not much money going around at that time, but they did go through.
Story_ID: 15743
Speaker 1: But I wanted to ask you about your father [grandfather].
Speaker 2: Newspaper.
Speaker 1: Yeah, his, if you can give us his full name and spell it for us, his date of birth and place of birth, if at all possible, or close to it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, tell us something about him.  What did he do and what was he like?
Speaker 2: Horace, Horace Roscoe Cayton.  Cayton is a slave name.  Yeah, it was a slave name.  He was born in Mississippi.  I'm told his mother, I'm told this, that his mother was the daughter of the plantation master.  Dad, his dad was a slave.  Dad was taken, let's see, his mother, I'm told was sent to Europe.  The father stayed on the plantation.  The child was taken to the master's house and was raised there.  He, I don't know these years, but slavery was going on so that gives you a general idea.
Speaker 1: So that was the 1860s at the late--or '50s at the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Fifties.
Speaker 1: Or '60s or early '60s (unclear) (simultaneous) -
Speaker 2: No, 19--no, no.
Speaker 1: Slavery ended in 1865 so he was still a--
Speaker 2: He was still there.
Speaker 1: If he was in slavery, if he was born during slavery, it would have been like 1860s, right, yeah.
Speaker 2: In the 18's, yes.  He went to Alcorn [State] University [Alcorn State, Mississippi].  I don't know, at that period, how he got there.  One interesting part about, going back to his father, I didn't know this until the records were--the young man, Richard [S.] Hobbs, when he wrote the Cayton book ['The Cayton Legacy'], went to Mississippi and found the records.  The plantation that he was born on, his bought it, as a free man, bought the plantation.  And I didn't believe that until he brought the records and showed me.  Yes, your father owned the plantation after he was free that my--(sirens)--
Speaker 1: Okay, we're back now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well, this is a true story that he did buy the plantation, but whatever happened after that.
Speaker 2: How did--is there any story about how he got the money together to buy it?
Speaker 1: That's what I was interested in.  That's why I didn't believe it.
Speaker 2: Or was it more of a--do you think it might be possible that it was more of a gift because he was the grandson of the owner of the plantation, I mean in actuality, even though he may not have been recognized as such?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't, I really don't know.  I can't even, you know, I can't discuss that.  I don't know.  I'm sure that it could have been the grandson, but there must have been a many a grandson on that plantation, and why would they choose him?  But he did go to Alcorn, and he was interested in Mother's sister, not, not Mother herself.  And he was escorting her out.  But he left to go out to Seattle [Washington], she started, Mother started writing stories and sending them to him.  And the love switched to Susie [Revels Cayton].  And that was their, how they courted each other, by writing her stories and writing letters.  Tell me something else to say, let's say.
Speaker 2: That didn't cause any trouble between the two sisters did it?
Speaker 1: No, cause I think that sister married Perry Howard of Washington, D.C.  No, uh-un.
Speaker 2: Now, why did he go to Seattle?  Why did your father go to Seattle?
Speaker 1: To get away from the South.
Speaker 2: Well, he just purchased this plantation, and--
Speaker 1: I'm talking about his father.  Now, you're talking about Daddy Cayton now.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: I don't know whether--anything that happened down there.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.  I'm getting it confused.
Speaker 1: But Horace Cayton, Sr., he went to Seattle, but he went several places before really establishing himself in Seattle, working many kinds of jobs to get there.  He became very wealthy, very wealthy with the newspaper [Seattle Republican].  When he lost it, he lost dignity.  He went--when he lost his paper people went to some of these political people and asked for jobs, they wouldn't give it to him.  So the family was just really going down the hill during the period that I was around.  Daddy died--when Dad died [1940], we were living at 820 21st Avenue.  It seemed like we didn't have hardly any money to even bury him.  But Horace [Cayton Jr.] came home from Chicago [Illinois].  Revels [Cayton] came home from California to the funeral.  It was a big funeral.  People did acknowledge him, even though they wouldn't help him.  And then the family--Madge [Cayton] did not come.  The family decided that it was time for me to come to Chicago.  That was their decision, mostly Mother's.  So Horace, Revels and a man named Gene [Coleman]--I can't think of Gene's last name, but he had graduated from the University of Washington with Horace.  He died a mail carrier, of course, he didn't, couldn't get a job there, but he, he was a driver.  And we first drove down from Seattle to California.  And Horace pretended that he was very sick.
Story_ID: 15744
Speaker 1: Let me go back a little step about to the funeral [of her grandfather, Horace R. Cayton Sr.].  There was friction--there's always been friction between the two brothers.  Mostly, as I understand it now, is that Horace [Cayton Jr.] was mad because he wouldn't, didn't (unclear) to Revels' name, and Revels [Cayton] had it.  So then, when the funeral was there, the labor unions all up and down the West Coast sent flowers, telegrams.  And the people in Chicago [Illinois] didn't know what, what was happening, no letters, no flowers, no nothing.  And Horace resented that.  He said, well, if this was in Chicago, we--it would be a big funeral, and my friends would be there.  So as we drove to Seattle [Washington]--down to California, the friction was pretty bad between the two brothers, very bad.  So Horace pretended like he was sick when he got to California and flew back to Chicago.  So that left the driver, Gene Coleman was his name, and Revels and I.  We got into the middle of the country, don't know where it was.  I've forgotten.  And Revels truly was sick, something, sleeping sickness [encephalitis lethargis].  And it was being treated in Seattle as a young boy.  But he truly was sick, and he had to fly to Chicago.  And that left Gene Coleman and me alone in the car.  The family was sort of all uptight.  Daddy was gone.  Mother [grandmother Susie Revels Cayton]--we're leaving Mother.  Mother was kind of my age, feeble.  Nobody could get together.  So Madge [Cayton] made up her mind that--she felt that alone--I was young, could not come across the rest of the country with Gene.
Speaker 2: About how old were you (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Teen, teenage, yeah, teenager.  I can figure it out, but not--she felt that I could not come across the country alone with Gene Coleman.  And they all knew each other.  But this was just a period of the family was shaky.
Story_ID: 15745
Speaker 1: Paul Robeson was closing out a concert that was at 43rd and Ashland, some large building there.  And it was something to do--it was an all-black affair.  There must have been thousands there, must have been.  So he flew out and drove to where we were and from there, drove into Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Paul Robeson drove you to--
Speaker 1: No, the driver, but he was with--I was with two men, Gene Coleman and Paul Robeson and myself.  And this was--Madge [Cayton] felt that was secure.  She was the matriarch of the family at that period.  So we drove into Chicago, and the first thing that--I was looking at all these black people.  So he had Gene stop at 47th and Michigan, and we just stood on that corner.  I had--it was a new world, complete new world.  Black people dressed up.  We walked up 47th Street, businesses, black businesses.  And they had on these red suits and hats and red shoes.  And they were just--I had never seen such a city that was awake with people walking up and down the streets, going into stores, drug stores.  And I used the word, I used the word to Paul, "Look at these niggers".  Now, this is what, you know, we were talking like that in those days.  And "Look at these niggers.  I've never seen anything like it."  And he says, just wait until tonight.  And so we slowly walked up 47th Street to the Rosenwald, a new, brand new world.  And walking into the gates of the, front gate, it was paradise.  And so we took pictures and then I took a picture of Gene and Paul in front of where we were going to be living.  And that's what this picture on my wall comes from.  It was a new world.
Story_ID: 15746
Speaker 1: If you could reflect back on growing up there, and tell me about some of the sights--
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: --and sounds and smells of growing up in Seattle [Washington].
Speaker 2: Yes.  Seattle was clean.  No black school teachers.  All white, but it was a clean city.  You could sleep anywhere and feel comfortable.  See, it was divided.  One section was called the Red Light District.  That was night clubs like the Black and Tan.  That's where your jazz was, right out there, at 40--on Jackson Street.  I lived in between, and then on the other side was where all the homes were and the churches were.  We were stretched in between.  The biggest thing in Seattle in those days was to go to the baseball park and watch our team, the black team, home teams play baseball.  That's how we spent our Sundays.  It looked like everybody in Seattle was there watching these teams.  Satchel Paige was there, not playing, but he, he knew this is where to--if you wanted to know Seattle, you go there.  People, how did they make a living?  Railroad, the railroad porters.  They made the most money during that period.  Young men like Horace [Cayton Jr.] and Revels [Cayton] hit the boats going from Seattle to California.  They were not longshoremen so they couldn't go out, away from that particular port.  As they got older, they could have traveled around, doing stewardess or whatever.  Seattle, at that period was green, full of flowers, very few educated people.  After I left, that's when, those that did get to go to college finally got a few jobs, but never in the school system.  I was surprised.  I had to leave Chicago [Illinois] '40 [1940] to get, to go back home, you know, 5 years later to find that there were schoolteachers there.  Most of those that were going to school, like Homer [E.] Harris--Homer Harris was the, one of the doctors there.  He's my age.  He had to go to the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa].  And interesting, just about a month, two or three months ago, and finding out he was the first black football captain at the University of Iowa.  And they're just now beginning to acknowledge him; going back to Seattle now, they're getting ready to open up a million dollar park [Homer Harris Park] in his name.  Going back home after leaving there, going back home and seeing people working all over.  There were theaters we couldn't go to when I was growing up, couldn't go up in--we'd have to sit upstairs; glass enclosure so we, they weren't--we weren't breathing down on the first floor.  I never really realized that we were discriminated on because I grew up in it, and I figured that's the way the world's supposed to be, all the black folks or the Chinese--Chinese or Japanese, we were supposed to live off to ourselves.  In my block that I grew up in, where the Laurel apartments was, that's what it, the name of the apartment that we lived in, I went--on one side of the street was the Japanese, a Japanese family--two Japanese families, but the Nakamuers (ph.)--Natiako Yamaguchi (ph.), she was my favorite youngster to grow with, grow up with.  We played jacks, and little fine Japanese material with the rice in it so that we could play jacks.  She lived on the block.  Japanese, and there were black and a Philippino family.  I don't know how the--oh, and a Jewish family.  The Jewish people during that period, they had all the stores and whatever in the black area so that they hired only their families.  So we had--they had to go do domestic work mostly.  The war had started when they put the Japanese in concentration camps.  My dear friend, Natiako Yamaguchi, when they took her away, took her family away, she gave me two beautiful Japanese kimonos that she didn't have use for, ceremonial.  I was showing them to my son the other day.  I don't know if he realizes the history of it, but they, they were moved out, and then black people started buying these Japanese businesses and homes.  That's when we really started coming to our own.  One year I went back home to see, to visit, see what it was like.  And Natiako was there, Natiako Yamaguchi.  They said Susan Cayton's home.  And she, she was very stiff and very formal.  And I said Natiako, and she was "Susan," and she was just bending down and bowing down.  And that was her way of greeting me.  But when we left, instead of that nod of, you know, bending down just to say hello, and I responded to it, she bent down further to let me know that she loved and she remembered, but she didn't want to be bothered with it.  But she remembered.  I knew the bow and I knew the feeling cause I was old enough to know what she had gone through or what the Japanese had gone through.  That's what helped the black people out there, is taking over those businesses cause even as the war came along, they lost some of the work that black people could use out there, to the Philippino.  They came over and took over quite a bit.  I think the most prosperous thing going on out there was the Red Light District and the night club district in Seattle.  They were doing quite well, quite well.  Ask me something else, let's see.
Speaker 1: Were black people a part of that night club scene?
Speaker 2: My uncle owned it.  I had an uncle that owned it.  As a matter of fact he--yes, I have a book of where, that's where all your jazz people would come.  The first Japanese singer, she sang there.  And she married a man named Harold Lewis who had a real estate office here in Chicago.  And Mariko, Mariko Lewis [NOT FOUND].  She came to Chicago and I don't know how they made it, but she was the first Japanese singer on the West Coast.  And I think she had something, little shake dance too.  And, what else?  As a matter of fact, we, we even had our own black cemetery out there, own black cemetery, which I would go out there and--once a year, or twice year, maybe once a year.  I remembered all the families in Seattle that had grave out there, they would meet and sit on the graves, take their lunch, and they'd make their courtesy calls to each family. Mama [grandmother Susie Revels Cayton] would sit--our Dad [grandfather Horace R. Cayton Sr.] would sit there with--I was the only one there at the time.  Mama would make a courtesy call, and then Dad would make a courtesy call, but come back to the grave.  And sometimes they'd bring a little dessert over from another grave.  But this was a very big thing in Seattle during that period.

Speaker 1: What were you like as a little girl?  What did you like to do as you were growing up?
Speaker 2: I belonged to a--the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] had a place over there where they had classes, and it--I think that was all over the city, even in Chicago [Illinois].  But they had something called the Girl Reserves.  And I found out in Chicago, they had the same thing here.  Ida Mae Crest, Dr. Ida Mae Crest [NOT FOUND], she was a Girl Reserve.  I didn't know.  One day we were, I was humming the song.  She said, you were a Girl Reserve?  Yeah, I was a Girl Reserve.  This was the place where it taught--if you didn't get it from your home, you got it at the Y, how to pour tea, how to--Amelia Earhart came to Seattle [Washington].  Our Girl Reserves went out and greeted her.  And this was a big thing with us.  And Sunday, we'd pour tea for our family.  Then I got confused a little bit because then I joined the Young Communist League.  And (laughter) that wasn't such a--it was pretty hard work getting the--crossing.  I finally pushed the Girl Reserves back, and I got into the Young Communist League.
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [grandmother Susie Revels Cayton] get you involved in that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, no, I think Mother came on afterwards.  She was doing an awful lot of reading, but I would go to camps.  And they moved my mind in a direction I was not--it was a cross between Girl Reserves and the Young Communists League and it made it difficult for me at times.  And the school was a beautiful school, grass on it.  And I say grass on it because it was no grass on it when I went out there to see it.  I didn't know what they did with the grass.  But no incentive too much for the black students.  Oh, we had 3 or 4 of them--more than that, but really had more incentive.  I don't know what happened to me in between.  I went as far as one year in a junior college.
Story_ID: 15748
Speaker 1: I think we were so poor, we were having a hard time.  I think that's what it was.  We'd--I can remember when I was in the house cleaning, and Mama [grandmother Susie Revels Cayton] was going down the street with bags, and I said, Daddy [grandfather Horace R. Cayton Sr.], where's Mama going?  And he was embarrassed.  She was going over to pick up some food from a relief office to come home and feed us.  And Madge [Cayton] and Horace [Cayton Jr.], they remembered this.  They weren't there at that time.  I was there, but they said, Senator Hiram [R.] Revels was walking down the street to get food to feed her family.  Understand, that was a shocking thing for the family to digest, that this was, Senator Hiram Revels' daughter going over to get food, stand in line; and walked, walked over there and walked back.  We had the gardens.  Dad always had flowers in the front which he'd plant, which he put there.  We were the only--on our side of the street, there were only 2 black families, three black families.  The other, on the other side was white.  Socially, we didn't have too much going.  All your big bands would come here, Duke Ellington, all of them.  They would come to Seattle [Washington] and play at some dingy hall, which was money being made.  But it was always down in the Red Light area, and it drew people.  I liked Seattle growing up because I didn't know what Depression was.  The history of it was fantastic.  I can remember down in, near--Japanese were near the Red Light area.  There two blocks and Japanese people, men and women and children were in their costumes or in their daily Japanese outfits.  They had a dance around a circle that would go about 2 blocks.  And they would just be doing something and it was beautiful now that I remember it.  And, yes, I, I would go down and watch them.  I didn't have--Lillie [Cayton] was about 5 or 6 years older than me.  So I didn't have too much companionship with her.  So I was really kind of on my own.  I, I'd come home for lunch cause we were too poor to buy it.  And I remember coming home, the third--the steps to the house, I could take one step and a jump to another step, and I'm on the porch.  And they knew, Mama and Dad in separate places would wait for that sound.  I never knew it.  And as soon as I'd open the door, I'd holler for my mother.  And one day, she took me aside and she said, tomorrow when you come home from school, call your Daddy's name out.  It's very important.  And from then on I would call his name.  He was sort of pushed back--he had lost his money.  He had his dignity.  He had nothing, nothing, lousy cook, and he did all the cooking, lousy cook, please believe me (laughter).  Mother wasn't gonna cook.  She would stay in bed all day and all around her bed were books, Japanese books or any books that were coming out for, about black people.  And she would read and she'd cut pictures out, history of the Communist Party or whatever.  As a matter of fact, Dad had written a book that people today are still trying to find the papers of it.  And I could sit on the stool in Mother's room, and Dad would sit on the steps.  And he would read whatever it was that was so important, that the people of today's history would like to find their papers.  He was, he wrote in a very flowery, too much--it would take him several--you know, it was just too flowery.  But it was history.
Speaker 2: Nineteenth century style writing or--
Speaker 1: Yes, it was history.  And I would--my mother would listen.  And then Mama would throw in her Communist ideas about it that were conflicted.  Dad was still Repub--not Republican, Democrat, lib--not liberal, conservative; Mama just the opposite.  They were good reading to each other.
Story_ID: 15749
Speaker 1: Revels [Cayton] was going with a woman, a Jewish girl [Ethel Horowitz] he finally married.  And he would bring her home, no place to take her.  And all the furniture on the first floor would go up to this one room, one room so the girl would look like we, we lived.  And I'd get mad, and I'd go up there and bring the furniture back down; laugh (unclear), and say whatever it was that was needed to make that room look like it was lived in; we were just that poor.  Finally, it was just too much.  They got married.  She came a comfortable family, not wealthy, and I think her father had a clothing factory and lived on Lake Washington.  And they moved to California.  And he was the first one to move out and then Horace--Horace [Cayton Jr.] and his white wife, Bonnie, moved out to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Now, both of your brothers married white women, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hum.
Speaker 2: Is there--
Speaker 1: Horace married his first wife, Bonnie who's still alive.  She's in Olympia, Washington.  I'm talking to her constantly.  Then his second wife was Irma Cayton Wertz.  She's alive and in Detroit [Michigan]; first Captain of--she was a Captain in the WACs [Women's Army Corps], the Army, first--she had an interesting life.
Speaker 2: Now, is she black or--
Speaker 1: She's white--no, she's black, I'm sorry.  And she's from Georgia.  When Horace went to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee], he was teaching down there or something.  He and Richard Wright went down there.  And he, that's where he met Irma.  Her father was a doctor in Georgia.  And she--he sent, they sent her to school to find a husband.  And she found Horace.  They married, they got a divorce, had a hard time for a while, divorced and then married again.  So that was his third, well, that would make her his third wife.  His next wife was a black woman.  She's alive out in Seattle [Washington] somewhere.

Speaker 1: What was the name of grade school?  Where'd you go?
Speaker 2: Garfield High School [Seattle, Washington].  Had a wonderful time when I'm calling for some--
Speaker 1: This is, I'm sorry.  This is the name of high--the grade school?
Speaker 2: High school.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what about the grade school?
Speaker 2: I've forgotten the name of it.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me a little bit about it even if you don't know the name.  What was it like?  You said, there were no black teachers, right?
Speaker 2: None, but the teachers were all right.  They were okay.  They, as I can remember.  I would say like this, after they got through teaching me, my mother [grandmother Susie Revels Cayton] would send me down to a woman named Mrs. Lawless (ph.) for some other edu--some more education.  Apparently, I wasn't getting enough.  And this was a white woman that was an excellent teacher and retired.  The school--nothing black in there at all.  Even on my trips up to Mount Rainier, the chaperons were all white.  We'd go up there and look at the, you know, trees and some would, the white wealthy ones would ski where they'd had some skiing lessons and we were watching them.  Athletes were--a lot of good black athletes that did very well at Garfield High School, some of them ended up teaching, but they had to leave Seattle to go to school to get their occupations together.  In grade school, yeah, grade school and high school, no, high school it was, that's where your Girl Reserves came in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was getting you towards maturity, teaching you so many things.  Of course, everybody tap danced over there.  That was the period that you had to learn how to tap dance any place to make--some would make money tapping on the street.  I enjoyed taking the train--my girlfriend's father would let us go to, from Seattle to Portland, Oregon.  And, overnight we'd stay.  That was a big thing for us.  Nothing ever really exciting was going on other than dances and fraternal organizations, The [Benevolent and Protective Order of] Elks.  I didn't know how large the Elks were until I came to Chicago [Illinois].  I lived in the Rosenwald, and marching down Wabash, they'd all be in uniforms and with something like plumes on and I don't know what they were.  Knights of something.
Speaker 1: [The Order of] Knights of Pythias?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And they had some beautiful uniforms.  I'd look out the Rosenwald window and they'd be in these uniforms marching down Wabash.  Let me tell you a little bit about the Rosenwald Building.
Story_ID: 15751
Speaker 1: I wanted to kind of continue with school until we--
Speaker 2: School, okay.
Speaker 1: Well, when you left, you were at Garfield High School [Seattle, Washington] when you--
Speaker 2: Garfield.
Speaker 1: --left Seattle, right?
Speaker 2: I graduated from there, yes.  But I had a junior college in there.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had a--
Speaker 1: You were a teenager, but you had graduated from high school already?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, I didn't know that.  All right.
Speaker 2: I was at junior college there.  It was very hard with the old folks at home and no money, very hard.  One thing that saved me in high school was that we had navy blue uniforms, skirt, a midi and then a tie or something.  And so everybody, black, poor and rich, wore the same thing.  So the only thing different would have been our shoes.
Speaker 1: So I guess it would be, you could say that when your brothers and sisters left to get educated, you were the last one--
Speaker 2: Last thing there, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and your parents (simultaneous), I guess--
Speaker 2: They were--Horace [Cayton Jr.] and Revels [Cayton]--Horace and Madge [Cayton] were sending money home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it was pretty rough?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was rough, yeah.  They were old, and nothing out there.  He couldn't get a job.
Story_ID: 15752
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduation from high school, I mean what did you, did you see yourself pursuing a certain career or what did you do?
Speaker 2: I think I was thinking like the rest of them.  I didn't know what was gonna happen.  There was nothing there, out there.  And those that had money sent their children elsewhere.  We didn't have it.  We didn't have it.  I believe that's why your--the family conference after the funeral; what to do with Susan?  Money was not a problem to them.  That's why I came to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, so tell me about the Rosenwald Building.  Now, you moved in there.  Now, who lived there that you stayed with?
Speaker 2: Madge [Cayton], my sister [aunt].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That was where the black elite lived in that period.  They couldn't come into Hyde Park.  And it was a, it's a world within itself.  It had its own social worker that would check into the homes to see if you were keeping it clean, Onita Cochroe [NOT FOUND].  I think there's a school named after her.
Speaker 1: Cochroe School, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, she checked out everything.  She was the building social worker, even going into the Sengstacke's house to see if it was clean.  Ralph Metcalfe lived in the building.  He lived on the 4th floor.  The top of the building, of the roof, is like a roof garden.  You could walk it.  I, when my baby was born, and he wouldn't go to sleep, I'd go walk around the four sides of the Rosenwald to put him to sleep.  Well, Metcalfe would hear someone up there, hollering and screaming like something was wrong.  He'd run up there in his pajamas.  He was the watcher of the roof of that section.  He--it was interesting.  Little, Little Ralphie was in our Cub Scouts.  We had our own Cub Scouts there.  And we had the--the building was really very secure.  It had nursery schools, on up to kindergarten.  It had its own play, field house with hired help, people from--a man for the young boys and it had, a woman took care of the girls.  They had a dancer, ballet dancer, a dancer that taught there.  They had many things scheduled there.  And when we had a, Cub Scout night and all the families were down there, Ralphie was acting very silly.  I said, Ralph--I was Den Mother, I said, Ralph, get yourself together and stop that.  And, honey, Mr. Metcalfe came over and you would have thought that I had, that I had beat him up.  Don't you ever discuss that with my--tell me first.  You know, he was just a--but, the, what was the name of the people that, the projects over on the end, on State Street were named?
Speaker 1: Robert Taylor [Homes]?
Speaker 2: Robert Taylor, and Mrs. Taylor would be out planting flowers.  You know, children never could walk on the grass, never, never at any time, even if it was a baby, 18 months.  Onita Cochroe teaches, walk on the sidewalk.  At no time.  As a matter of fact, when Butch, I moved over here, Butch [Harold Woodson Jr.] rolled down this grass here.  It was the first time he could roll and walk on grass.  The Sengstackes lived there at the time.  I could see her [Myrtle Picou Sengstacke] limousine coming up to taken her to (unclear), to the main entrance.  And yet, when we were having--we couldn't go to any place, like--we used to--across the street was a field from Rosenwald.  And we would go, sit on logs and roast hot dogs and, and marshmallows.  And Mrs. Senestack would sit on the log with me while we watched the children--these 8 boys does these, do their thing.  And it was so organized that the young children, say up to 3 years old would stay in one spot and they were not leave there.  And they were well watched.  And the older boys would go down by the flagpole, but if they were noisy, they'd have to go over to the field house.  In the evening, you didn't come out in the clothes that you wore during the daytime.  You cleaned up and you either sat on the benches or you sat at the flagpole.  This was, it was a good way of teaching children how to respect your buildings and where you lived.  And other mothers would let--if you were doing something wrong, another mother would say, don't do that.  And the voices were never loud, and you sat on--they sat on the benches--
Speaker 1: Now, this is in the year, this is in 193--
Speaker 2: '38 [1938].  I was at the, I was there in the '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were at--you came out of high school in thirty--what was it, thirty--
Speaker 2: '39 [1939].  Yeah, and then I came here, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So you got here in the early '40s.  So, yeah, that is much different from the way the Rosenwald Building is now.  I mean--
Speaker 2: Gosh, there's no--yeah, it's closed now.  But they have--before I went in there, I was bringing something down from the South Side Community Art Center.  We were having rummage sale.  And I knew that would be a good place to put it in the hall.  So I went in the main entrance.  There was no grass, but I couldn't make myself walk across the grass--the dirt.  I walked on the sidewalk and went into all these entrances and posting.  And when you'd go into each one, you could just smell urine, where children had urinated in the, in the halls.  It was just a complete different, a new world.  There were a couple of people that couldn't afford to move out, and they were frightened to come out and sit on the benches.
Speaker 1: They were people who had been there a long time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, too old to move.  I think that the Sengstackes moved, well, the Schro--Dr. Schropter (ph.) George Schropter, they moved to, bought a building here.  Earl [B.] Dickerson, another one that moved to, a half a block from here on Hyde Park Boulevard.  They didn't go far--oh, and some were--would call it-- on the strip here, the Drexel Square.  But that was it.  I'm sure there were others in here, but you didn't get to see them.  They might have been light complexioned.
Story_ID: 15753
Speaker 1: My husband [Harold Woodson], when he was, he was in college, and he still couldn't come across.  He would--Cottage Grove [Chicago, Illinois] was the cross off.  You just didn't pass that.  He came over to do some work for a Jewish doctor.  He, and he crossed the street there and came into Drexel Square and was walking down towards 47th Street.  The police stopped him.  Someone had called quick, that quick, stopped him.  And the woman had to come out and say, he's all right.  He's coming here to do some, some work for me.
Speaker 2: So you're saying in those days, black folks couldn't come across Cottage Grove into Hyde Park without having a--?
Speaker 1: Having a problem.  And someone told me that, I don't know why they won't let us in here.  But some of the white people were walking around the streets in just their bathing suits.  So that, I don't know what was going on at that period.  Washington Park was still alive with the Communists and the talkers that were talking about everything and against everything.  It was an interesting period during that time.  You know, going down, walking down 47th Street to go down to eat dinner, you never just went in slacks or interesting slacks.  You dressed if you'd go down there.
Speaker 2: So not even interesting slacks (laughter)?
Speaker 1: No.  You wore a black dress, and you'd walk down to have dinner.  When you got to the Palm Tavern, white linen table cloths and each celebrity--Horace [Cayton, Jr.] had his own both.  The Jones brothers [Edward, George, and McKissack Jones] had their booth.
Speaker 2: Now, the Jones brothers were famous for--
Speaker 1: Policy.
Speaker 2: Policy, yeah, and numbers games, you know, right.
Speaker 1: I used to--
Speaker 2: So they were kind of underworld.
Speaker 1: That's--they made their money like that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but they were--
Speaker 1: But I used to go down, when I was first here, Horace and George Jones would go down to the Y [YMCA, Young Men's Christian Association] at 38th and Wabash and play badminton.  And then they'd have someone drive me home, and they'd go over to the Vincennes Hotel at something, it's on--that's not the name of it.  It's on 39th Street and they had baths and rubdowns.  It's still there, on 39th Street and King Drive.
Speaker 2: I know what you're talking about.  It's a hotel--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a hotel, and it's on this side, the North--the East side of the Street.  They'd go there for rubdowns and hot baths.
Speaker 2: The Ritz Hotel, is that it?
Speaker 1: Ritz.  Yeah.  It was a, it was the beginning of protesting.  I know there was a dime store at 43rd around Prairie that would not hire blacks.  And so we decided to protest.  I'm sure the [Communist] Party was part of it.  And we were marching with posters, you know, Blacks Not Allowed; Don't Shop There, you can't work there; don't shop where you can't work.  And the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] was there, and they said, what's your name?  And I gave it to him, didn't care.
Speaker 2: Now, were you still a part of the Young Communists League or any of that at that point?
Speaker 1: No, I was through with that.  But I ran into all of them here, like St. Clair Drake.  You know, the camp--no, the [Alpha Phi] Alphas had their Alpha House on King Drive.  And Harry Jones used to cook and have--you could have lunch up there.  And who was that?  Oh, they decided to have a party up there.  And St. Clair Drake and his wife were at the door collecting tickets.  And it just, it was a busy time.  And so I saw all the older ones, but I wasn't interested in the Young Communist League because this was a brand new world, and I had this world to check out.  I didn't care about politics.
Story_ID: 15754
Speaker 1: You rode across country with Paul Robeson?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what was Paul Robeson like?  You had a chance to spend some time with him.  You know, what was Paul Robeson like?
Speaker 2: He was unimportant to me.  See, really.  I, he was quite unimportant.  All of these heavy names that I came across were very unimportant because they just became a part of the family.  Even when young Paul Robeson came to Chicago [Illinois], Paul was, Paul must have been sick.  But Revels [Cayton] was here, and they were here for something about the [Communist] Party --I don't know what it is, but I lived in the basement of the Rosenwald.  And young Paul came down.  And they were getting something organized, but it meant nothing to me at all.  I didn't have the intellect that these when--well, he, they hadn't arrived.  That was, Paul was singing, but he wasn't as famous as he is now.
Speaker 1: And so you didn't really pay attention to what he was like so much (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, and he--
Speaker 1: He didn't make an impression on you at all or--
Speaker 2: No, just protection.
Speaker 1: Okay, he was being (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: No, I understood why he was there.  Madge [Cayton] said, you have to have protection.  You have to have someone with you, an adult with you, other than Gene Jones [sic, Coleman].  And that was all.  And in talking, it was at my level, not at the level that he would talk to Revels and the rest of them.  He'd talked and introduced to me Chicago, at my level and tell me, you've got big surprises, big surprises.
Story_ID: 15755
Speaker 1: Yeah 47th Street [Chicago, Illinois] was a very busy street.  I know during that period, when I first got there and got fairly organized, Madge [Cayton] says, it's time for you to get a job.  And so I was afraid to go by myself.  So she took me by--walked me down 47th Street.  We'd get to a business, go in there and see if they need help.  (Chuckle) I'd go in.  Would you like to hire me?  I was, just--I had not matured sufficiently.  I did not get these jobs at all.  I did work at, as a waitress at some--35th and King Drive.  I'd--then I got a job at Supreme Liberty Life [Insurance].  And I worked there until--some man was carving names out, and my name was Susan Cayton, and I put that--you know, Old Man Gibson [Truman K. Gibson] was in charge then.  And [Earl B.] Dickerson was in there, and all the heavy names at that period.
Speaker 2: Lloyd Wheeler.
Speaker 1: All of them were in there.  And all the offices in the front, and I put my little wooden name plate in there, and Gibson saw it and fired me immediately.  He would--Cayton, don't want a Cayton in here.  The reason why, Parkway Community Center was the, the brainchild of--what's that church?  Where was it?  57th and Prairie, Good Shepherd [Church].  Good Shep--that was the brainchild.  That was their church, and that was their community center.  And it opened up and they hired Horace [Cayton, Jr.].  But the center outgrew the church, and then finally there was breaking--there's a history there which I had not--I've forgotten.  But they finally broke off.  They also broke a lot of relationships.  So that the Gibsons were not speaking to the Caytons and when my name went up, I lost my job.
Speaker 2: Gee, that's--
Speaker 1: Earl Dickerson got--found out about it.  He was there.  He ran down and Horace--he was on Horace's board at Parkway, which was over there at 51st and King Drive, and explained what was happening.  But Horace didn't bother to explain to me.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the new one is 500 East 67th Street there--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: But it was originally at 51st--
Speaker 1: 51st and--the building's still there.
Speaker 2: Parkway Community House.
Speaker 1: The building's still there.  It's a Baptist institute now.  And the old build--the old one, the new one has a playhouse.  The Playhouse started there.  It was--it opened up with Langston Hughes, "Sun Do Move".  And the programs are at the Woodson Library.  Langston, he wrote the play and he got in production.  One of Horace's wives, Irma [Cayton Wertz], was one of the actors in the play.  I remember the opening night.  We had all of the white judges and everybody, and Marshall Field, all of them there to the opening night.  These were people that gave money to Parkway Community Center.  But these were people, interesting enough, that kept Horace in his place.  When he needed money for the payroll, Horace would go to Marshall Field who lived way out.  And he'd drive out there, and Field knew he was coming.  And he'd make Horace sit in a waiting room until he felt like coming to him.  So Horace's dignity and all--he had to drop his dignity feeling like I am Horace Cayton cause he was in the white area.  And he would wait, and finally he'd come out and give him a check for the payroll at the art center--at the, you know, the Parkway.  But, yeah, when he would come, they would come to the South Side, everything was--the women and the girls, it was fantastic, whenever it might be.  But it was a different story.  Horace was king over here.  Horace said he felt like taking his hat and holding, you know, and saying, give me some money, please.
Speaker 2: Okay, where did you find work finally?  Where did you finally find a job?
Speaker 1: At a counter at 35th and King Drive, across the street from Supreme Liberty Life, like a drugstore.  It was a drugstore, you know, fountain, and fountain in there.  And that's what I did.  And then I worked at Parkway Community Center.  And then I still--I wasn't married, and I started working for the Employment Service.  It was federal at that time.  And then at the end of the war, it came back to the state, state of Illinois.  It was Federal Employment Service.  I worked there, I don't know how long, and State.  And then I went to the welfare and worked there, Chicago Welfare.  It was 19 something Madison.  And I got married at that period and that period, from then on, I never worked again.

Speaker 1: How did you meet your husband [Harold Woodson]?  And tell us a little bit about him.
Speaker 2: So he told me, (chuckle) how I first met him, Dr. [Margaret] Burroughs had a coach house out in the '60s behind a big mansion, black people owned.  And the coach house, she and Rosalie Davis, Charles Davis' wife, she and Margaret had this coach house.  And they wanted to get rid of them.  They were making too much noise, parties and what.  I mean they partied, and we partied.
Speaker 1: Margaret Burroughs, Dr. Burroughs.
Speaker 2: Oh, God, she was a partier.
Speaker 1: Now, that's something new, now that people don't, probably don't realize, but--
Speaker 2: Some of the old folks know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, I'm certain there'll be some newer people watching this later on.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I could not tell what happened then.  But anyhow, they wanted to rid of Charles and Rosalie and they cut the heat off.  So when you'd go back there to party, you had to keep your coat on.  You'd wrap yourself in blankets, but they still partied.  I went with a young fellow, used to be the love of my life, Tom Coleman, who was related to Charles S. Jackson, and he worked as a embalmer.  And--
Speaker 1: This is the Jackson Funeral Home?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that--it was next door to where Margaret Burroughs is now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a funeral home.
Speaker 1: That's 38th and Michigan or around--
Speaker 2: Yes, about, the next door to her.  It was a funeral home.
Speaker 1: Is this the same family that has the Jackson Funeral Home on Cottage Grove now?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: They're different, okay.
Speaker 2: This is the, the wealthy established one.  This man had horses.  He was very wealthy.
Speaker 1: He had a hearse drawn by horses?
Speaker 2: No, he owned a stable of horses, a stable of horses.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Tom was his nephew, I think, because whenever Tom's mother would come to the city, she would stay at Charles S. Jackson's home, which was on Michigan next--oh, I've forgotten about where it is.  I know it when I pass it.  But one night some Governor, Governor Green, no, not Governor.  What was he?  Attorney Green or heavy name, I forgot what his name is.  His wife is just, still alive, but he died, and Tom was supposed to pick up the body.  And we were going out to Margaret's.  We had this date.  So he picked me up in the hearse and we went and picked up this man, this Green--what was he?  I don't know what he was.  We picked him up, big name, and we stashed the hearse around some place so no one would see him, and we went to Margaret and Rosalie's house and had a ball.
Speaker 1: So you went to the party and you left the body in the hearse?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, and stashed some where, where they wouldn't see the hearse.  And then went over there and just had a wonderful time, poor folks party, where you bring the food; you bring the liquor, but--here's the space here, and it was nice.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you were telling me how you met--
Speaker 2: I met Harold [Woodson] there.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's where you met him, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they--yeah, I met him there.  He and Margaret were, I think had something going there.  And I had to be home at a certain time.  Madge [Cayton] put really time limits on me.  And I went up and I said, Margaret I've got to get home.  And, and she said to Harold, you'd better take her home.  He says, no.  They were growing uncomfortable.  And he said, no, I'm not taking her home.  And Margaret made him take me home.  And he lived in Rosenwald, and so I didn't speak to him, but he said he always saw me peeping out the door or something and decided he wanted to go with me.  And Horace [Cayton Jr.] had interviewed him for a job, but never hired him.  But he, Horace had other things in his mind.  And when he found out I had met him, he made a state--we went together, he pushed us together all the time.  He did that by having these very famous parties at his home, which was Parkway [Community House].  And he always invited us both even when he didn't want to be bothered.  I know when Richard Wright was here with Ellen [Wright] and their first baby, they wanted to go out and party.  So Horace invited me down, and, of course, Harold came with me.  And we had to sit and babysit this baby while they went out and had a ball.  Horace, he used Madge and Howard--Madge and I a lot.  We lived in the Rosenwald and he lived down there.  So when he wanted to entertain his friends, he'd bring them down to the house.  And Madge would have to cook, and we--I got to know most of the people that he knew.  He brought everyone down but Marshall Field to have, have Madge cook dinner.
Story_ID: 15757
Speaker 1: Well who were some of those people and do you remember anything and any anecdotes about some of them?
Speaker 2: I remember one story.  There was a--mostly, there were white people on the board cause you had to have money.  This old woman had an electric car.  And, you know, how the street divided there on 51st, you can go straight down King Drive or you can go into the park.  And you can see.  She brought her electric car down there and parked on the other--not on King Drive, but in the park and then walked across.  And Horace [Cayton Jr.] saw that electric car, and he had half the people in the building standing around that car to make sure it wasn't lifted (laughter) as she came to the board meeting.  Yeah, he had some interesting people around.  Some of the men that were there were interested in meeting black women.  Nothing ever went on, but this was their way of socially meeting these women.  Katherine Kuh, one of my pictures on the wall is from Katherine Kuh to Horace.  And she was one of the party--always attended the party.  As a matter of fact, at Mother's [grandmother Susie Revels Cayton] funeral we came, the family came back and Katherine Kuh came back with us.  And we were reading things about, whatever Mother had written, around the table.  And Revels [Cayton] wouldn't read it.  And Horace [Cayton Jr.] had expensive gifts to give every member of the family.  He gave Revels a leather something, to carry things in, business.  And he gave it to Revels, and Revels wouldn't have it.  He had her to take it.  And he wouldn't read anything that Mother had written so Katherine Kuh, who was lame in one leg, but she's very important at the Art Institute [of Chicago, Illinois].  Do you know of her?
Speaker 1: I've heard her name before.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she read, but the family broke up at that point, after we had the dinner at Horace's at the Parkway [Community House].
Speaker 1: Well, I mean what do you mean, what, it broke up?
Speaker 2: Horace went one way and Revels went the other way and never went back to Seattle [Washington].  And I went to the Rosenwald and my life started there as a single person.
Speaker 1: Okay, so things were--so Revels and Horace--
Speaker 2: Had very little contact, very little contact.  Revels was married to a Jewish woman [Ethel Horowitz] and Horace would come to New York and he'd go over there drunk.  And Revels would bring him in for a while and finally, Horace told me this, he said, I needed help so badly and I couldn't stop drinking that he called Revels.  And he said, please, let me come in, I want to talk.  And Revels put a bottle of whiskey at the door and never, and never answered the door when he rang.  And Horace told me that, you drink yourself to death.  That's what was symbolized.
Speaker 1: So there were some serious issues then?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was very serious, very serious.  And I never really understood them all.  I know each one, individually, that said--Revels says he was getting--he had cancer and I didn't realize it.  He says, why doesn't my brother like me?  And what did I do, and what did he do?  And Revels and Horace would ask the same thing, but never could they get together and bring it to understand what was happening.  Both were psychoanalyzed, both of them.  And nothing--they never came together at all.
Story_ID: 15758
Speaker 1: Horace [Cayton Jr.] liked the thought of the union, a professional person.  He needed a job though, but he was professional, and went along with the marriage.  And I got pregnant immediately, and I didn't have to work.  I stayed home and took care of my youngster [Harold Woodson Jr.].  I had a lot of little things I did, like I sewed clothes in my home and the women in the Rosenwald would come down and buy them.  And that helped to give me spending money and what not, but never any hard work after that.  We lived a, we've had a happy life.  He [Harold Woodson] had problems and I had problems, but we worked it out and we still had a good marriage.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, what did he end up doing?  What was it he did?
Speaker 1: Harold was a biochemist.  He worked, got his Master's and he worked, completely worked, all, everything on doctor--for his Doctor's, and had got up ready, he had his languages, had all this all set.  And the head of the department switched over to another man, and Dr. Walker retired.  They had--Harold, they were good friends.  The new man said, took Harold aside.  He was getting to be interviewed by, you know, you have to talk between these people.
Speaker 2: His committee.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he said to Harold, he said, I'll never let a nigger be my first PhD.  You come back next year, and I'll give you your PhD.  And the baby was born then.  And Harold said, I can't do it.  I have a new baby.  I just can't do it.  U.S. Public Health had given him money to go to school.  And they, they heard about it.  And they said, we'll give you money to go to school.  He said, I got to take care of a family now.  I can't go back.  And so from then on, that was sort of a downfall a bit for Harold.  He'd worked very hard for that.  He even earned extra money tutoring all of your, many of your young doctors, like Dr. Tanner and Harvey--not Harvey Whitfield, but in that age group.  He tutored them so that they could be dentists.  He interpreted, he--foreign books, French and something else.  He would rewrite, what do you call it, interpret--not, what do you call it, translate, thank you, darling.  He'd translate that, the medical books into English.  And that was extra money for him.  He had a clinical laboratory on 63rd and King Drive.  And when the doctors found out that they could do a lot of, some of those tests at, in their own offices, business kind of dropped.  And so he just sat down and read and--I even brought my church here.  My church had, we had church here on Sundays to bring him, to make him part of it.  You know something interesting, as much education as he had, we had all kinds of dreams for Harold, Jr., all kinds of dreams.  But at that time, jobs were coming along where they could make money.  And Harold, in the school system, in the college system, you can't make much money.  And Butch said one day, I can make money, more money than you can driving a bus.  And it was true.  It was true.  Now, I think he acknowledges that he should have had the training.  He should have done--because he's pushing his own son to what he hasn't, didn't get.  He's pushing his son, own son to make up for it.  In his own way, he's done very well as a young man, pulled himself together, running a home and taking care of this--soon all of this will belong to him.  And he knows what to do with it.
Story_ID: 15759
Speaker 1: I know you met a lot of artists and a lot of activists along the way, now, but you--how did the idea for gallery come up?
Speaker 2: Sitting home with your husband [Harold Woodson] wondering, now, what can I talk about now.  And, and Harold would read and tell, want to discuss his books.  I didn't want to talk about the books.  I enjoyed art.  I enjoyed it, and I joined the [South Side] Art Center.  Vern Gayeton [NOT FOUND] brought me on the board there.  And one day there was a woman from Oak Park came into the art center and said that, I have a lot of black art that I'd like to sell.  And at the art center, we don't do it like that.  We have shows.  And she couldn't--and she'd gone to several of the art--Nicole's, several people, and they said, no, we can't do it.  So I, I heard about it, and I had the director to drive me out there.  And there was all this wonderful black art, Charles (unclear) Sebree.  I had some of it on my walls, beautiful art.  I said, I'll sell it in my home.  I said, just bring it all to me.  And Mrs. Woodson had passed so I, I opened that bedroom into a gallery.  It's so interesting, you know, the artists did support me.  I had two comfortable chairs in the middle of the room and a coffee table for people to come in and just sit down and relax.  And Sylvester Britton, who was my main artist, came in.  He says, take these things out of here.  You don't have to make it comfortable.  You're selling art.  You're not--this isn't a living room.  Take it out.  Sell the art and get the, put the best art forward.  And that was the beginning of it.  And Walter Evans from Detroit [Michigan] has several books out on his collections.  He came here one day, and somebody told me about him, and he was checking it out.  And I don't know how the conversation came up, but I said, well, where are you gonna take your art?  He said, I'm thinking about putting it back here.  And I had the best, top art in my small gallery.  And people bought and--but I didn't have heavy names to come in.  The little names were buying these, this work, putting it in will-call.  He stayed with me and kept bringing more work in until he wanted, he decided he wanted to buy that picture, this Charles White.  He stayed with me long enough for me to be able to say, no, I'll never sell it.  So art, I don't know if he'll come back or not, but he's well wanted.  His art collection, I'd love to sell it.
Speaker 1: That's on Evans and--
Speaker 2: Walter Evans.
Speaker 1: Walter Evans, okay.
Speaker 2: He's now down in Atlanta [Georgia].
Story_ID: 15760
Speaker 1: Tell us about some of the artists and what they, you know, Charles Sebree is no longer with us, right.
Speaker 2: He's no longer with us, but, you know, I used to see him when I was living in the Rosenwald walking down the garden in mid-winter in white tennis shoes.  He was living with his mother.  I didn't know him very well.  He was getting his start there.  Cortor, Eldzier Cortor, I knew him well.  But he lived in that coach house behind the [South Side] Art Center, that, yeah--
Speaker 1: Right,--
Speaker 2: --a small room, two, two bedrooms I think; raised two children.  And then finally, I don't know what--how they broke up, but he went on to New York and married and she, Mrs.--his wife married.  It's very funny, he, Cortor never came back to Chicago [Illinois], never came back.  His son was doing something, protesting something and was killed.  And so, of course, his mother sent a wire for him that our son is dead and this, that and the other.  He never, he never returned the wire and never did attend.  And several months later, a beautiful painting arrived from New York.  Everything he thought about, about his son, just--his son was in it.  We saw the message.  He was hurting and this was his way of saying, I was with you, but I couldn't come.  And she still has this painting.  He, he's still alive.  Had several replacements.  His wife was going to New York with her husband.  She didn't have his address and so she called and she says, how can I get a hold of Cortor?  And they went to New York, called and the wife--I don't know, didn't let them come in, didn't accept.  Nobody's been able to get in to see him.  And later he called the hotel where they were staying.  They talked for an hour or two hours about their children, and the woman wasn't insulted that they couldn't come to the house, but it was a--they had a family reunion by telephone, grandchildren and what not.  He is still a heavy seller.  His work sells high.  I would say that's between $70,000 and $80,000.  He did very few pieces in color, mostly black and white.  The piece that she received was in color.  I have, I have contact with him.  I sent him a, anything I'm having in gallery, I sent--I was trying to get a piece of his work in there, just prints, cause those prints sell twelve, thirteen, $14,000, good ones.  I never came out and said, may I sell your prints?  And in one of his notes to me, he said, well, I didn't think--what kind of work are you selling in your gallery?  So I started sending him my programs, and he knew I had heavy art in there.  I sent him a note when my husband [Harold Woodson] died.  And he sent me back a beautiful note, and said, my first grown-up pair of shoes was bought at the Woodson Shoe Store.  And so, it--he remembered, yeah.
Story_ID: 15761
Speaker 1: So the Woodson--the shoe store was your husband's [Harold Woodson]--
Speaker 2: Husband's father's store, yeah.
Speaker 1: It was next to the, you said, the Bingham Bank [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: It started out in that same block of the Bingham Bank, same block.  And once a year, we would have an outdoor something, a tea party, a tea or whatever that was.  And they would invite all the black businesses.  And Mrs.--Mr. and Mrs. Woodson would always go.  They dressed in--as a matter of fact, I have the shawl, which has got to be over a hundred years old and some of the dresses that she would wear to these tea parties.  Then they moved to 47thsStreet, near Vincennes.  And that was the first black shoe store on that street.  That was acknowledged by the white people.  They sent out listings of first of everything in Bronzeville, and the shoe store was among them.  So interesting, the stories that they used to tell me, that I've heard too from--you'd see this mother and dad sitting down fitting shoes on and all of these books all the way around--not books, I'm sorry, boxes all the way, supposedly full of shoes.  They were nothing but blanks.  They didn't have (laughter) enough money to stock the store cause I showed her--she said nothing but blanks.  But we had the right sizes.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  That's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, nothing but blanks.
Speaker 1: It's, impression is everything.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Yes, she stayed on 47th Street, even after Mr. Woodson died.  Mr. Woodson had a, had a storage place for cars.  They were all, always in business, good hustlers.  The family of Mr. Woodson was so interesting.  Two children, brother and sister--two brothers were born in Texas.  And Mr. Woodson was young and so was Mr. Wood--Mrs. Woodson.  And there was a lynching going on in the city.  And all those were downtown, they forced them to stay.  And Mr. Woodson, they put Mr. Woodson along with others, in the front line, for them to watch them burn this man up.  And as soon as they let him go, he went back.  He called her Honey.  Honey, you stay here until I, I get--I'll send you money to bring you up to Chicago.  I'm going.  He left and he never went back.  Now, Mrs. Woodson did go back for several funerals, but he never went back and had a hard time discussing it and telling what he went through seeing this live man burned up.  It was time to run and get out of the South.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess that is something to see the leading citizens of your community (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And had to stay there.  He had to stay there.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess you couldn't go back to a town like that.
Speaker 2: Un-un.  But they started this--I know I went to a shoe store Chernin's [Shoes], the discount place.  And was getting some shoes, and a white man, you know, I--color means nothing, but I have to tell it like that, was walking past.  And I had told the story to the clerk that my father-in-law had the first black shoe store.  And he came over to me, and he said, and I was the first man to--white man to work there.  He said, I worked there for years, and for years.  He says, I learned my trade at that shoe store.  And he was over there at Chernin's.  The people would call him for shoes and he--that was his job.  But he was old then, but it was so nice to see a piece of history walking by and remembering.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you never know where people get their starts.
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 15762
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about some of the other artists.  You have Charles White's work on the wall here.  He's no longer with us either.
Speaker 2: No, but when I went out to Pasadena [California] to bring a young lady, Brunetta Bernstein--let me just say a little bit about Brunetta Bernstein.  She was Brunetta Barnett.  She was a school teacher in Chicago [Illinois], but she always wanted to be in the theater, always wanted.  So she went to New York, was living and met a man that, a play director, Sidney Bernstein.  You know, what's the name of--Lorraine Hansberry, the view from Sidney--
Speaker 1: The Sign in Sidney--
Speaker 2: The View.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the--
Speaker 2: --through Sidney, Sidney Something's Window.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is The Sign In the Window, I think, yeah, by Sidney--'The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window'.
Speaker 2: This is Sidney Bernstein's widow that knew Horace [Cayton Jr.].  As a matter of fact, when Horace was drunk, left these pictures, Charles White, the [Charles] Sebree and the family clock with Brunetta.  And when Brunetta--when Horace closed his eyes, she says, I'm bringing, I'm coming to Chicago with things that belong to you.  She is in Sacramento, wasn't it--Pasadena.  And I went down there to sort of help her close out and to come to Chicago to live cause she's about 95 now.  I had all these things packed and I didn't know how to get--she didn't tell me how to do it and I didn't know how to do it.  And I called young Charles White.  He has a different name.  I have it in my file.  He's an artist.  He was adopted.  And he, he came down and made the arrangements for the pictures to be sent to Chicago.  They were Charles White--some pictures of, done by Charles White, 'The Blacks.'  That's a play.  And Sidney Bernstein, he produced it and Brunetta was--
Speaker 1: That's a play by Jean Genet, yeah, (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Sid--and Brunetta was in it, and it traveled all over Europe.  And she also was very close to Horace.  As a matter of fact, I think she was in love with Horace, but she keeps telling me, we were just friends, but she loves me because I'm Horace to her.  And, you know, she said, because you remind me of Horace, you know, like that.  Horace must have been quite a guy in his day, but there was a warm, warm friendship and some of the others.  Young White, Charles White did help me get these things here.  I'm trying to think, some of our local artists.  I'm trying to think of heavy names.  Okay, most of the young artists they're good, most of them that I, come into my gallery have had training.  If they haven't training, get some kind of training.  I, they can't come up to what I have been selling the, this WPA [Works Progress Administration] work.  Their work can't come up to that.  They, you just don't put them together.  So, now, I'm sort of having to change my mind since I don't have too many WPA pieces coming in.  So I'm taking the best of what is around here.  Gregg Spears has helped me to hang my show.  He's very good.  He has finished, has gone to school, businessman, and now he's been able to go to the [South Side Community] Art Center and rebuild it, bringing it back down to the early stages to bring it up into the new world of, of the art world.  I don't know many of the big, the large, other name artists around, too many of the stories.  I know that, oh, Irene Clark was one--.
Story_ID: 15763
Speaker 1: How did I get some of this WPA [Works Progress Administration] work?  William McBride, he was on WPA.  He was a person that wasn't the great artist--I can show you some of his work, but he was a collector's collector.  He could collect a--it's face down, down here.  And he would, all of the early work, and what he would do, he would wrap them and in storage.  He would, as he was very sick and his wife--his sister took over, I was called down to where he was working.  And it was a storage house as long as this house, full of boxes, all the same size, where he--and packed on each other.  You opened the door to his loft, his portion of the building, and you'd just walk into boxes.  They were packed right to the door.  He had his own way of getting in and he wouldn't sleep.  He just slept in a chair.  And so I--when I went down there, I never saw such fine art in all my life.  She would, she was taking out of boxes--she knew nothing about art.  She brought out the, The Red House.  It was over there.  History of the Red House, by John--George Neal.  George Neal's over there.  George Neal was an early, early artist of, equivalent, his work equivalent to Charles White.  It might even have been better.  I don't know.  But it was equivalent to that.  The Red House, when Eleanor Roosevelt came to Chicago [Illinois] to open up the South [Side] Community Art Center, a woman of that background, she has people behind her.  And they would tell her.  They would do the--check out to see what's what.  And so they told her, ask for The Red House by George Neal.  And she asked for it.  It was, it was just one of the things that--and she looked at it and gave it back.  George--he had this George Neal painting.  I just sold it the other day.  A hard, a hard picture to--you have to be a collector to buy something like that.  McBride had everybody's art in the country almost, but mostly the Chicago artists.  He had the history of the South Side Community Art Center.  He and Irene Clark had no place to sleep.  So they slept in the basement of the South Side Community Art Center.  And the art center, they weren't much on history.  After--minutes and everything was stored in the basement.  He collected all that.  He collected the letters that were sent to Mrs. Roosevelt and the answers from Mrs. Roosevelt that she would come.  All this was in storage, in his storage.  I walked down the--I went in that room, and it was just fantastic of what you had to see.  And even the packing of the glassware, the china that he had was, the packings, other artists wanted it.  It was different from what they used.  They knew it would last for years.  It was finally moved to the, a storage place at 39th and Michigan.  And it took the whole top level, a whole top level of boxes that--I, I worked on opening these boxes for over a year.  The collection of books that in one of the collections--I have the, everything he ever owned, I have it--it was insured, some way, some jeweler did it, but I know what he had.  One book, what this woman did, she had boxes.  And she'd fill them full of books, first editions and what not.  One book was, book cover, was a play written by Richard Wright.  It's in, in this collection, a book by Richard Wright.  She put them in these boxes and sold the boxes for $35.00.  So these men getting books, got a collector's item.  The early art is just, some of it he would steal.  For instance, at the Parkway Community House, Horace [Cayton Jr.] had some WPAs and we'd put them out to be picked up cause it was really against the law.  That really belonged to the government.  It did not belong to the artists.  But McBride would steal he could get.  What he'd--you'd put some junk out, he'd go get it.  So that's how he really started his collection.

Speaker 1: This, a small black, little black boy.  There were four them.  One of them I have.  The art--South Side [Community Art Center, Chicago, Illinois] has one of the Bartés and two collectors have them.  Mine I have, and it's beautiful, a beautiful little boy, but the signature did not have the Barté and the little dash over the name.  A big gallery owner, Michael Rosenthal, from New York.  He comes here maybe once or every other year to see what I have.  He picked up this, he says, this is not a Barté.  I said, why isn't it?  He said, it doesn't have this line over it.  So I checked out with some of the artists who were still alive then, and they said, we remember when he made them.  That's how the art center got ours.  That one down here.  Well, he, he did it the way he wanted to.  You have a real Barté.  I had it in gallery for a long time, and no one would buy it.  I think it was $5,000, and no one would buy it.  Brought it down and no one, and so I, I now own it.  What Mary did was she had some man that owned a pizza place, company, a young white man, came in and some of the pieces, he got them and sold them.  And Mary would get nickels and dimes.  The whole, the whole collection just was gone for nothing.  And it was the history.  Even just the posters.  I have posters of all the jazz artists that would be at the Regal [Theater, Chicago, Illinois].  Ramsey Lewis just--I'm using that name, I'm using Ramsey Lewis.  Who was it? I don't know, but--
Speaker 2: A piano player?
Speaker 1: I can't--19--but it was when 47th street was alive, but these packets would go all up and down the street.  I had them in perfect condition.  And they would sell for $500 and $600.  Some would pay $1,000 for it, to have them.  That helped to show the history of the 47th street because we would buy--the art center would have their book out and you had to buy ads.  They'd go ask all the merchants.  So we learned who was on 47th street at that period.  The cover would--might be by Alexander or it could be by [Charles] Sebree.  Nowadays those books sell for thousands of dollars, with the programs in it.  That was what [William] McBride had in his collection, stacks of them, just stacks of them.
Story_ID: 15765
Speaker 1: Tell us about William McBride (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: One of the stories that William told me, and I saw the desk too, he was walking downtown.  And it was during that period when we, we don't just walk all the way downtown cause we couldn't even go to [Marshall] Field's and try clothes on.  We could buy it and say, I want that hat, but you can't put it on.  You took it out of the store.  He passed--he was on Michigan, and he saw a desk in the window.  And he went in there.  He told the man, I want that desk.  And the man just looked at him cause he  probably looked like--even when he, at his best, he looked horrible.  But the man took the money down.  And each week, he'd come in and pay on the desk.  And the man, when he saw he was sincere and was gonna buy it, he did put it aside.  I don't know how long it took him to buy this $5,000 desk, but he bought it on will-call.  And I saw the desk.  And he brought it home and he wrapped it up, never used it.  Everything he bought, he wrapped it up and just put it aside.  I--
Speaker 1: He had an apartment full of wrapped up things?
Speaker 2: Yes, in boxes and--yes, the full length of this apartment.  Believe me, it was the full length.  It was well over a million dollars worth of art.  Well, over--I remember looking at television one day and turned on the news, and there was William McBride with everything out on the street, been put out, couldn't pay the rent.  Everything out on the street.  And then I saw other people coming, and I called Herb Nipson.  His, he was gone, his wife, she said, he's down there trying to protect William McBride's stuff.  So all the artists rallied around, and they got their money together--they got money from everywhere and cars and put William McBride back into a place where he could keep his art collection (laughter).  They were all night long carrying these boxes and pieces of art.  They were treasuring them like it was the National Treasure.  They knew his collection, all the artists, big and little, just down there protecting and snow was on the ground--
Speaker 1: About when was this?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Can you give me a decade?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Herb Nipson was president of the board, let me see, so '50 [1950] around '50, in that, '50, '55 [1955] something like that, yeah, yeah.  What else about him, about his collection?  I sold the, most of the material, not the art, his papers, which were fabulous, to the [Carter G.] Woodson [Regional] Library, Vivian [G.] Harsh collection, and from that, they have the history of 55th Street and 63rd Street and 47th Street.  His papers were just--he would, I remember he had his show over on 53rd.  There was a gallery over there.  And he'd put the WPA [Works Progress Administration] show up in this--it's a gallery, plus he makes prints.  So he put up--well, I stood in line a half an hour before I could just get in to see the show.  The show, the people were just lined up like it was a bread line, in high heels, waiting on a Sunday to get in.  When the show was over, William had made the mistake of borrowing some money from this owner over there.  I think he owed about $20,000, something like that.  He said, I'll pay you back.  He never paid him back, and the man has all the, most of his McBride--of his WPA collection.  He did the same thing, around the corner here was a man that loaned money out.  And he said, you've got to give me something for collateral.  He gave him a [Henry O.] Tanner, $35,000.  He never paid him back, and he has a Tanner in his collection.  And how I knew this, I had the receipts.  And I put, I gave it to the art center, not the art center, to the Harsh collection, the receipts.  He was always being put out, never had any money.  But the receipts told the history of this man, this great collector.  He could have sold any of that art to go back into where he was supposed--any place he wanted, he had art he could sell to go back in.  He didn't believe in selling it.
Speaker 1: What was--well--
Speaker 2: Never believed it.
Speaker 1: We only can guess at what he was thinking he could do with it.  He didn't, you know--
Speaker 2: He was a collector.  That's all.  There was no tomorrow with him.  He just collected.  I have a--he would come and sell me a few little Gordon--[Berry] Horton pieces on paper.  I have them hanging up.  And, but he would never sell the big things.  I knew things were happening when I had another man coming around here selling, selling me pieces of work.  Like the nude over there and it was just--that was just a piece of paper.  And McBride, you know, was selling bits off, but not big pieces, no Charles Whites, no [Charles] Sebrees, but all the older artists, like San--Walter Sanford.
Story_ID: 15766
Speaker 1: One of the interesting things about the old artists in Chicago [Illinois], Walter Sanford, Berry Horton and others, Berry Horton walked up and down the waterfront, unemployed, no money and just walking up and down.  The same way that--many of the artists could never get on like some of the old artists.  I have to add that they never--they, they died hungry.  Margaret Burroughs is interesting.  What she would do, she'd have prints that she'd sell, and she'd stash money aside.  Some of, when Horton died, had the body picked up.  And there was a place down in, McGowan, an old name among the funeral homes, 33rd and Indiana, somewhere around there.  She'd give you a price and Margaret would pay for it.  She took care of all the old artists, all of them.  She'd been a pain in the neck, most people say, but she took care of the artists.  And she still does today.  If some artist was really out of it--if you ever can catch her, now, she's in her better times.  She can travel all the time, but she doesn't close her to door to, to an artist.
Speaker 2: That's something.
Speaker 1: That's something that a lot of people don't know, that Margaret really took care of the old artists when they dropped dead and had no place to go.  And she had that, that big home over there that's now her own home.  She'd put them up there for a while until they could get on their feet and then let them get out, you know, until the next person would come along.
Story_ID: 15767
Speaker 1: What's been the most rewarding part of being a gallery owner?
Speaker 2: The artists and getting to know them.  Sometimes--and I have several collectors that, nice collections.  And they got in trouble.  One, one had a son was opening a business.  He had to sell his entire collection.  I have a Margaret Burroughs, 1971.  I think I got for $400 or $500.  I have people coming in that are having a hard time with their collections and want it sold.  One very heavy name, going back to the Joe Louis period, brought in a, a painting that had to be sold to help this man get along with his money.  It turned out that--well, some money came through and so I'm holding the picture for his sister to come pick it up.  She doesn't have to sell it.  But those are things when you can help somebody.  I'm secure myself, not rich, secure.  When people are in trouble, they come here, and I can sell it for them.  And according to how much trouble in they're in and how they're hurting, I don't take anything out of it.  I, I just sell it with my other art, but push it a little harder.  The older the art is, there is always someone I can call, pick up the telephone, do you want a Charles Sebree?  And the man wants it for X number of dollars.  They can come with cash and get it and pick it up.  I have bought several of my own pieces cash for $300 or $400, and they were glad to get it.  And the picture would be worth up into the thousands.  I just heard of something that's, we're, just heard about it this morning.  We have a problem at the [South Side Community] Art Center [Chicago, Illinois], and we're getting X number of dollars, but we had to put up something in collateral.  And we found in the closet--we still don't have great places to put our important pieces, an Elizabeth Catlett piece.  It's a beautiful piece, beautiful head.  It's like silver.  It's not silver, but like it.  It's some, it's light; beautiful and her initials on it.  And this morning when I got up, the telephone rang and this girl that, our bookkeeper, she said, we've got a problem.  We've got the money, but this Elizabeth Catlett isn't--it's not an Elizabeth Catlett.  We had, what's her name?  She had a gallery down there.  I can't think of her name right now.  She sold Elizabeth Catlett's work.  So we had a picture of it, and we gave it to her to send to Elizabeth Catlett.  And Elizabeth said, this is not.  It's a copy.  It's a copy.  And so it got back to her, we had to tell the person who we got the money, it's not a real McCoy so we'll go into our collection and get something else comparable.  But we thought this Elizabeth Catlett would be a good piece.  And they're wondering what the heck are we gonna do with it.  I said, I'll buy it.  I'll buy it.  Things like that, the artist wants it, wants you to break it.  You don't want it around at all.  And Elizabeth Catlett said, break it up.  We don't, I don't want it and I don't want it for sale.  I think I'm going to get it, not to say this is Elizabeth Catlett, but it's a beautiful piece of art.  Whether it's hers or John Brown's, I'd want it because I'd love to look at it.
Speaker 1: If you had something to do over again, would you do something different in terms of this--?
Speaker 2: No, this gives me life.  At my age, I need life around me.  As a younger person, I was busy with children, Cub Mother.  But this gives me life today.  I'm still on the board, been on there 30 years.  They don't want people on there over 3 years--
Speaker 1: And this is--
Speaker 2: South Side Community Art Center.  And I'm not moving.  There's another man, we aren't moving.  I'm, we're not moving.  I'm very active.  We have our art auction coming up this weekend, and I'll be down there at 8:00 o'clock in the morning helping to carry the art to, to where we're going to have our art auction.  And I actually work, but they also respect me when they know I'm tired.  They help pick, carry things out.  But I'm very--and it gives me, I don't know what I'd do without it, as a place, something to do.  And I love my artists.  I really love them.  They're very important in my life.
Story_ID: 15768
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Making the community safe so we can walk down the street.  It's not--all these people that are doing all these things that upset me, shooting and what not, it started from the roots of it where we didn't have jobs anyhow.  And it just keeps, more gangs, more gangs from each generation; something to stop it somewhere so that at some generation, we can start them off in school or give them some incentive, just some incentive to make this a better place.  I'm past that now.  Those are hopes and dreams.  But I'm too busy dreaming about things I could do in my last years of my life, that I enjoy seeing.
Story_ID: 15769
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything that you've done so far, what do you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I can't see much of my legacy.  I think it all came before me.  I believe that I, I'm riding in on the tails of the Cayton name.  I really believe I'm just riding in on the tails of the Cayton name.  I am doing things that I like, but I'm doing it as Susan Cayton Woodson, the arts, bringing it out, but I don't think I have a legacy.  I, I really don't.  We have in our family, this started way back with Dad [grandfather Horace R. Cayton Sr.], that, and the other arms of the, of Senator [Hiram R.] Revels' family.  But in our own arm, when someone dies, someone in the Cayton family has to go speak for them.  When one of the cousins died, Donnie, out in San Francisco [California], Revels [Cayton] went to speak for him.  When we speak for him, their history, where they came from and just making them a part of our history.  We had a cousin to die in Seattle [Washington].  Revels called me, he said--he had cancer.  He says, I can't make it.  You'll have to go and speak for Marguerite.  So I went out and spoke for her, and I came back home, and I said, who's gonna speak for me?  There's no one left to speak for me.  And so I--the end of the line.  I don't know who's gonna speak for me.  I don't know where that legacy other than what I, how I've lived.  I haven't lived a perfect life, however rewarding.  It's been a rewarding years, what I've, what I've done and what I've been a part of.  Even the little stint in the Communist Party, I was marching for freedom.  I was marching to open the doors.  I enjoyed it.  I don't know what my legacy would be, other than I'm riding in on the courts, I mean the coattails of the Cayton book.  I think I'm in the last chapter and kind of bringing it together, what's left of the offsprings of the Cayton family.  They don't understand.  I recall your, your mother, your Dad saying go to your Mother [grandmother], Mrs. [Susie Revels] Cayton.  I'd go, Mother saying, go ask your Dad if you can, your Dad if you can do such and such.  Go ask Mrs. Cayton if you can do that.  In one of the books, either in Horace's [Horace Cayton Jr.] autobiography or what, they were at the opera, and Horace had to go to the bathroom.  And Mother reached across Horace, Mr. Cayton, Horace has to go to the bathroom.  And that's, that's the way it's always been, with respect to our seniors, our parents, remembering they're the important ones, Mr. Cayton, Mrs. Woodson, those were the important ones.  The new generation, they don't understand.  They all say, just Aunt Sue, you know, we all do when we want to be a part of the family, it's Aunt Sue, but not Mrs. Woodson.
Story_ID: 15770
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?  It's slightly different from legacy.
Speaker 2: I don't have--a little disappointed, not remembered, that our family couldn't get together, even within my own private family.  I have two grandchildren I don't--I know nothing of, I knew them as babies, priceless memories, priceless.  But now they're adults.  They don't know me at all.  They don't even speak to me hardly, not because they hate--just, they have their own lives.  And I'm so envious of all my other friends who have tight, close families.  I have nothing.  I have one son [Harold Woodson Jr.] and about 3 outsiders, not even related to me that are acting as family to me, taking care of me when my son's not here.  So I'm disappointed that I don't have a big beautiful family, with loving.
Speaker 1: But how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I wanted something that I never got.  And just remember that.  I didn't have a family that I could love, be a part of.  I really want that.  I never had it, never got it.  After my own family, nothing.
Story_ID: 15771
Speaker 1: A lot of things that would be, will be passed on.  You've collected things that didn't fall through the cracks.
Speaker 2: That's true, I forget--
Speaker 1: That's a legacy in itself.
Speaker 2: Yeah, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: You live with all of it and you forget that this is your legacy.
Speaker 2: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm accustomed to it.  You wake up and it's--you walk up here to see if it's still here.  Yes, I am passing on a legacy of art.
Speaker 2: Quite a bit too.
Speaker 1: Yes, and old pieces, old pieces.
Speaker 2: I think another highlight in your life would have been the friendships that you established with these artists.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I've never seen so much love when my mother gets together with a lot of these artists, Stringfellow--there's a--
Speaker 1: Allen Stringfellow--
Speaker 2: There was another artist that was WPA [Works Progress Administration] artist that was a friend of Stringfellow.  We have a piece here.  It's an abstract art.  I've never seen so much love.  I've been the outsider when I come in.  They know that I'm her son, but she is, she's the queen.  My mother takes things for granted at times.  She doesn't take the credit that is actually, that is given to her, and that--she's a humble woman.  And she has that, she has a lot to give, a lot to offer and she's well loved by her family, more so than she thinks.
Speaker 1: I love my artists.  They become family when they're close enough.  Really, I remember something Allen Stringfellow did.  I had a man come in here who was a con artist.  He had the original--
Speaker 2: Con artist (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he had the, he had the art.  He had the art.  He was known in New York [New York], Detroit [Michigan] and Chicago [Illinois].  And when Chicago found out about it, they were faxing all over to each other, be careful.  I had a gallery full of, of Fred Jones originals.  And when I found out, I called the man, come get them.  And Allen Stringfellow found out.  He came in here and sat--he laid across, on the floor waiting for the man to pick everything, and take it out of the house.  It was just beautiful the way--I had another artist coming to make sure that he got out and Harold and I were, were kept, you know, safe.  Yes, the artists are, they've been family to me, just family.
