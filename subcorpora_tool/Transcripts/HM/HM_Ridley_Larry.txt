Speaker 1: So I'll begin by slating.  My name is [HistoryMaker] Harriette Cole.  I'm the interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Today is November 30, 2016.  Observing is Mrs. Magdalena Ridley.  And I will ask you, sir, to please say and spell your name, and tell me your birthdate and what you do.
Speaker 2: My name is Laurence Howard Ridley [HistoryMaker Larry Ridley].  Laurence is spelled L-A-U-R-E-N-C-E, and Howard, my middle name, is H-O-W-A-R-D.  My last name is Ridley, R-I-D-L-E-Y, and Roman numeral II.
Speaker 1: And you call yourself Larry, is that correct?
Speaker 2: Professionally, I go by Larry.
Speaker 1: Professionally?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what is your birthdate?
Speaker 2: September 3, 1937.
Speaker 1: And what do you do, sir?
Speaker 2: I am a jazz educator and a jazz performer with quite a varied career, touring and teaching and performing with some of the greatest names in the history of jazz.  So, I'm a very lucky guy (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What do you play?
Speaker 2: I play the bass, the, the acoustic bass.
Story_ID: 663066
Speaker 1: So, we'll start with what we call People magazine type questions.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Easy ones.  What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, my god.  My favorite food?  All of it.  You know, I have nothing in particular that I don't like.  You know, I'm wide open as far as food.  I've always been very open to trying varying cuisines, and a lot of that was because of my travels internationally.  I've been in different countries, and one of my things was always to sample what is the local fare and to get an idea of what's happening culturally.  And food is certainly a part of culture, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.
Speaker 2: And so it's been a great, great, ride all the years that I've been involved.
Speaker 1: You say you travel a lot.  What's your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't have any one.  Because I've, you know, been to different parts of Europe.  I've been in Africa, and to various islands.  So, I've had a very prolific career in that regard, in terms of my travels and coming in contact with various cultures.  And I always like going into the various countries, because I get a chance to meet the people.  And it becomes something that's more--it becomes more intrinsic to me, because I'm not just reading something through a travel guide or anything like that, you know.  And I have a lot of friends in different parts of the world due to my involvement as a professional jazz musician, as well as an educator.  And it's been fantastic, I have absolutely no complaints.  I've been a very fortunate guy, and I've worked with some of the greatest names in the history of jazz, with some of the earliest people like Mr. Eubie Blake and Duke Ellington.  I've played with people like [HistoryMaker] Sonny Rollins, and have been friends with people like John Coltrane.  And Dizzy Gillespie, I've worked with him and Clark Terry.  I mean the list is--all of that is on my website.  So, rather than try to--
Speaker 1: Oh, that's okay.
Speaker 2: --you know--
Speaker 1: These are the short questions still (laughter).  What about your favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color, that's an interesting question.  I guess I would say blue, now that you ask me.  And I guess I'll put that in a wider context of thinking about how I enjoy playing the blues, and sometimes in my blue (laughter).
Speaker 1: And your favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Well, I like all of the seasons; I don't have any one in particular.  I enjoy all of them, you know, the idea of making the change and adapting to whatever the climactic conditions are.  And through my travels throughout the varying parts of the world has given me an ability to check all that out.  So, I don't have any preference, although I--in the long run, if I had to spend a certain amount of time, I would much rather be in warmer weather.  Not super hot, because I've been in places like that, you know, where it's that.  But I'm very adaptable in terms of climactic situations.
Speaker 1: Great.  And do you have a favorite saying or phrase?
Speaker 2: Hm.  That's a very interesting question.  Do I have a favorite phrase?  "To thine own self be true" ['Hamlet,' William Shakespeare].
Story_ID: 663067
Speaker 1: Now I want to talk about your family.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: We'll do both sides of your family, but let's start with your mother.  If you tell me her name, when and where she was born, and tell me about her and her family please?
Speaker 2: My mother, my first girlfriend was, her name was Nevoleane [Nevoleane Morris Ridley], spelled N-E-V-O-L-E-A-N-E.  And her maiden last name, was Morris, M-O-R-R-I-S.  And then she married my father, Laurence, L-A-U-R-E-N-C-E, Ridley, Sr. [Laurence Ridley, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Spelled different from you?
Speaker 2: No, I spell it L-A-U.
Speaker 1: L-A-U.  Oh, L-A-U, got it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Got it, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And my mother was born in Xenia, Ohio, spelled X-E-N-I-A, and she moved to Indianapolis [Indiana] with her family.  She comes from a large family of brothers and sisters.  And--
Speaker 1: How many children?
Speaker 2: Oh, there must have been about eight or nine of them.
Speaker 1: And where was she in the birth order?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  Mother was about, I'd say the third, I think.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  What year was she born?
Speaker 2: Nineteen zero six [1906], somewhere around in that area.  I'm sorry--
Speaker 1: That's okay.  And did she work?
Speaker 2: Well, she spent time--she was always a very active person.  From the time I was in elementary school, or even going to kindergarten and stuff like that, she was always very active with myself and my brothers [Michael Ridley and Rodney Ridley] and my sister [Lynne Ridley].  She was a very caring parent and, you know, we were members of the church too, of the African American Episcopal church.  Bethel A.M.E. Church [Indianapolis, Indiana]--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --was the church that I came up in early on.  In fact, I was an altar boy.
Speaker 1: Really?  And she was involved in the church?
Speaker 2: She was involved in the church.
Speaker 1: So, her work was family as opposed to outside (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Family.  But she worked for a while at St. Vincent's Hospital [St. Vincent Hospital] in Indianapolis, which was just two or three blocks away from where we lived in Indianapolis on the North, North Side--
Speaker 1: What did she do there?
Speaker 2: She was sort of like an attendant.  She was the bottle washer, and stuff like that; she did stuff like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Story_ID: 663068
Speaker 1: But she [Ridley's mother, Nevoleane Morris Ridley] operated the elevator when she was a teenager, and that's how she met my father [Laurence Ridley, Sr.].
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: My father had a very large newspaper route in Indianapolis [Indiana].  He carried the Indianapolis Star, which is the morning newspaper there.  And he would come, and she worked there as an elevator operator at the Madame C.J. Walker building [Madame Walker Theatre Center, Indianapolis, Indiana].  And so my father would stop in there, you know, and kind of take a break from the weather outside, because it gets really cold in Indianapolis (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: And he saw this little cutie pie, you know, and he said, "Oh, I'd like to get to know her," you know.  And I'm making everything short, but that's what happened.  And he started hanging out, you know, and it was an excuse for him to get warm (laughter).  And he'd come in and he'd engage her in conversation, you know.  But that was the beginning.
Speaker 2: Was he a teenager too?  Were they around, in the same age group?
Speaker 1: They were maybe not quite teenagers.  They were like in their early twenties, I think.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Some- somewhere around in there.
Story_ID: 663069
Speaker 1: So, going back to your mother's [Nevoleane Morris Ridley] family, what, what--tell me about her parents.  Were they also from--well, she was from Xenia, Ohio.  So, where were her parents from?
Speaker 2: Well, they were from Tennessee.  And in fact, occasionally we have been getting together the past few years having family reunions, and I have a pretty large family there in Tennessee.
Speaker 1: What did they do in Tennessee during--back in the day?  Were they farmers?
Speaker 2: A variety of things.  They were, some of them were domestic workers--a variety of vocations that they were involved in.
Speaker 1: Can you trace your mother's family back to slavery?
Speaker 2: That's a very interesting question, because that's something I've been meaning to do for some time.  I have not yet engaged in it.  My brother, my youngest brother [Rodney Ridley]--I have two brothers and a sister [Lynne Ridley]--my brother [Michael Ridley] next to me passed on, and my sister passed on.  But my youngest brother and I, we're the last of the Mohicans, so to speak (laughter).  So, we've been talking about trying to put things together to sort of come up with a family history.  And I learned a lot from my grandparents on both sides, on my father's [Laurence Ridley, Sr.] side and my mother's side, about some of the, you know, history of the family--not really in depth, but enough to know that basically they were from like, you know, the South, like Tennessee, in that particular area.  And my grandfather traveled a lot, that's the reason he was getting jobs and stuff like that.  And so--
Speaker 1: Your mother's father?
Speaker 2: My mother's father, yeah.
Speaker 1: What did he do?
Speaker 2: I guess he did a variety of things.  I'm not sure early on, but he ended up working, once he moved to Indianapolis [Indianapolis], in the Chevrolet factory (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  And what was his name?
Speaker 2: John Morris, M-O-R-R-I-S.
Speaker 1: And so your family--so on your mother's side, just heritage wise, are there Native Americans in your family?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, there are some in the background.  I don't know any of the names.  I've been saying I was going to get--like go through the whole DNA thing, but I haven't done that as yet (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, you--
Speaker 2: But there is Native American in the background.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Do you know what tribe?
Speaker 2: Cherokee.
Speaker 1: Cherokee.  And do you know how far back?
Speaker 2: No, that's something, like I said, that is part of--
Speaker 1: You're looking into it?
Speaker 2: I'm looking into it, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you didn't know any relatives growing up who were Cherokee?
Speaker 2: No.  But looking at them--
Speaker 1: Well looking at you (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) there was no doubt.  There was no doubt that there was some Cherokee going on there (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's why I'm asking. I'm looking at you so I'm asking (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, you know that they're in your family.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: It's just a question of--you're going to do some research.
Story_ID: 663070
Speaker 1: Now on your, on your father's [Laurence Ridley, Sr.] side, where was your father born?
Speaker 2: My father was born in Indianapolis, Indiana.
Speaker 1: He was, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What, what year?
Speaker 2: I think it was around 1906, somewhere around there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Around there.
Speaker 1: And what--tell me about his family?  Where were his parents from?
Speaker 2: Well my, his mother [Evelyn Ridley Maxey] was originally from Kentucky.  His father [Thomas Ridley, Sr.], I think was from Indianapolis.  Unfortunately, my father lost his father at a very young age.  So--
Speaker 1: Do you know what happened?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  His father was, he worked for a moving company there in Indianapolis.  And he fell off the back end of the truck, and he suffered wounds that--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --you know, I don't remember specifically what the wounds were, but that's what contributed to his demise.
Speaker 1: How old was he?
Speaker 2: I don't remember how old he was.  But he was old enough to have had my father, who was the oldest, and then my uncle Martin [Martin Ridley] who was second in line.  Oh no--yes, Martin and then my aunt Mildred [Mildred Ridley], and the youngest one, Thomas, named after my grandfather who, like I said, didn't have an opportunity to meet him because he passed early.
Speaker 1: He had four children?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And he was from Indianapolis?  His--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was born in Indianapolis.
Speaker 1: His wife was from Kentucky.  Is that where most of her people were from?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And do you know what their work was in Kentucky?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  That I don't know.
Speaker 1: So, you said you learned some things from your grandparents.  What did you learn from your father's parents?
Speaker 2: Well, unfortunately, I never got an opportunity to meet my father's father, because he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, because he died early. But his mother--
Speaker 2: He died early.  But my grandmother remarried, and she married a gentleman by the name of Mr. Maxey, who had several sons.  It was the second marriage for both of them.  And that was, and like I said, my father was the oldest, and then my sister Mildred--I mean his sister--
Speaker 1: His sister, sure.
Speaker 2: --Mildred, then my uncle Martin, and then the youngest was Thomas Ridley, Jr.
Story_ID: 663071
Speaker 1: So, you just told me your parents [Nevoleane Morris Ridley and Laurence Ridley, Sr.] met when your mom was working the elevator and your father was working the paper route.  When did they marry?
Speaker 2: Oh, my god.
Speaker 1: Did they marry young?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I came about a year or two after they had met and gotten married.  And I was born in 1937, so they must have married roughly around 1935, somewhere in that area.
Speaker 1: And after they got married, where did they live?
Speaker 2: In Indianapolis [Indiana].
Speaker 1: And I, so I read that you lived in the Lockefield garden apartments [Lockefield Gardens, Indianapolis, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was the second project built by the Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] administration in the '30s [1930s].  And it was brand new, it was beautiful.  And it was really a nice place for African Americans to live, you know, and it was just really beautiful.  And they had different sections.  It was a complex, and the complex formed like a triangle.  And in the middle of the buildings that were around this triangle, there was a huge--and when I was a kid it seemed like it was really huge--but there was this grassy area that was in the center of the development and, you know, people would come in there and sort of walk around.  But in each of the sections of the apartments, you know, like there were, you know, like there were things like playground equipment and stuff like that.  So, it was, it was quite family oriented.  And it was really, really very nice growing up there.  And a lot of my friends that I grew up with are still friends.  In fact, one of--a good friend of mine who is a well known jazz alto saxophonist, James Spaulding, he's also from there.  And he lived just a few blocks away from where we lived, and I knew him and his whole family.  His father [James R. Spaulding] was a guitar player, and he had several sisters and several brothers.
Speaker 1: So, I'd like for you to talk for a little bit longer about the projects, and the vision that came during that time when Roosevelt put money toward building these buildings.  Because today when we fast forward to 2016, the idea of the projects is very different from what it was when they began.
Speaker 2: You got that right.
Speaker 1: And so, I'd love for you to paint a picture.  You know, what was the purpose of the projects, and what did they do for the community?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, you know, basically like the start of the whole affordable housing concept.  And it was built for people of African descent, and that's what the population of it was.  But it was a very large complex, and like I say, it was a rectangle, and in the center was this courtyard area.  And there were, there was also like three sections of the buildings.  Now, I lived at 706 Blake Street, which was like a complex of several buildings.  Like, there was one building in an L shaped fashion that was in each of the sections that made up Lockefield Gardens. It still exists, although it's not for the same situation.  It's become somewhat interracial now, but it started out as being housing for people primarily of African descent.
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: And there was a school that was right at the end of it [Burke Elementary School (ph.)], the first elementary school that I went to.  Well, they had a section that was more towards--the main strip of the African American neighborhood in Indianapolis was Indiana Avenue, and that's where all the clubs and the nightlife.  And like I say, the Madame C.J. Walker building [Madame Walker Theatre Center, Indianapolis, Indiana] was there, which is a national landmark that still is there.  And everything was happening on the avenue.  And it's--
Speaker 1: And the avenue is right next to you?
Speaker 2: It was, it was just about two blocks down from where we lived.  I lived on Blake Street, and Indiana Avenue was like that (gesture), and then Blake Street went to the left.  And it was really nice, really very nice.  In fact, that whole area was really nice.
Speaker 1: And you're, you lived in an apartment.  What size apartment did you live in?
Speaker 2: It was a two bedroom apartment.
Speaker 1: And so, can you describe your home?
Speaker 2: It was a nice sized apartment; very, very, well kept.  And like I say, it was brand new during the time we were there.
Speaker 1: How long did you live there?
Speaker 2: Oh, I lived there until I ended up going to high school [Shortridge High School, Indianapolis, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Okay, a long time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 663072
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, I went to Burke Elementary School [ph.].  And at the end of the com- of this complex [Lockefield Gardens, Indianapolis, Indiana], they had a section that was called the annex, and there were some classrooms there. That was down, right off Indiana Avenue.  And the public school that I ended up going to was Public School 24 [William D. McCoy School 24, Indianapolis, Indiana], and it was to the left side of the complex that was there.  And--
Speaker 2: And this was an all black school?
Speaker 1: Yes, it was an all black school.
Speaker 2: So, when you think back on--
Speaker 1: It had some great teachers, too.
Speaker 2: Yes?
Speaker 1: Great teachers, and they were all people that had graduated with honors from the historically black colleges and universities [HBCUs].  And they were the creme de la creme, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, you got a top notch education.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  And they were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Which teachers do you remember?
Speaker 1: --they took an interest.  Oh, I remember all of them really, for the most part.  I remember Mrs. Simpson [ph.].  I remember Mrs. May [ph.].  Oh, there was just a whole bunch of them, and they were all achievers.  Many of them were members of the--you know, they'd gone to historically black colleges and universities and got their degrees, and they came out and taught and were achievers in the community.  And like I said, my mother [Nevoleane Morris Ridley] worked at the Madame C.J. Walker building [Madame Walker Theatre Center, Indianapolis, Indiana] as the elevator operator.  And Madam C.J. Walker set up all these things with the hair products and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --all of that.  She was--and it's still there in, in great shape, you know.
Story_ID: 663073
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So at that time, Madam C.J. Walker's business was a big thriving business?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes.
Speaker 1: So that was a very good job for your mother [Nevoleane Morris Ridley]?
Speaker 2: Well, she was the elevator operator.
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: But then some of her sisters worked in the place, too.  In fact, my mother's youngest sister [Ardeania Morris Buell] was a model for the--so, you know, they'd put the stuff in her hair and she'd be looking like a little doll baby (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, when you think about your--
Speaker 2: Well, it was two of my aunts that became models for--
Speaker 1: Models for Madam C.J. Walker?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were they on the packaging?  Or were they like live models at events?
Speaker 2: That part I don't remember.  I don't remember that, so I wouldn't want to venture--
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: --or guess on that.
Speaker 1: When you--
Speaker 2: But they--all the pictures that they took advertising the hair products, their image was there.  You know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Got it.
Speaker 2: --they had various profiles of them with--
Speaker 1: So, they were in, in ads?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 663074
Speaker 1: What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: God, there're so many.  I just remember having such a, a great childhood.  And that was really because of my parents [Nevoleane Morris Ridley and Laurence Ridley, Sr.] and my family, and also other people that lived in the individual little sub-complexes of the complex.  Because everybody looked out for everybody, and you knew the people that lived--like the people--one of my favorite friends who turned out to be one of the great trumpet players, Virgil Jones, lived in the same little section of the Lockefield Gardens [Indianapolis, Indiana].  And he lived up on the top floor, which it was only about four stories high.  It wasn't like, you know, the projects they have now, you know, that kind of thing.  But, and we all lived in different little sub-sections of the entire complex.
Speaker 1: And so, James Spaulding was there.  Virgil Jones was there.  Were there other--was Slide Hampton there, too?
Speaker 2: Slide (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was he living in your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Slide, I'm not sure exactly where Slide lived at that particular time.  But--and I can't really recollect exactly where he lived.  But, you know, we came in contact later on as I became involved--
Story_ID: 663075
Speaker 1: Because Miss Ruth McArthur, like I said, started this conservatory [McArthur Conservatory, Indianapolis, Indiana], and she hired people from the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra.  And my first violin teacher was Miss McArthur, and then she brought in Miss Mildred Lynn, who was the first violinist with the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra.  So, I studied with her.
Speaker 2: And what year did you start (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And they had all kinds of people going there.  In fact, this was like, you know, like '45 [1945] or somewhere--
Speaker 2: So, you're still a young child?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 2: When did you pick up an instrument?  When did you start--?
Speaker 1: Six years old.
Speaker 2: Six, and what was it?
Speaker 1: The violin.
Speaker 2: You started with the violin?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I used to--'The Bell Telephone Hour' radio was the stuff back then.  And they had this program on that I listened to that I loved, which was 'The Bell Telephone Hour.'  And they had all these great players: Fritz Kreisler, Jascha Heifetz, and on and on.  They had all these great performers that would, that I'd hear over the radio.  And then I suddenly decided that I wanted to play music.  And day I would tell my mother [Nevoleane Morris Ridley], "Oh, I want to play the trumpet."  The next day I'd want to play the saxophone, "Oh, I want to play the saxophone."  And my mother said, "Wait a minute, hold it."  (Laughter), "You have to make up your mind, you know."  And that's when I heard Jascha Heifetz on 'The Bell Telephone Hour.'  It was something about the sound that he got out of that instrument that just really captivated me.  And that's what made me pick up the, the violin.
Story_ID: 663076
Speaker 1: Well how did, how did you get your first violin?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a gentleman who was a friend of the family who worked at this music store where they sold instruments.  And like I said, once I had made the decision what instrument I wanted to really focus on--he was an African American gentleman who worked at this really top instrument company there in Indianapolis [Indiana].  And he was able to, he was a distant relative of the family, too.  And when I had made the decision I wanted to play, you know, they kind of let him know.  And he got this violin, and I had this little tiny violin, you know, because I was just a little--
Speaker 1: You were five or six, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And that's when I first started playing.  And my--
Speaker 1: And as you grew up, you changed sizes?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: I didn't even realize at first that violins came so small?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: They really do come for little kids.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they make them--I think they still make them.
Speaker 1: They do.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They do.  And so, who taught you?
Speaker 2: My first teacher was Miss McArthur [Ruth McArthur].
Speaker 1: And was this at your elementary school?
Speaker 2: No.  This was at her--she opened up this music school in the neighborhood for--
Speaker 1: The McArthur Conservatory [Indianapolis, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: The McArthur Conservatory, yes.
Speaker 1: But that, that didn't open until you were nine is what my records say.  Is that true?  Was it before then?  So I was just wondering, did you--was there music at all in your elementary school before you started?
Speaker 2: I played in the little orchestra.  They called it an orchestra, you know (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  So there were music teachers at your elementary school--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --from the beginning, at George Washington Carver [George Washington Carver School 87, Indianapolis, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And that's the school that was right, right on the edge of your home [Lockefield Gardens, Indianapolis, Indiana].
Speaker 2: Of--
Speaker 1: So you walked to school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that wasn't that far a walk.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, and--
Speaker 2: It used to seem like it was far when I was that age, but--
Speaker 1: Especially when it was cold, right (laughter) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) as I, as I visited it later I said, "Oh, my goodness, I used to think that this was a huge, huge place," you know.
Story_ID: 663077
Speaker 1: And so in 1946 is when the McArthur Conservatory of Music [McArthur Conservatory, Indianapolis, Indiana] opened.  And you were telling me--tell me again about Ruth McArthur.  Who was she?
Speaker 2: She was a young woman who had grown up there in Indianapolis [Indiana].  And she started the school for, you know, kids in the African American--conservatory, she called it, for young African American kids.  And that's--she was my first (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what instruments were being taught there?
Speaker 2: I don't remember all the instruments, but I know the violin was what I had, I started on.
Speaker 1: So as a child, you were playing the violin?  How long did you play?
Speaker 2: Oh, I played the violin up until the time I even went to college.  In fact, I ended up going to Indiana University School of Music [Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, Bloomington, Indiana] on a violin scholarship.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And but then I started playing--I was attracted to jazz because I was hearing it on the radio, you know.  And there were jazz musicians that lived in the area, and one of my distant--well, she was one of my aunt's sisters.  She married one of my uncles, his name was Cecil, Cecil Morris [ph.].  And so, Bessie Morris' [ph.] sister was married to this saxophonist by the name of Jimmy Coe, C-O-E.  And he was the alto saxophonist that took Charlie Parker's place in the Jay McShann band.  And so, a very fine musician.  And he lived in Indianapolis and ended up marrying one of my aunt's, by marriage, sister.  And that's how, you know, we became--you know, Indianapolis was a very family oriented situation.  I mean, you knew other people and--you know.
Story_ID: 663078
Speaker 1: So, you mentioned that when you were a child, like so Spaulding [James Spaulding] was one of the people who was in your building [Lockefield Gardens, Indianapolis, Indiana].
Speaker 2: He was, he lived in the subdivision.  It was a project, you know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --with several buildings (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So as children, you were playing the violin.  Did he begin his musical career early like you did?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.  But he ended up going, his family ended up moving and he had went to another school that was on the Eastside of town.  I was born down on the Westside of Indianapolis [Indiana].  And he began to develop, but we always kept in touch, you know.
Speaker 1: You did?  You stayed good friends (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: And so, what about Virgil Jones?  He was in that--
Speaker 2: Virgil lived in the same little section (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And was he beginning to play as a child?
Speaker 2: Play the trumpet?  Yes.
Speaker 1: So, did--as children, did you all play together at all?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: So, what was that experience?  Were you playing at home?  At school?
Speaker 2: Well, there were different situations that we played in.  We really started doing a lot of playing together when we all became teenagers, and we were playing like teenage dances.  And even--my father's [Laurence Ridley, Sr.] brothers knew this gentleman that was the manager of a club that was there called the Sunset Terrace [Indianapolis, Indiana].  And all the people used to come through--Charlie Parker, Coleman Hawkins, you name them--the great players that would come through and perform there.  And I'd always--in those days with the wooden telephone poles, they would put up these signs, you know, that had the person's picture up.  And a guy would come around and he had a bag, like a paper bag full of these posters.  And he'd tack them up on the telephone poles.  So, I always remember seeing all these pictures.  And as I remember, I'd sneak down about three or four blocks; it wasn't that far.  You know, I mean it seemed far then, but it wasn't that far.  And we used to go around the back of this building where the Sunset Terrace was and sit at the back window.  And then in the summer, you know, they would have the window kind of cracked.  You know, it was really before air conditioning (laughter) and all that, and we'd listen to the musicians.  And I remember that it was one of the things.  And then I was hearing it on the radio.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 663079
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who were you hearing on the radio as you were growing up?
Speaker 1: Well, I was hearing 'The Bell Telephone Hour.'  And, and Jascha Heifetz and people like that were the leading players; they were playing.
Speaker 2: And this is what got you interested in jazz?
Speaker 1: No, that's what got me interested in music.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In just playing music.  Jazz, I was hearing it, and I always figured that I wanted to play it.  It wasn't until I got in, basically in high school [Shortridge High School, Indianapolis, Indiana], that I started playing jazz.  I wanted to play jazz, but I couldn't hear myself playing jazz on a violin.  And--
Speaker 2: Did you try?
Speaker 1: A little bit.  I could play a little boogie woogie, you know, and have you stomping your feet and dancing.  I mean I could always swing a little bit, you know (laughter).  And--
Speaker 2: But you felt like you had the wrong instrument for the art form you wanted (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I went to 'Jazz at the Philharmonic'; that was the traveling thing.  Norman Granz had this thing called 'Jazz at the Philharmonic' that went from city to city, and he had all the leading jazz players of that day.  And I was always saying I wanted to play jazz, but I couldn't really hear myself playing jazz violin, at least I wasn't, I wasn't being attracted to that.  Then Ray Brown was playing with Oscar Peterson and Herb Ellis as part of the 'Jazz at the Philharmonic' concert tour.  And they had all these great players, you know, Coleman Hawkins; I mean, you name them.
Speaker 2: And you went to this when you were young.  This is--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You were twelve in 1949.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So did your--who went with you?  Do you remember?
Speaker 1: That's an interesting question.  You know, things were a lot safer during those days.  So, you know, there was a lot of places that you could go--just go on your own.  I didn't need to have any adult supervision or anything like that.  And I was always raised--you know, my mother [Nevoleane Morris Ridley] and father [Laurence Ridley, Sr.], you know, and my family--the additional family that weren't blood family, but they always looked out for us.  So we knew our boundaries, not like today where you got a lot of wild folks running around and acting crazy.  But we were always--because we knew that if we acted up, by the time you got home, the telephone would have rang.  And my mother was not afraid to use the belt (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And you didn't want that belt (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I got many--I got many spankings, you know, as a young fellow.  But I wasn't a bad guy, you know.  But just sometimes I would just kind of be a little independent when I--without checking in and making sure, you know.  But I always respected my parents, because they were wonderful people, you know.
Story_ID: 663080
Speaker 1: So, when you went to the 'Jazz at the Philharmonic,' part of what was, was notable about Norman Granz is that he was pushing for integrating audiences.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Which at that time--
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: --many of the black jazz artists were playing to white audiences as opposed to an integrated audience.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, Indianapolis [Indiana] is very funny in that respect.  Because even though there was this whole thing, there were still--there were a lot of white people that hung out in the neighborhood.  Because, you know, they'd come to the clubs, and they'd be coming to the various events and stuff like that.  So, I always knew people.  And then my father [Laurence Ridley, Sr.] carried ice, and so my brother [Michael Ridley] and I would be working with him on his truck.  He had a 1937 Chevrolet truck, I'll never forget that truck.  My father kept that truck and carried ice.  You know, eventually the bed of the truck rusted out, and he put some plywood in there (laughter) to keep it alive.  But--
Speaker 1: And did you help to carry that ice?
Speaker 2: Yes, I carried the little twenty-five pounds of ice.
Speaker 1: The little twenty-five pounds (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We had the little thing we put over the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah how big, how big did they get?
Speaker 2: You know, they had the ice hooks.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And you'd pick it up and you'd just put it on your shoulder.
Speaker 1: And this was a daily run, was it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did a lot of that, because people had iceboxes in those days.  And you know, they'd open it up and I'd lift it up and put it in.  I never lifted anything heavier than twenty-five pounds, you know, because I was a kid like six or seven years old, in that age group.  But we used to--there was an icehouse where they had these huge blocks of ice.  I mean those boxes of ice were the length of this table here.  And--
Speaker 1: Wow.  And they would cut--
Speaker 2: They would come, they would come down a conveyor belt.  And it was already--what do you call it--ready for the market.  So, it was in twenty-five pound sections.
Speaker 1: That was the size that would fit into the icebox, twenty-five pounds?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Got it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And--
Speaker 1: And so you were saying that your father carried the ice, and so you got to see who was in the neighborhood.  You were telling me about the people who came to see jazz.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They--I wasn't able to attend early on, you know, but I remember all the great names that used to come through.  And as I started listening to jazz and learning it--because my folks were into jazz.  And in fact, I got involved in bebop, because my mother's youngest brother [Charles E. Morris], during that day, you know, he was about wearing his shades and being cool, you know.  And that's where I first started becoming aware of bebop.
Story_ID: 663081
Speaker 1: But you also, you, you mentioned that you grew up in the church, in Bethel A.M.E. Church [Indianapolis, Indiana] right.
Speaker 2: I was an altar boy, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so your family was very active in the church when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: My father [Laurence Ridley, Sr.] wasn't as active as my mother [Nevoleane Morris Ridley], though.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my mother made sure she took all of her kids; my two brothers [Michael Ridley and Rodney Ridley] and my sister [Lynne Ridley] and I.
Speaker 1: And were you there--was it Sunday?  Was it during the week? How--
Speaker 2: Mostly Sundays.  And like I say, I was an altar boy, and I put on the little robe and everything.  And I'd sit up and I'm looking at people.  And while I was speaking about that--one of the most memorable things that happened to me as a youngster as an altar boy--there was a woman who was overtaken, you know, overcome by the service and the message that the minister was giving.  And she came to join the church when they opened up--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --"Okay, if anyone wants to come forward and make their confession to God," and what have you.  And there was a woman that sat just like you're sitting right there.  She was just about that far, maybe a little bit further back towards the wall.  And I'm looking at this woman, and she was sobbing.  And I'll never forget this.  This is something that's been like indelible on my mind, you know, because she couldn't stop crying.  And she was just sobbing and sobbing and sobbing.  And I sat there and I watched that woman draw her last breath.  She died, and I'm looking just about as far as--like I say, where you're sitting.
Speaker 1: As she came to offer herself (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was so overcome to, you know, do the confession and, you know, recommit to God, you know, the whole thing about coming and--
Speaker 1: And she died right there?
Speaker 2: Died right there.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And she kept sobbing, and then one of the sisters, you know, one of the deaconesses in the church, had her on their shoulder.  And I watched that woman, and I'm serious, about as far as you are sitting there.  And I'm looking at this--maybe a little bit further, you know, back toward the wall (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How old were you?
Speaker 2: About six years old, yeah.
Speaker 1: What did that do for you, to you?
Speaker 2: It's an experience that I've never forgotten.  And in my mind, it's like a movie.  I mean, yes, as we're even speaking, I'm seeing it like a rerun.  It just showed me--I think it's where I really starting beginning to realize the importance of human feelings, and how important that is.  And being involved in the church was always about being a Christian, and being involved and not growing up in a situation where there was a bunch of knuckleheads, you know, necessarily.  I mean there were a few knuckleheads in the hood (laughter), you know, but we never hung out.  I never hung out with any of them, you know.  But--
Speaker 1: So, I was asking about the church.  Often when people are active in the church, music like bebop or jazz is not necessarily welcomed by the family when you want to do that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, they were--
Speaker 1: Did you have any resistance (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, there was never anything.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: There was nothing like that.  Like I say, my parents were into, you know, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, that whole thing--Ella Fitzgerald and everything.
Story_ID: 663082
Speaker 1: But I always wanted to play jazz, but I couldn't hear myself playing jazz violin.
Speaker 2: And so, when did you make the, the change?
Speaker 1: I went to the 'Jazz at the Philharmonic' concert, and they had the Oscar Peterson Trio with Ray Brown playing the bass, and Herb Ellis on guitar.  And when I heard Ray, I was, became fixated on him, you know.  I still have this mental picture of seeing him, and he was playing that bass.  And oh, my god, he was getting, just getting down.  The brother was leaving no prisoners (laughter).  And I, you know, I got to know him later as I became a professional, and I used to tease him all the time.  And I always say I met Ray in Indianapolis [Indiana] attending that concert.  And I was with him when he was performing in Indianapolis just a few--well, maybe three or four years back now.  And he was performing, and I would go to the club and hang out with him.  And I'd get there early, because he was a part of that old school of musicians, where they'd get to the club and have their meal, you know, and sit down and eat, and tune up their instruments and get ready to go on.  I mean, real pros, you know, and very serious about their commitment to being musicians.  And I was teasing Ray, and I said, "It's your fault.  Yeah, it's your fault, you're the culprit."  He said, "Yeah, but look what you've done, man."  He says, he says, "I'm proud of you."  And I said, "Well, thank you, sir."  I mean and to have the person that inspired you say that to you, and for him to just take me on just like a younger brother, you know, was just wonderful.  And I went to, I went to the club and he said, "Well, Mr. Brown hasn't shown up."  I said, "Well, that's unusual."  And then all of a sudden we got a call from the hotel where he was staying, which was generally in the area.  So, we jumped in the car and went over there.  And it hurt me to my--bottom of my toes, to see them wheeling him out on a gurney.  He was an avid golfer, and it was ninety degrees and humid.  And some guy that night when we were sitting in the booth, this guy says, "Hey, when's tee time, Ray?"  He said, "Oh, six a.m."  I said, "Ray, you're playing until two o'clock in the morning, man."  You know, he said, "Oh, I'll be cool, Larry [HistoryMaker Larry Ridley].  Don't worry about it, everything is cool."  I said, "Man, but it's hot out here, man.  You know, this is Indianapolis, man."  I mean, you could lose five pounds just stepping outside, you know, sometimes.  I'm exaggerating of course.  But it was just hot, and you're sweating.  And we go to the hotel and see him coming out.  So, I always say to people that I met him in Indianapolis and I said goodbye to him in Indianapolis.  And it hurt me to my heart, you know.  But he was such an inspiration.
Speaker 2: And so you were twelve when you saw him perform the first time, right, at the Philharmonic [Philharmonic Orchestra of Indianapolis]? Was it around that age?
Speaker 1: Not at the Philharmonic.
Speaker 2: Where did you see him perform?
Speaker 1: It was, it was a traveling show called 'Jazz at the Philharmonic' that Norman Granz, the jazz promoter--
Speaker 2: That's where you saw him?
Speaker 1: That's where I saw him.  They played at theaters across the country.
Speaker 2: Right, yes, that's what I'm talking about.
Story_ID: 663083
Speaker 1: And then did you--after that, did you then go and trade in that violin for the bass?
Speaker 2: No, I never traded it in.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No.  A friend of mine--when I decided I wanted to play the bass I was a teenager or early teens.  And there was a friend that lived around the corner from me, who worked at a music store.  His name was Frank Rogers [ph.], and I always told him, I said, "Hey, man, I really want to play the bass."  And he's the guy that got me my first bass, because he said, "Oh, yeah, well, we got a bass, you know.  I'll get ahold of this bass for you."  And that's how I got my first bass, was through him.
Speaker 1: And then did you learn to play (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I taught myself.
Speaker 1: --at the conservatory [McArthur Conservatory, Indianapolis, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: I taught myself.
Speaker 1: You taught yourself?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because I had studied the violin, and I knew the treble clef, you know, and taught myself the bass clef.  And then I just got, you know, like an elementary book showing me the positions and the fingering.
Speaker 1: Because it's a bit different, isn't it--the bass from a violin?
Speaker 2: The intervals are much wider.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But it was interesting, because my first really professional gig--because I played gigs with the little teenage band that we had.  Like I said, Freddie Hubbard and James Spaulding, and all them.  But I ran into Monk Montgomery, one of The Montgomery Brothers.  He was the bass playing brother, and Wes was the great guitarist.  And his brother Buddy [Buddy Montgomery] played--Buddy played the piano, and later gravitated to the vibraphone.
Speaker 1: And they were an established group at this time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: They played--
Speaker 1: They were adults.
Speaker 2: They--oh, yeah, they were adults.  And they played at this club out on 16th Street out by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway [Indianapolis, Indiana]; it was called the Turf Club [Turf Bar, Indianapolis, Indiana].  And Freddie Hubbard and James Spaulding and myself, we used to go out there--and the Montgomery brothers.  It was called The Montgomery-Johnson Quintet.  And when we'd show up at the jam sessions on the weekends, on Saturday, you know, they'd say, "Uh-oh, here come them blues in B flat boys," because most of the tunes we knew were in the key of B flat (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But they were really very nice to us.  You know, they treated us so nicely throughout their lives, you know.  And Wes Montgomery--I mean, anybody that doesn't know the name Wes Montgomery, I don't know where they've been living; under a rock or something.  You know, because I mean he's one of the all time great stylists, and he was very much into Charlie Christian, but had his own style and sound.  He played with his thumb.  He didn't play with a pick, and that's how he got that soft sound on the guitar.  And all the brothers were self-taught.  I mean, they were geniuses.  I mean, Buddy could play some of the most complex chords.  It was like the bebop chords.  He had the voicings and all that stuff.  And Monk could just play the bass.  In fact, Monk was the first one to play the Fender bass guitar, which--and he did that because he was playing with Lionel Hampton's band.  And Lionel Hampton was--a Leo Fender who created the Fender bass guitar, and gave him one.  And so Monk was playing it, and so that's how Monk started playing the fender bass. And--
Speaker 1: And that became--the Fender bass became the favorite instrument over time, right?
Speaker 2: In certain musical context.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot of--particularly in blues groups--and then of course later on with the so called rock groups, which came out of rhythm and blues, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They were hybrid versions of rhythm and blues.  But that instrument, I still have a couple of them.  One's fretless, you know, so I can just play it just like--because the bass--because see, bass doesn't have any threads.  But I knew the spacing of my--you know, the dimensions between my fingers on the key- on the fingerboard, so I taught myself that at first, and then I ended up going to a teacher.  And I had a lot of musicians around that taught me a lot.
Speaker 1: I was going to ask.  Because when you and your friends went to the jam sessions with The Montgomery-Johnson Quintet, were they also teaching you?  Did you get them to teach you?
Speaker 2: Well, they were teaching us.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But they taught us more from the bandstand.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, like I say, one of their favorite phrases when they'd see us walk in the door, "Here come them blues in B flat boys" (laughter).  But they were always very nice.  It was a very nurturing environment, I have to say that.  You know, they took us under their wing.  And another great trumpet player from Indianapolis [Indiana] that was our age was Virgil Jones.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: And you'd grown up with him?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 663084
Speaker 1: Now you went to Shortridge High School [Indianapolis, Indiana].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Which--
Speaker 2: Oh, before we get there--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: School Number 24 [William D. McCoy 24, Indianapolis, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Yes?
Speaker 2: That was the first public school I went to.  They had some of the greatest African American teachers.  They all were graduates of historically black colleges and universities [HBCUs].  And so, we got a first class education, first class.  I mean, there wasn't a lemon in the bunch.   I mean and they were nurturing people too, very nurturing.  And then I went to--we moved from the projects [Lockefield Gardens, Indianapolis, Indiana] to the North Side of town, and that's when I got involved and I ended up going to Shortridge High School.  And I was a part of the third class, as I mentioned before, that was allowed to reintegrate.  Because--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --when my father [Laurence Ridley, Sr.] and my aunt, his sister [Mildred Ridley], who I never got to meet--she died before I was born.  When they were coming up, the schools were integrated.  But they built--there was a push to--because the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] was a big organization in the State of Indiana.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: In fact, it was the home of the grand dragon [D.C. Stephenson] for several years.  And that's when things became more segregated, because people used to really integrate more, you know.  And it was, it was very interesting coming up in, in that kind of environment, you know.
Story_ID: 663085
Speaker 1: You just mentioned the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK].  You know, you were--you grew up in a time when racism was obvious, let's say (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you share some of your experiences what you encountered?
Speaker 2: Well, one major experience--you know, like there's many things that I can bring up.  But one of the things that really to this day that I remember, I was about six years old, and my father [Laurence Ridley, Sr.] would go to these used car lots.  And, you know, being a little kid, the doors were open, you know to the cars and everything.  So, I opened the door to this one car, and I'm sitting up there acting like I'm driving, you know.  I'm going like this (gesture), you know.  And the next thing I know, the door opens and there's this white guy who grabs me by my collar and pulls me out of the car, and he put his foot dead in the crack of my behind.  And I said--so he kicked me so hard, I peed in my pants.  And my father came running when he heard all this ruckus going on.  And he was saying, you know, "What's going on," you know, like, "What's happening over here?"  They said, "Well, this little old nappy head nigger, he come over here and he's sitting up here in the car," and this, that, and the other, and blah, blah, blah, you know.  And, you know, he was--and my father smoothed it out, you know.  But that really was a hell of an experience.  That's when I got my first taste of real racism.  Because we used to hang--because I used to be with my father carrying ice, and there were a lot of white guys around, guys that were from Kentucky and Tennessee.  And they were all beautiful guys, you know.  So, I never thought about any racism in that regard, although I lived in a, you know, a black neighborhood, African American neighborhood, you know.  But we still--there was this interplay going on with my violin lessons.  I was studying with this young white woman [Mildred Lynn] who was the first violinist with the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, and I never got into the thing about saying, "All white folks are a drag," and this, that, and the other, you know.
Speaker 1: Because your parents didn't--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --have those conversations with you?
Speaker 2: No, no, because people were--you know, it was not a big thing.  There were certain sections of town that you knew you didn't go into, and particularly after a certain time of day.  And that was, you know, we knew it was off limits.  And there were certain areas where you knew that they were really very racist people that lived there.
Speaker 1: And did you have separate bathrooms and separate--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --not being able to eat at the dining counter and all that stuff, did that happen in your town to your knowledge?
Speaker 2: To my knowledge, no.  Because I was brought up, you know, in like the black neighborhood, which is like growing up in Harlem [New York, New York] or something like that, you know.
Speaker 1: So, it wasn't necessary to have the--
Speaker 2: No, but downtown, in the downtown area there were places where you knew that they would not serve you, you know, if you were African American, you know.
Speaker 1: And so with you and your friends (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We stayed away from there.
Speaker 1: You just didn't go?
Speaker 2: Just didn't go there, nope.
Speaker 1: Well, was it ever discussed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was not cruising for a bruising (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 663086
Speaker 1: Was it ever discussed, like, "Why can't we go there?"  Or it just was a given?
Speaker 2: It was just a part of what was.  Naturally, there were conversations about it, but there were always white people that were friendly with the community.  So, you know, it wasn't--it was not like really being--it was the South, but it wasn't the deep, deep South where you had that kind of thing.  And so, I never came with up that thing, "Oh, white folks are a drag, you know," and this, that, and the other, blah, blah, blah, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, but then at the same time, you said that the grand dragon [D.C. Stephenson] of the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] lived in Indiana.  So, this is kind of--
Speaker 2: So, it was in the newspapers and on the radio, you know.  We knew about what was going on.
Speaker 1: Did you ever see the Klan?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: Thank god.
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Nevoleane Morris Ridley and Laurence Ridley, Sr.] ever talk about the Klan?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Because the neighborhoods were pretty much self-contained, you know.  The people in the African American neighborhoods, you know, maybe worked for wealthy people that lived in certain parts of the town.  We did things like that.  And my father did a lot of moving of people, and stuff like that.  So we would go in there, and my brother [Michael Ridley] who was next to me--it was about eighteen months' difference in our age--he'd have us on one end, and we'd be moving people and doing all kinds of stuff.  So, I came up with my father like taking us--he'd take us on the truck.  He had this 1937 blue Chevrolet pickup truck, and I'll never forget that.  He kept that truck for years.  In fact, after he moved out of Lockefield [Lockefield Gardens, Indianapolis, Indiana], and later on, he even kept the car parked in, in like a little driveway of the house where we moved to on the North Side of town, you know, because we were living at first on the Westside of town.
Story_ID: 663087
Speaker 1: So, when you went to Shortridge [Shortridge High School, Indianapolis, Indiana] that--the black school was Crispus Attucks High School [Indianapolis, Indiana], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Fantastic school, too.
Speaker 1: And what was your reason for going to Shortridge?
Speaker 2: Well, because I was a part of the second or third group that--when they re-allowed blacks to go to--
Speaker 1: To integrate.
Speaker 2: To integrate, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, as one of the early classes to integrate, did you feel any racial pressure at the school?
Speaker 2: You know, it's something about kids--you don't really know.  I mean, I had a couple of teachers that were doozies.  That you know, I had one lady and she had a big southern drawl, and boy, many times I wish I could have had a size shoe big enough, (laughter) because she really was strange.  That was in high school.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Because--
Speaker 1: So, there was quite a contrast between the teachers that you had at P.S. 24 [William D. McCoy 24, Indianapolis, Indiana] and the teachers at Shortridge?
Speaker 2: At P.S. 87 [George Washington Carver School 87, Indianapolis, Indiana], too (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Excuse me, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, P.S. 24 didn't--
Speaker 1: Then P.S. 87, then Shortridge.  Did you feel like you got a good education at Shortridge?
Speaker 2: Oh, one of the top.  Shortridge was one of the top high schools in the country.  A lot of senators--Richard Lugar was a graduate.  In fact, when I went in as a freshman, he was in the senior class.  And he was, they had a thing they called an annual dance in the high school called the blue belle ugly men dance.  And he was, he was the blue belle--I mean he was the ugly man one year.  And they used to have the little dances and stuff like that, you know.
Story_ID: 663088
Speaker 1: While you were still in high school [Shortridge High School, Indianapolis, Indiana], you started performing professionally, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were you performing the bass? Or were (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because you had transitioned at this point?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so, with whom were you playing?  Where were you playing in the early days?
Speaker 2: Well, Indiana Avenue, like I say, was like the main stem, like a street in Harlem [New York, New York], where all the black clubs were; they had all the entertainment.  And there was a place called George's Bar [Indianapolis, Indiana], and my uncles, Martin [Martin Ridley] and Thomas Ridley [Thomas Ridley, Jr.] originally were friendly with one of the guys that was the, one of the owners of the place.  So, he approached them about having my little teenage--because we used to get together like at Freddie Hubbard's house.  Freddie lived up on the top floor of this house where you could look out.  It was an attic apartment, and we'd look out the windows. And right across the street was the parking lot for Polk's, P-O-L-K, Polk's Milk Company [Polk Sanitary Milk Company, Indianapolis, Indiana].  And Wes Montgomery was working there during the day, because Wes had six kids.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: He had a big family.  But he was very conscientious about taking care of his children, and so he would work all day at the Polk's Milk Company and then go play gigs at night at this club called the Turf Club [Turf Bar, Indianapolis, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And Freddie used to tell me how he would look out the window, because he and his mother lived in this attic apartment and the window was facing the parking lot.  And he said he would catch Wes going out, sneaking out and taking a nap (laughter).  And he said, "Hey, Wes, I see you over there, okay."
Speaker 1: 'Cause he was working day and night (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) "Don't let me come down there and tell on you," you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, he was working day and night, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so, you begin to play fulltime with the Montgomery jazz quintet [The Montgomery-Johnson Quintet], right?
Speaker 2: Well, we had our own little group [Jazz Contemporaries] at George's Bar--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that I had.  It was Freddie Hubbard on trumpet and James Spaulding on alto saxophone and flute.  And at that time he had joined the [U.S.] Army, but he was stationed at Fort Benjamin Harrison there in Indianapolis [Indiana], so he was there.  And he--we had a young piano player, a white guy named Walter Miller, who was the original pianist with the group.  And Paul Parker was the drummer, and Paul came from a musical family.  His older brother, Buddy Parker, was his nickname Buddy, played the tenor saxophone.  So, he came from a very musical family.  And--
Speaker 1: Did you have a name for your group back then?
Speaker 2: The--why am I drawing a blank?  Yeah, we had a name.
Speaker 1: (Speaking off camera) Do you remember? You can say it.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: But anyhow, how many years did you have your own group?
Speaker 2: Several, at least--that was the beginning.
Story_ID: 663089
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And each of these artists with whom you were in that group went on to do very well.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So it's not--I mean, you know, a lot of people have groups when they're young.  But--
Speaker 2: No, we were all I guess very precocious kids, and were involved in music.  And James Spaulding's father [James R. Spaulding] was a guitar player, and he played with different bands, and we were around all these musicians.  There was a gentleman, a blind gentleman, who was--well, he wasn't totally blind, but he had limited vision, because he would get around by himself and he didn't use a cane or anything.  His name was Erroll Grandy, a genius on the piano.  I mean, he could play any style of music, and--you name it.
Speaker 1: And did he play with you?
Speaker 2: No, no, but he was one of the people that we looked up to, and he had a great deal of influence.  And he used to walk around, and he had this little gruff voice.  And I'd see him and he had very blurred vision, and he'd wear these Coke bottles for glasses, you know.  And I'd see him and I'd say, "Erroll, I see you over there."  He said, "Oh, Larry [HistoryMaker Larry Ridley], I'm just going to take care of business here."  (Laughter) That's the way he talked.  But he was, when he sat down to that piano--whew, he could play anything--ragtime, stride, blues; any swing type of jazz.
Speaker 1: Your group Jazz Contemporaries?
Speaker 2: That was the group I formed when we were in high school [Shortridge High School, Indianapolis, Indiana] with Freddie Hubbard--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and James Spaulding and Paul Parker.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) and Walt Miller [Walter Miller]?
Speaker 2: Walt Miller.
Speaker 1: Now, because you had the various influences like Erroll Grandy and the Montgomerys [Wes Montgomery, Buddy Montgomery and Monk Montgomery] and all these different people--did you know--or I could say when did you know that you could be a musician as your work?
Speaker 2: I really had my mind made up that I wanted to be a professional musician.  You know, I had jobs.  Like, I worked in a supermarket stocking things and packing groceries and delivering packages, and stuff like that.  But I knew I wasn't going to stay in that, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I just always knew that I wanted to play.  Like I say, when I went to the Circle Theatre [Hilbert Circle Theatre, Indianapolis, Indiana] and saw Ray Brown--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and 'Jazz at the Philharmonic,' I knew that that was what I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 663090
Speaker 1: And so when it comes time for you to go to college in '55 [1955], you go to Indiana University Jacobs School of Music [Bloomington, Indiana].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  That was before it was the Jacobs School of Music.
Speaker 1: Was it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they renamed it later.  It was just Indiana University School of Music at that point.
Speaker 1: And how did you come to that school?  Did you receive a scholarship?
Speaker 2: Yes, I received a scholarship.  I was taken down and I auditioned to, to get a scholarship.
Speaker 1: But this is on the violin, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, even though you were--
Speaker 2: I was already playing the bass.
Speaker 1: --playing the bass, playing jazz--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at this point, there's no jazz curriculum?
Speaker 2: Right.  They didn't have a jazz curriculum there.
Speaker 1: So in order to go to college, you had to go--
Speaker 2: Well, because I always figured--and I guess through conversation with family and what have you--they were always saying, "Oh, you know, you talking about you want to be a professional musician.  You know, it's a hard life."  And you know, so I made up my mind early on, with no objection on my part, to get a degree in music education, so that if stuff got rough trying to play professionally I always had something I could make a living.  Because, I mean, I didn't want to be out there working and washing dishes and stuff (laughter).
Speaker 1: Or like your friend [Wes Montgomery], working at the Polk Egg Factory.
Speaker 2: Polk's Milk Company [Polk Sanitary Milk Company, Indianapolis, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Polk's Milk, excuse me.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Polk's Milk Company (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You didn't want to do that.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no.   That was not part of the plan.  No aspirations in that regard (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, you went to college and you studied violin?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: This is classical, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  But there were a lot of jazz players that were attending that were in the music department--
Speaker 1: There were?
Speaker 2: --in the school, and there was a little jazz thing going on there.  In fact, there was a pizzeria that had jazz there, and I used to get gigs in there.  That was how I made some money on the sideline, you know.  I'd have like a duo gig, and I'd have a piano with me or a guitar player.  You know, I always knew how to make some money.  I wasn't sitting around begging nobody for anything.
Speaker 1: Now, because you are doing jazz on the side, that's where your heart is, and you're learning classical violin in school--
Speaker 2: And playing in the orchestra.
Speaker 1: --and playing in the orchestra.
Speaker 2: In string quartets.  I did all of that.
Speaker 1: Are you passionate about what you're doing with the string quartet and the orchestra and all that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, it's learning?
Speaker 2: I've never made a division.  It's about--there's only two types of music, good and bad.  And that's the way I've always looked at it, you know.  Because I came up, you know, with the country and western and all that kind of stuff, too, you know.  But I like, I like that kind of music too.
Story_ID: 663091
Speaker 1: And so, what did you learn at--in, in college [Indiana University School of Music; Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, Bloomington, Indiana] that you were able to use in your jazz career?
Speaker 2: Well, we had a jazz scene going on there, and just by majoring in music education I was getting various techniques, courses which would enable me to become a teacher, you know, so that I would have that, rather than just going for a bachelor of music.  I went for the bachelor of music education so that I would always have this in case things didn't work out.  So, I've always been thinking ahead, so that because I like to have some grits on the table, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: And then you switched your major to contrabass? What's that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To the bass, yes.  And I had the bass teacher there, Mr. Murray Grodner, who was an ex-bassist with the New York Philharmonic.
Speaker 1: So, you had great teachers at your college as well?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  And I still, I got to check in and see if he's still alive.  Because Mr. Grodner, I call him every now and then and talk with him, you know.  He's like an uncle to me, you know, we had that kind of relationship, a very symbiotic relationship.  He was always very encouraging, and I learned a lot from him.
Speaker 1: So, what did you learn from him?
Speaker 2: The rudiments of playing the instrument; you know, the positions, and how to get--
Speaker 1: You taught yourself up to that point, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I mean this was embellishing and augmenting what I'd already taught myself.  Because I had the sound in my ears, you know, so--but it was always like finding my own sound.
Story_ID: 663092
Speaker 1: And that process of finding your own sound, you know, many musicians talk about how it sort of evolves over time, and then--
Speaker 2: And that's what happens.
Speaker 1: --and then at some point you realize this is it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because you can't be like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did that happen for you?
Speaker 2: You know, you can emulate some of your influences to a certain extent.  But beyond that, you got to find your own thing.  One of the great things that happened too, when I was there at Indiana University [Indiana University School of Music; Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, Bloomington, Indiana], David Baker and myself and a trumpeter, Alan Kiger--Gunther Schuller came through with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, and we knew he was involved with John Lewis of the Modern Jazz Quartet.  And so we went and introduced ourselves, and he got scholarships for us to come to Lenox, Massachusetts, and we came for the second year of the Lenox School of Jazz.
Speaker 1: And that was in the summer?
Speaker 2: In the summer, yes.  And I studied bass with Percy Heath, and I played in a group that Max Roach was the conductor of, with Ornette Coleman.  It was Ornette Coleman, this is 1959, and Ornette Coleman was first coming on the scene with his new approach to jazz; what they were calling avant-garde, you know.  But, and we played in a group together, he and Don Cherry, who played a little small trumpet called the pocket trumpet.  And--
Speaker 1: And you met all of them at the Lenox School of Jazz (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At the Lenox School of Jazz, yes.
Speaker 1: How long was that program?
Speaker 2: Oh, it lasted for a few weeks.  I can't remember, I don't remember.  It was just, you know, I don't have a timeframe (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But it was in the summer?
Speaker 2: It was in the summer, yes.
Speaker 1: And you went to Lenox, Massachusetts.  And you said who helped you get the scholarship for that?
Speaker 2: Gunther Schuller.
Speaker 1: Gunther Schuller.
Speaker 2: With the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra.
Speaker 1: And you said we.  Who else was part of your group that went there?
Speaker 2: Oh, there were a lot of musicians that were there that I became friends with that came from other cities.  David Baker was there ahead of us, and he basically--that's before they--like I said, there was a jazz program.  But we had our own thing going on, and we used to get together and jam all the time.  And there was this place called east hall, which was a rehearsal hall.  It was a whole big building, and they had practice rooms and also an auditorium.  And I played in the orchestra.  I played in the orchestra and we would practice.  And there was--little quick anecdote about that.  There was this gentleman by the name of Tibor Kozma, who was the conductor of the university orchestra.  And he was very, very, prim and proper, you know, with his Russian accent, and blah, blah, blah.  And so he had this little--I call them Messerschmitt, which is a name that's well known in Germany for making, I think motorcycles.  And they made this little thing that was like an enclosed motorcycle.  And one day, just showing how--you know, there were times when I could be a little impish, I guess.  But we lifted this thing (laughter) and put it in the front door of this rehearsal hall (laughter), a bunch of us.  And he came out and he was--always had a sneer on his face.  "Who did this?  Who's responsible for this," you know.  And we just stood off on the side, and I was cracking up.  My sides were hurting.
Speaker 1: No response (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) But that was to get back at him for being such a BO--a BH (laughter), you know.
Speaker 1: While you were at Indiana University, you played with David Baker's big band, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, was he--
Speaker 2: He was a student.
Speaker 1: He was a student as well?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a graduate student.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then did you play for a while with the Modern Jazz Quartet?
Speaker 2: No, but we met them, and we ended up going to the Lenox School of Jazz.
Speaker 1: And they were there at the same time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were in residence.
Speaker 1: Got it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were there along with Bill Evans, the pianist, and Herb Pomeroy, the trumpet player, and Jim Hall, the guitarist.  The whole Modern Jazz Quartet was in residence, and those are the people we studied with.
Speaker 1: So, all of these people are there.  This is a very rich experience (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And we were hanging out together, yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: We were at the Music Inn [Lenox, Massachusetts], which was like up there in the Berkshires.  And we had our rooms there, and we'd get up and go and play music and hang out and jam, and be around these fantastic people.
Story_ID: 663093
Speaker 1: And like I said, I played in the group that Max Roach was the conductor of, and that was fun.  And the interesting thing about it--I'm stepping ahead a little bit--Max always told me, he says, "Well, Larry, if you're ever in New York [New York]--," because he was taken with my talent and ability I guess--and he said, "Give me a call."  So I said, "Okay, Max, I will, you know."  I mean, to have Max Roach--I mean, whoa!  But of course!  (Laughter) So, when I got to New York, I called him up and I said, "Hey, Max.  This is [HistoryMaker] Larry Ridley."  He said, "Hey, man, how you doing?  What's going on?"  I said, "Yeah, I just got in New York, and you told me to just give you a call when I get to New York, you know."  He said, "Yeah, what are you doing on such and such day?"  I said, "Well, I'm just here, you know."  So he says, well, he says, "Bring your bass and come to such and such place."  So I go there, and I'm looking at all these great musicians that are in the band, you know--Booker Little, trumpet player and all; George Coleman and all these fantastic players, you know.  And so--
Speaker 2: And what year is this about?
Speaker 1: That had to be what, nineteen--oh, god, in the sort of late '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: So, you're in your twenties, your early twenties?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And--
Speaker 2: And was this after you finished school [Indiana University School of Music; Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, Bloomington, Indiana] that you come to New York?
Speaker 1: I didn't finish my degree.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was later on.
Speaker 2: When--
Speaker 1: That was later on.
Speaker 2: When did you come to New York?
Speaker 1: I first came, like I say, in 1955.  And then I came to stay in 1957--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --or somewhere around in there.
Speaker 2: So, anyhow, you go to this rehearsal place.  And what happens?
Speaker 1: I go to this rehearsal, and all these great musicians are there in the room.  And so, Max says, "You know, I need a bass player."  I said, "Oh, really?"  (Laughter) He said, "Yeah, I want you to play bass with me."  He said, "Come on, get your bass out.  We're rehearsing, and I've got these great players, you know." And I ended up coming to New York and got a gig right away, you know.  I mean, how fortunate can you be, you know?  And to call him up--and it wasn't the fact that he was just being nice--
Speaker 2: He meant it.
Speaker 1: --but he was very sincere, you know.  And Max was like a big brother to me, Max Roach, I mean, and all the subsequent drummers that I became involved with, like Philly Joe Jones, Art Blakey, Billy Higgins, and on and on.  I can name so many great drummers that I've had the pleasure of performing with and playing with, and just becoming a part of the fraternity of players, you know.
Story_ID: 663094
Speaker 1: And so when it comes to playing with these great drummers and other musicians in the jazz world, because much of it is improvisational--this kind of melding of talent--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --which is very different from, say, the classical music that you learned in school.  Can you talk about your process when you're working with different artists and creating music together?
Speaker 2: Well, apart from the blues, which anybody that's learning how to play knows, learns how to play the blues and you learn the twelve bar blues form.  But the different compositions that are a part of what musicians use, you know.  Like a song like 'Fine and Dandy,' (sings musical notes) or 'Cherokee,' (sings musical notes), you know, all of these song compositions have chord changes that are a part of it.  So you know, whoever's playing the piano or the guitar in terms of chordal instruments, they're playing that.  And every individual in the group has their particular role.  The bass player is like the link between the harmonic instruments and the drums.  So, that's what forms the rhythm section.  And occasionally, there'll be a guitarist that might be a part of it, too, and that becomes the rhythm section.  And we're accompanying the horn players that are on the front line, you know.  And they will have songs that they're playing and there're chord sequence to all of the tunes, and you learn what the chord sequences are.  And my role as the bass player is to improvise the bass line that becomes the link between the piano and the guitar as the chordal instruments, and the drums.  So the bass is like in the center of making that link, which is very important.  And it's important to know how to get a groove.  Like Duke Ellington wrote that song, "It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing" ['It Don't Mean A Thing'] (laughter).
Story_ID: 663095
Speaker 1: Well, and I mean you're saying that.  But it--in the actual performance of it, if you aren't grounded and connected, both grounded and connected to the other musicians, then it doesn't work.
Speaker 2: That's true.  And sometimes, you know--well, I've always tried to be very open to adapting to whatever the musical circumstance is.  Because if I'm playing in a duo situation, say, with a pianist, then the bass has a dual function, because it's up to me to play lines linking the chord sequences to the various songs, and at the same time having the rhythmic pulse that's going.  And then if you add a drummer, and then you become the link in the rhythm section.  And it's always about accompanying, and to know the chord sequences to the songs that you're playing.  And you have to create inventive lines, but it's not just going off on your own.  You have to have your ears and everything else in tune with creating contrapuntally what the other instruments are doing, and you have a role within that organization, whether it's, like I say, from a duo, to a trio, up to a quintet, on up to a larger group.  And you have the chord sequences, so then it's a matter of coming up with the bass line that's going to form the pulse at the bottom in the rhythm section.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I don't know what create contrapuntally means.  What does that mean?
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  Come to order, class (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, contrapuntally means that, you know, if you're playing the chords, then that's, there's a sound with the multiplicity of the notes that are a part of any chord.  And then you've got the drummer playing time and playing on the cymbals, and keeping the time and doing other little things that they do.  The bass has to create a line, knowing the chordal sequence to the song, whether it's playing twelve bar blues or a thirty-two bar song.  You have to know all of those chords.  And the chords give you the basic notes, you know, like the four notes that make up the chord, to link, form the link within the rhythm section.  And that's, that serves as the pulse.  The drummer's keeping time over here, and doing little fills with the left hand on the snare or whatever.  But he's keeping the cymbal (sings musical notes).  And it's my thing to go (sings musical notes) you know.  And so whatever the chord sequence is, I'm playing this line.  And so, the piano player or the guitarist is playing the chords, and I'm the link within that.  So, we each have a role that we play.
Speaker 1: That's what--
Speaker 2: And so, and it's not me just going off on my own just playing anything.  I've got to be able to hear and have the musical acumen in order to play a line that's contrapuntal to what the soloist is doing, as well as being the link in the rhythm section.  So, it has more than a singular function within the group.  But it's very important; very, very, important.  And if you don't have that--and this is what--with my years of jazz education, I'm always working with rhythm sections and getting them to understand what their role is, and how they have to learn certain aspects of learning the chords, learning the melodies, playing tempos.  That's the other thing.  You have to--playing the bass, you have to learn how to get your hand positions on the neck so that you're playing the notes, the individual notes that they're playing, the lines.  And at the same time, you're stroking the instrument to get the sound, so that, you know, (sings musical notes).  And it's not just playing just anything.  It's hearing that and being a part of the unit, because you're in the middle between the harmonic instrument and the drums.  And you're also, you're all listening to what the soloist out front is doing.  And so, that's, that's what creates the ensemble interplay, whether it's a duo or a trio, on up to a big band.  That's, that's a part of it.  And every song that you play has chord sequences, and that's what everybody's playing on.  Even if you're out front soloing, you have to learn how to play the notes that are a part of the harmonic fabric, so that you're playing something that's in the context of the improvisational situation at that given moment.
Speaker 1: Excellent.
Story_ID: 663096
Speaker 1: So, while you're at the Lenox jazz school [Lenox School of Jazz, Lenox, Massachusetts], you made an album.
Speaker 2: I--well, they re- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or you participated?
Speaker 2: I participated in an album that was a compendium of the various groups that were particularly together there with all the players like myself, who came there and was studying with all these great people--the Modern Jazz Quartet, all of these great players--Bill Evans, pianist, and Herb Pomeroy, trumpet player, and Kenny Dorham, trumpet player.  They were all on the faculty there.  They had an all-star faculty.  I mean, you know, you couldn't ask for--
Speaker 1: Well, was this the first album that you participated in, recording?
Speaker 2: Well, what happened was that they recorded the student concerts there, and it was released later as a part of the historical documentation of the Lenox School of Jazz.  It's--
Speaker 1: So, it's a live performance that's captured on tape (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, right.
Speaker 1: Got it.
Speaker 2: And I played in a group with Ornette Coleman, who had just first come to the East Coast, who basically was like the father or the main prime--one of the prime innovators of the so called avant-garde.  But he was a part of it.  And Don Cherry, who played a little pocket trumpet--it was about that big (demonstrates)--he was a part of it.  But we, they recorded the student performances at the end of the time we were there.  So, that was the culminating function that occurred.
Story_ID: 663097
Speaker 1: And so you're, you mentioned Ornette Coleman, a pioneer in the avant-garde perspective, say of jazz.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What's happening now in you finding your own sound?  How is your sound developing as you're encountering these different people who are bringing their influence in?
Speaker 2: Well, the main thing with being a jazz musician is finding your own voice.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Male or female.  And I mean, I've played with some great players, male and female.  And so, I've been very fortunate in that regard.  And the thing that I've always maintained is that not going in a very myopic way, recognizing the fact that when you're playing with different people, you have to--because it's the melding of the vibes between you.  You know, there's a certain thing that you have to--you know, it's just like Duke Ellington wrote that song, "It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing" ['It Don't Mean A Thing'].  Because, when you hear young groups, they're all over the place.  Like I go and do a lot of things at the schools and stuff like that, and you hear the kids, and the trumpet player is up there blaring, but they have not really learned how they have to blend.  And that's true in any type of music, with any musical organization, whether it's rock, folk, or whatever, you know, jazz or symphonic.  It's a thing of learning how to blend and meld together.
Speaker 1: As you keep your own voice.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: With those--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Which could be two opposing energies.
Speaker 2: And that's--you know, you don't want it to end up being a cacophony, you know.  But it's a thing of--you basically have the same goal in mind.  It's that you're improvising.  It's like you're creating a Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven] sonata or a Bach [Johann Sebastian Bach] fugue, or whatever, you know.  Every part is very important to the total mix of learning how to play with each other, and being sensitive to that.  So that my bass line is not conflicting with what the drummer is doing or the piano player.  But we all--and whoever is the soloist is the one that has the primary voice at any given moment within the performance, and it's very important to know how to do that.  Now that's one of the things that the later versions that they call the avant-garde, that I have mixed emotions about with some people.  Because sometimes I hear them, and they're just playing a lot of noise and everybody's going for themselves.  I don't get it.  You know, it's like being in Times Square [New York, New York], you know, (laughter) on New Year's Eve, you know (laughter).  But, there has to be a blend in terms of--that's when the music has its greatest empathy.  And learning how to reach out to the audience too, because you have to make the audience feel something of what you're doing.  And I hear, I've heard a lot of guys, particularly young guys, they'll come up and say, "Man, we played at this place and the people didn't want to listen to us.  And they were just--," and I say, "Well, what were you playing?  Were you feeling the audience?  Were you tailoring what you're doing so that you are attracting and drawing them in?"  Because it's like the little--what is it?  The Pied Piper, that whole thing about the Pied Piper, how he could draw the kids.  Because it was, the bottom line was the melody he was playing on the pipe was attracting and hypnotizing the kids to follow him.  And that's what it is when you're dealing with an audience.  And it's true, like even if you're an actor or actress, you have to know how to do that too.  You know, because you can go to a play sometimes and hear some people, and they're awful (laughter).  You know, but they have to know how--that's what separates the women from the girls and the men from the boys.

Speaker 1: When you were performing with Max Roach's band, how long, how long did you work with him (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Off and on, many, several engagements that, that I performed with him.
Speaker 1: In the early days when you first moved to New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: In fact, we did the 'Freedom Now Suite' ['We Insist! Max Roach's Freedom Now Suite'] that was done at the Village Gate [New York, New York], and we got a big write up.  That was during the time that all of that--and Abbey Lincoln was his wife, and she was singing with the group.  And that was at the time of that whole thing that was going with the Civil Rights Movement, and Max did this 'Freedom Now Suite.'  We did it at the Village Gate.  And guess who one of the dancers was that?
Speaker 1: Who was it?  Eartha [HistoryMaker Eartha Kitt]? No?
Speaker 2: The poetess and writer.  God, what is her name?  It's escaping me.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou?
Speaker 2: Maya Angelou.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I love Maya Angelou.  When that woman speaks, I mean, you know, I just melt.  She has such a tone in her voice.  It's like a very angelic sound to her voice, and that's what makes her such a great actress.  And even when she's just offering poetry and stuff like that, I mean she just captivates you.  And that's what we have to do as jazz musicians.
Speaker 1: So, she was dancing during this performance?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That was before she became well known, you know, as a singer.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: It was the Helene Walker [Helena Walker] dancers.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: And so, what was this performance again?
Speaker 2: It was the 'Freedom Now Suite.'
Speaker 1: And this was in the early '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty [1960].
Story_ID: 663099
Speaker 1: As you--as a jazz musician during this moment when there's so much going on in the country around civil rights, and here's an example of you're participating from an entertainer's point of view.  How conscious are you of what's happening in the country, and how is it affecting, how is it affecting your artistry?
Speaker 2: I mean, you know, it's so, such a broad way to try to--I mean it affected all of us, you know, because we were feeling the same thing, you know, like the deprivation on so many different levels of what was happening, you know.  That's the reason why.  But, you know, getting along with people from different races, I've never had a problem with that.  And contrary to what some of the so called militant folks want to act like--they want to act like, "Oh, all white folks are devils," and this, that, and the other.  No, that's bullshit.  Pardon me.
Speaker 1: That's okay.  You say whatever you want.
Speaker 2: You know, no, I mean people are people.  There's knuckleheads in every race that I've ever encountered, and I've been in many countries all over the planet.  And so, you know, it's only a difference between good and bad in varying degrees within those levels, you know.  So, these people that get into this heavy thing--and you know, I know a few of the guys and hung out with them, that were a part of the movement, you know, the Black Power movement--Rap Brown [H. Rap Brown; Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin] and all them guys, you know, and different ones.  And LeRoi Jones who later became Amiri Baraka, he was an old buddy of mine, we hung out.  In fact, when he put out his book, 'Blues People' ['Blues People: Negro Music in White America'], I played as a part of the press conference that they had at one of the clubs.  And when he introduced his book, that's how he started to take off.  That's when he was LeRoi Jones, L-E-R-O-I, the King Jones.
Speaker 1: I remember.
Speaker 2: And then he later became Amiri Baraka.  A good dude; a smart, brilliant dude, brilliant dude.
Speaker 1: So you're--so that's another example of your kind of intersecting the Black Power movement.  Because actually that's where--he was part of the Black Arts Movement, let's say.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We were all involved in that.
Speaker 1: Right, yes.  And so part--
Speaker 2: Randy Weston, that's another name.  Randy's always been very much into tracing the African roots.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he and I, he's like a big brother to me.  And I've worked in his band, and we've done a lot of things together.  His music is very Afrocentric.
Speaker 1: How do you--what, what do you feel your role was during that time?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess the only thing that comes to my mind immediately in responding to you, is that I was very fortunate to be on the scene and to be connected to people who were in the forefront of this.  So, I had entree into this.  I wasn't just somebody hanging on the sidelines that was looking from the outside in; I was in it.  And that's not to say anything about being arrogant about it, you know.  But it's just the point that, you know, I was one of the soldiers that was concerned about all this, you know, and very much involved in it, and I was playing benefits and all kinds of things where we were supporting the movement.
Speaker 1: And based upon the experience that you've described, at least in those musical moments, you described always having connection to people across cultures.  So--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --during this period of tremendous unrest when you were performing at these different benefits and things, was it an integrated audience?  Did you feel like--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --this was a time when people were coming together?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  There were always people that were, you know, involved of varying ethnic persuasions, you know.  So, you know, it wasn't just all black folks getting together and hanging out and being a mob or whatever, you know.  No, I mean, there were a lot of intelligent people, you know, like I knew Rap Brown and all them guys, you know.  And like I say, LeRoi Jones who became Amira Baraka; a whole bunch of those--Nathan Heard, Lloyd McNeill, the artist who's also--he played the flute as well, but he was more of a practicing graphic artist.
Story_ID: 663100
Speaker 1: In the various bands that you played in, did you--during that period did you go down south to perform at all?
Speaker 2: I didn't go a lot of places.  I went to, like I was--went to Atlanta [Georgia], you know.  But Atlanta was like, you know, that was very cosmopolitan, you know, for people of color, you know.  That was always like the mecca, you know, sort of Harlem [New York, New York] is.  But Atlanta, the city itself, had this overall vibe, you know.  Harlem was a very significant component to New York [New York], but you know, New York's got--
Speaker 1: Everything.
Speaker 2: Everything.  I mean, it's like a salad bowl (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, you weren't really going to like Mississippi and Louisiana and places like that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I didn't go to Mississippi during that time when it was really the heavy stuff.  But I was, you know, I went to, you know, places like Atlanta--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and Georgia and Tennessee, places like that, and Kentucky.
Speaker 1: And so when you went to those places, did you encounter racism?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But you know, it was a thing--you knew where to go, and you didn't--you know, I'm not one that goes looking for trouble, you know, because I don't like confrontations.  Because I mean, you know, even though I'm a nice guy, you know, I don't take no S-H-I- you know.  You know, I'll engage in the thrilla from Manila if necessary, you know (laughter).  Coming up around those (unclear) that I came up around, that you don't maintain a certain amount of--that's why they like me, you know.  But I've always tried to be a nice guy, and you know.  I learned that from my parents [Nevoleane Morris Ridley and Laurence Ridley, Sr.]--to get along with people and the conditions I came up in Indianapolis [Indiana].
Story_ID: 663101
Speaker 1: After you worked with Max Roach, you joined Slide Hampton's octet?
Speaker 2: Well, I came to New York [New York] with Slide Hampton's group [Slide Hampton Octet] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you?  Okay.
Speaker 2: And it so happened that when I called Max to let him know I was in town, we had a break in between engagements.  Because we used to play in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] a lot up on Wylie Avenue up on the Hill in the black section of Pittsburgh.  It's called the Hill District.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: That's the famous neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Crawford's Grill [Crawford Grill, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] was the place that booked all the jazz groups.  And I played--
Speaker 1: So that's where you had been working with his octet--
Speaker 2: That's when I first came east.
Speaker 1: Got it, got it.  And then during the '60s [1960s], you played with a number of different musicians in New York.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What are some highlights that you remember during that period?
Speaker 2: Oh god, it's so many.
Speaker 1: Well, one of the things you talked about, just in terms of your experience, was the apprentice system in jazz music at that time.  Can you describe what that was for you?
Speaker 2: Well, I say apprentice in the fact of playing with these major artists, like playing with a Max Roach or a Philly Joe Jones or Art Blakey or Horace Silver, on and on.  I worked in Carmen McRae's trio [Carmen McRae and Her Trio] and different groups like that, being flexible enough to try to--you know, because music is music, to me.  There are only two types, good and bad, you know.  So I've always accepted the challenge, and I like all kinds of music.  You know, because I played in string quartets and all that kind of--orchestras and--
Speaker 1: When did you meet [HistoryMaker] Sonny Rollins?
Speaker 2: Sonny Rollins.  Well, when did I meet Sonny?  Boy, I'm trying to--seems like I've known him all my life.  He's like a big brother to me.
Speaker 1: But it was in the '60s [1960s], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah, early '60s [1960s].  And he hired me to be a part of his group, and I played in the group.  At first, it didn't have a piano player.  It was like he had just bass and drums.  And I still speak with Sonny, he's still alive, you know.  He's up in age now, but he lives right up above New York City in the Woodstock [New York] that area up there.  And just so many wonderful experiences, being on the bandstand and playing music with these people.  And I'm playing with my heroes, you know, and sheroes.  Because I mean, you know, I think about, you know, playing with Carmen McRae, you know, and Betty Carter, as far as a couple of singers that come to my mind.  I played with Anita O'Day, I mean, it's a whole bunch.  All that stuff is in that long list of names that I put down there.  Because I sat down at one point a few years back and said, let me put down all the names of the people that I had the pleasure of working with.  And that's why that list looks so long.  But I've been very fortunate, because I would come in--and I've always tried to maintain a certain level of flexibility.
Speaker 1: Right, you mentioned that.
Story_ID: 663102
Speaker 1: Have you ever had your own band?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: When did you have your own band?
Speaker 2: Well, the first time [Jazz Contemporaries] was when I was a teenager in Indianapolis [Indiana] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then when I came to New York [New York] I would get various gigs.  I even had like duo gigs.  There was a place down on Little West 12th Street, the Needle's Eye [New York, New York].  It was down in the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York], and I used to have a friend that owned--in fact she's still around.  Sue Yellen [ph.] was her name.  I met her, and she and her father had opened up a place called the Needle's Eye, and all the basketball players and everybody used to come through.  I mean, it was heavy, you know.  It was down there in that Meatpacking District [New York, New York].  So late at night, you know, we'd be all out, and in the summertime we'd be all out on the street talking S-H-I- you know, (laughter) and just having a good time.
Speaker 1: This is when it was still the Meatpacking District?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: There would be little pockets of nightlife in between?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And it was wide open, you know, because people would--we'd get outside and we'd be probably talking loud and whatever.  But we weren't bothering the neighbors or anything like that.  It was--
Speaker 1: 'Cause they weren't there.
Speaker 2: Exactly (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Those were the factories, right.
Speaker 2: And I had a lot of good times there with people like Cedar Walton, a pianist with me, and Harold Mabern, a pianist, and Ronnie Matthews.  I think Kenny Barron made some of those gigs with me, too.  So, there were quite a few piano players that we did the duo thing with.  It was really nice, you know, having that.  And then I started getting other gigs, and just working with different people.
Speaker 1: And recording?
Speaker 2: And recording, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you recorded with Slide Hampton on 'Somethin' Sanctified' (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) With the octet [Slide Hampton Octet], yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  That was in 1960?
Speaker 2: That's when I first came to New York.
Speaker 1: And then '61 [1961] with Red Garland and 'The Nearness of You.'
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: That was the trio [Red Garland Trio], yeah.
Story_ID: 663103
Speaker 1: You're described sometimes, often as a side man.  What does that mean, what's side man in music?
Speaker 2: Well, it's a term that has come about when you're working with someone's group who is the leader.  Like if you're a member of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers [The Jazz Messengers], you're a side man.  That's, that's where the term comes from.
Speaker 1: So it's like a featured artist in a sense?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Because, you know, the beautiful thing about playing in a jazz group, you know, it's like you're your own section.  And in order to make that group be very functional and to communicate with your audience, you know, you have a role to play in making sure that the music, you know, forms a--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --you know, like a tight fabric.
Speaker 1: The fact that--I mean you were--you have been in high demand.  You performed with many of these bands over the years.  How did you--
Speaker 2: Thank you Jesus.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Just in terms of managing your time, how did you make the choices to go from one band--
Speaker 2: Well, some of them--
Speaker 1: --or moment to another?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  Some of the groups that I worked with were not always working back to back.  So, you know, and I was on--you know, there were other musicians that had groups, and they occasionally had a gig.  They may not have always had something where they had, say, six weeks of work or whatever.  You know, there were situations like that, but there were times when somebody would call and say, "Hey, I got a gig at the Village Gate [New York, New York], you know.  Are you available?  Come on, I want you to hook up with me," you know, that kind of thing, or at the Village Vanguard [New York, New York] or any of the other clubs that were around.  And that's how that came about, and I guess I was the right guy in the right place with the right stuff.  And all these people liked the way I played, and the fact that I was a team player.  You know, I was also focusing on being a soloist.  But by the same token, the major function--I'm always telling my students that your first obligation is to be a team player.
Speaker 1: Well, I've watched a video of you teaching, where you used basketball terms to talk to students, all about the team.  Can--talk about that for me, please.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I was very fortunate that I came up around some great basketball players who went on to make names for themselves--Hallie Bryant, who became a member of the Harlem Globetrotters, and [HistoryMaker] Oscar Robertson, who's one of the NBA [National Basketball Association] legends.  Oscar was in high school [Crispus Attucks High School, Indianapolis, Indiana] during the same time I was.  In fact, we had a little social group that we interacted together too when we were coming up in Indianapolis [Indiana]; you know, just having a wide range of friends like that.  You know, I've never been somebody who just had a tunnel vision about things.  That's the reason why when you look at the list of people I performed with, I never turned down a gig and said, "Ah, it's not real jazz," and something like this, you know.  I mean playing--I mean having the opportunity with a Josh White, one of the legends of folk music.  Give me a break!  I mean, whew!  You know, and Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry, and oh, my goodness, all that stuff.  I, you know, I could go on naming names, but that's on the list.  You have a list of all that (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 663104
Speaker 1: Like over the course of your career as you have had these many engagements with different artists, have you also had times when you weren't working?
Speaker 2: When I wasn't working?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well, there have been--
Speaker 1: I mean artists often talk about the lean times.
Speaker 2: There have been lean times, but pretty much because I maintained a certain flexibility, particularly coming on the scene where a lot of different bandleaders like the way I played and liked the way I was a team player, they would call me.  As I've gone on then to become a professor at Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] and all that, and also to have my own bands, I've--you know, I've engaged different players, and I always managed to keep like a list of individuals that I feel very compatible with.  And all those names that you see on my website, those are people I've actually played with, you know, whether as a side man, as they call it, or as a leader; we've interacted together.
Speaker 1: Well, and you've done a number of recordings with different artists on Blue Note Records--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that seem to be a--
Speaker 2: That was a major jazz label at one point.
Speaker 1: Right.  And you did a lot of work with them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I also did something on Atlantic Records and Riverside Records.  I remember doing something for Riverside, too.
Speaker 1: So, the album--you know, the music making business--when you were recording and selling and working with the labels--I mean, many artists talk about the challenges of working with labels and the splits, and you know, just how, how it works for them as opposed to the label.  What was your experience in working and recording?  And did you feel that it was fair?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't have anything to do with the business part of it, you know, because we were getting union scale for the most part (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, occasionally, we would get someone who--the more you became someone being called upon, you could work above the union scale, the musicians' union scale, you know.  But it's always been a thing of interacting and leaving yourself open to be able to perform in a variety of idiomatic persuasions.  And that's always been my thing, because to me, it's all music.  That's why I say I've worked with folk singers, blues people, with mainstream jazz players, even some of the avant-garde situations.  Because it's about music and just being a part of the team, and I've enjoyed it.  I've always tried to avoid working with people who weren't at a certain level, you know.  So, I've been very fortunate in that regard.  I've had a lot of people who are frontline people, like, whether it was in the folk--like I say, like Josh White, people like this, you know, and that, that--Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry, you know.  So, they've known about me and my flexibility as a, as a musician.  And they liked the way I played, and figured that I would bring the right stuff to the circumstance.
Story_ID: 663105
Speaker 1: In 1968, you're thirty-one years old, and you start taking classes at New York University [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You're already a successful musician.  Why did you make that choice?
Speaker 2: Well, because of my early attendance at Indiana University School of Music [Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, Bloomington, Indiana], I had amassed a certain amount of credits.  And I always figured that a part of my motivation for doing that--being involved in music education rather than just a straight music degree--was because I always felt that this would give me an option for employment.  And plus I enjoyed sharing with--teaching young people and getting people--it's all under the title of audience development.  Because I always tell the young people that I work with, it doesn't matter if you don't become a professional musician, but playing a musical instrument gives you an insight of appreciating what happens with music.  My wife Magdalena [Magdalena Ridley] always told me about when she was playing the clarinet in her little school band, and stuff like that.  It was--and she, from the way she talked about it, and the buoyance in her voice, I could tell that it was really a special, special thing, to have that exposure.  And it makes you a much more well rounded individual I think, whether you become a professional, or just a supporter, or a fan.
Speaker 1: And when you went to NYU, the dean at the time, Daniel Griffiths [Daniel E. Griffiths]?  I read that he was very actively looking for minority students to create diversity in the school.  Were you recruited?
Speaker 2: At NYU?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm trying to remember how I found out about it.  I think somebody told me about it.  Oh, what happened was there was a guy--I told you about this club that I played in called the Needle's Eye [New York, New York], that was down on Little West 12th Street.  He, he worked at the school, and he was telling me that they were trying to build a program, and that I should get involved in the program, and that's how I got involved.
Speaker 1: And it was--so how long was that program?
Speaker 2: At NYU?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I did get my degree.  I guess I was there two and a half years.
Speaker 1: And so you're performing all the while?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Was it during--
Speaker 2: That was the beauty of that program that I was involved in at NYU, because it allowed me to still be active as a performer and still attend classes and get credits towards my degree.
Speaker 1: And was it during that time that you began to play with Thelonious Monk?
Speaker 2: When did I start playing with Thelonious?  Oh, my goodness.
Speaker 1: Let's see--
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Seventy [1970] to '73 [1973], I believe.  So maybe you had finished school by then.
Speaker 2: Probably so.
Speaker 1: 'Cause '68 [1968] is when you started at NYU.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, then--
Speaker 2: I think I had graduated in '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: From NYU.
Speaker 1: So, then it bridged that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 663106
Speaker 1: When you are performing with Thelonious Monk, this is at the top of his career, right?
Speaker 2: Well, he was riding the crest of--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --yeah, of his career, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so you joining his band, what was that experience like?
Speaker 2: It's like having a taste of heaven (laughter).  Thelonious Monk, oh my god, that man is such a genius.  His touch on the instrument, the individuality of his style--that's what makes him so recognized, because he has an individualist style.  He comes out of a ragtime period, of being influenced by ragtime piano players.  But he came out of that with his own approach and his own signature, which is what every jazz musician strives to do, you know.  Like Miles Davis started trying to sound like Dizzy Gillespie, and he ended up finding his own sound.  And that's, that's the whole thing, is finding your own identity.  It's very, very important.  Because when I went to the Lenox School of Jazz [Lenox, Massachusetts], the few weeks I was there I was so enamored with Percy Heath of the Modern Jazz Quartet that I grew a beard, and I was wearing ascots like he wore them.  And oh, I was, oh, I thought I was hot stuff.  And I'd be walking around, and I was even playing the bass the way that he would play the bass.  And he would bow his head, and I was even doing that, and I was stroking the strings.  He influenced me a great deal.  Ray Brown was my first influence, but then I had guys around town.  Phillip Stewart [Phillip "Flip" Stewart] was a local player in Indianapolis [Indiana] that was a great influence on me as well, and Monk Montgomery.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so you played for several years with Thelonious Monk.  Was this primarily in New York [New York]?  Were you traveling?
Speaker 2: We did some traveling, yes.  I don't remember all of the--see, we were in Europe.  I got a funny story to tell you about that Thelonious.  Where were we?  Was it--I can't remember.  I know what it is, but I'm not recalling it right now.  But we were playing in this place, we were at the shrine in this country.  And it's where all--you know, like a lot of great--
Speaker 1: Japan?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't Japan, it was in Europe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we were in this place that was the castle of this countess, or whatever she was, or something.  And they had it so that you could go in and visit and go on the different floors of this place.  It was like a brownstone, you know.  And I'm down on another floor, and Thelonious' wife, Nellie [Nellie Smith Monk], would travel with us all the time.  And so I'm on another floor, the drummer and I.  And all of a sudden, I hear Nellie scream.  And so we said, "Oh, my god.  What's going on?"  So, we rush down to the floor where they were, and there's Thelonious sitting in the queen's bed, laying in the queen's bed like he's at home, with his head on the pillow and everything (laughter).
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And Nellie's about, she's about to have a hemorrhage or something, you know.  "Thelonious, you can't do that.  Oh, oh, oh."  And so Thelonious (laughter) I said, "Thelonious, what you doing, man?  You know, this is a national shrine.  You can't be doing that."  Thelonious said to me, he says, "Oh, I just wanted to see what the bitch saw."  (Laughter) And I said, "Oh, no, Thelonious, come on man.  Get up out of that bed, man."  (Laughter) He's in the countess' bed, with all the barriers all around it and everything.  He just climbed over and just--(laughter).  And I heard Nellie screaming, and we rushed down to see what was going on.  And there's Thelonious laying up in the bed, in the queen's bed.  I said, "I'll be damn" (laughter).
Story_ID: 663107
Speaker 1: You also describe one of the things that you appreciated about Thelonious [Thelonious Monk], that he was the master of understatement.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you describe that?
Speaker 2: Whereas a lot of musicians--and speaking of him as a pianist--and it applies to certain other instruments, too--the idea of understatement, and his use of dissonance.  And he would achieve dissonance--like when you look at a piano keyboard, you got the white keys and you got the black keys.  Well, you know, like when you play like a white key and a black key at the same time, that's called a minor second intervallically, in terms of musical language, and it gives a certain kind of sound of dissonance.  He could incorporate that type of thing into his playing, and it gave him his unique approach to soloing.  And he would always--the way he would construct--he had his own way of rhythmic patterns in terms of the lyricism.  And if you listen to some of his songs, you know, he had like one song, (sings musical notes) and so forth.  That's one of his tunes, you know.  But just an interesting use of rhythm and using minor seconds.  Like I say, like if you got a white key and a black key right next to it, and you hit both of them simultaneously, that gives you the sound of a minor second.  It's a more strident tone, and it becomes more constant the wider you go with the intervals, the intervallic relationship of one note to the next.  And he had a way of utilizing that to create a very singular approach to his soloing and his use of rhythm.  He would say, (sings musical notes). And it was just very flexible in terms of how he could move the rhythms around, you know.  And that was a signature part of his trademark as a pianist.  He wasn't trying to play more lyrically or melodically, in the sense of like Red Garland or Oscar Peterson or anybody--Bud Powell, or anything.  He loved Bud Powell, though, because Bud would do some things where he would use minor seconds on the piano, too.  But Bud was--in fact, he wrote a song called 'In Walked Bud.'
Story_ID: 663108
Speaker 1: So as a, as the bass player in, when you were playing with him, since his rhythm was different from others, how do you as a bass player come in?  Because you talked about the--
Speaker 2: You have to play the time.
Speaker 1: Right, you talked about being that bridge (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So if it's in 4/4 or 3/4 or 6/8, you know, those different meters, you adjust accordingly.  So, if I'm playing (sings musical notes) I'm marking four to the bar.  And if I'm playing a waltz, (sings musical notes) then I'm building lines based around the waltz feeling.  And you know, the various tempos, from very slow--if you're playing a slow blues, you know, you got (sings musical notes) but you got to keep the sonority of the notes that you're playing, so that they link up and you have a line.  So, that's the bass line.  So then you're acting, like I say, with the harmonic instruments--the piano or guitar and the drums.  So, you're the link in that.  So, it's a team effort. Everybody has their role.
Speaker 1: And so as you're playing with different artists, Monk being one of them, you're--when you talk about flexibility, being the link, you're also finding that you're being flexible in kind of marrying your way of performing with that artist's rhythm. Is that it?
Speaker 2: And the reason why I was able to work with a lot of different piano players who came from different stylistics and parameters and approaches, was because knowing music and having been involved in music all my life, you know, I don't have a problem, you know, because there's different types of music.  Like you listen to the various even European classical composers, you know, there's a difference between the way, say, Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven] would write, or some of the more avant-garde composers.  And you have to learn how to play within the genre--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --that's being performed at any time.  And so, what I have to contribute as a part of the ensemble has to be done so that I'm a partner in the whole situation, but I have a specific role.  And if I'm not performing my role properly, then I'm, you know, I'm not taking care of business, and I won't keep the gig long, for openers (laughter).
Speaker 1: There you go.
Speaker 2: So, the idea of being very flexible, that's something I've always recognized.  And plus, I enjoy playing with people with different styles, you know.  It's, it's a challenge, because they're great players too, you know.  So, and as the bass player, you know, I'm not the one that's stating the melody out front all the time.  They're the ones that are in control--our different horn players--like playing with Hank Mobley, who's a tenor saxophonist versus [HistoryMaker] Sonny Rollins, or with John Coltrane, or on and on, you know, Ben Webster and all of these people.
Speaker 1: Did you ever work with anybody who was inflexible, or not a great collaborator?
Speaker 2: That's an interesting question.  I was playing with som- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause ego's got to be involved in here somewhere, for some people.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, a lot of the great players that I've had the pleasure of working with, there is ego, but not in that corny sense, you know, that you think of when people are just really corny, and their ego is, you know, just blown out of proportion, self-inflated type of thing.  You know, because these people are geniuses, you know what I mean?  Thelonious Monk is a genius in the style.   And his genius was in coming up with his own voice.  Sonny Rollins, the way he approaches the tenor saxophone--Ben Webster, Coleman Hawkins, they each have their own signature.  And that's what every jazz performer should be striving for, is to find your own voice.  And I always tell my students, "To thine own self be true" ['Hamlet,' William Shakespeare].  You know, you don't--we borrow a little from here and there.  Nobody's that highly unique, you know, except some of these guys that call themselves playing avant-garde, and some of them are just playing noise--be elbows, and banging, and doing all kinds of crazy stuff.  And there's an audience for that, you know, but it's a very narrow audience (laughter).
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 663109
Speaker 1: So you started teaching shortly after you got your degree [from New York University, New York, New York].  Your degree I guess was in '71 [1971], and you went shortly after that to be a professor of music at Livingston College [Piscataway, New Jersey] at Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey].
Speaker 2: When I was getting ready to graduate, I was playing at this club I mentioned before, the Needle's Eye [New York, New York].  There's a gentleman that came in, Bill White [ph.] was his name.  He worked in the administration there, and we became fast buddies.  And so I was telling him, I said, "Hey, Bill, you know, like I'm getting ready to graduate.  And I was just wondering, you know, like it would be nice if I could get something whereas I could teach, because my degree is in music education."  He said, "Yeah, well, they're opening a new college at Rutgers University called Livingston College."  Because that was during the time all the riots and things were going on, you know, and Newark [New Jersey] was on fire, you know, and across the country there was all kinds of stuff going on.  So they said, "We better do something for these--you know, before they go crazy."  (Laughter) Because there was a cry for black studies, because people like [HistoryMaker] Nikki Giovanni, Toni Cade Bambara, Nathan Heard--I mentioned Lloyd McNeill (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) [HistoryMaker] Sonia Sanchez.
Speaker 2: Sonia Sanchez, all these people.  They were brought in because Rutgers University being--it was 1966, you know, a poison Ivy League school, in their opinion, you know.  So they said, "We got to do something."  So that's when they opened up Livingston College, and all the professors that they brought in were people who represented what was, I guess the avant-garde during that particular period, you know.  And I was told about the job by my friend, Bill White, who worked in administration.  And he said, "How would you like to start a jazz program?"  I said, "You know, is fat meat greasy?  Bring it on, let's go."  And that's when I stepped in and I brought in first Ted Dunbar, a guitarist, and Kenny Barron, Freddie Waits, and subsequent others that I brought in--Frank Foster, you know, and they formed the nucleus of the jazz program.  I'm the one that started the jazz program at Rutgers University (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.  And it's a whole curriculum?
Speaker 2: Yeah, jazz degree program.
Speaker 1: Right, jazz degree program, right.  And you implemented that beginning in '72 [1972]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you stayed at Rutgers for quite some time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I was there twenty-eight years, or something along those lines.  Yeah, that was a great ride.  Sometimes I wish I had stayed.  I got--
Speaker 1: Why did you leave?
Speaker 2: I got cute and just thought, well, you know--because I was getting a lot of gigs.  I was working with the National Endowment for the Arts.  I was the national coordinator for the Jazz Artists in Schools.  I was doing all kinds of stuff like that.  I was serving on the New York State Council on the Arts jazz panel, and doing all kinds of things like that.  So I was really becoming very diversified, in addition to my performance career.  And so, that's, that's what that was all about.
Speaker 1: But during the time that you were there--I mean you were quite prolific in performance and in participating on the making of many albums.
Speaker 2: Well, that's what they wanted at Rutgers.  That's the reason why they brought in people, like I mentioned, like Nikki Giovanni and people--
Speaker 1: They wanted people who were doing their art--
Speaker 2: --who were doing something--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and who were active, and not just people who were going to sit in the ivory tower and maybe get a little pipe and act like I'm a professor.
Speaker 1: That's kind of like, the School of Visual Arts [New York, New York] is like that too.  All of the professors are working at their craft.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So that's what you were doing?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so, you--
Speaker 2: Because at first, it was just the school.  It was just like art and music.  And then when they decided they wanted to branch out and start a degree program, that's when I became the chairman of the music department, and we split.
Story_ID: 663110
Speaker 1: During your time at Rutgers [Livingston College, Piscataway, New Jersey], which you did so many things, but among them, you played as part of the Duke Ellington Orchestra.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, what, what was it like to work with the Duke [Duke Ellington]?
Speaker 2: What can I say?
Speaker 1: What was his personality like?
Speaker 2: Fantastic.  He was, he was one of the most sophisticated brothers from the hood.  He had that thing, you know.  I mean, you know, he was just a genuine man, but he was very eloquent.  He was always Mr. Ellington, you know.  And he, he was great to be around and to talk with.  And one thing I notice like when I first started playing with that band, Duke would start off with just the band playing. And then when he'd come on stage, he'd come on and make his grand entrance.  And the band would be cooking, I mean, we'd be playing, and the band was smoking.  And when he came and sat down to that piano, I swear to god, we all became an extension of his fingers as he touched that keyboard.  I mean, that was, it was a metaphysical thing that happened.  I felt, I said, "Whoa, this is a bad dude here."  And you know, we all became--and the band had its own sound, you know.  And all those great players, I mean Johnny Hodges, Harry Carney, and oh, just so many, all those great players.  I had an opportunity to play with all these heroes.  And Harry Carney, the baritone saxophonist, was one of the all time greats and was well known, he used to come through Indianapolis [Indiana].  And I found out years later that my uncle Ben [Ridley's great uncle, Ben Holliman], who was the one that started me out playing boogie woogie on the violin, Harry would always come to town and he would come and hang out with my aunt, my aunt Nancy Holliman [Nancy Holliman Johnson].  Just a little anecdote to show you some of the humorous sides of Uncle Ben.  Harry would always bring him a fifth of scotch, and he'd sit this scotch up there, and he says--and Uncle Ben looked at him and said, "Harry, you came late, but you came straight."  (Laughter) And you know, it was beautiful.  So, my aunt Nancy was one of Harry's girlfriends that he would occasionally meet and run into, you know.
Speaker 1: So, Duke--I talked to his granddaughter, [HistoryMaker] Mercedes Ellington.
Speaker 2: Mercedes uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And one of the things that she described was how strict he was.  Was that true in the band?  You just described how everybody came together with those fingers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From the musical (unclear).
Speaker 1: What were rehearsals like?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, Duke was very suave and very sophisticated.  But, you know, he had a little gangster in him too, you know.  I mean, he didn't take any stuff.  And I remember one time he got mad at one of the guys in the band, and he went off on him and he was using all kinds of, you know, colorful language and stuff like that, and even slapped him.  And I said, oh, no.  Not Mr. Ellington, my hero, you know.  And, but he was--he was smooth, smooth, one of the smoothest human beings I ever met in my life.  And he could talk to anybody, and talk on their level.  He was well versed in so many different areas, you know.  He was, he was quite a gentleman, and it was such a joy just to play around him and just talk with him, you know.  He was, he was great.  I have fond memories and a whole lot of little anecdotes that I can come up with, but I don't want to take up a lot of time.  But, you know, he was just smooth, smooth.
Speaker 1: You had mentioned working with the National Endowment for the Arts.  So, that started in 1976?
Speaker 2: Excuse me one second.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: I need to sneeze (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yup.
Story_ID: 663111
Speaker 1: I was asking you about the National Endowment for the Arts.  How did, how did it come to be that you worked with them?
Speaker 2: Well, I was on the jazz panel, and I became chairman of the jazz panel at the National Endowment for the Arts.
Speaker 1: And what was the jazz panel? What was that?
Speaker 2: The jazz panel entertained grant requests from musicians and different jazz organizations.  And they would submit proposals, just like they still do today, you know.   And they would apply for a grant for a particular project, or if there was traveling to perform at a particular venue, or helping to finance a road trip, or even performing.  They even expanded later on where even if--a lot of the classical artists, if they were going to perform in Europe, they would give them seed money so that they could match it with the promoters in the various countries.  So, it became a thing that made it so that you aren't just totally begging for a job, you know; you had something that you were offering.  And it also gave you a stamp of approval--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, that you were endorsed by the National Endowment for the Arts.
Speaker 1: And-- And Nancy Hanks, who was one of the creators of it, and Dr. Walter Anderson [Walter F. Anderson], they were mentors to me.  And I learned a lot from her.  Nancy worked for the Rockefellers, and she was a patron of the arts.
Speaker 2: And so you as the panel chair, you were responsible for identifying--for selecting who would receive awards (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.  I was the coordinator, you know, like to manage the various proposals.  And we would go around the table of the people who were brought in as panelists to adjudicate the proposals and find out if they were worthy of it.  Because, you know, some people would ask for the moon, in terms of dollars, you know.  And we had to make decisions about whether or not their project warranted the type of money that they were asking for.
Speaker 2: And what kind of money were they giving out at this time?
Speaker 1: Oh, it varied, you know.  Of course the orchestras, because they were part of the intellectual bourgeois, they were getting the lion's share of the money that was allocated by the [U.S.] Congress.  But they created a jazz panel, and Dr. Walter Anderson and Nancy Hanks were very keen on doing that; not just making it something that was, you know, high class, you know, only.  I mean, do you know what I mean when I say high class?   High society, or whatever you want to call it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  And so, what would the average grant be?
Speaker 1: Well, different people--if it was an organization, they would apply for it.  But we never would fully finance.  It was always giving a certain amount, a percentage.  And it was the panel's responsibility to determine whether or not--with what they were projecting that they wanted to do--whether or not the amount of money that we could give to them was going to enable them to do the project.
Speaker 2: Got it.
Speaker 1: Because it wasn't any--it didn't make any sense to throw money, and people not have anything.  They had to come in with some supporting sponsors to be with them, you know, whether it was a state art's council or some private industry music instrument company, or whatever, you know.
Speaker 2: I guess also the structure, the infrastructure, to make sure they could do it.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, oh yeah.  All of that was important, and that was a part of the criteria for selecting.
Story_ID: 663112
Speaker 1: And so, after serving as a panel chairman for the, for the jazz panel [for the National Endowment for the Arts], you served as national coordinator of the Jazz Artists in Schools program.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, what was that?  That's bringing it into the public schools?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  What happened was, [HistoryMaker] Billy Taylor was on the National Council for the Arts [sic. National Council on the Arts].  And of course, being a jazz musician, he was always pushing for money to be allocated to the jazz scene and discipline.  And they had the art and artists in school program, and people in various parts of the arts--whether they were graphic artists or, you know, poets, you know, or writers--they would fund people who would submit project proposals.  And the idea of the panels were to determine whether or not what they were projecting--what they wanted to do--that the amount of money that we would dispense to them would be something that would be helpful.  But they were never to be the total financier--
Speaker 1: Right. I understand (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) of whatever the project was.  They had to come in with--
Story_ID: 663113
Speaker 1: And so at, at--in 1982, you co-founded the Jazz Cultural Theatre [New York, New York].  What, what was the--this theater?
Speaker 2: There was a, there was a place on the West Side [New York, New York].  What street was that?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  28th [Street].
Speaker 2: Right, 8th Avenue between 28th and 29th [Street].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right?
Speaker 1: And it was an open place.  And Barry Harris, a great pianist and I, we decided we wanted to--because some of the club scene, you know, having to deal with some of the club owners, and this, that and the other--we wanted to have a place.  And Barry was also conducting workshops to teach aspiring jazz musicians and artists too.  And we wanted a place where we could do a combination of presenting performances as well as having the ability to teach.  And so, it had a dual function.  And we had a kitchen there, too.  And so, people would come in--when they'd come in to hear the music, you know, we had a cook in the kitchen.  And in fact, that's where I met the love of my life.  One of my partners, he's like a big brother to me.  He's not a musician, but he's been a jazz promoter, and he's promoted all sorts of performances and things at different venues around New York [New York] and Queens [New York], you know, covering the Queens and Bronx [New York] and Manhattan [New York] areas.  Jim Harrison is his name, and he's been like a big brother to me.  And his wife was a co-worker with Magdalena [Ridley's wife, Magdalena Ridley], and so Magdalena told me the story that--well, when Magdalena came in, she came by herself; her friend hadn't shown up yet, Cornelia [Cornelia Harrison].  And so when she walked in, I was on the bandstand.  We were getting prepared to start performing, and the lights were kind of low.  And so when she walked in I said, "Oh, it would be so nice to have such a lovely lady perform for us."  And she kind of gave me a little old look, who is this fresh dude, or whatever.  And she went and had a seat.  And so, when Jim's wife Cornelia came in, her co-worker--Magdalena told me the story.  She said Cornelia said to her, she said, "Do you see that guy up there on the bass?  That's the guy I want to introduce you to."  She said, "I want you to meet him."  She said, "I've had the pleasure of meeting that fresh guy, you know.  He spoke to me, you know, when I came in."  And we met, and hey (singing), "I'm in heaven with an angel," (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Very good.
Speaker 1: I married an angel.  She's wonderful.  I can't say enough about Magdalena.
Speaker 2: And when did you get married?
Speaker 1: Where did we get married?
Speaker 2: When?
Speaker 1: Oh, when?  Okay, I don't remember.  Seems like we've been together for eternity.
Speaker 2: Well, it was when you had that business, right?  So, what year?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Well, I knew him for seven years, but then we didn't get married until '89 [1989].
Speaker 2: Got it, okay.
Story_ID: 663114
Speaker 1: And so, teaching has remained an important part of your career, even as you have always been performing and recording.  There are many recordings, but also your giveback, your teaching.  And in 1991, you became professor of jazz bass at the Manhattan School of Music [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: I was there part-time.
Speaker 1: So, you're part-time there.  And what else were you doing at that time?
Speaker 2: I was still at Rutgers [Livingston College, Piscataway, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were able to do--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the gentleman that was in the start of the jazz program there, I knew him.  I met him and he contacted me and asked me would I be interested in teaching there, teaching jazz bass, because he was starting a jazz program.
Speaker 1: Got it.
Speaker 2: So I became the jazz bass instructor there on a part-time basis, you know.  But I had several students, so it ended up being a nice little thing.  And through the years, it grew in terms of the pay structure (laughter).
Speaker 1: Very good (laughter).  That's always important.  And you continued your education, too.  You went to Empire State College [SUNY Empire State College, Saratoga Springs, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's where I went to complete my degree that I had started at Indiana University [Indiana University School of Music; Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, Bloomington, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Because I didn't graduate from Indiana University, but I transferred all my credits to NYU [New York University, New York, New York].  And then as I was coming out, I was--
Speaker 1: So, you didn't finish at NYU?  You did finish at NYU?
Speaker 2: Yes, I finished at NYU.
Speaker 1: Right, but this is another degree.  This is a master's [degree]?  You got a master's, right, a master's in arts and cultural policy from Empire State?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: An additional degree after NYU?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, you'd been teaching for quite some time at Rutgers, and then you decide to go back for your master's.  What is this degree doing for you in terms of your career as an educator?
Speaker 2: Well, it's enabled me to do a lot of things.  I became very much involved with what started out as being the--well, building the jazz faculty there at Rutgers, and coming up with a jazz undergraduate degree program on the bachelor's level.  But I started going to the various jazz education conferences and getting involved with them.  And I was also, like I mentioned about the national coordinator of the Jazz Artists in Schools program--I had, I was getting all these ties with education.  And I started, you know, going--I had been to several states where we had the Jazz Artists in Schools program.  And I would go as the national coordinator, and I would have an annual workshop whereas the people that were artists--and the idea was engaging artists, not someone that necessarily had gone through and gotten their degree in jazz or in music, but offering another splinter in being employed as a musician.  And that turned out really nice, really, really, nice.  And we used to have annual conferences where we'd bring the artists in, and we'd talk about techniques about how to conduct their workshops and how to relate to students, because they were mainly artists.  They didn't take education courses to get a degree in college in order (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you were teaching them.
Speaker 2: --to get a teacher's license, yeah.  So, that was a part of giving them those kinds of skills.
Story_ID: 663115
Speaker 1: In '93 [1993], you become a jazz artist-in-residence at the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, what--I didn't realize that they had an artist-in-residence program there.
Speaker 2: Well, I became the artist-in-residence because I was there and I started teaching courses in the education program there.  And a young man [Wynton Marsalis] that I'm very proud of--I've known him since he was a kid and I know his family--in fact, I played in New Orleans [Louisiana] and I met his mother and father.  And we'd have breakfast over there, and his mother would cook us some eggs and bacon for myself and the drummers, Lenny McBrowne and them.  And so, I knew Wynton's father [HistoryMaker Ellis Marsalis, Jr.] and mother [Dolores Ferdinand Marsalis].  And when he came to New York [New York], he and his brother, you know, I'd sort of keep my eye on him, because his mother--their mother called me and said, "Larry [HistoryMaker Larry Ridley], I'm worried.  They're going to be there in New York.  Would you just kind of keep an eye out, open for them, and let me know what's happening, you know?"  I said, "Of course, I'll do that, you know.  I won't let them run wild."  (Laughter) But they're nice guys, that whole family, the Marsalis family.  They're really very talented, and achievers.  Because their father teaches in the performing arts high school [New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, New Orleans, Louisiana] there, and he turned out a lot of talent there; [HistoryMaker] Terence Blanchard, another great trumpet player out of there--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --and numerous other players.  They all came to his program there in New Orleans.
Speaker 1: In '98 [1998], you were inducted into the International Association for Jazz Educators hall of fame [sic. International Association of Jazz Educators; International Association for Jazz Education].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: This is after many, many, years of teaching, in addition to performing.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah, that was nice.  Because, like I say, I was very much involved with the organization.  And they decided that they, you know, because of my credentials and what have you, they felt that they wanted--they started a jazz hall of fame, and they inducted me.
Speaker 1: Wonderful.
Speaker 2: And in that particular year, I was inducted into the hall of fame there.
Speaker 1: And the next year, you retire from Rutgers [Livingston College, Piscataway, New Jersey].
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, which I, in hindsight I often lament, but it's a done deal.  Because there were a lot of people that were on faculties that maintained their faculty.  Because I had tenure, and I was always telling people, "Don't give up your tenure.  Don't give up your tenure."  And like a D-A- fool, I gave up my tenure, and I could have kept doing that, you know.  Because I brought in people like Kenny Barron and Ted Dunbar.  And Kenny was going off doing his stuff and still stayed on the faculty.  And I thought, okay, I can come out and I'll be able to do this, that, and the other, you know.  I don't know.  I got carried away for some reason or another, but I should have just stayed there.  But, would a, could a, should a, you know.  It's a done deal.

Speaker 1: You, in 2001, you became executive director of the African American Jazz Caucus.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What is--was that?
Speaker 2: Well, the National Association of Jazz Educators [sic.] was an organization that was started.  And then all of the people of African American descent, you know, would come to the conferences.  And I felt it was important to start an organization so that we could discuss some of the things that they would be experiencing by being involved at various institutions, whether they were, you know, multicultural institutions or even black colleges [HBCUs].  And the idea was to start a program to utilize some of the musicians that were fine instrumentalists, but who did not want to opt to go to New York [New York] or go to Los Angeles [California] to make a career for themselves as a performer or whatever, or working in the recording studios or whatever.  So, you look and there's a multitude of talent out there that people--you know, they were just happy to be at home.  And they were fine players, I mean really fine players.  So then when they started talking about this, Charles Reinhart [Charles L. Reinhart], who was the head of the--he was the national coordinator of the dance program--he approached me and took me under his wing and brought me in to be a part of the American Dance Festival.  And we would have jazz musicians to come in and accompany dancers, and also do performances.  So, he was like a mentor to me.  I'll never forget, he was like a big brother to me.  Charles Reinhart, a really great dude.
Speaker 1: The education bug.  Now you get a doctorate, doctor of performing arts, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: At the University of Maryland Eastern Shore [Princess Anne, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, did you go there?
Speaker 2: No, it's an honorary degree.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: Beautiful.
Speaker 2: Yeah, from that institution.  And there was a gentleman on the faculty there that was responsible.  He was teaching jazz, and he brought me in to do clinics.  And he put forward my name, and that's how--
Speaker 1: Very nice.
Speaker 2: --I became Dr. Larry Ridley [HistoryMaker Larry Ridley] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Excellent. And you continued to work with the IAJE.  What does that stand for (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The International Association of Jazz Education [sic. International Association for Jazz Education].
Speaker 1: At a point in 2011, you began lecturing at Jazz at Lincoln Center [New York, New York], right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 663117
Speaker 1: So, your--I'd like for you to just talk a little bit about the importance of education in your career as a musician, because it's been integral for most of your career.
Speaker 2: Well, one of the key things that's important about all of that--and this is something that I guess I got a bug or putting it as a part of my modus operandi--was understanding how important it is to maintain the various disciplines in the arts.  And in order to do that, one of the best ways--you know, like people didn't go through teacher education programs in the arts.  But using artists to come in as professionals to share with the resident instructors some of the things that they learned by being professional performers, and to make it sort of a living entity as opposed to something that you just talk about that's over there, you know, or whatever--and so, the idea was marrying the performing artists.  That was the whole thing about the Artists in Schools program [Jazz Artists in Schools] at the National Endowment for the Arts--was bringing in people who were doing that as a vocation, you know.  I participated in that, and we had a number of artists from various states that would come, and we'd have an annual thing and I would do it as a part of the American Dance Festival with my friend, Charles Reinhart [Charles L. Reinhart].  And we would have a simultaneous thing going on where we would be having workshops, and getting the artists to understand the techniques that they would have to employ in working in the schools and working with young people like that.  And it was a very successful program.  And the gentleman that was--Nancy Hanks was the one that was responsible for that whole thing with the National Endowment for the Arts.  And Dr. Walter Anderson [Walter F. Anderson] was the one that was in charge of the music program, classical as well as jazz and folk art, and all of that.
Story_ID: 663118
Speaker 1: And you had mentioned to me about your friendship with Representative Conyers [HistoryMaker John Conyers, Jr.].  And he was instrumental in getting a bill passed to make--just tell me what that bill was.
Speaker 2: H.R. 57 [H.Con.Res.57].  Because we would talk all the time, and he was always, he's always been the one among his congressional colleagues that would be bringing in jazz artists to do things.  And when they started the Congressional Black Caucus thing, he's the one that made sure--because some of our brothers and sisters involved with the Black Caucus, you know, they were interested more in some other kinds of stuff, you know.  But he was, he was determined that he was going to have jazz as a part of this, too.  And so I would, you know, I started the whole thing with bringing in artists, and we would have artist training workshops to get them to understand.  And we interacted with Charles Reinhart [Charles L. Reinhart] from the American Dance Festival and Linda Buki [Linda Constant Buki], who was with folk art; she was the national coordinator.  And they would share techniques about how it was for an artist to go in--because you weren't supposed to overshadow or supplant the resident teachers who had gone for teaching degrees, and were the resident people.  They were to be an adjunct, working with--to bring in their life experiences and what they were dealing with as a vocation to get the young people to understand, "Okay, if you want to become a painter, an artist, or a dancer, or musician, or a jazz player, or whatever, these are some of the things that, you know, you would have to"--
Speaker 1: And what was the--what did the H.R. 57 say?  What did it--?
Speaker 2: It recognized jazz as America's national treasure and art form through the African American experience.
Speaker 1: And this is in 1980 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And it has gone and traveled throughout the world, becoming an international culture.
Speaker 1: And this happened in 1987?
Speaker 2: Is that when it was?  I forget what year it was.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I've been doing so much through the years (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What--
Story_ID: 663119
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What, what are you doing now?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm trying to be a good husband [to Magdalena Ridley] (laughter) in addition to trying to perform.  I'm still teaching part-time at the Manhattan School of Music [New York, New York].  And I'm working on trying to establish an outreach program from the Rutgers Institute for Jazz Studies [sic. Institute of Jazz Studies, Newark, New Jersey].  Marshall Stearns [Marshall W. Stearns], who is a jazz scholar, and I mentioned him earlier, he left his archives to Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey], and it's a body of material that's outstanding.  And what I've been seeking to do is to set up a program across the country working in various schools to have jazz artists-in-residence, and to give, make up materials for them to utilize to talk about jazz as the art form that it is.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And we've got some really outstanding people that have gone through the program.  Unfortunately, some of the artists school programs, when new people came in to the endowment [National Endowment for the Arts], they kind of cut back on the program. Unfortunately, you know, there was that period, I'm sure you're aware of, a lot of stuff happened with the arts and other areas that the government had stepped into, had become involved in.
Speaker 1: So at the moment, there's less money than at other points in your career?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And also, part of what I was doing was approaching instrument companies trying to get them to be involved, because that's their marketplace, you know.  And you know, the different companies like Yamaha [Yamaha Corporation] and different ones, I approached them.  In fact, I ended up--I'm a Yamaha artist, and I have an electric bass guitar that they gave me for endorsing the instrument.  And it's, it's been, it's been good, you know.  There's still been a lot of cutbacks recently with the arts, and I'm a little disappointed in what's happened and what is happening.  But you got to have somebody in [U.S.] Congress that's really sensitive to that.  And Conyers [HistoryMaker John Conyers, Jr.], the reason why he was able to do so much was because Bobby Scott from Virginia and Mel Watts [sic. HistoryMaker Melvin L. Watt], who's now head of--it's one of those agencies of the federal government [Federal Housing Finance Agency].  He took on that particular role.  But he was very much involved as a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and they all went on to piggyback and go into other areas.  And I still have a lot of connection with Congressman Conyers, because every year as a part of the Congressional Black Caucus, we get together.  And he always has a jazz concert, and we have like a workshop.  And--
Speaker 1: That's great.
Speaker 2: --things like that, yeah.
Story_ID: 663120
Speaker 1: So as you look at your very full career, what do you hope that your legacy is?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy, I never really thought of it from that perspective, and I don't think about it from that perspective.  I'm just driven by the fact that I feel so strongly about the art form, that it's given me so much, that I want to see that--and it is America's national treasure.  And being in that resolution [H.Con.Res.57] that has given congressional approval of recognition, I think it's important to work as much as I can with various arts organizations across the country and state art agencies, and try to do what I can to make sure that jazz is inclusive within whatever curricula they design.  So, it's, it's a job.  And it's, you know, it's got its up and downs, you know.  Because unfortunately, as I'm sure you're aware of, school systems across the country have suffered severe cuts, and the arts in particular have been given a short shrift on a lot of stuff, which is a shame.  Because can you imagine a world without art and music?
Speaker 1: Nope I don't want to (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That doesn't even make any sense.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, whether you're a poet or a playwright or, you know, an actor or actress, or a musician--the arts are very much a part of our lives, you know.  And I can't, I just can't imagine that.  But there's some people that are in certain levels of the meritocracy, or whatever, of the American system that feel that the arts are superfluous, unfortunately.  I don't, I still don't understand that.  Yet and still, they got their little stuff that they like, whether it's country western or whatever, you know.  So, come on, give me a break, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Let me ask you.  When you--another look back at your life.  Is there any--do you have any regrets?
Speaker 2: Well, I mentioned a little earlier in our conversation, the only regret that I lament to a certain degree--but I've gotten over it, you know.  I wish I had stayed at Rutgers [Livingston College, Piscataway, New Jersey] and still had gone out doing my traveling.  Because it was a nice--and I was tenured--and it was a nice nest egg, you know, whatever.  I would get through my performing, and doing these other things was always like gravy on the steak (laughter).
Speaker 1: You miss the gravy (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, I miss the steak that I could put the gravy on (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, there you go (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 663121
Speaker 1: What advice do you have for young people, in particular young African Americans, who might want to follow in your footsteps?
Speaker 2: Get to know the full range of what the African American experience is all about, you know, like when all of the Civil Rights Movement and things started happening.  You know, I mean, people like, that had gotten involved in the Civil Rights Movement, a lot of them didn't realize how involved Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was.  You know, he was very much involved, he was a jazz fan.  He used to come around to the clubs.  And Cannonball Adderley and his brother [Nat Adderley] and various other musicians would hang out with him and would play various fundraisers for him.  And he loved jazz, and you know, it's got to be something that people don't forget, that the arts are very important.  Yeah, we need physics and all the other things, but I can't imagine a world without art and music.  It just wouldn't--
Story_ID: 663122
Speaker 1: Is there anything you'd like to share that I have not asked?
Speaker 2: Keep swinging.  Keep on swinging.  And know your history.  Get involved in history.  Don't just go for the status quo of what you think, and don't go for the easy stuff, you know.  Because I've watched some of the things that's going on now, even with television (unclear).  And I watch some of the shows that are geared more to our community, the African American community, and some of it is stupid, as far as I'm concerned, you know.  And they did--Bob Johnson [Robert L. Johnson] at, you know--
Speaker 1: BET [Black Entertainment Television]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, BET.  He started BET Jazz [BET on Jazz; BET J], and I was involved with that for a minute.  But then something happened when he and his wife [HistoryMaker Sheila C. Johnson] got divorced, and she got a lot of the money (laughter).  Things changed, you know, and he kind of just dropped out on continuing to--.  Plus there was another Bob Johnson [Robert E. Johnson] that worked for him at Ebony [sic. Jet] magazine who was a jazz fan, and he and Duke Ellington were tight.  And so he was always keeping that in the mix at Ebony magazine, and what they were doing, you know.  But I just would like to see a return to that.  I was hoping that--I never had the opportunity like to really--I got a chance to shake hands with Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] when he first was running for president.  And I played--I got a call, and I played a fundraiser for him up in Harlem [New York, New York].  And I had a chance to shake his hand, and I was really impressed with the guy, you know.  And I'm just, I'm just an Obama fan.  I mean, he's so intelligent and he's so even keeled, you know.  And, you know, his way of even letting you know, "Don't mess with the brother," you know.  (Laughter) He'll let you know, but he's got such a smooth way of doing it.  And he is, to me he's one of the greatest presidents that's ever held that office.  And to know that he's a fan of the arts, that makes me feel good.  I wish that things had been a little different in terms of him leaving a bigger legacy, and reopening up a lot of what was happening with the National Endowment for the Arts.  But, you know, there's an element in the [U.S.] Congress that--you know.  I guess in certain circles they could be called knuckleheads, you know.  But they don't think that the arts are that important, but without the arts, what would life be, you know?  And so, I'm always trying to encourage people who are in positions to give back to the community, and make sure that the arts and sciences are given an equal footing, you know.  Because I can't imagine a physicist--and I know people who are physicists and stuff like that that love jazz, and that's what they do in their off time.  And they've got bigger collections than I've got, you know.  And that's how they get their thing.  But, you know, they might be physicists and stuff like that, but they got some--they got a whole big jazz collection, and they love the range of the music.  And that's always been nice, to run into people like that, you know.  And--
Speaker 1: Well, I thank you, thank you for sharing your story.  It's been wonderful.
Speaker 2: Well, thank you for inviting me.
Speaker 1: You are most welcome.
Speaker 2: And it's my pleasure.  And you're a wonderful hostess and interviewer--
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: --I'll say that.
