Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask you what I call five People magazine-ish type questions, okay?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: What about food?  What do you like to eat?  What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy, there are so many choices, as far as favorite foods are concerned, but I think probably an, an old fashioned Thanksgiving dinner with the turkey, and the homemade stuffing, and ham.  That, that kind of does it for me.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Typically the fall, just as the leaves are turning, and that's always been one of my favorites.
Speaker 1: When going on vacation, what's your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, there are a couple.  I actually like Cabo San Lucas [Mexico].  And this may not seem like a normal vacation destination, but because my family enjoys it so much, we go back to where I was raised, which is New York City [New York, New York].  And we do all of the touristy things in New York, some of which I didn't get to do as a child growing up there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have a favorite phrase?
Speaker 2: Actually, I have a couple.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Probably one that I try to use in business more so than anywhere else is that, the more you sweat during times of peace, the less you bleed during times of war.  And that's, that's a preparation saying, if you will.  It's something that keeps you focused on doing what you can, when you can.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's the first time I've heard that one.
Story_ID: 565068
Speaker 1: I want to begin by talking about your family.  Tell me your mother's name.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Bettye Williams [Bettye Belton Williams].
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was actually born in Bessemer, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Do you know when?
Speaker 2: I do, but I can't say on this tape, or she would kill me.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter), all right.  Now, how far back in your family lineage can you go on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Her mother and father and her grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me her grandfather's name.
Speaker 2: Her grandfather's name was Tal Belton, T-A-L.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the next generation down?
Speaker 2: Her mother and father.  Her mother was Rebecca Belton, and her father was James Belton [James Belton, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Did you know your great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: I did not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Knew both of them and spent some of the, the best years of my life with them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Where did they live?
Speaker 2: In Bessemer, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me about your relationship with your grandparents.
Speaker 2: I, I think it was at one point like a lot of relationships are with children and their grandparents.  They, they spoiled me and tried to take care of me and make sure that I had not only what I needed but also what I wanted.  And then it was also very different, because for a long time I lived with my grandparents while my mother was continuing her education.  After she got out of college [Miles College, Fairfield, Alabama] and after she'd started working, she and my father [Clifford Brown] had separated.  So both my mother and I were living with my grandparents for a while.  And my mother had gone back to school during that time period to work on her graduate degrees [at Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  So, as much as it was a regular relationship with grandparents, at some level it was even more than that.  So I've always been very close to both of them, and even though they're both deceased now, they're not gone as far as I'm concerned.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about some of the times with your grandmother and grandfather.
Speaker 2: Oh, the, the, the stories are too many to tell.  Living in Bessemer, Alabama, my grandfather was probably one of the most well known people in the town and sold things.  He worked in the mines there in Birmingham, Alabama, but was always an entrepreneur on his own.  So I got a chance to watch my grandfather interact with people and do business with people even as a very, very little boy.  And if you stop and think back as to when this was--you're talking about the late '50s [1950s], early '60s [1960s], prejudice was rampant in the country and certainly in Alabama at that time.  And yet, I saw my grandfather maintain his dignity even when it was very, very hard to do so.  I always had this memory of--my, my grandfather used to raise animals in addition to planting his own food and, and things of that nature.  And we would go to the feed store, and that was actually the name of the store in bustling downtown Bessemer, Alabama, and there were always some men there.  And I have this memory of these men dressed in overalls and/or khaki pants with suspenders and a t-shirt underneath and straw hats.  And several black people would not look them in the eye when they would go to shop and, and buy feed or seeds to plant with from them.  But I always noticed that with my grandfather it was very different.  You, you used to have to back your truck up to this platform so that they could help you to load your stuff onto the back of the truck.  And they always used to speak to my grandfather and act like they were very happy to see him, and I noticed that they didn't do that with other black people.  And I wondered what the difference was.  I probably was six or seven years old.  But my grandfather used to always say that you have to make people respect you, and they did; they respected him.  They talked to him even though clearly prejudice was rampant.  They talked to him as an equal, and he expected to be treated so.  So very early on in my life I got a chance to see that you didn't have to do things the way everybody else was doing things, and I attribute a lot of that to my grandfather.
Speaker 1: How much education did your grandfather have?
Speaker 2: Fourth grade at best.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did he own the land that they lived on?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.
Speaker 1: Do you know how he acquired the land?
Speaker 2: Just through flat out hard work and, and purchasing it.
Speaker 1: He purchased it.
Speaker 2: He did.
Story_ID: 565069
Speaker 1: Was there any stories about any of your ancestors being in slavery?
Speaker 2: Well, not direct stories.  You know, you, you hear stuff sitting around after people think you're supposed to be asleep when you're a child.  But as far as being direct descendants of slaves, that was never anything that, that I heard as a child--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --or was told about.  All of the stories going back to great-grandparents and great-great-grandparents were of, of free working people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, tell me about your [maternal] grandmother [Rebecca Belton].
Speaker 2: Ah, a, a woman of strength.  My grandmother was one of the strongest people that I've ever met or ever been around.  My grandmother grew up in Chicago [Illinois].  Her parents died very early, and I think she probably matured before her time, raised by aunts and some of her older siblings.  But my grandmother was truly the, the patriarch [sic.] of the family.  She was a piece of work.  And you had to have your act together when you got in front of my grandmother.  A very independent woman, very, very smart woman; went back to school to get her high school diploma in Bessemer, Alabama, as a much older woman; learned to drive when a lot of women then, the only place they could go somewhere was on the bus or if they got somebody to take them.  My, my grandmother went out and got her license.  And much later in her life, she moved New York City [New York, New York] and became a practicing nurse in New York City.  So this was a woman that didn't sit on her hands and was not somebody that was willing to just kind of go with the flow.  She always did things a little bit differently from other people.
Speaker 1: Do you have a story to share about her be- you know, your personal interaction?
Speaker 2: Probably the, the, the thing that is, is most poignant to me with my grandmother was, because of the type of person that she was, I never saw my grandmother be afraid of anyone or anything for that matter.  And yet, when I was in that five or six year old range and we had gone shopping in Birmingham [Alabama], and this is when things were still very segregated; counters were segregated--and I was hungry, and I was, as most little kids would be at that point, I was kind of antsy about it.  And I couldn't wait to get home, and I said, "Why can't we have something here?"  And there was a lunch counter, and she said, "Okay, I'll, I'll buy you a sandwich."  And I went and sat at the lunch counter, and I noticed that the waitresses were just walking right by me.  Well, I was, I was sitting in the white only section, and I didn't know it.  And the people behind the counter had started to talk and to murmur.  And I think they were going to get the manager or the boss or whoever because this black kid was sitting in the white only section.  And just before they could come to confront me, my grandmother, who had been, you know, not shopping but who had been kind of window shopping, looking at some other things, she saw me, and she came over, and I remember the expression on her face.  And it was the only time I had ever really seen my grandmother show the semblance of fear, if you will.  And she wasn't afraid for herself; she was afraid for me.  And she got me down off that stool, and she said, "You can't sit there, not now."  And later, when we got in the car, she explained it to me.
Speaker 1: What were your thoughts when she was explaining to you about the segregated lunch counter?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, naturally it was the kind of thing that as a, a five or six year old, I didn't fully comprehend it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Comprehend it.
Speaker 2: You know, naturally, also, being home and being around all different types of people, I saw that things were not fair, but I didn't understand why they weren't fair.  And I remember talking to my grandmother about the money.  And I said, "Well, is it because they thought we weren't gonna pay?  I mean, because I know you have money.  I've seen your money."  You know, I would tell my grandmother, "I've seen your money in your, in your pocketbook, so I know you were gonna pay.  Is that why they didn't want me there?"  And she said, "No, that's not it."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she did her best to try to explain it to me. But I, I remember that I was, I was puzzled then because I thought at the end of the day they were there to make money, and why wouldn't they want to make money if we were going to pay?  But she did her best to explain it to me.
Story_ID: 565070
Speaker 1: Your mother [Bettye Belton Williams], did she share any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Quite a few.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother grew up there in Bessemer, Alabama, with her brother, James Belton, Jr.  My mother was the older of the two, and just in the different things that the family had to do to survive and yet, at the same time, maintain their dignity.  I always remember my mother talking about when she got ready to go away to college.  And there was this belief that you couldn't be doing well and then still retain your job, because the bosses and the supervisors were looking for people that they could control.  And my grandfather [James Belton, Sr.], who was working in the mines [in Birmingham, Alabama] at the time, would not tell people that his daughter was going to college.  As proud as he was of it, he didn't want it to get back to them, because then he wouldn't be allowed to work the overtime.  And this was a very, very difficult situation to deal with, because can you imagine being that proud of your child and not being able to talk about it for fear of retribution on the job itself?  And that was one of the things my mother always talked about and that after she graduated and got her first job, one of my grandfather's supervisors actually came by our home.  I think his car broke down or something nearby, and that was when he told it.
Speaker 1: What's--what college did your mother go to?
Speaker 2: She went to Miles [Miles College, Fairfield, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what did she major in?
Speaker 2: Well, then, it was primary education.  And my mother ultimately became a teacher in the New York City public school system [New York, New York].
Story_ID: 565071
Speaker 1: Your father, tell me your father's name.
Speaker 2: Clifford Brown.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was also born in Alabama, in Brighton, Alabama.
Speaker 1: And do you know his date of birth?
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: And you won't tell it either?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, all right.  And his parents?
Speaker 2: Leola Brown and Otis Brown.
Speaker 1: Did you have a relationship with your grandparents?
Speaker 2: With my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandfather was deceased, so I did not know him.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, tell me about your relationship with your grandmother.
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.  Some of those are stories that I'm not necessarily proud of because she spoiled me as much, if not more, than anybody in my life.  There's a, a family story about me spending time there with her, and she was so glad to have me around that she would let me do anything.  And my mother [Bettye Belton Williams] always used to say that, that she would let me get away with murder.  That my mother came to pick me up one time, and I actually had dirt in the bed, in my grandmother's bed.  And my mother asked her, "What, what happened?  How did that happen?"  And she said, well, that I had brought it in and put it in the bed.  And she said, "Well, why did you let him do that?"  And she said, "Well, he has to play; let him play."  So, my grandmother, the, the stories are just endless about things that my grandmother on my father's side allowed me to do as a very young child.  My father always thought that that was really something special because he thought that his mother, my grandmother, was very hard on him.  And he said all that stuff that I got away with, that, that he would have never lived to become my father if he had done any of that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  Now, your grandmother, did she also own the land in which she lived on?
Speaker 2: No, unfortunately, she didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And again, I think that was another sign of the times.  At that point, after my grandfather was deceased, she was, you know, working trying to raise her sons, and she was renting a, a home there.
Speaker 1: And what type of work did she do?
Speaker 2: Domestic work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you know about her education?
Speaker 2: We never actually talked about it, but I kind of overheard my father and my uncles talking about the fact that she just barely did make it to high school.
Story_ID: 565072
Speaker 1: Now, tell me whether your father [Clifford Brown] shared any stories about his growing up in Alabama (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Boy, did he, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A lot of the things, being poor, being there in the South, and just how difficult it was for her to try to raise three sons, my father and his two brothers, on her meager income and make sure that they all had clothes to wear.  And my father used to say that you would never see him in a pair of jeans as an adult because he had to wear jeans every day as a child.  That was all that he had.  And he told the story about one time they went (air quotes) swimming in the creek, if you will, and some of the residue from the creek had gotten on his jeans.  So even though he was dried out by the time he go home, the residue was on his jeans.  And he remembered that being one of the biggest whippings that he ever got because, of course, his initial impulse was to lie and tell his mother [Leola Brown] that he hadn't been swimming in the creek when, of course, that was a taboo, and he knew he wasn't supposed to do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any other stories about his growing up there?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that the, the biggest thing that he talked about was just the, the schooling and, and the lack of the school having the resources to really teach them.  He, my father, was very smart with numbers and didn't really have anything except old, antiquated books.  But he always did say that he had very good teachers and that those teachers were the only thing that saved them because they didn't have anything else.  A lot of times they would come in the school, and there weren't enough books for each student.  So people had to share books if there was, and the books that, that they were sharing were old, outdated, antiquated books.
Speaker 1: How much education did your father receive?
Speaker 2: He went through high school.
Story_ID: 565073
Speaker 1: And what did he--what was his occupation?
Speaker 2: My father [Clifford Brown] was one of the first blacks to ever play on the PGA Tour [Professional Golfers' Association].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Well, it was during a time period where you weren't making Tiger Woods money, that's for sure.  A lot of the purses were significantly smaller then.  He started late.  He got his love for golf as a caddy there in Alabama.  And naturally, after he'd finished caddying he'd stay out on the course and hit the ball a little while.  And it got to a point where people saw that he could really hit a golf ball, and actually got to play with some of the, the white men that were members of the club there in Alabama, and did very well.  And the rest, as they say, is, is history.  But it was a tough history because of a series of things that happened, based on how difficult it was to, to fit in.  Golf at the time was your quintessential white man's game.  And for my father, to be able to do it and do it well, there were a lot of hardships, not the least of which was when he would go to play in a tournament, he wasn't allowed to stay in any of the hotels.  So, there were times when my father would go to a tournament and have to sleep in his car and have to shave at, in the restroom of a gas station and then go out and play against Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer and Lee Trevino.
Speaker 1: So those were some of the golfers that he played against?
Speaker 2: And beat, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What year are we talking about?  What years?
Speaker 2: Early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Early '60s [1960s], okay.
Speaker 2: There's a, a tremendous story that my father told me about a tournament that he was playing in, in Tennessee.  And whether you're aware of this, but they, they feed all of the, the PGA.  The card carrying PGA pros get to go into the clubhouse and eat, and you know, they always put on these big spreads, these extravagant meals for them.  And they wouldn't allow my father in the clubhouse.  And only one golfer stood up for him and said, "If you don't let him in, I won't come in either, and I'll protest this."  And ironically, it was Gary Player from South Africa.
Speaker 1: Very interesting.
Story_ID: 565074
Speaker 1: Tell me about your relationship, your personal relationship with your father [Clifford Brown].
Speaker 2: Well, it was, it was a segmented relationship, because there was a period of my life where, because my parents were divorced, my father was not around.  So my very young years I was around my father, and then there was a gap where a lot of my life was spent without me being around him.  And ultimately, I was in my early twenties before my father and I got back together.  And I remember, as a child, always wanting to be around my father.  And you know, other kids would say, "My dad's taking me to this," or, "My dad's taking me to that."  And my mother [Bettye Belton Williams] never let me want for anything, so I was always taken to those things, but I was taken by my mother.  And I remember pretty distinctly there was supposed to be a, a sack race, where--a three legged sack race, and it was with the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America], and the person that raced with me was my mother.  And some of the other kids wanted to tease me because my dad wasn't there, and I remember initially feeling hurt by that.  But then once my mother and I got those legs in that sack and got into that race, I didn't care about it anymore, and I realized how fortunate I was to have my mother there with me.
Story_ID: 565075
Speaker 1: Was, is there a story about how your mother [Bettye Belton Williams] and father [Clifford Brown] met?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy, is there.  They met at a football game there in Alabama.  And he walked her home that night, because the buses had stopped running, so he walked her home.  And then when it was time for him to try to go home, all the buses had stopped, so he had to walk from our home, where he escorted my mother, all the way to Brighton, Alabama.  And he talked about that up until the day that he died, about how, how he must have really been crazy about my mother because he knew that the buses had stopped running or would have stopped running by the time he had taken her home, but he did it anyway.  And one of my mother's lifelong friends, who is, she's still friends with today, talked about that because she was walking with them.  So he had these two ladies with him, and he was infatuated with my mother to the point that he didn't even care that he was gonna have about a three hour walk, in the dark, at night, after he got my mother home.
Speaker 1: Okay. So they married in Alabama?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 565076
Speaker 1: And when did you move to New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: I was in the third grade.  And my mother [Bettye Belton Williams] had remarried, and started teaching in New York City--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and decided to send for me.  I was living with my [maternal] grandparents [Rebecca Belton and James Belton, Sr.] at the time.  And once my mother remarried and realized that the, the opportunities for her to do well and for us to do well as a family were not going to take place in Bessemer, Alabama, that was the beginning of, of, of how our family really started to make some, what I would refer to as, some, some real progress.  And my mother ultimately moved up the line in the New York public school systems, became a princil- principal, became a counselor, and ultimately retired from the New York public school system.
Story_ID: 565077
Speaker 1: I want to step back, because you were born in Cleveland, Ohio, so your mother [Bettye Belton Williams] and father [Clifford Brown] married.  And tell me what you know about the move to Cleveland.
Speaker 2: Well, I think it all, as most moves in those times were about, it was about opportunity.  And my father's golf career was budding at that time, and he got somebody to sponsor him to play golf, and that was in Cleveland.  Now, it also helped that my mother's brother [James Belton, Jr.] had moved to Cleveland earlier and had started his family and his life there in Cleveland.  So there was kind of a dual attraction: one, her husband was gonna be able to do what he really wanted to do, and the opportunities to do it were better for him in Cleveland than they were in Bessemer, Alabama; and it didn't hurt that her brother was already there with his family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how long did they live in Cleveland?
Speaker 2: Oh, probably six--five, six years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 565078
Speaker 1: Now, do you have siblings?
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about them?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I have a sister and a brother.  My brother is the older of the two.  His name is Roderick Williams.  I don't think he'll mind me telling you when he was born; he was born in 1962.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your sister (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And my sister, Cliffye [Cliffye Williams Johnson], her married name is Johnson.  And Cliffye is significantly younger.  She might mind.  You know how you ladies are about your ages, but Cliffye has just turned thirty.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 565079
Speaker 1: So your mother [Bettye Belton Williams] and father [Clifford Brown] separated while they were in Cleveland [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And your mother moved to New York [New York] from there, or did she go back to Alabama first?
Speaker 2: She came back to Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So let's talk about your early years in Alabama.  What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Oh, earliest?  I don't know if it was the earliest because some of them kind of blur together in a, in a timeframe there, but I remember at a, a, a house, not the house that I really did most of my growing up in, which was at 9 Center Street [Bessemer, Alabama].  There was another house on Center Street that, that we lived at for, in my estimation, only about a year or two.  And I remember getting choked on a fishbone and my [maternal] grandmother [Rebecca Belton] being on the back porch hitting me in my back, trying to make me spit it out.  And for years I wouldn't eat fish after that, because I always had that bad reaction about choking on a fishbone.  And I was very young, less than five, maybe three or four years old.  And I just remember standing on that back porch and my grandmother whacking me in the back, trying to make me cough up the, the, the ch- the fishbone (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The fishbone?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 565080
Speaker 1: Tell me about the community when you were elementary school age.
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.  Everybody knew everybody.  It truly was that kind of idyllic scene that you hear about, where you walk down the street, and everybody is waiving, because you knew everybody.  Everybody knew everybody else's children and parents, and of course, everybody also knew everybody else's business in a small town like Bessemer [Alabama]. I, I remember people looking out for each other and not being afraid to go anywhere or to do anything because you knew that before you got to wherever it was you were going within the town, you were gonna pass a dozen people that knew you and cared about you.  So it really was that extended family scenario that was something that candidly I, I missed when we first moved to New York [New York] 'cause that was a very, very different atmosphere.  But there in Alabama, I knew all of the other kids in the neighborhood.  We all used to walk to the same school together in elementary school [George Washington Carver Elementary School, Bessemer, Alabama].  And some of those people are people that I remember and talk to even today, even though I left Alabama when I was in the third grade.  Ironically, the day before we're actually taping this interview, somebody that was in my first and second grade class called me, and I talked to him, and we are still friends today.
Speaker 1: And, and who is that?
Speaker 2: His name is Fred Farnis, F-A-R-N-I-S.  And he called because he was thinking about one of his sons coming to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], my alma mater, to play football.  And he wanted to ask me about the Morehouse football program.  So, Fred and I were in first and second grade together, and there he was calling me as recently as, as yesterday.
Speaker 1: Who else do you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a really unique thing to happen, and this is just one of those--I couldn't dream this up this way.  And it actually is related to Fred because a fellow that was in my third grade class, and he left at the end of third grade and moved to Los Angeles [California].  I didn't know that.  I left when we got out of third grade and moved to New York, to Manhattan.  And evidently, he had gone back to Alabama and had run into Fred.  And he said, "Whatever happened to Ronnie Brown [HistoryMaker Ronald Brown]?"  Because they used to call me Ronnie when I was a little boy.  And Fred said, "Well, he's living in Atlanta [Georgia]; I've talked to him and you know, met his family."  And this gentleman, whose name is Jerry [ph.], said, "Well, I live in Atlanta now.  Can you tell me how to get in touch with him?"  And Fred gave him my email address.  And he emailed me and said, "I'm Jerry from the third grade, and we were in third grade together, and we haven't seen each other since, and I understand that you live in Atlanta, and we need--."  And due to my travel schedule and a series of other things, we didn't really get a chance to connect.  And finally one Saturday, when I was actually home, I decided to call him.  And we talked and talked and talked, and that by itself is probably not ironic.  But this is the ironic part: Jerry told me that he moved to Los Angeles at the same time that I moved to Manhattan.  And we started talking about where my wife [Deborah Peyton Brown] was from.  And I said, "Well, my wife is from L.A."  And he said, "Well, what part of L.A. did she live in?"  And we went through all of that, and he said, "Well, where did your wife go to high school?"  And I told him what high school, and he said, "How old is your wife?"  And my wife and I are, are the same age.  And he said--and of course, we're the same, Jerry and I.  And he said, "Well, I went to that high school."  And he said, "What was your wife's maiden name?"  And he knew my wife and her twin sister [Beverly Peyton Baker (ph.)].  They were in the same high school class in Los Angeles.  And my wife and her sister had gone out to play golf that Saturday morning.  And when they came back in, I was talking to him on the phone, and I used their class name.  They had given their graduating class a special name, and he told me to say it to them.  And when I said it, they both looked at me like I had three heads, and they said, "How do you know about that?"  And then I gave them the phone, and it was Jerry, and they remembered him.  He actually sent, he emailed me pictures of them in their high school yearbook that he had.  And at the same time he also sent a picture of us from when we were in third grade together in Bessemer, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Wow, that is ironic.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so you talk about a small world scenario.  He was in my class in third grade in Bessemer, and he was in high school class with my wife in Los Angeles.  And now all of us live here in Atlanta (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 565081
Speaker 1: Tell me the name of the elementary school that you attended.
Speaker 2: In, in Alabama the elementary school was Carver--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as in George Washington [George Washington Carver Elementary School, Bessemer, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the teachers (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I certainly remember faces and, and, and getting paddled.  Exact names I may struggles with though--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from elementary school.
Speaker 1: Tell me what it was like in elementary school at that time.
Speaker 2: The thing that I remember the most about it was the caring, the caring and, and the discipline, thus, the paddling.  You know, you'd have to hold your hand out and get some licks when you didn't behave properly.  They were not playing, and they were trying to prepare us.  And I've always thought that the initial education that I got there in the South, the discipline around that education, even though they didn't have all of the resources that they needed, they cared so much about us, and they were trying so hard to get us prepared, that that was still some of the best early education I think a child could get.
Speaker 1: Did you attend kindergarten, or did you go to the first grade?
Speaker 2: I did, I went to kindergarten.  And there is a (laughter), a story that my mother [Bettye Belton Williams] embarrasses me with about kindergarten, because I actually went early.  I was younger than most of the kids in kindergarten, and the bathroom facilities were not nearby.  There was something called an outhouse in those days.  And they wanted to send one of the older boys with me because I was so young they didn't know if I could do what I needed to do by myself.  And I wouldn't let anybody go with me.  And that was one of the early stories about my, my independence, if you will, because the teachers told my mother after she came to pick me up from kindergarten that he won't let anybody go to the bathroom with him, even though we normally do a buddy system here when a child is that young.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So first, second, and third grade you go to Carver.  And how is the decision--oh, you, you told me that your mother goes to New York [New York] before you.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you stay there with your [maternal] grandparents [Rebecca Belton and James Belton, Sr.].  What grade were you in when your mother left to go to New York?
Speaker 2: Third.
Speaker 1: Oh, so--
Speaker 2: I mean it wasn't a long period of time that she--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, I see.
Speaker 2: --was in New York--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --before.  She was getting settled and finding, you know, a place for us to live.  So, you know, I had been living there with my grandparents anyway.
Story_ID: 565082
Speaker 1: But then when my mother [Bettye Belton Williams] got married to my stepfather and she went to New York [New York], it was a matter of months--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --not years.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And your stepfather's name?
Speaker 1: Gifford Williams.
Speaker 2: And they, they met in Alabama and then moved to New York?
Speaker 1: No, they actually met in New York.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My mother had, had gone to New York and worked there one summer.  And they met and maintained a relationship even after she came back to Alabama and then decided to get married.  And the rest is history, as they say.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.  So tell me about the trans- excuse me--the transition from living in Alabama to New York.
Speaker 1: It was amazing, as you might imagine.  I went there for a summer before I officially moved to New York.  And we were living in Brooklyn [New York], the only time that I ever lived in Brooklyn; all the rest of the time was in Manhattan [New York].  But that summer we lived in Brooklyn, and I met some of the most diverse people that summer ever.  It was like a little mini United Nations in the block.  You know, you had a kid from India; you had your--I mean a kid that was as Irish as Irish could be, you know, bright red hair, freckles; another kid that was from Africa; and then a Jewish kid.  And we all would get together and come out because our parents were going to work, and we would come out and play every day during the day in the street and play stickball and handball.  And I just remember it as being one of those times of, of being opened up to new things and listening to the different accents, how people talked, what people ate, and it was just a great time of, of learning for me.  And I think that you also got to find out that as much as things were different, that there were some things that were exactly the same.  It was a working-class neighborhood, so everybody's parents were getting up going to work every day, and the kids were kind of left to their own devices during the day to figure out what they were gonna do.  And again, this was the summer, so everybody was out of school.  And occasionally, different parents would choose to take the children on little trips to, whether it was to the movies or to a theme park or something like that.  And I just remembered walking down the street with this, this group that, that looked like it could have been for a commercial, you know.  I guess at that point, the only thing that we didn't have as part of the group was somebody that was Asian but, you know, black, white, Indian.  There were no girls though; it was all boys.  It was all of us.  And we didn't think anything of it because we were friends.  And it was kind of us and then everybody else.  And I remember that because that was one of the summers that I got opened up to not only the differences in other people but at the end of the day how people really are the same.
Speaker 2: Tell me about the, the neighborhood.  Where did you live?  Was it in a brownstone, in the projects, in a house?
Speaker 1: It was an apartment building, and it wasn't the projects.  It was a middle-class neighborhood in, in Brooklyn.  I wish I could remember that address, but I can't.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But a, a middle-class neighborhood where, again, everybody got up and went to work every morning.  Everybody had at least one car it seemed like, which was kind of unusual for New York.  With all the mass transportation, not everybody had cars in those days.  But I just remember becoming part of the neighborhood through the children.  And you learned who the guy was that ran the fish market and who the guy was at the vegetable stand.  And you know, people talked to each other.  So that little section of New York reminded me a little bit of Alabama, because people knew each other, they really did.  And all of us kids in that block ended up not only knowing each other but knowing each other's parents.  And it was a very kind of nurturing relationship.  I remember, I remember hating to leave.  Even though I knew I was gonna go back to my friends in Alabama, those, those guys had become my really good friends just that summer.
Story_ID: 565083
Speaker 1: So you--the summer is over, and you go back to Alabama.  When do you come to New York [New York], or go to New York, and stay?
Speaker 2: Fourth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We moved.  That was actually pretty traumatic.  I always think back to my [maternal] grandfather [James Belton, Sr.] telling me, you know, that, that I could always come back and that if, if things were just so, that I should call him because I was his main man.  That's what he used to tell me.  And that was the first time that I had ever remembered seeing my grandfather be emotional.  And I was kind of happy about it because it was something new and exciting, and I wasn't really thinking about leaving my grandparents.  I was thinking about what I was going to, and I knew, you know, they'll always be around.  But I think for them, it really was a big deal, you know, their first grandchild.  I was the oldest and the one that had actually lived with them.  And that was gonna be a pretty big chunk to pull out of their life.  And I can look back on it now in retrospect and see that was a pretty big deal.  I was viewing it from the excitement element, and they were viewing it from the standpoint that a little child that they felt like to some degree they had raised as their own was about to leave.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you moved back to New York or go to New York to live, this is when you live in Manhattan [New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So your parents, the--your mother [Bettye Belton Williams] and her husband [Brown's stepfather, Gifford Williams] have moved to Manhattan.
Story_ID: 565084
Speaker 1: Now let me ask you, your relationship with Mr. Williams [Gifford Williams]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what type of relationship did that turn out to be once you began to live together?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it ended up being a special relationship.  There were some ups and downs.  You know, I had not been around a father figure for a very long time other than my [maternal] grandfather [James Belton, Sr.], who loved my mother [Bettye Belton Williams] dearly.  And you know, I had never seen what the normal interaction between husband and wife was like.  So that was a, a change for me.  That was a, a big deal to see my mother, you know, interacting with this, this male figure that wasn't her father and just how that whole thing transpired.  So that took a little getting used to for me.  And it wasn't, again, as an adult.  Now when I look back at it, it wasn't anything abnormal; it was just different for me because I hadn't had that before.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My stepfather, who I just referred to as my father, was from the West Indies, Jamaica.  And I remember early on thinking I was never gonna get used to his accent.  And we found something that we could really bond on, and that was baseball.  And I loved baseball, I loved to play baseball, and he had actually played baseball, professional baseball, in the minor leagues early in his career, had actually played on the same team with Willie Mays in the minor leagues.  He never made it to the, the, the pros.  So, all of a sudden we had this common ground here and the rest of the relationship built from that.  And then, of course, my, my brother was born, Rod [Roderick Williams], and so then that was there in common also.
Speaker 1: What did your stepfather, father, do for a living?
Speaker 2: He had a chauffeur service, driving cars and renting cars for other well known people in New York [New York].  And I actually got a chance to sit inside of Bentleys and Rolls Royces and go to big office buildings downtown and meet and interact with people that otherwise I probably never would have.  I always remember the first time that we came back to Bessemer [Alabama] to visit.  We came back in a Bentley. And you know, this was like 1963 (laughter), and people were seeing Bentleys everywhere.  And I remember my mother actually being worried about it because she thought we would get stopped and pulled over by some of the, the state troopers because, I mean, here we were in a car that some people couldn't, they didn't even know what it was.  They knew it was very expensive.  And I remember for the time that we were there, when the car was parked out in the yard, I mean people would just gather to look at the car.  So that was one of those fond memories of kind of feeling special then.
Story_ID: 565085
Speaker 1: So tell me about school in New York [New York], elementary school.  Now you're about ten.  Tell me about the elementary school.  What was the name of it?
Speaker 2: John Finley--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --elementary school [P.S. 129 John H. Finley School, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And what do you remember about John Finley?
Speaker 2: Just the, the early belief system that people had, which was negative.  It's like, kid coming here from Alabama.  We're probably gonna have to put him in remedial courses, because surely they can't be teaching the type of curriculum in Bessemer, Alabama, that (air quotes) we are here in New York City.  And my mother [Bettye Belton Williams], being a very strong willed person--she got a lot of that from my [maternal] grandmother [Rebecca Belton]--she refused to allow me to be arbitrarily put in a remedial or even an average class.  My mother said, "How do you know what he can do?  You know, you're just assuming that he can't be an honor student or that he can't be in a, a special class."  And she said, "Test him."  And one of the old stories was, when they asked me to read something and comprehend it, and they were gonna ask me questions about it, and I read it, and I handed it back to them, they said, "No, we want you to read it."  And my--I remember my mother saying, "If he gave it back to you, then he did read it."  And they didn't believe that I could have read it and comprehended it that fast.  And that was one of those little poignant memories that I have, because I had the kind of mother that was involved and active and stood up for me.  And I could have been one of those casualties that had been put in either remedial or (air quotes) average classes if my mother had not been the type of person that she was.  And of course, they asked me the questions about it to see if I really had comprehended it, and I blew them away.  And at that point, then I got put in the, the special class and the honors classes with everybody else.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What are your other memories about--'cause you went from the fourth grade to the sixth grade in this, in this--
Speaker 2: Well, the, the rest of--
Speaker 1: --particular school?
Speaker 2: --the--and yes, at that particular school.
Speaker 1: Particular school, okay.  So when you were preparing to go to junior high school, you were doing very well, right--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) as far as being a student, A student, A/B student?
Speaker 2: Probably only about one or two Bs.  Everything--
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was--
Speaker 2: --else was--
Speaker 1: --A's.
Speaker 2: --was A's, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what high, junior high school did you go to, middle school?
Speaker 2: Frederick Douglass [J.H.S. 139, Frederick Douglass School, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Now what area of Manhattan [New York] are you living?
Speaker 2: We are living initially on, at 41 Convent Avenue.  And that was a, a fantastic place to be because that was an upper middle-class neighborhood then.  And I remember it because entertainers lived in our building.  I didn't know them.  My mother would point them out to me, and she said, "That's So and So from The Drifters, and he lives on the sixth floor," you know.  So that was a pretty big deal, to, to be in a building where you would see people that were either, you would end up seeing them on televisions, or you'd see them, you know, on a poster advertising that they were gonna be performing or something like that, so.
Speaker 1: And this is about what street, 145th Street?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Sounds like somebody spent some time in New York.
Speaker 1: So tell me about Frederick Douglass.
Speaker 2: Frederick Douglass was a little bit different.  This was when we had moved over to 148th Street and not at 41 Convent Avenue anymore, and tougher neighborhood and a tougher school.  But I was really, really fortunate because I got into the honors classes with a man by the name of H.W. Brendle [ph.].  And Mr. Brendle had a tremendous impact on me because he taught us how to be men.  I'm, I was never really sure about it, but I thought that Mr. Brendle had a military background.  And we used to have to have handkerchiefs, just like this one you see now, in our pocket every day.  And if you didn't have a handkerchief, you were gonna get punished and get demerits for it.  And I remember a classmate of mine, whose last name was Brown also, Harold Brown [ph.], was there, and Harold was a very, very intelligent student, and he didn't have his handkerchief.  And he was worried that when Mr. Brendle did inspection, it was like what was he gonna do.  And I cut my handkerchief in half, because you only had to show the top of your handkerchief in your pocket for, to pass inspection.  And Harold never forgot that.  He always appreciated the fact that, that we had pulled that off that day.
Story_ID: 565086
Speaker 1: So we were talking about Mr. Brendle [H.W. Brendle (ph.)].  What other preparations did he have you--how else did he want you prepared for school?
Speaker 2: The biggest thing I guess was that he wanted to make sure that we thought things through, that, that we were prepared to deal with whatever eventuality.  So his teaching was not just class work; he was actually teaching us about life.  Now one of the other things is that this was an all-male school, an all-male class.  And Mr. Brendle knew that we were supposed to be the brightest.  And this was a tough school, and he used to do things to make sure that we didn't have to deal with some of the other madness that was going on in the school, because there were gangs and fights and everything else.  And because he wanted us to be focused on our education, he used to make sure that we actually got out of class before some of the more hard lined students got out of class so that we'd have a chance to get a head start and not be caught up in, in all of the mess that went on immediately after school was over.  But A, we had to have our shoes shined; we had to show that we had at least one, if not two, pens; and of course, we had to have the handkerchief; and you had to have your, your workbook and a notebook that you could write in and take notes.  And that was part of inspection.  And if you didn't pass inspection, you were gonna get demerits.  And he actually kept a chart with all of that stuff on it.  And of course, you could earn extra point by doing more work than the standard work.  And we all wanted to please Mr. Brendle because we knew he cared about us.  I remember as part of the award, out of his own pocket, Mr. Brendle would take us and let us pick out ties.  And he would pay for it, if you had done extra credit and had the higher scores.  So again, my friend Harold Brown [ph.] and I, we would battle to see who would win, and he would always take the first, second, and third placed people that had the highest point total.  So early on we started to see that there was a reward for doing what was right and doing good and, and excelling, and Mr. Brendle instilled that in all of us.  I still have two of the ties that Mr. Brendle bought me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was Mr. Brendle African American?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was, as were most of the teachers at Frederick Douglass [J.H.S. 139, Frederick Douglass School, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Was he the first male teacher that taught you?
Speaker 2: He wasn't the first, but he was clearly the one that had the, the biggest impression on me, the largest impact.
Story_ID: 565087
Speaker 1: What other activities were you involved in, in middle school [J.H.S. 139, Frederick Douglass School, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was always a ballplayer, different sports.  I played baseball, basketball, even tried my hand at football for a little while but more so basketball and baseball.
Speaker 1: Were you involved in the student government?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, was the president of the student government association, and I remember when I moved to a different school.  And I'm trying to remember now what grade that was.  I think it was seventh grade I was the president of the student government association.  And that was a pretty big deal because I got a chance to see something then that was the first real slant at racism in New York [New York].  And I got ready to run, and there was a specific teacher that tried to discourage me from running.  And then we had to make our own posters, and every poster--and he had to approve the posters that could be put up in the hallway.  And every poster that I put together he found fault with it, and I couldn't understand it.  And my mother [Bettye Belton Williams] had to sit me down and tell me.  You know, she said, "Who else is running?"  And I was the only person of color that was running.  And we went through the whole process.  And I just couldn't understand why he was giving me such a hard time.  And even some of my other, some of the other students at the school started to look at this and say something's wrong here.  You know, this guy is just being overly oppressive on you, and not only should you tell your parents, we think you ought to tell the school administrators.  So some other little seventh grade kids standing up for me and recognizing that something was out of kilter, and that was my first real interaction with it there in, in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about music?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy, I, I still have the bad memories of sitting at the piano with my baseball uniform on while the rest of the team was getting ready to head to the baseball field.  And until I played my scales right, I couldn't leave.  So, there I was, baseball glove sitting on the piano stool, with me trying to make sure that I got my scales right with the piano teacher so that I could leave and go play baseball.
Speaker 1: Did you play any other instru- instrument in, in school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: My, my brother [Roderick Williams] was, is the artiste in the family, not me (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 565088
Speaker 1: Think about sights, sounds, and smells in New York [New York].  What, what comes to your mind--
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) back then--
Speaker 2: --sounds--
Speaker 1: --during that time?
Speaker 2: --definitely were a really big deal.  The noise factor is high in New York [New York] and the fact that you, you, you tune it out after a while.  And you know, there's always something going on.  There's always some construction.  There's always some building.  There are, you know, people screaming at each other out of the window of a cab and just the, the volume of noise from the traffic to construction to people talking to, you know, the trains running to--I mean it's, it's endless.  And yet, that is part of the vibrancy that makes New York New York.  You get a certain energy level when you're there that I don't know of anyplace else that you get.  And I've traveled and worked around the world, but there is nowhere else just like New York.  So the biggest single thing to me was the, the sounds.  I mean you can hear so many different accents and so many different people speaking passionately about something, whether it's sports, or a pretty girl, or a politician, or the neighborhood.  There's a lot of passion in New York, and you get to hear it in the streets of New York.
Speaker 1: What smells come to mind?
Speaker 2: From the sublime to the ridiculous; everything from the different ethnic foods that you could smell cooking, based on what part of the city that you were in, to the smell off the, the river [Hudson River], the water itself, some good, some bad.  And then, of course, just the--to me, people always talked about New York being crowded.  And I never really felt that way when I lived in New York, because there was so much to do and so many places to go.  Yes, there were a lot of people, but you also had a lot of latitude about what you could or couldn't do and where you could and couldn't go.  And you could do it whether you had a car or not.  So my, my thoughts and memories about New York are, are, are pleasant and, and really very good.  It was a great time for me.  I enjoyed being there when I was there.  But those, the smells were--a couple that really stand out.  Obviously, when you're on the water, that's a completely different thing than being anywhere else in New York.  And the other one is being in New York during Christmastime and the, the smell of, you know, the, the guys out there with the pretzels and you know, the chestnuts (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Chestnuts.
Speaker 2: --and just the, the, the vibrancy of the choices of all of the different things that are right there while you're walking up and down the street.  And now they've taken it to another level.  I mean you could, you could almost have a gourmet meal on the street in New York now if you wanted to.  But just the, the guys that had the, the, the hotdog carts that they would push, and they'd open it up and you could smell the sauerkraut come out.  And it was just a, a tremendous thing as a child growing up to, to be around all of those sights and sounds and seeing the big limousines pull up and you know, very important looking people jump out while you're just walking down the street, all of the, the, the star sightings, you know, seeing the actors and actresses walking right across the street from you or passing right by you when you were in certain neighborhoods in New York.  So those sights and sounds of the city were, were things that, that obviously I'll never forget.  And since we visit fairly often, I don't have a chance to forget even if I wanted to.
Story_ID: 565089
Speaker 1: Most people who live in New York [New York] don't have an opportunity to visit certain places, like the Empire State Building [New York, New York] and Statue of Liberty [New York, New York].  But in the school system, they took you on field trips.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember?  Can you share a story about field trips (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, absolutely.  And, and ironically, there are people, to the point that you make, that, that live their entire lives in New York and they've never been to the Empire State Building, you know, 'cause for whatever reason they missed it that day when their school went, and they just never made it.  So, I remember not wanting to do certain things.  And again, my mother [Bettye Belton Williams] being the strong willed person that she was--I think the school trip was gonna be to the Statue of Liberty.  And I said, "Eh," you know, "who wants to go to the Statue of Liberty?"  I see the Statue of Liberty all the time.  My mother said, "You have to go.  It's not optional."  And I remember being kind of pissed off about that, 'cause I didn't see why.  And after I did it, it was unbelievable 'cause it was so moving, and the stories, and looking at what people went through, and the different people that passed through there.  And that's why you have parents, because they're smarter than you are, and they know what you should be doing even when you don't want to do it.  But then my mother was also cognizant of the fact that that wasn't the only place that you were going to get that kind of exposure and education.  So whenever--and my mother was teaching in the New York public school system--whenever her school was going somewhere that she thought was important, she would let me miss school at my school and go with her school.  That was the first time that I ever went to the, the Guggenheim Museum [Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, New York] was with my mother's school, not my own.
Speaker 1: What about Rockefeller Center [New York, New York]?  Have you ever visited there as a child?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  As, as, as a child, I went with my family, not with the school, and I've been back as an adult.  I've actually taken my children [Jarrod Brown and Jordan Brown].
Story_ID: 565090
Speaker 1: Let me see, we're in the 1960s.  Tell me if your, your parents [Bettye Belton Williams and Brown's stepfather, Gifford Williams] are political or involved in civil rights at all.
Speaker 2: Well, my mother certainly is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And a lot of that was during a time period where there was a push for rights overall, and there was a really big push for rights for teachers and better pay and salaries.  I mean it was for all public servants--I mean the police, the firemen--but the teachers were really having an exceptionally hard time then.  And I remember my mother becoming a part of the, the group, if you will, that was pushing and fighting for improved salaries for teachers, improved benefits, and the overall ability to do a better job of teaching the school children in the New York City public schools.  And there were actually meetings that took place in our apartment on Saturdays, where I got to see people from a variety of different backgrounds sitting in our living room.  And I'd come and stand by the door sometimes and listen to what they were talking about.  So it was the beginning of that activism.  And my mother always supported people that were running for political office.  I showed her something probably about three months ago in a, in a New York paper, that there was a person that was running for the local congress.  It's a gentleman named Denny Farrell [Herman "Denny" Farrell].  And Denny Farrell has been an icon in New York political arenas now for thirty plus years.  We remember when Denny used to work down on Riverside Drive at, at a garage, the same garage candidly that my father kept his car in.  And when he first started running for political office, he used to come and, and get donations from my mother and father.  I remember my mother donating five dollars to his campaign one time and how happy he was to get it.  And now he is one of the most respected politicians over the last three decades or more in New York City [New York, New York].
Story_ID: 565091
Speaker 1: So you leave middle school [J.H.S. 139, Frederick Douglass School, New York, New York], and what high school do you attend?
Speaker 2: I ended up going to Seward Park High School, which was all the way downtown in Lower Manhattan on Grand Street [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And why that school?
Speaker 2: Well, the closest school to me was George Washington [George Washington High School; George Washington Educational Campus, New York, New York].  And my mother [Bettye Belton Williams] refused to allow me to go to George Washington, especially after two kids either got hung or hung themselves during the time period that I was supposed to be going to high school.  And she said, "If things are that far out of hand, you are not going there.  So we're gonna send you somewhere else other than to George Washington."  So I was a little bothered by it because most of the kids in my neighborhood that I grew up with and played ball with, that's where they went to high school.  But my mother sent me downtown where it was a safer environment.  And I had been going to school downtown anyway because the seventh and eighth grade was at a school called Simon Baruch [J.H.S. 104, Simon Baruch School; M.S. 104, Simon Baruch School], which was also downtown in an area of New York [New York] that was called Stuyvesant Town.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it wasn't new for me--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to travel to go to school.  But I really thought I was gonna be going to school uptown, if you will.  And then lo and behold, that, that year before it was time for me to go, the two kids either hung themselves, which is how it was being billed in the papers, or, or got hung in the bathroom.  And my mother said, "No way, not gonna happen."
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, tell me about your high school years.
Speaker 2: Wow, talk about a time of, of growth, a time of introspection, a time of really starting to question things more, and I mean everything, from the government to religion to friendships.  And I remember sitting in some of my high school classes, and some of the debates that we had there were just stirring.  I mean we were talking about things that, that I felt were really real and to this day, I think were real, morality and ethics.  And that, that was the, the, the beginning of my philosophy about right and wrong.  And that was also the first time I ever protested anything.  We actually marched against the Vietnam War when I was at high school at Seward Park and made the decision knowing that we were gonna be marked absent from school.  I mean this was a really rebellious thing to do then.  But we felt that it was important enough to make sure that our voices were heard.  And I mean we were high school students, not college students, and that was a pretty big deal then.  I remember kind of wearing that like a, a badge of honor.
Speaker 1: Where did you protest?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: Where?
Speaker 2: Where?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Probably about four or five blocks from the school.  And we walked down the middle of the street and stopped traffic and was very well coordinated.  And we felt great.  We felt like we were exercising our rights as, as American citizens and that we had been talking about this stuff for months, and we said well, it's time to do more than just talk about it; we need to get out there and do something.  So it was, it was one of those times in your life that you started to, to make choices about who you really were, and what you were gonna stand up for, and what was important to you.  You also got a chance to look at the differences in people.  That was the beginning of my tolerance, if you will, for different.  Homosexuality was not rampant in my high school, but you could tell that there were some people that were living a different lifestyle and how to cope with that.  I mean that was, that was new to me.  When I was growing up in Alabama, you know, we used to say so and so was a sissy or something like that, but this was different.  This was clearly something very different.  And I remember being in class with people, and we actually talked about it for the first time opening and publicly.  And I remember that being just one of those revelations in that time period for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You continued to ha- to be a honor student in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 565092
Speaker 1: Before we finish talking about high school [Seward Park High School, New York, New York], tell me about religion.  What was the religion of the house?  Or was there--
Speaker 2: There was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There definitely was.  I was raised in the Baptist church and, and baptized there at Convent Avenue Baptist Church in Manhattan [New York] and had gone to Baptist churches all my life in Alabama.  I remember as a child in Alabama they used to pack me a lunch when we went to church.  That's how long church service used to go.  So I would have rolls and stuff from, from whatever we had had for breakfast because they knew that church was gonna go on that long.  I can remember going to sleep and waking back up after having taken a good nap, and church service was still going on when I was a child in Alabama.  So it's always been the Baptist church growing up, and the same thing was true there in New York [New York], and became members of Convent Avenue Baptist Church, which was a, a fairly well known church in New York City, and got involved in a lot of the youth programs there.  I remember going on Sundays to different Bible study, and then after that they'd take us out for little outings.  I remember going bowling with the, the church class.  The church even had a football team, which my brother [Roderick Williams] played on for a very short period of time.  He wasn't that crazy about football.  But it was just another part of that whole growing up process.  You went to Sunday school on Sunday morning and then either youth church or regular church there at Convent Avenue.
Story_ID: 565093
Speaker 1: Anything else that you can think of that you want to share about high school [Seward Park High School, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, when I look at high school, this was when there were a lot of people trying to find themselves, not just me.  And there were the different organizations.  So you had the Asian club; you had the Jewish club; you had the Russian club; you had the African American club.  And I remember the first time that I got introduced to the African American club.  It, it, it's like everybody looked like Huey P. Newton to me, you know, and, and all of these guys were wearing dashikis.  And you know, I had some dashikis too and, and little nice Afro there, but it's like, it was like something out of the movies then.  So, you got a chance to see all of these different people really trying to find out who they were and really doing a lot of research into their own backgrounds, the different Asian clubs, of which there was probably like three at hour high school; the different Hispanic clubs, you know, from the Puerto Rican club to the Cuban club to the Spanish as in from Spain club, who viewed themselves as very differently from the other two clubs.  And I just remember the proliferation of these different clubs and everybody trying to say this is who I am, you know.  So this, there was this kind of cultural awakening also as we were growing up about who we really were, and yet we all remained close.  So you'd go and be in the Chinese club, and then you'd come out, and everything would be okay, and you'd interact with everybody else.  But those were some of the things that really stood out to me, that and spending time in different people's homes and seeing how they lived.  I had quite a few Jewish friends when I was in high school.  And you know, you'd go by and the--you'd, you'd learn what people ate, and you'd learn what the different customs were.  I remember one of my friends who was Greek, Nicky Calamaris [ph.].  I remember Nicky like it was yesterday and going to Nicky's home, and his mother's English was not the best and yet she was a very sweet, warm, motherly woman, you know, and being very nice to me in a way that you don't have to speak the language perfectly to know that somebody is being nice to you.  So, when I was in high school, all of those different things were going on, including what was happening uptown, in my own neighborhood.  And the, the whole Black Muslim thing was, was becoming a really big deal.  And, and I remember not only Ali [Muhammad Ali] changing his name but Kareem [Kareem Abdul-Jabbar], who had been Lew Alcindor, and you know, people wearing the crescent and the star and all of the different things that were going on then to, to just kind of shape you and make you learn more about all of the different things that were happening in the world at that time.  And most of that for me happened when I was in high school.
Speaker 1: Well, what were your thoughts about Malcolm [Malcolm X] being killed, Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] all of that happening in that time period?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: What were some of your thoughts?
Speaker 2: They, they were mixed emotions, as you might imagine.  The Kennedy scenario, I was much younger, but I remember thinking that, that hope had been snuffed out.  And that I didn't know if the rest of the people coming behind Kennedy were going to have a vision for American like it appeared that he had.  Now with Martin Luther King, it was a very different story altogether.  It was a, it was a religious feeling, you know, that the, that the loss was, was deeper than just a (air quotes) person per se.  I mean I was profoundly hurt when Kennedy died, I mean I really was.  I remember crying and you know, all of the other people that cried.  But the difference in my mind with when King died was not only did it seem like hope left, but it seemed like a part of the re- the religious beliefs that, that almost like God was gonna have to intervene after this happened.  And I remember being very, very worried after King was killed about the state of this country going forward.
Story_ID: 565094
Speaker 1: So you were telling me about your, your feelings about the, the country during that time, so--
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think that it was a time period where a lot of people were just unsure about what was next.  The assassinations, there was already a lot of dissension in the nation.  And it was already a, a question about how far we were actually gonna be able to go as a nation and who was gonna take us there, and there candidly weren't a lot of choices.  And all of a sudden, with those assassinations, several of the choices seemed to, to just go away; several of the good choices seemed to go away.  And it made you wonder what the real impact was gonna be to this nation over the next ten, fifteen, twenty years, because you needed all of the voices.  And you needed all of the differences of opinion to be articulated in a way so that everybody could get something from it.  I, I, I use a phrase now that has become one of my favorites because I just think it's so true.  And the phrase is that, "Agreement is temporary, but understanding is lasting."  And what you should seek is understanding.  And I felt like the people, particularly King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], and, and Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], and, and even more specifically Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy], had gotten to the point where they were saying things in a way that people could understand it.  And that's the beginning of you being able to reach any kind of consensus.  Any kind of relationship is with understanding.  Most people try to strive for agreement.  But you got to recognize that agreement doesn't last.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Something that you agree about today, next week you could disagree about it.  But if you have understanding about something, that is something that transcends time.  And I felt that the folks that we lost during that crucial time period were folks that were actually fostering a better understanding.  And that was the basis or the foundation, if you will, for being able to make progress.  So I was very worried.  I was very concerned because I felt like there was going to be a vacuum in the understanding that all of the different constituencies needed to have before you could ever even think about having agreement.
Story_ID: 565095
Speaker 1: Tell me how you decided what college you would go to.
Speaker 2: Well, that was something that I had a lot of help from my mother [Bettye Belton Williams].  My mother had done her graduate work at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], and she was enamored with Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] men.  And she they were just different; they carried themselves differently; they walked differently; they talked differently.  And unbeknownst to me, when she was doing some of her work at Atlanta University before I was born, she said if she ever had a male child she would want him to go to Morehouse, but she didn't push Morehouse on me.  She made me think it was my idea, which was the best way to go about it.  And she introduced it to me, because it wasn't the first thing on my radar screen.  I, I felt like I wanted to go to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angles, California].  You know, I wanted to be out on the West Coast.  All of the stuff that I had seen on television and in the movies, that just seemed like a great lifestyle.  And you know, the different athletes that were out there, and the, the UCLA Bruins basketball championships with John Wooden, and being able to go to the beach after class, I said yeah, that, that's, I want to go to school out on the West Coast.  And then the more that I thought about it, and the more that I read, and the more black males that were doing positive things that I found out about, the majority of them had gone to Morehouse.  And I said, "Let me look into this a little bit more deeply," and I did, and then it became my wish and want as opposed to my mother's.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had spent an awful lot of time around a lot of other people.  And I felt like I wanted to spend as much time as I could in a concentrated area of people that were striving to be their absolute best and that nobody was going to accept any less than that from you, and that was how I viewed Morehouse.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you graduate from high school [Seward Park High School, New York, New York] in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-one [1971].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you go off to Morehouse that fall?
Speaker 2: Really, that August.
Speaker 1: That August, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, late August.
Speaker 1: And who paid for your education?
Speaker 2: Well, I had an academic scholarship--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to Morehouse.  And it wasn't a complete one, so my parents did have to pay some of it.  But the bulk of it was an academic scholarship.
Story_ID: 565096
Speaker 1: Tell me about, about Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], about your freshman year.
Speaker 2: Never forget it.  That's step one.  And I've already started talking to both of my sons [Jarrod Brown and Jordan Brown] about this: the best four years of my life, the four most impactful years of my life.  I should say that, 'cause I've had some pretty good years with my wife [Deborah Peyton Brown] and my children.  So the, the college years were not necessarily the best but the most impactful.  And the reason for that was because of all of the relationships.  And my mother [Bettye Belton Williams] started by telling me before I left to go to Morehouse that I was gonna make some friends that were gonna be my friends for the rest of my life.  I didn't believe it, 'cause I figured I'd always be really super tight with my buddies that I had gone to high school with [at Seward Park High School, New York, New York], and I am still friends with some of them.  But the relationships that I cultivated at Morehouse are just special and lasting.  We were the guys that, that suffered through it all together.  Nobody was (air quotes) rich.  And we all used to get care packages from home that freshman year with everything from cookies to crackers to a little hidden money in a stash somewhere.  I always remember that then, and some of the kids will probably laugh at this, but the cassette tapes were the rage then.  And my mother sent me a cassette tape with the whole family on it talking to me kind of saying hello and giving me news about the family; updates, who was doing what, when, and where, and I wanted to listen to it privately.  Of course I had a roommate.  And it probably was about the third day after I had received it before I could actually listen to it.  And my mother had put a five dollar bill down inside of the cassette tape.  And that was like fifty dollars then (laughter), you know, to have that five dollar bill freshman year.  I could go and buy a steak dinner and, and a couple of other things and maybe even have a change left after that.  So I remember being so happy when I finally opened up that cassette tape.  And not only was all of the news about the family there, but that five dollar bill was there.  It might have been a ten.  I'm not sure, but regardless, I was happy to get it.
Speaker 1: Who was the president while you were there?
Speaker 2: Dr. Gloster.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Hugh Gloster [Hugh Morris Gloster] was the president when I was at Morehouse.
Speaker 1: And who were some of your classmates?
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness, one of my, my classmates, a gentleman who is now prolific in writing books and, and just doing some, some really significant things, is Dr. Robert Franklin [HistoryMaker Robert Franklin], who happens to be from Chicago [Illinois] originally.  And Dr. Franklin went on to have a, a storied career in religion, philosophy, and education, somebody you all should think about.  He's currently at Emory and is in residence there at Emory University [Atlanta, Georgia].  But there was an eclectic group of people that I had in my freshman class and in classes that were ahead of me and in classes that were behind me.  Edwin Moses, the Olympian, was at Morehouse the same time that I was.  We lived on the same floor.  Edwin was younger, but we used to go and play basketball together down on the, the, the outdoor Morehouse court--just a, a series of people that went on to do some, some important things but, but were, in their own right, integral to my education and the education of all the rest of the people around them.  And we've talked about this, me and several of the guys that were in that class of '71 [1971], about how, how we really educated each other, because we had some that were from Alabama, some that were from New York, some that were from Chicago, some from California.  I mean there was just this melting pot of young, black males trying to find themselves and trying to realize what the future could hold for them.  And there was many a night where we would stay up all night into the wee hours of the morning discussing right and wrong, and, and philosophy, and the state of the nation, and what we would do if.  So those were some of my, my real formative years, and I'll never forget them, and I look back on them with a lot of, of, of heartfelt warmth and pride for what we did.
Story_ID: 565097
Speaker 1: Who were some of your professors that you remember or made a significant impact on you?
Speaker 2: Well, at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], as you might imagine, there are no shortage of people to, to draw on and pull from.  But probably a gentleman that really impressed me because of what he expected from you was E.B. Williams [Edward Buchanan Williams], who was the head of the political science department, and I was a political science major.  And he started talking to me about a series of things that he made me think, and that's probably the highest compliment that I could pay him.  He, he made me think about things that I had not thought about before, from the economics of a situation to why people do what they do, never mind what you see in the headlines.  The headlines is not really the news; it's not really the story, and he, he taught me how to look beyond the headlines.  He taught me how to think about things from the standpoint of what people, what people's interests were as opposed to what they talked about as a rationale for why things were done.  And I use that to this day, when I'm either trying to do a deal or trying to look at why certain things work the way that they do.  You know, the old adage says if you really want to find out something, follow the money.  That may very well be true, but you also should follow what it is that people's interests are, because who people have relationships with change over time, but people's interests are usually pretty consistent.  And if you can find out what people's interests are, you have a pretty good barometer of how they are going to react, perform, or interact with you.
Speaker 1: All right.  What else was significant about your years at Morehouse?
Speaker 2: Well, I think probably one of the biggest things was the respect that you were taught at Morehouse, respect for yourself and respect for the other people around you.  And not everybody that came to Morehouse had that respect initially, but we learned it before we left.  And I think that was the, the part of becoming a Morehouse man.  It, it set expectations not just for you but for everybody else around you, and we held each other to those expectations, something as simple as you can't--you shouldn't fight the way I present my argument; you should fight my argument.  And boy, that was one of the tough ones for me as a freshman because I just, I had, I didn't see things that way in the past.  And to understand why that was the way you needed to approach things was very different for me.  And being around those other learned Morehouse men, some upperclassmen, it really helped me with: A, understanding that you don't know everything, but B, neither does whoever the person is that you're talking to.  And if you're willing to listen, you can always learn something, and that may even help you better present your point than if you're just trying to keep somebody else at bay and only trying to push forward your ideas.  So the exchange of ideas openly, candidly, but respectfully, was something that I got during my years at Morehouse College.
Speaker 1: Why political science?
Speaker 2: Well, I always thought I wanted to be a lawyer.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: And I felt like that was like the step one to being a lawyer.
Story_ID: 565098
Speaker 1: But then the business world called, and that's a, another story altogether (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How did you make that transition?
Speaker 1: Well, it started by working part time at a bank.
Speaker 2: Which bank?
Speaker 1: Then it was called First Atlanta [First Atlanta Bank, N.A., Atlanta, Georgia].  That morphed through a series of acquisitions and everything else to become what is now Wachovia [Wachovia Bank, N.A.].  Started out in the computer operations department at night loading tapes and 50 81 punch data cards, so I'm really dating myself here.  But that became more fascinating to me than going on to law school.  So, the whole computer industry and the IT [information technology] area was really beginning to take off, and I had an aptitude for it.  I had actually taken some computer science courses even when I was in high school in New York [Seward Park High School, New York, New York] and had done very well there.  Because I was basically finished all my requirements early, I was taking electives for the last half of my senior year in high school, and, and one of them was computer science, so was doing a pretty good job there and then got the part-time job when I was at, at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] working at nights and fell in love with it and got good at it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What year were you in when you decided to change?
Speaker 1: Well, I didn't, I didn't change my major.
Speaker 2: Okay, I got you.
Speaker 1: So I have a minor in economics, and my--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --major was political science.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Was that your first job?
Speaker 1: No, not by a long shot.  I had had first jobs that went way, way back, including running the elevator in a very special building on Riverside Drive in New York [New York] that held a lot of actors and athletes.  And I remember coming back and telling my mother [Bettye Belton Williams] that I absolutely had to get a college education because I could not be stuck in a job like running the elevator where everybody that got on the elevator wanted to, after they said hello, they wanted to talk to you about the weather.  And I said, "I can't do this," (laughter), you know.  It was a part-time job while I was in high school.  But I always remember thinking, gotta go get your education, because there were grown men that were supporting their families doing the same job that I was doing.  And I remember talking to my mother about it saying, "How can they possibly support their families on this salary?  They make the same salary that I make," which was a very good salary for a high school student.  But she told me about how people go and, and buy the food in bulk.  And she said, "They're not eating like you eat."  And she always laughed at me and said yeah, that, that was the real thing that, that made me know I had to go and get a college education 'cause I, I could not run the elevator for the rest of my life.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Prior to that, I had worked in the grocery stores in New York as a fourteen and fifteen year old.  And in those days you had to have a work permit, and I was too young.  But I knew this real cute girl in the office, and she gave me a fake work permit.  And I started out as a stock boy in Finast, F-I-N-A-S-T, grocery stores there in Manhattan [New York] and worked my way up to cashier.
Story_ID: 565099
Speaker 1: All right, so back to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  Anything else you want to tell me about those years?
Speaker 2: Well, again, those were the years where you really started to find yourself.  You started to find out what was important to you, and you started to look at life differently.  And when I say differently, that everything wasn't about you.  One of the things that they taught us at Morehouse was to be of service.  And I used to go over to Washington High School [Booker T. Washington High School, Atlanta, Georgia] on Saturdays when I was a sophomore at Morehouse and teach reading to kids that were struggling to read.  And that was part of not only what I did but a series of other students at Morehouse, because part of what we were expected to do was to be of service; that it wasn't all about you.  And those were the, the years where that really got embedded in me that sure, I wanted to be successful, and make a lot of money, and do things, but that it wasn't just me that I needed to be concerned with, that there was this larger community of, of, of human beings and, and people that you should, based on all of your blessings and education and everything else, that you should care about and do things to be helpful.  So that was a, another turning point for me in my life that I got at Morehouse, the whole idea of, of the principles around service to others.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you leave Morehouse in 1975?
Speaker 2: Seventy-five [1975].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what about socially?  What's going in your--on in your life socially?
Speaker 2: A great time, great time to be single in Atlanta [Georgia], and the whole scenario in the Atlanta University Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia] then was that the women outnumbered the men, and I would not have had it any other way.  Those were, were great years.  I met my wife when we were in college.  We did not--I mean I knew who she was.  We didn't start out dating then right way.  My wife happens to be a twin, and I met her through one of the guys that lived on the same floor as I did in Morehouse who was a very good friend of mine, Rufus Baker [ph.], from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when Rufus was telling me that his girlfriend had a twin sister.  Now Rufus was quite a joker, so he was always pulling a fast one on people, so for a long time I didn't believe him.  I thought he was just pulling my chain.  But one day I actually saw them together, because I had met his girlfriend, who ultimately became his wife, Beverly [Beverly Peyton Baker (ph.)], my wife's sister.  And they were twins, and they were together.  I said, "So Rufus, you weren't lying."  And he said, "I tried to tell you, but you just didn't believe me."  But he lied so much that I couldn't (laughter), I couldn't believe him then.  Still one of my very best friends though, Rufus Baker.
Speaker 1: What, what is your wife's name?
Speaker 2: Her name?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Deborah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --originally Deborah Peyton, now Deborah Peyton Brown.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what school was she attending?
Speaker 2: She was at Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  And I embarrass her by telling people that when we were in school, my wife was Ms. Clark.  And that was a pretty big deal for Ms. Clark to be escorted by a Morehouse man.  The guys at Clark were not necessarily happy about that.
Story_ID: 565100
Speaker 1: So what happens after graduation [from Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Work, work at the bank, became a supervisor in the computer operations department, ultimately became a manager, and started that career in the banking industry at First Atlanta [First Atlanta Bank, N.A., Atlanta, Georgia] in the IT [information technology] world.
Speaker 1: So this was in 1975?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So tell me what happens next.
Speaker 2: Well, then there were times for change and, and moving over, and I decided to go and work at a company called Equifax [Equifax, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia], also in the IT capacity.  And those were some really great informative years because I started to learn even more about credit and business.  Equifax was originally called the Retail Credit Company [Retail Credit Company, Inc.] years and years ago, and it became Equifax, and it expanded into a series of other industries.  But the primary industry was always credit report, whether it was credit reporting on individuals or credit reporting on companies.  And really, that's where my IT and managerial career blossomed.  I became the first African American to be the head of the IT department at Equifax.  The very first implementation of security on the computer systems was done by me at Equifax.  I'll, I'll never forget it.  I had to go to Toronto [Canada] to learn about a product called, of all things, Top Secret [ph.].  And that was how we would give or deny access to certain parts of the computer system to individuals and organizations, I mean stuff that you would say, "Well, how could you ever have done without that then?"  Well, we were doing without it then.  And installing that security throughout all of the systems, including remote nodes, was probably the biggest project that I had undertaken to that point in time.
Speaker 1: Tell me what, what year this was that you began working for Equifax.
Speaker 2: Well, I ended up working there for eleven years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So this probably would have been '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: All right.  Were there other projects that you implemented at Equifax?
Speaker 2: Well, that was the single biggest project--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as far as impact to the rest of the people.  But one of the things that we did do was to pull together all of the other departments and show how using the IT resources that things would actually get better for everybody.  And you know, you look back at that today, and you say, "Well, of course, everybody wants to use all of the technology that's available."  That wasn't necessarily the case in the mid-'70s [1970s], you know, mid to late '70s [1970s].  So you had to convince people that having all of this stuff automated and being put on computers and that you could actually have remote access to it and do those kinds of things.  That was, that was a sales job also.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you head up the IT department, and you're there for eleven years.  So what is your, your next venture?
Speaker 2: The next venture was to go to a company called Sales Technologies [Sales Technologies, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia].  And this company was doing salesforce automation, and they were looking for a progressive person to head up IT for them.
Speaker 1: And you say salesforce automation.  What does that mean?
Speaker 2: Well, that was the beginning of all of the commercials that you see now, where the, the different people are out with their laptops, and they're talking about doing business before they actually go in on the sales call.  That was where it started.  It started with Sales Technologies.
Story_ID: 565101
Speaker 1: We were talking about the Sales Tech.  Is that the name of it?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, Sales Technologies [Sales Technologies, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: And you were telling me about the project that you were working on there or some of the, some of the projects that you worked on or implemented there.
Speaker 2: Well Sales Technologies actually grew out of a think tank at, at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia], because in those days, if you really looked at it, people were not caring around laptop computers like they do today.  So that was something very different, something very new, to actually give a salesperson a laptop and then teach them how to use it and teach them how to be more productive in what they were doing.  And it was a very, it was a good time for me not only because of all of the things that were happening in the IT world where computers were getting smaller, and different battery life, and communications capabilities were expanding and becoming much more realistic, the ability to transmit data over phone lines was not as much of a hit or miss as it was before.  So you actually could build a business around that.  And that's what these entrepreneurs had done at Sales Technologies.  But they needed somebody that had the experience and expertise in information technology to actually run it and turn it into something that was a repeatable and reliable function, and that's where I came in.  So they, they wooed me away from Equifax [Equifax, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia] to come and deal with this new startup company that was beginning the whole process of what is now called CRM or customer relationship management, but in the old days it was just called salesforce automation.  How do you automate your salesforce?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we started by doing it across a variety of different industries, so from consumer package goods to healthcare to science.  Everybody that was doing anything that had a salesperson out in the field, we were coming up with ways to automate that process for them.  And this was the beginning candidly of allowing people to not have to come into the office.  This is where telecommuting actually started, because if you had your own laptop and then you could plug into your phone line, you didn't have to come into the office, because you could get all the data, all the information that everybody else at the office got through your own laptop.
Speaker 1: Were there any other companies like this in the nation?
Speaker 2: This was certainly one of the first, and, and at the time, the largest.  And because of the scope, I mean we had customers like everybody from people that were making blue jeans to General Mills [General Mills Inc.] to a large pharmaceutical company to Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.] to--I mean so it was an eclectic group of customers.  But everybody was trying to do the same thing, which was to figure out how to be more productive and how to give people in the field the sales tools that they needed to be more successful.
Story_ID: 565102
Speaker 1: This expanded over--it wasn't just in the United States or for American companies.  Did you go--
Speaker 2: In, in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) overseas?
Speaker 2: --initially it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And if we fast forward a little bit--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --after I became the person that was in charge of the whole company, after I got promoted to being the, the president and CEO of the entire company, after that, much further after that, we decided to acquire one of our largest competitors.  But now this was also after we decided to specialize and segment in the healthcare industry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So one of the things that happened in the interim was that this independent company, Sales Technologies [Sales Technologies, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia], was actually purchased by the Dun and Bradstreet Corporation [Dun and Bradstreet, Inc.].  And that was another one of those really big pivotal points in my life, because I was then part of a multibillion dollar company, Dun and Bradstreet, that had offices all over the world.  And I got a chance to go and interact with those people, and visit, and deal with those different offices, and try to figure out what the synergies were between what Sales Technologies was doing and what other areas within Dun and Bradstreet were doing.  And Dun and Bradstreet at that point in time owned companies like Moody's [Moody's Corporation] who were doing the, the ratings for people's credit and debt worthiness, to companies like IMS [IMS Health], who were helping primarily healthcare companies, to Nielsen [A.C. Nielsen, Inc.], who were doing the ratings for television.  So, truly, Dun and Bradstreet at that point in time was just a multifaceted umbrella companies that had a series of other companies underneath it, some that had some synergies with each other and some that didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Continue telling me what happens next.
Speaker 2: Well, that was where a lot of my managerial experience was gleaned.  I learned even more about how to deal with people.  I got promoted steadily, senior manager, director, vice president, senior vice president, and ultimately, there was a decision that had to be made because Dun and Bradstreet was making some, some changes strategically as to, as to what they wanted to focus on.  And I was asked whether or not this was something, this whole salesforce automation, was something that had a future.  And I remember being called to the headquarters office there in Connecticut to sit down and talk about it.  Well, at the time it was actually on Park Avenue in New York [New York] (background noise).
Story_ID: 565103
Speaker 1: The Dun and Bradstreet Corporation [Dun and Bradstreet, Inc.] at that point in time was just a, a real mix, a variet- of a variety of different companies.  I mean, there was everything that you could think of.  And one of the things that I was asked when I had to go up to the, the corporate office, which this was before we moved to Connecticut was actually there on Park Avenue [New York, New York], was whether or not this salesforce automation thing was something that we really could see going out into the future.  And I remember talking about it because there was even some concern that they might want to divest or even shut that company [Sales Technologies, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia] down.  And I remember sitting across the table from the person, and I said, "This is something that I know has legs and life, and I can do it."  And he looked at me, and he said, "I believe you; go make it happen.  You're now in charge of the whole company."  And we went from a period of losing money in one year, where we lost about $14 million, to making $22 million in profits the very next year.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: So it was a significant turnaround.  It was the first turnaround that I had ever been involved with.  It was my first time being a president and CEO.  And I always look back at it as a very special time, because I was working with some really special people who helped us to make that kind of turnaround in the business.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: The next steps then were to focus on which of these areas would be the most lucrative and which ones would really be the most lasting.  So it's almost like the old adage of, of, of why do you rob banks?  It's because that's where the money is.  And what we had found was that certain industries had higher appetites for doing this type of, of installation and implementation than others, so the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry was where we decided to focus.  And some of our customers became or, or are--were the largest healthcare companies in the world, particularly major multinational pharmaceutical companies.  And this is where my international career began to take off, because a lot of those pharmaceutical companies, their headquarters, are not in the United States.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: So I started to travel Europe and Southeast Asia and Australia, dealing with and interacting with these major healthcare companies and showing them how with our tools, our automation tools, that they could actually do a better job of selling and marketing their products and services.
Speaker 2: What companies where there?
Speaker 1: Literally every major pharmaceutical company in the world was one of our customers.  So from Merck [Merck and Co., Inc.] to Abbott in Chicago [Illinois], Abbott Labs [Abbott Laboratories], Ciba-Geigy [Novartis AG].  You, you name it, any pharmaceutical company, we worked with them.
Story_ID: 565104
Speaker 1: I think probably that was where the real shift in my own management career took place.  The--all the stuff that I had learned up to that point prepared me for what was about to happen next, which was trying to take a company public.  And it was something I had never done before.  It was a little bit scary.  And I got a chance to do it with a, a strong group of people that some had had that experience in the past, but it was a revelation for me to recognize that to be successful, it was more than just running the business, that now you had to court investors.  You had to look at what type of shareholders you wanted to have as investors in your business.  Not all investors are really good investors for your company.  You have different types of shareholders, not just individual versus institutional, but even within the individual and institutional people have different goals and objectives.  There are some investors that are willing to accept you not paying a dividend.  There are other investors that that's what they live for.  If they don't get the dividend, they sell the stock and get out of it.  And you don't want to have a lot of volatility in your stock price.  So all of those were things that I started to learn, things that previously I had only been worried about, making sure the company [Sales Technologies, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia] was running properly and profitably.  Now, I had to deal with Wall Street analysts thought about the future of the business and who the competition was and what new (background noise)--
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: This was where I really had to recognize that just running the business was not enough, that these other consti- constituencies were a huge part of whether or not we were going to be successful going forward.  And the picking of who you wanted to have as an investor in your company was something that I had to become adept at pretty quickly, because if you had the wrong types of investors, you could inflict real volatility in your stock price, and you didn't want to have that.  That, combined with dealing with these analysts, some who were really sharp and knew an awful lot about the business, and yet, you had some at the other scale who didn't have a clue.  And yet, you would be there at these, these meetings on Wall Street, and they would just be peppering you with these questions, and you had to learn how to answer them and how to deal with them.  And of course all of the regulatory issues that went along with being a publicly traded company.  So that was another real significant evolution in my business life.  When I combine that with the fact that I then became responsible for an international company, you can see how my business acumen had to improve and increase if I was going to be successful with these additional responsibilities.  And that was another one of those soul searching times where you kind of find out who you are and what you're really capable of.  I knew I could run a business.  I wasn't sure because I had never done it before, whether or not I could run a publicly traded company, and boy did I find out.
Speaker 2: And you found out that you could do it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Found out that I could; found out what it took to do so.  And it's amazing because you, you build up these images for yourself about other people when you see people.  I remember for years I had seen people being interviewed about what the future held for their companies, and what the revenue stream was gonna be the right--like, and what the earnings per share would be in a given quarter.  And I used to wonder, how do they do that?  How do you know that?  And the reality is you don't.  And you learn how to talk about things in a way that makes you believable.  And you don't paint an exceptionally rosy picture, and yet at the same time, you don't want to be gloom and doom, and you try to keep an even keel.  And one of the things that I became known for was telling the analysts that were so enamored with the numbers--they wanted to know: what are the numbers?  What are numbers?  I said, "Let me explain something to you guys about the numbers: the numbers allow you to anticipate.  They don't allow you to predict, and you need to understand that.  Because if you try to use these numbers to predict what's gonna happen in the future, you're gonna get yourself in trouble."  And I remember specifically after being interviewed by a couple of analysts, they said that was the smartest things that they had heard in a very long time, because several of the other CEOs they had interacted with always tried to tell them that based on what the numbers said, you could extrapolate exactly what the business was gonna do going forward, and nothing could be further from the truth.
Story_ID: 565105
Speaker 1: So, continuing on, what happens next in your career?
Speaker 2: Well, this was the time period where I mentioned earlier that the international business really came into play.  We had a competitor in Europe and Southeast Asia that was also doing what is now being referred to as CRM or customer relationship management: how you keep track of who all of your customers are; who's calling on these customers; what contacts do you have with those customers; when do those contracts expire; what kind of discounts do you have in place with them.  We automated all of that, and allowed people to actually carry that information around on a laptop with them.  This was another one of those pivotal moments.  I remember we had the meeting, the very first meeting after the company had been bought out, the competitor had been bought out, and we had it in Scotland.  And my remembrance was that I was the only black person that I saw the entire time that I was in Scotland.  And I stayed at what was then the most fabulous hotel in Scotland called the Gleneagles Hotel [Auchterarder, Scotland].  And I remember speaking to my wife [Deborah Peyton Brown] and my mother [Bettye Belton Williams] and saying I've never seen grass this green before in my life at this hotel.  And all of the people were there from different parts of the world.  And we were trying to figure out how we were gonna put this company together; and what kind of projections we would have for the future of that company.  Learning people, the different accents, different cultures.  Some cultures that had been at war with each other forever; how were you gonna make those people work together; what were the, the tools you had available to you to get them to recognize that we were all in the same boat, and that boat was either gonna rise or sink collectively.  But just some of the best times of learning about other people's lives and what was important to them and how they got to where they were.  Now this was still part of a spinout from the Dun and Bradstreet Corporation [Dun and Bradstreet, Inc.].  And we were part of a company that was then called IMS [IMS Health].  And IMS was the parent company, if you will, to Sales Technologies [Sales Technologies, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And once we bought our largest competitor, we changed the name to Strategic Technologies [IMS Health Strategic Technologies, Inc.].  And at that point, I was responsible for offices in thirty-two different countries.  So I had to learn and figure out how to pace myself and not be a domestic person, where, yes, I would fly to New York [New York] or to California or to Chicago [Illinois].  That was nothing compared to having to be at meetings in Tokyo [Japan], and in Australia, and in Singapore, and in Spain, and in Germany.  And that was another one of those really significant learning experiences for me, because now there was nobody else to point to; it was me.  I was responsible for this thirty-two country, over two thousand person organization that was in this IT [information technology] world doing the latest and the greatest with all of the new technologies that were available at the time.  And for that kid that had grown up in Bessemer, Alabama, this was a long way away from that, had to do a variety of different things.  I remember something being really important, and I had to take the Concorde [Aerospatiale/BAC Concorde], because that's how important things were from a time factor.  And I had always wondered what could be big enough to make somebody have to take the Concorde across the Atlantic Ocean?  And here I was doing so.  And by the way, it was not nearly as comfortable as the regular airlines were.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because of the shape and everything that had to be done to reach those speeds, it was actually kind of cramped.  So I'm glad to be able to say that I've did it while it was still flying.  But other than it shortening the trip across the ocean, it really wasn't a very comfortable thing to do.
Story_ID: 565106
Speaker 1: If we think about this, though, from the standpoint of my own personal career, that was where I think the next step was really taken.  I was dealing with a lot of people that were older than me and that had an awful lot of experience.  And how did you meld that into a company where everybody's input was needed but leadership is actually a lonely position?  By definition, leadership is not a group activity.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, even though we had all of these other people and they had all of these other capabilities, the buck actually did stop with me.  And to say grace over an empire of that size, was something that I was still learning how to do.  And fortunately, I learned relatively quickly, and we were able to take that company [IMS Health Strategic Technologies, Inc.] and do some significant things in the marketplace and become a leader that other people would come to us for insight and wisdom about what was going to happen next.  So that was also my first opportunity to travel in a private jet that I was controlling.  So the Gulfstream IV was at--was available to me.  And I remember doing something that previously I had only either read about in books or seen in movies, where I visited six different countries in five days.  And the only way that you really could do that throughout Western Europe is if you were doing it by private jet.  And again, that was a, a long way from 9 Center Street in Bessemer, Alabama, when before the jet was coming to pick me up, they had the people to call ahead of time and ask what I wanted to have on board to eat for the trip.  And I just remember thinking: you probably have come a very long way right now when the Saturday before you're leaving on a Monday, people are calling you to ask you what kind of food you'd like to have on board the jet before we head to Europe.  It was one of those little moments in time that after I hung up the phone I remembered going and telling my wife [Deborah Peyton Brown].  I said, "You will not believe what that call was.  They just wanted to find out what kind of food I wanted to have on the corporate jet."
Story_ID: 565107
Speaker 1: And speaking about your wife, is your family growing now?
Speaker 2: Growing now?  No (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, no, at this time, we're, we're in '98 [1998] through 2000--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you've had some children, is, is what my question is (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.  I, I, I, I (laughter), I thought you were talking about right now.  No, no, definitely not now.  Those boys are seventeen and fifteen years old.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And yes, they were on the scene.  And, and this was also something that I had to learn to cope with, being away from my family.  And one of the things that we had done prior to that was to, to bring my wife [Deborah Peyton Brown] home and have her work in the home and raise our children.  My wife, who is significantly smarter than I am, was in charge of the pricing area for the Federal Reserve Bank, the sixth district of the Federal Reserve Bank based here in Atlanta [Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia].  And we made a conscious decision that the way things were moving, it was gonna be important for our children to have one of their parents around more times than not.  And with my travel schedule, it wasn't gonna be me.  And my wife retired from the Federal Reserve Bank and stayed home with our children.
Speaker 1: And tell me your children's names?
Speaker 2: Jarrod [Jarrod Brown] is my oldest; he's seventeen.  And Jordan [Jordan Brown] is our youngest; he's fifteen.
Story_ID: 565108
Speaker 1: So what happens next in your career?
Speaker 2: Well, next was taking the company public, outside of IMS [IMS Health].  So we then decided that it would make more sense, and economically and every other way, to not be attached to this larger company, IMS, and to take Strategic Technologies [IMS Health Strategic Technologies, Inc.] out from under that and take it public by itself.  So we had to come up with a new name.  We had to decide how we were going to deal with all of the other analysts, because now it was gonna be even different from dealing with the Wall Street analysts when you were part of the IMS conglomerate.  And we named the company Synavant [Synavant, Inc.], S-Y-N-A-V-A-N-T.  Because of the fact that we were in so many different parts around the, the world, we didn't want to have something that just sounded like a, a totally American name.  This was actually borrowed from the French.  And we took the company public on NASDAQ.  And I always say to people that I've had the opportunity to ring the bell to open the New York Stock Exchange [New York, New York] and push the button to open NASDAQ, and that is something that is part of my career I'm actually very proud of because a lot of people only get to see that on television.  And I've actually done it on both exchanges, and that was a pretty big deal.  When we took IMS public, it was when I got a chance to do it on--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) the New York Stock Exchange.
Speaker 1: --Stock Exchange.
Speaker 2: And when we took Synavant public, I got to push the button NASDAQ--
Speaker 1: NASDAQ.
Speaker 2: --and that was a pretty big deal.
Speaker 1: I'm sure it was.  So this company was take public in 2000?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what happened with the company once it went public?
Speaker 2: Well, a variety of different things happen, not the least of which was we started making money, even more money, and other people started looking at the company as an acquisition target.  And we ultimately sold Synavant to one of our competitors [Dendrite International, Inc.].  And my favorite phrase about that is that I made lot of money for other people, but I also kept some for myself.  And I was actually able to retire after we sold that company.
Speaker 1: That's great.
Speaker 2: And that is what actually led me to being on the board at the Atlanta Life Financial Group [Atlanta, Georgia].  Shortly before that happened, I became a board member.  And it was one of the best things that had ever happened to me, because I got a chance to do something that I felt was really important here with a black company.
Story_ID: 565109
Speaker 1: Tell me a little more about your decision to come aboard the, as CEO--well, well, as on the, a board member, I'm sorry, for Atlanta Life [Atlanta Life Financial Group, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Well, I had one of my college friends, Bruce Dobbs, to introduce me to Bill Clement [HistoryMaker William A. Clement, Jr.].  And I met Mr. Clement.  We hit it off immediately, thought he was a wonderful guy.  He is a wonderful guy.  And he was looking for an additional board member; he was expanding the board here at Atlanta Life and wanted to know if I would be interested, so I interviewed with him and the then-CEO.  And I said this would actually give me an opportunity to use some of the experience and expertise that I had gleaned over the years of taking companies public and dealing with different people internationally, that maybe I could apply some of that to an institution like Atlanta Life.  So I said yes, and they brought me on the board, and I was working here--not working here but working with the board and with the then, who, who is now Mayor Shirley Franklin, was also on the board of Atlanta Life.  And I got a chance to spend some time around her before she became the mayor and looked at what could be done to make sure that this institution was gonna be viable and vibrant for the next several decades.  So I was really interested in what I might be able to bring to the table.  And there were some issues with the company.  Company history, of course, having been started by a former slave in 1905, Alonzo Franklin Herndon [Alonzo Herndon], and had gone through a lot of the ups and downs that insurance companies go to but had survived them all.  I mean from both world wars [World War I, WWI and World War II, WWII] to Vietnam [Vietnam War] to the Depression [Great Depression] to everything else, Atlanta Life was still standing.  And I thought that was a strong testament to all of the different people that had been in charge here since 1905.
Story_ID: 565110
Speaker 1: Did you know a lot about the history of Atlanta Life [Atlanta Life Financial Group, Atlanta, Georgia] when you came on board as a board member?
Speaker 2: I had heard, I had been hearing about Atlanta Life since I was a child.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, a lot of the specifics, no, I didn't know.  And I learned those after I started doing my own investigation before I actually became a board member, the different people, most specifically Jesse Hill, that had done things using the platform of Atlanta Life to make things better for people of color not only throughout the City of Atlanta [Georgia] but throughout the nation because of his activism.  And you could even go all the way back to the, the Niagara Movement, the precursor to the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], one of the founding members was Alonzo Franklin Herndon [Alonzo Herndon].
Speaker 1: Can you just lay out the history for me?
Speaker 2: The company was formed in--or started in 1905 by Alonzo Franklin Herndon, who, again, was a former slave and made his money initially, initially with barbershops.  He had what was then referred to as the finest barbershop in the Southeast, and all of his customers were white.  And they did not even know that Mr. Herndon owned the barbershop.  They thought he worked there.  And to make them feel comfortable, he actually would enter through the back door of his own establishment.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So he saved enough money to purchase what?
Speaker 2: He, he purchased an insurance company that was struggling.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What--at that point, somebody just said, "I don't want to see the business go away, and I will sell it to you."  And when he purchased it that was the beginning of what we now know as the Atlanta Life Insurance Company [Atlanta Life Financial Group, Atlanta, Georgia].  And of course, he bought additional companies along the way and started to grow it, and Mr. Herndon became the first black millionaire in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Is it true that the company that he purchased initially he bought for a hundred and forty-five dollars?
Speaker 2: A hundred and forty [dollars].
Speaker 1: A hundred and forty.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  And so tell me more about the history.
Speaker 2: Well, I think that when you start talking about a hundred years, there's a lot of history.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But one of the things that Mr. Herndon stood for was to try to give people what I'll loosely call economic dignity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there wasn't a lot of that.  During that time period, even if you had money, and you were a black person, you might not be able to get a proper burial because the white organizations just would not sell you insurance.  So at a minimum, people wanted to be able to be buried properly.  And a lot of folks realized that that was much less of a traumatic impact on a family if you had burial insurance.  So that's how things started.  It started as burial insurance versus life insurance, if you will--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and the company grew from there.  Now you've got so many decades to go through, but that was the origin and to make sure that people were able to know while they were still alive that they weren't going to be a burden to their family when they passed on.  And that was one of the most significant parts of the economic dignity that Mr. Herndon was striving for when he started this company.
Speaker 1: Right.  He saw a need, and he wanted to feel that need.  Is that right?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It, it was something that: one, you couldn't, you couldn't get it, not because you couldn't afford it, but because they refused to sell it to you.  And that was a very big deal because everybody wanted to be able to have some form of economic dignity, and not the least of which was to be able to not become a burden to your family after death.  And Mr. Herndon, via the Atlanta Life Insurance Company, was providing that dignity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was added next to the company?  There's, there were two units.  Is that right?
Speaker 2: Well, there are today.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But for a long time, Atlanta Life was just that; it was a life insurance company.  And it became one of the largest by being very good at acquisitions, acqui- acquiring other African American insurance companies and making them part of the Atlanta Life Insurance Company.  At one point in time, Atlanta Life was the largest African American insurance company in the nation.  And that was the result of buying other companies in different parts around the country, from Florida to Chicago [Illinois] and even some of the western states.
Speaker 1: The company has been in existence for a hundred years.  And you are the sixth president?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So a lot of long living people have been part of this, not the least of which was Mr. Herndon's son, who ran the company for decades, Norris Herndon [Norris Bumstead Herndon].  And then you had somebody like Jesse Hill, who was also here for a couple of decades.  So it is really something to say that you're a president and CEO of the Atlanta Life Financial Group, knowing that since 1905 there's only been six.

Speaker 1: How did that make you feel to be offered the position of actually coming--being a board member and then being asked to head up this historic company?
Speaker 2: Well, I always say that my fellow directors tricked me into it, and it was because I talked too much during some of the board meetings.  The reality is this was my chance to do something that I genuinely cared about for some people that I genuinely cared about.  A lot of the work that I had done in the past was for economic reasons.  It was to make sure that I was gonna be able to take care of my family, make sure that if I didn't want to work anymore, that I wouldn't have to.  But this was your classic labor of love, if you will.  This was something that I knew if I was successful at it, the impact would be extremely broad and for an awful lot of people.  And that's what made it intriguing to me.  And I sat down and discussed it with my wife [Deborah Peyton Brown].  And she said, "If you feel that strongly about it, I will support you in it, and let's do it."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And as of March of 2004, that's when I accepted the position of the CEO for the Atlanta Life Financial Group [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: What strengths did you see in the company when you came?
Speaker 2: Oh, the people, the people and certainly the brand.  The brand is one that is, it just resonates wherever you go.  I always tell the story that I was in Cleveland [Ohio] for an NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] event shortly after I had become the new CEO here.  And a woman came up to me at the event, and she said, "You're the new head person at Atlanta Life, aren't you?"  She said, "I've read something about you."  And I said, "Yes, I am."  And she said, "Well, I want you to know I was a calendar girl for Atlanta Life back in the '40s [1940s]."  And I didn't know what a calendar girl was.  I did a little digging in my history and found out that they would actually send out calendars to all of the policyholders, and they would send pictures of the employees, the very attractive girls, if you will, that worked for the company. And she said that was her first job ever and how much it meant to her, how much Atlanta Life meant to her.  And I have found that traveling around the country, that every city that I go in, especially where there are people that have been around for a while, black people that have been in business for themselves, they all know about Atlanta Life and the legacy that it had.  So, it was one of those things that it was the right platform; the brand was a very powerful brand, brand; and yet we also knew that the business was changing and that the way Atlanta Life had been profitable in the past was not how it was gonna be profitable going forward.
Speaker 1: So what were some of the problems that needed your attention?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that there were issues surrounding what the strategy was for growing the business.  The business was functional.  There were--you know, different parts of the business were making money.  There had been a decision made even prior to me coming on board to go into the asset management business, which I think and still think was a brilliant decision.  The question was, how were you gonna make it successful and by when?  And what else did that mean?  Because one of my other favorite phrases is that whenever you say yes to one thing, you're automatically saying no to something else.  And you need to be aware of what it is that you're saying no to.  So when we said yes to the asset management business, we were saying no to something else, to several other things, candidly.  And that's okay, as long as you know that and you understand that, because you can't do everything, especially not simultaneously.  So we had to stop doing what I will call the industrial insurance, the kind where, you know, the person came and knocked on your grandmother's door to collect the, the two dollars or whatever it was every month for that insurance.  The, the, the marketplace, the dynamic, just the times, everything says you weren't gonna be successful doing that anymore.  You might have sold a lot of insurance premiums, but the cost was gonna be prohibitive for you to try to stay in business that way.
Story_ID: 565112
Speaker 1: So tell me, how, how is the company set up now, and how did you realign the company?
Speaker 2: Well, now, there is the umbrella company, which is the Atlanta Life Financial Group [Atlanta, Georgia].  And underneath that umbrella, you have the Atlanta Life Insurance Company; you have the Atlanta Life Investment Advisors [Atlanta Life Investment Advisors, LLC; Herndon Capital Management, LLC]; and now, based on our re- recent acquisition, you also have Jackson Securities [Jackson Securities LLC], which is a broker, dealer, and an investment bank.  So the parent is ALFG, the Atlanta Life Financial Group, and those other subsidiaries fit up under that umbrella.  Within the insurance company, which is one of the legs on that stool, if you will, we have a preneed business and our group business.  So we're not selling individual insurance policies anymore; we sell group reinsurance now.  And the reinsurance is because no single insurance company wants to absorb all of the risk themselves.  So, say you go to a Fortune 500 company and say, "I want to be your life insurance company."  Even if you win, you don't want to retain all of that risk yourself.  So we partnered with several of the majority insurance firms, and we reinsure the policies that they've written.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.  And the preneed?
Speaker 2: Preneed is kind of a, a back to the future for us.  Preneed is just what the name says: it allows you to do the planning before or pre, before you need it.  Most people go in, and especially when it comes to burials and, and funeral plans, they do it at need.  And that can be the most traumatic, the most difficult time.  And preneed allows you to not only pay for your own funeral before it happens but to make sure that you're in charge of how it's actually gonna be done.  You pick out--and this sounds morbid, but to my knowledge, we all have to leave here someday.  And how great it would be to not have that burden be on a family member because preneed-ing it, you've taken care of all of that.  And that is a very--it's a growing business, particularly in the majority community, and we are bringing it to the minority community.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and how are you doing that?  Are you--what is your relationship with the community as far as churches and different organizations in the community?
Speaker 2: Well, it's, it's, it's, it, first of all, it's extremely high.  And a lot of that is historical, because Atlanta Life has been one of the sources for financial backing for decades, particularly in Atlanta [Georgia], but not just in Atlanta.  There was a time when people could not get mortgages.  There was a time when people couldn't get loans to build some of the most fabulous churches that we see now dotted across the South.  Guess where they came?  They came to Atlanta Life to receive those mortgages, to get that money.  And some of the biggest churches around now got their start or their initial funding to build those, those sanctuaries from Atlanta Life.  The same thing is true with a lot of the educational institutions.  Atlanta Life not only donated a lot of money to the Atlanta University Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia], all the schools in the center, but it was one of the places where when those graduates finished, that they could come and work.  So the relationship in the community is a significant one.  If you noticed on the marquee in our building here, we house the southeastern branch of Rainbow PUSH [Rainbow PUSH Coalition], is in the Atlanta Life building, so is the Peoples' Coalition [Coalition for the People's Agenda] with Reverend Lowery [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Joseph Lowery]; it's housed here in this building.  So are the 100 Black Men of Atlanta [100 Black Men of Atlanta, Inc.], housed in the Atlanta Life building.
Story_ID: 565113
Speaker 1: Tell me about--there's a, a senior program or a retirement program that Atlanta Life [Atlanta Life Financial Group, Atlanta, Georgia] works with?
Speaker 2: A retirement program?
Speaker 1: It's a--I, I believe, I believe it was a program where senior citizens that did not have, or would not have enough money for their retirement, there's some program through the church that Atlanta Life is working with.
Speaker 2: Well, certainly there are a variety of different things that we offer using insurance products like annuities that help people with their retirement if they haven't taken care of it previously.  And Atlanta Life works with some of the other large insurance carriers to provide and make those annuity products available to institutions like churches.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's not a primary focus of our business though.
Speaker 1: Right.  I was really just thinking I, I, I read something about that.  And, and, and I'm not sure, but I knew that Atlanta Life worked with the community, and that was just something else I was trying to bring out.  Well, tell me what is ahead for Atlanta Life?
Speaker 2: Well, being a true financial services institution is what we are becoming, where insurance is an important part, but it's not the only part.  The fastest growing segment of our business today is our asset management business.  And when we started out, when I started out, we had about $7 million of external money under management.  I call it other people's money.  And now we have over 800 million, and we are headed towards a billion in assets under management.  That's pretty rapid growth to go from 7 million to over 800 million, and it's because we have some of the best portfolio managers in the world working here.  And large institutions, pension funds, the municipalities, Fortune 500 companies, they are chasing and looking for that performance, and that's why we are able to manage money for them.  If you were to look at the list of who we manage money for, it reads like a virtual who's who of the Fortune 100.
Speaker 1: I see, I see.  To go back to the question I was asking you, is there a relationship with MetLife Insurance [Metropolitan Life Insurance Company]?
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a significant relationship.
Speaker 1: And the retirement education program was what I was trying to allude to that connected to the churches.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And tell me, tell me about the relationship with MetLife.
Speaker 2: Well, it's, it's one of those win-win situations.  It started out with our group reinsurance business--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --where MetLife and Atlanta Life would go in together to, say, Coca-Cola [The Coca-Cola Company, Atlanta, Georgia] and say, "We want to be your life insurer."  And they'd look at MetLife; they'd look at Atlanta Life and say, "Okay, this looks like something that we can do."  And we would then do the underwriting for the life insurance for all of their employees.  So we started doing that with MetLife, and we did it consistently, and we did it well for several years.  And once we decided to go into the asset management business, the same person at MetLife that made the decision to partner with Atlanta Life to do the group reinsurance business was the same person that made the decisions about whether or not or who was going to manage the assets that MetLife had.  And we got one of the largest allocations from a single entity from MetLife.
Story_ID: 565114
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we have not talked about, about Atlanta Life [Atlanta Life Financial Group, Atlanta, Georgia] that you would like to, to tell us?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's important to recognize that a major part of Atlanta Life's history took place during the civil rights era.  And it took place during Jesse Hill's tenure when actually allowed Atlanta Life employees to leave work and go and work as deputized individuals to register people to vote in the City of Atlanta [Georgia].  And all of the progress that we've seen here in the City of Atlanta now, particularly the diversification process, a lot of that stemmed from the work that was done by Atlanta Life employees and that they were given the opportunity to do that because of the vision that, that Jesse Hill had for what this city could be and what the southeast could be.  So everything from having the phones answered here from the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] when they were trying to tap all of Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] phones, to in this very room where we are right now, the funeral arrangements for Coretta Scott King were made with all of the King children sitting in some of the same chairs that we're sitting in right now.
Story_ID: 565115
Speaker 1: Anything else about Atlanta Life [Atlanta Life Financial Group, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's important to recognize that Atlanta Life has decided to be one of the major players in the education of finance to the minority community.  So we believe in not just doing what is profitable, and this gets back to comments that you'll hear me say all the time about Atlanta Life having a double bottom line.  Everybody understands the profit bottom line, but we also believe that there is a social bottom line.  And we strongly believe that, and we put our money where our mouth is with the programs that we support, everything from the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] to the Butler Street Y [Butler Street YMCA, Atlanta, Georgia] to the Herndon Elementary School [A.F. Herndon Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia], which is named after Alonzo Franklin Herndon [Alonzo Herndon], and what we do at the different colleges and high schools to make sure that our children understand the important of finance early on in their lives so they can make better decisions and have a better economic future.  And that has always been something that Atlanta Life wanted to do, and it certainly is something that we will carry forward in the future.  The acquisition of Jackson Securities [Jackson Securities LLC], the firm started by Maynard Jackson back in 1987, continues to help us to do that because of now we have those additional products and services, everything from your standard broker dealership to municipal finance to corporate finance that allows us to do more things for more customers and different types of people.  So the firm overall is growing as a financial services entity, much more than just a life insurance company.
Story_ID: 565116
Speaker 1: Tell me about the other organizations that you are involved in?
Speaker 2: Personally, I happen to be (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Personally.
Speaker 2: --a, a member of the 100 Black Men [100 Black Men of Atlanta, Inc.].  I sit on the board of directors at Philander Smith College out in Arkansas [Little Rock, Arkansas].  I am a mentor at my alma mater, Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia], where I've taken on several mentees and helped guide them with their business future, which is one of the most rewarding things that I've done.  I sit on the board of the Georgia Power Company, which is the largest subsidiary of the Southern Company, the board of visitors for Emory hospitals [Emory Healthcare, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia], and a series of other institutions that I have lent some of my time and energy to, from the Boy Scouts of America to teaching at the Goizueta Business School here at Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia].  So there's no shortage of things to, to, to keep me busy.  And I enjoy it all, especially the things that allow me to do things for other people.
Story_ID: 565117
Speaker 1: Tell me, what are your hopes and dreams for the African American community?
Speaker 2: The first one, of course, would just to be knowledgeable, knowledgeable about what's possible, what's available.  I've always believed that people become more responsible the more knowledgeable that they are.  Usually when people don't take responsibility--people don't take responsibility for things that they don't know about and specifically for things that they didn't do.  If I get drunk and go out and wreck the car, you're not gonna go and take a drunk driving course.  You didn't do; I did it.  So, the whole thing about taking the responsibility for yourself and your family, I think becomes a simpler and more realistic process the more knowledgeable you are.  One of the biggest reasons that people don't do well is because they don't have the tools to do well with.  I always use an example to say that, with your best intentions, if I asked you to go outside and cut down that big tree in the parking lot here, and what I gave you was a fingernail file, you don't have the right tools to get it done.  I don't care how motivated you are; that's gonna be very frustrating for you, and it's gonna take you a very long time to make that happen versus if I gave you a power saw and asked you to cut down that same tree.  So we want to provide tools to the community that allow them to make better decisions sooner rather than later.  Because one of the things that happens, unfortunately, and has happened in this community is that there's been an absence of knowledge and understanding about what was possible.  And we're gonna take that away, not only by providing loans in some areas but making sure that people have the right level of understanding about what they can do.
Story_ID: 565118
Speaker 1: When you look back over your life, is there anything that you would change or anything that you regret?
Speaker 2: Regret, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Change, I wish that maybe I had traveled sooner internationally and gotten a better feel for just how similar we all really are as human beings.  I didn't, I didn't know that for sure until I was an adult.  And I've made sure that my own children [Jarrod Brown and Jordan Brown] have traveled internationally at an early age and interacted with other people so that different doesn't have to be viewed as bad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's just different.
Speaker 1: Different, okay.
Story_ID: 565119
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered, or what, what legacy would you want to leave behind?
Speaker 2: Well, it's much more important to me to, to leave behind a service legacy than any personal accomplishments.  Sometimes, truthfully, you have to have the personal accomplishments before you're given the platform to do what you want to do, which is the service to many.  And one of the ways that I make decisions about what I do and don't do is based on two criteria.  One is that's--what is it that's best for the largest number of people?  And the second criteria is, over the longest period of time.  And I'd like to do a really good job of making decisions that way more times than not.  And if I can do that, I'll be able to, or somebody else will be able to look back on this life and say that it was a life well lived.
Story_ID: 565120
Speaker 1: Because this interview will be viewed by the future generations, what message would you like to send to the future generations?
Speaker 2: Probably a lot of messages, but I'll, I'll, I'll distill it down for you.  And, and the first one is to be confident.  And confidence is really a derivative of two things, my opinion: it's attitude and expertise.  You can make sure that--you can make sure that you have the right attitude, but it's incumbent upon you to go out and get the expertise, and that will drive your confidence.  You feel better about things that you are knowledgeable about.  And early in my life, in my working career, I was not as confident as I should have been, and that was because my attitude was wrong.  It was wrong about how I felt about other people, thinking when I was in my twenties that maybe other people were better than I was, and that I should take a subservient role to them.  I remember hearing when I first started working about all of the different graduate degrees that people had gotten and what their titles were.  And I came to find out over time that that really didn't mean anything as far as their competence was concerned.  So I would want all of the future generations, the young people to work on your confidence as early as possible, and again, that is the derivative of the two things.  It's not just walking around having a confident attitude.  You also have to have the expertise to back it up.  So it's attitude and expertise, and your confidence will soar, and that will allow you to feel good enough about yourself to do anything.  I, I think the, the other message, if you will, that I would offer to future generations is to be seekers of the truth.  The truth is something that is actually rare these days because so many people are dealing with and coloring things by what is in their best interest as opposed to what is true.  And when you find out what the facts are, it keeps you from being prejudiced.  You see, opinion without actual data, information or facts to back it up is really nothing more than prejudice.  And you don't want to be prejudiced.  So make sure that before you offer an opinion about something, that that's really what it is and that it is based on some data, some factual information that you've been able to find out.  'Cause if you offer the opinion without the information or the data, you are really just expressing a prejudice.  And for future generations, we've already had enough people to be prejudice, so don't add to it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I want to thank you for taking the time to share your story and to do this interview.  And I'm sure it will be an inspiration to the future generations.
Speaker 2: Well, thank you very much for taking the time to listen to all of this.  And I'm looking forward to what the finished product looks like.
