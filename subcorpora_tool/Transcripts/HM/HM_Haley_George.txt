Speaker 1: So, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [George] Haley, the next couple of questions are some very lighthearted People magazine-ish type questions.

I can't do everything, but I can do something.  And because I cannot do everything, I will not refuse to do the something that I can do," [Edward Everett Hale].  That's my phrase for myself and my philosophy of thinking in terms of other people as well.
Story_ID: 216150
Speaker 1: Now, tell me a little bit about your mother.  What was her name, where was she born, and where did she grow up?
Speaker 2: All right.  My mother, my mother was Bertha Palmer Haley.  She was born in Henning, Tennessee.  She grew up there and, and went to, to college first at Lane College [Jackson, Tennessee] which is where she and my father [Simon Haley] met.  And well, she, she and my dad, I'm having to do both perhaps at the same time, (laughter) she and my dad [Simon Haley] met at Lane and then dad went into the service, the First World War [World War I, WWI].  And then they, when he came back they got married and went to, to Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York]--I'm sorry, Ithaca, New York.  Dad to work on his master's [degree], and she was at the Ithaca Conservatory of Music [Ithaca College, Ithaca, New York].  Now, the--I was born as I said in 1925, Alex [Haley] was born in 1921.  And my mother and dad went to Lane--I'm sorry, dad was teaching at Langston University [Langston, Oklahoma].  That's where she was, and then we moved from there to Alabama A&M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University (AAMU); State Agricultural and Mechanical Institute for Negroes] in Huntsville [sic. Normal, Alabama], and this is where my mother died.  My mother died when Alex was ten, I was six and we had a baby brother, Julius [Haley] who was just a baby.
Story_ID: 216151
Speaker 1: Did she [Haley's mother, Bertha Palmer Haley] ever share any stories with you about her growing up, how she grew up, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: A few, not too many.  As I said, I remember just the love of a mother as a six year old and, of course, now as old as I am, I still am all but traumatized by the fact that she wasn't with us, you know, longer than that.  And you talk about sharing stories.  I guess, the two things I remember most about sharing was Christmas.  When, say I was three in Langston [Oklahoma] and mother and dad [Simon Haley], we called her Mama, and dad got us ready for Christmas, you know, and its, that's the main thing I remember, really, really remember about what happened as a youngster with her.  And they were preparing Alex [Haley] and me for Christmas, "Santa Claus is coming, if you, if you do, you know, you're good boys, he'll come, he may even, he may even have a rest stop here 'cause he's got all of these millions of houses to, you know, bring presents to but if you're good, he might even stay here for a little bit."  We were just fascinated.  We, with them made signs for Santa.  We had a long, long drive way, Santa a rest stop, a rest stop for you.  Sure enough, Santa, you know, on Christmas Eve or Christmas morning, we got downstairs and, and Santa not only had come but I just remember seeing all these things, toys and clothes and whatnot.  I was just fascinated.  But the thing that fascinated me most, was the fact that Santa had come and stayed there as a rest stop.  There were three coffee cups on the table.  And Santa's cup was there.  I looked and saw oh, he didn't drink all of his coffee.  And Mama had made coconut cakes which was my favorite, and chocolate cake which was Alex's favorite, and Santa had a little bit of that left on either saucer.  I was just fascinated with that.  In addition to that, it had snowed and dad had gotten out and, and put some sleigh, some tracks on, on the roof, you understand, all of that.  Now, we'd go to grandma's [Cynthia Murray Palmer] in Henning [Tennessee] which is where, where my mother was born.  And we would go there in the summertime.  So that was really home for us but she was my grandmother's only child.  And my grandfather [Will Palmer] had already died.  So it was back and forth from the college [Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma] to home.
Story_ID: 216152
Speaker 1: The other was the more, trauma, traumatic thing, of course.  When we moved to Alabama A&M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University (AAMU); State Agricultural and Mechanical Institute for Negroes, Normal, Alabama], Mama [Bertha Palmer Haley] was ill and she died there.  And you talk about the experience of my life was I recall one of Dad's [Simon Haley] students came down, I was in first grade.  And one of dad's students came down to, and spoke to my teacher and said, "Professor Haley wants [HistoryMaker] George [Haley] to come home right away because his mother is not doing well."  And he rushed me, I remember this because he was a tall guy and, and was had me literally running across campus.  I got home, everybody was around the bed, dad had brought her in from the hospital and, and so, and in a few minutes after I got there, the doctor said, "Well, she's dead."  Nobody said anything until the six year old pipes up, that's me, and I said, "Well, Dad, how can Mama be dead when her eyes are still open?"  And when I said that my father came to me and just, just was crying like if I can always feel you, just crushing me, crushing me.  And when he started that, it seemed like everybody else just started crying then, you understand?  And it was that kind of experience that I have lived with because they said, "Well, now your mother's gone to live with God," you know.  In the business of Alabama I used to go up, look out at the skies and see if I could see my Mama up there, you know.  But it was, it was a short experience.  But at least that's pretty much the story of my mother and what it has meant, what she has meant to that extent.  And I'll share something else about her.  The next year, I was playing an orphan in one of the operettas our school down in the South had, big deal you, you know, as a school operetta and, the, the teacher did not necessarily know that my mother had died before, so I was playing an orphan.  And I had a little song to sing.  And it was, "Mother are you looking down from heaven's window high? Can you see your little boy or can you hear me cry?  Sometimes it's so hard to be unselfish, brave, and true.  Do you think that God would care if I would come to you?"  And I just used to sing that, as you can see, I mean as old as I am it, it, stays with me so much, but the significance and impact and meaning that, that had on me.  Of course, well, my brother had his, you know, Alex [Haley] and then my little brother [Julius Haley] who actually didn't remember our mother at all.  Now, Henning [Tennessee] be, became even more meaningful to us, that was where she was born and where my grandmother [Cynthia Murray Palmer] was.  She literally lived the rest of her life for her three grandsons, 'cause Mama Bertha was her only child.  And, and that was it.  That was home.  Okay.
Story_ID: 216153
Speaker 1: Now, tell me a little bit about your father.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) All right.
Speaker 1: Starting, please tell us his name and where he was born and where he grew up.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Dad his, his name was Simon Alexander Haley, okay.  He was born in Savannah, Tennessee which is kind of mid-Tennessee on the Savannah River.  His father [Alec Haley] was a ferry man across the Tennessee River, and, and also a farmer as well.  And he, actually, grew up there until the time he went to, to Lane College [Jackson, Tennessee] where he and my mother [Bertha Palmer Haley] met.  But his was a very, well, sharecropper kind of life.  They actually weren't that interested from the standpoint of his father in particular, of his going to school and, and, you know, being educated as such.  Their business was to try to get boys big enough in particular to start sharecropping, using their own abilities and skills.  My grandmother [Queen Haley] wanted to at least try to get him to go to school so they were able to get him out of there and he went to Lane.  Very, very, oh, I'd say poverty stricken but dad had a mind wanting to do something and he, and he had several jobs, went to, he stayed at Lane two years and then went to A&T [Negro Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], graduated from A&T and then was in the service, the World War I [WWI].  He was wounded in the Argonne [Meuse-Argonne Offensive], gassed in the Argonne [Forest, France].  Came back, and was able through grants and otherwise to, to do some graduate work.  Went to Cornell [University] in Ithaca [New York], which was fantastic for that time in the 1920s, you see, Dad was able to get things like that done.  As I say, he and my, he and my mother got married so she went with him to, to Ithaca. She working, she was a musician by the way, she was at the Ithaca Conservatory [Ithaca College, Ithaca, New York], and Dad was doing a master's [degree] in horticulture at Cornell.
Story_ID: 216154
Speaker 1: And I won't say backing up a bit but I've already told you my mother [Bertha Palmer Haley] died but, one of the things that I do recall as a youngster is she was the, she played the piano and dad [Simon Haley] sang.  He was a baritone.  And in Henning [Tennessee] and other places they would, they would, you know, he would sing and she would play.  Like, one of the songs he had was 'Mammy' and 'Danny Boy.'  He loved 'Danny Boy' and he'd play, she'd play that and he'd sing, "Oh, Danny Boy, Oh, Danny Boy," you know.  And after, let's say there, his completed his work at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York], 'cause Alex [Haley] was born there, Alex was born August 11, 1921 in, when they were still then in Ithaca.  They came back to Henning.  My grandfather [Will Palmer], maternal grandfather, had a lumber business [W.E. Palmer Lumber Company, Henning, Tennessee], very, the only one in the little town, very prosperous lumber business, and he really wanted dad to stay and run his company but dad was interested in trying to help others, I'm talking about other African Americans and through education.  So that's what he really built his life on, as his profession on.  He was in agriculture.  His first assignment after the, we came was at Langston [University] in [Langston] Oklahoma.  And then from there to Alabama A&M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University (AAMU); State Agricultural and Mechanical Institute for Negroes, Normal, Alabama] which is, is as I say where my mother died.  And just dad, you know, was left with his three young sons, Alex ten as I said, and myself at six, and Julius [Haley] was fourteen months, I believe.  Within a short time thereafter, dad married again.  My stepmother is Zeona Haley, who originally was from Columbus, Ohio.  She was a teacher at Alabama A&M.  They were married there.  And she had her master's in education.  So the two of them, of course, continued to, to bring up the three sons and we have a sister, the only girl in the family who, of course, was just adored by us all.  You know, Lois Ann, Lois Ann Haley, now Butts. She's a music teacher herself, now retired.
Story_ID: 216155
Speaker 1: Did your father [Simon Haley] ever share any stories with you about his growing up, how he grew up, and any particular stories he may have shared you, talked about?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  He would, he did, about, of course, his being--working on the farm [in Savannah, Tennessee], that kind of thing and what he was fascinated most with, of course, was, was going on the ferry with his dad [Alec Haley], his father.  And we, he would just tell us about sometimes the--my grandfather would let him wheel the ferry, you know, and when we were, when we'd go back to Savannah [Tennessee] on occasion and visit some of the other relatives, he'd take us down to the Tennessee River.  And, and he was talking about one time, the, the ferry moved away from the river, you understand, the bank of it, and a car ran into the river but not, yeah, I mean they were able to stop it, you know, before it just (laughter) got to, got too far.  And then, and that's, you know what, I don't remember too much other than the little school where he went, and one of the professors, the teachers who persuaded him to say, you know, you're smart enough I want you to do some other things.  You're going on to, to Lane College [Jackson, Tennessee].  So actually about his growing up, I don't recall too much that he--that he talked to us about.
Story_ID: 216156
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your ancestors.  And I know that you can trace your origin.  All right, so tell me a little bit about your ancestors?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now, one of the things that certainly is, is fascinating from our standpoint, and we talk about this, with Alex [Haley] and I used to say this is, we were in the process, I'm talking about African Americans with, say the generation in--particularly my father [Simon Haley] and mother's [Bertha Palmer Haley] generation who were really wanting to, to move away from the business and thoughts of slavery as such.  Here they were and others, I mean, I'm talking about that generation now, pushing and people who were in positions to say, hey look, to get from where we are now on say the American scene in particular, we need to push as far toward education as we can, and to move away from the dialects and the this and that and other.  And so for instance, you talk about things, when my mother and father came back from Ithaca [New York], I mean they, getting really kind of educated and trained now.  Grandma [Cynthia Murray Palmer], as I've said that they'd laugh about it, they, they grandma would say, "Bertha, go on in there and, going into the piano and play something for us."  And Bertha, my mother, would say, "Oh, Mom, it's not piano, it's piano.  And so grandma would say "P-I, spells pie don't it?" (Laughter) you know.  I mean that gives an example of the kinds of things.  They didn't really want--she didn't wanna talk too much about the Africa heritage.  Also, although they knew about it, what happened was when my mother died, and certainly it was not one of those things that would have come about anyway.  Grandma was in a better position to talk in terms of, of the African when we were growing because we went there every summer, you understand.  Not, let's say having to talk around my, my mother.  I hope you understand what I'm saying.  I mean it was more direct because there was grandma and Aunt Liz, Elizabeth [B. Murray], this was her sister who had come home after, come home from Oklahoma, incidentally she taught in Oklahoma but she, after my mother died she came to live with grandma.  And then others like Cousin Georgia who lived in Kansas City [Missouri].  And Aunt Till [ph.], Matilda [ph.], who lived in Jackson, Tennessee.  That generation would get there on grandma's porch and other places, and they were the ones who would talk about the African and other kinds of things like that.  And surely, I would listen, now I'm younger, of course, Alex was older, and it was kind of soaking in.  You know, when you're children, you, these things happen to you and you don't always, they're, they're and, and, and, you know, that they're there but, but they have to sometimes come out, and that's what was happening where we were concerned.  But the long and short of it is, we did listen.  And Alex used to talk, he got so amused at Aunt Liz for instance, they all put that [W.E.] Garret [& Sons] Snuff in and (laughter) and start, and Alex used to say--remember seeing Aunt Liz and sitting there moving her snuff around in her mouth and he said, 'cause he was the author, you know, he would see all these kinds of things and, and laugh about 'em.  But he says Aunt Liz could look out there and see a lightning bug many feet away and she could (laughter) hit that lightning bug and then say, "Yeah, that African could do so and so," (laughter) you know.  But that really, really did, was--say the pastime on summer evenings in which you, you sit out on the front porch, rocking the chairs, and then maybe we would be doing, what is it, "Last night, night before twenty-four robbers at my door," hide and go seek, you know, and this kind of thing.
Story_ID: 216157
Speaker 1: Tell me about some of the stories about Africa and the Africans that they [Haley's older relatives] would share with you.
Speaker 2: Well, actually about the, Chicken George and the ones who had come from North Carolina.  Chicken George was the one who actually came over to Henning [Tennessee].  And just the stories of how they had to, to avoid certain kinds of situations, you know.  And let's face it, that's happened the subtleties if you wanna say it, how they sometimes would, would laugh about certain things that did happen, that where white people would think that they were doing one thing and then they'd do another, you know.  And, and there was a lot of, let's say, a lot of reason for them and what the, they expressed their own hostilities, if you wanna say it, in many ways and it wasn't all that way.  Some of the people they recognized were, were more decent than others.  I mean, you know, whites who were interested in trying to help.  And sometimes whites would do this and sometimes they wouldn't.  I don't really recall any specifics even now other than the fact that we were, we knew that we were needing to advance in so many ways and, and, and the, let's say the way of life was such that we used what we had to make things better for ourselves and for others.
Story_ID: 216158
Speaker 1: Mr. [HistoryMaker George] Haley, if you will, just tell us a little bit about, of course, you know, you have an ancestor that we're all very familiar with, Kunta Kinte.  Tell us a little bit about some of the stories you heard about him growing up.
Speaker 2: Yes.  We heard about the African pretty much, how certain kinds of things happened to him.  As, as I said, well, growing up we'd come there [Henning, Tennessee] every summer from wherever we were.  I'm saying now, my brother Alex [Haley], myself, and then as my young brother, Julius [Haley], grew up.  And grandma [Cynthia Murray Palmer] and Aunt Liz [Elizabeth B. Murray] the two persons who lived in the house, would sit and talk, you know how old folk sitting out talking and they'd say, "Oh, you know, he would do this."  I mean not only him, but as they, the, the people in the family talking in terms of, of Kizzy and the African as, as they came to talk a little bit about their ancestors.  And actually, I didn't think too much of it to be frank with you.  I mean, we knew at that time, we'd listen to them, and as we grew up and Alex started working on it again, we brought some of this back to our attention more.  Although as I said, we knew it existed, you know, that that was part of the discussion.  And when it really came to, had more bearing, was after Alex decided to look into the family heritage again.  Alex would say--he did 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X' [Malcolm X and Alex Haley], and he used to say, "If you've done something like that, he said you feel like a mother who has birthed a child and you're empty."  And he said that he went by the [National] Archives [Building] one day here in Washington [D.C.].  Somehow he looked into the archives and saw people who were just poring over, you know, their heritage and whatnot.  And he said, "I decided I was gonna look into grandma's," 'cause he now remembered that we, that he or we had had, listened to them.  And, and he saw Tom [Murray] and Irene Murray, which were grandma's parents, and he looked--they had eight children but only seven were there.  And he says well he couldn't figure out what happened to Cynthia, okay.  But Cynthia is our grandmother who was the eighth child.  And so it just started fascinating him to the extent of now really deciding he was gonna do this.  So he went back down to grandma and still Aunt Liz is there.  And Cousin Georgia and now this is when I kind of got into the act again with him.  I was practicing law in Kansas City [Kansas] at that time and that's where Cousin Georgia was.  And it just became really fascinating to listen to them.  Fortunately, they were still around to give us versions again of the African, Kizzy, and I can't even think of his name now, I had called his name earlier, but at any rate that's, that's how it really started going.
Story_ID: 216159
Speaker 1: If you will, Mr. [HistoryMaker George] Haley, please give your siblings' names and birth order, including yourself.
Speaker 2: Oh, but myself?
Speaker 1: Including yourself, your siblings--so you would start with Alex [Haley]--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --and, give us that.
Speaker 2: You know what?  I--thank you.  I thought when you said siblings, okay.  Well, my, I was almost thinking you were talking about my children (laughter).  But Alex is the oldest.  Alexander Murray Palmer Haley, born August 11, 1921.  I tell you as I move along, every one of our names has meaning, dad [Simon Haley] did this.  Alex came, his name comes from his father, and, and Alex, Alexander.  And then Murray is my grandmother's [Cynthia Murray Palmer] maiden name, okay.  Palmer is my mother's [Bertha Palmer Haley] maiden name.  So all of those Alexander Murray Palmer Haley, okay.  I'm next.  George Williford Boyce Haley, born August 28, 1925.  George comes from my maternal grandfather and my mother, her name was Bertha George Palmer.  The reason she was named George is because they had another child, male who died and they still wanted to call him, I mean have the family name, so I'm George Williford.  Williford comes from William, which was my great maternal grandfather's [sic. maternal grandfather] name, William [Palmer].  And Boyce comes from dad's benefactor who found he was a, he was a, a Pullman car porter one summer, and a guy who was named, a gentleman whose name was R.S.M. Boyce was very impressed with him, and sent tuition for him to A&T college [Negro Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University] in Greensboro, North Carolina, so he was able to really finish, so I have his name.  Julius, my younger brother is Julius Cornell Embree Haley, born December 5, 1930.  Julius actually comes from a scholarship dad got from Julius Rosenwald.  Cornell because of his school [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] where dad got his master's [degree].  Embree another award scholarship that dad got.  So that's how those names are significant to him and to us.  My sister, our sister is Lois Ann Haley Blackstone Butts.  She is born, I get a little bit mixed up, I'm pretty, I think it's, well I know it's August--August 7, 1933.  And those are the four, four siblings.
Story_ID: 216160
Speaker 1: Now, let's talk a little bit about you growing up.  Tell us what street you lived on, and can you describe your block or your community for us?
Speaker 2: All of the time, with the exception of being in Henning [Tennessee], which was just heaven to us to go home to Henning in the summer, we lived on college campuses.  My dad [Simon Haley] and stepmother [Zeona Haley], dad first, mother [Bertha Palmer Haley], then stepmother lived on black college campuses.  From Henning which was home base, we were in Langston, Langston, Oklahoma.  And that's where, where our mother--natural mother and dad were. Then we lived in Alabama A&M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University (AAMU); State Agricultural and Mechanical Institute for Negroes] at Normal [Alabama] or Huntsville, Alabama, where my mother died and, of course, stepmother was there.  So we were still on a college campus.  Incidentally I, I was thinking about it, we were there during the time one of the infamous cases involving blacks were concerned.  And that was the, the chase, the Scottsboro [Boys] case.  They, people just swarmed into the campus to try to find these five [sic. nine] boys, you understand.  They didn't find them there but the, I do recall that as a youngster, how they just frightened all of the campus because of people looking for these guys.  Lot, a lot of other things happened please believe me, I'm just thinking in terms of that.  But other, other history events were happening.  For instance, when I first met as a youngster George Washington Carver who was at Tuskegee [Normal and Industrial] Institute [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] but he'd come there, or Marian Anderson came to sing as a young person there.  And those kinds of things at college campuses.  We moved from there to Elizabeth City State Teachers College [Elizabeth City State University] in [Elizabeth City] North Carolina.  First my stepmother and Lois [Ann Haley Butts] and I went, dad came later (laughter).  One of the years dad taught at Alcorn [Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERIA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Dad taught at Alcorn in Mississippi and Alex [Haley] did his first year at, in college at Alcorn in, in Alcorn, Mississippi [sic.].  Then they came up to Elizabeth City, North Carolina and so all of the family was there.  Alex left as a junior student to enter the, the United States Coast Guard, with the understanding from dad that he was gonna finish his college when he got back but that was another story.  He never finished college because the war [World War II, WWII] came on and he stayed in the Coast Guard for twenty years.  After Elizabeth City, North Carolina, as I said, we stayed on these campuses.
Story_ID: 216161
Speaker 1: What was that life like living on college campuses?
Speaker 2: It was, it was, almost it was like an oasis if you wanna say it.  When we talk in terms of the black, white relationships, we really didn't get too involved, though we very much knew the, the dual systems.  There was no doubt about that.  But, but it was like a college, a big family, you understand.  You went out to go to the store perhaps off the college campus or maybe to the movies.  We didn't go to the movies that, that much off the, the college because there were activities, they had certain things that we could do on the campuses and like, as I say, you'd have artists come in.  And say the universities, the colleges would, would have concerts and just many kinds of things like that.  But we didn't get off the college campus too much.  Football games, basketball, all of that was right, right there, you see.  And then Elizabeth City State Teachers [College; Elizabeth City State University] in [Elizabeth City] North Carolina.  And then, my father [Simon Haley] went to AM&N College [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical & Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff] in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.  I went with him, just myself, Alex [Haley] had gone to the [U.S.] Coast Guard from then.  And, and we went there in the late '30s [1930s], just the two of us.  I was in high school [J. C. Corbin High School, Pine Bluff, Arkansas] and, and even, it was a prep high school on the college campus, you see.  I was so pleased because, 'cause I had, I had been taking music.  I had--I was in like my fourth year of piano.  And they let me play in the college band.  Got me a uniform and I could play, I was playing the--the French horn, you understand.  So I could travel with the band, 'cause I was a faculty youngster, you understand.  I'd go to Philander Smith [College, Little Rock, Arkansas] and to Memphis [Tennessee], just with my little band, I mean my little horn, and I went.  I learned how to play pretty well with, with the college band.  And then, of course, mother, mother, my stepmother [Zeona Haley] didn't like AM&N, so she taught, she got a job at LeMoyne College [LeMoyne-Owen College] in Memphis [Tennessee].  Now it's LeMoyne-Owens [sic.] but when we were there she taught at LeMoyne.  We still lived on the small college campus.  And although that was city, I went to Booker T. Washington High School [Memphis, Tennessee].
Story_ID: 216162
Speaker 1: Hold that thought, Mr. [HistoryMaker George] Haley, 'cause we're gonna move on to the high school years but first I want to ask you, tell me what sights, sounds, and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights, sounds, and smells.  I'm not sure what you mean.  You mean that, that I recall?
Speaker 1: Any particular, like if you may smell something, like you may smell saw dust and it just kind of reminds you of growing up or smell of the ocean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --that kind of thing--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --you know, something you may see that triggers, that really reminds you--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --of growing up.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I guess one of the things, sights, oh, sights, sounds, and smells.  Summertime in particular, I would think in terms of say cotton in the--cotton and corn because Henning [Tennessee] was a little town.  And, and the sights in particular or even the, the smell of good wholesome living.  And sights, sights, sounds and smells.  Oh, and sound.  The main I think about is Henning.  I don't know 'cause that's so, so meaningful to, in my growing up years.  Hearing a passenger or freight trains the, you know, late at night or something like that.  When I hear that even now, I do remember the, the train is passing through from Memphis [Tennessee] to Chicago [Illinois], you understand (laughter).  So I, that's, that's true.  You had, when you asked me about then, the sights, of course, would be agricultural.  My father [Simon Haley] was in agriculture, and to come in and see corn growing, cotton, this kind of thing, sights, smells, I guess the freshness of the atmosphere.  I still like that.

Speaker 1: Now, I know you moved around a lot during the elementary school years but do you remember the names of some of your elementary schools and some of your friends there--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: --and teachers?
Speaker 2: Sure I do.  The ones I remember were the Bells [ph.] and Wilsons [ph.] at Alabama A&M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University (AAMU); State Agricultural and Mechanical Institute for Negroes, Normal, Alabama].  Marian Wilson [ph.] and John Turner [ph.] are professors, retired now, at Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina] and North Carolina State [University, Raleigh, North Carolina] but originally from Alabama.  Her father was the dean of music and would play, of course, in the band, Drake [ph.], and there's another gentleman who's here [Silver Springs, Maryland], whose name is Cashen [ph.] whose father was in Alabama at that time.  Now, one of my finest friends still that I remember in sixth grade was [HistoryMaker] Gerald Lamb.  This is another story, you talked about the stories now this is, this is one.  Gerald Lamb and I were kind of competitors when we moved to [Elizabeth City] North Carolina, I mean in sixth grade.  And, and just last year we were talking about this but I was there, we had the sixth grade and then going to, let me see what was the name of that school?  Elementary school, I know.  But then we went to P. W. Moore Junior-Senior High School, [Elizabeth City, North Carolina] which was the high school at that time.  And I left going to Arkansas.  But I our relationship was such that we remembered each other.  And I don't know, I guess we wrote a little bit.  But now I'm really jumping ahead of myself, in 1964, now we're talking about from 1939 to 1964, I'm jumping that far.  I got elected to the State Senate in Kansas.  I read in the paper that there was a fellow elected to the treasurer of the State of Connecticut whose name was Gerald Lamb.  And at the same time, Brookes, of course, that's when he, Senator Brookes got--[HistoryMaker Edward] Brooke got elected.  But Gerald had the same name as it, and it said Elizabeth City.  I wrote, no either wrote or called him, I've forgotten, and I said, "I had a friend so and so and so sixth grade."  And now, I said congratulations 'cause this is first black, you know, to get elected treasurer.  I said, "Now, if you happen to be the same Gerald Hall [sic.] --."  No I said, "Being elected to the treasury, African American congratulations.  But if you happen to be the, my old friend Gerald Hall, second congratulations," or something.  Well he wrote or called right back.  And we reestablished our relationship.  And now he lives, for instance, in Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts], and we've been up there to visit him twice, they've been down here, he came out to Kansas City [Kansas] and all of that, you see.  So it really is something, I mean our relationship was reestablished to that extent.
Story_ID: 216164
Speaker 1: What about your teachers during the elementary school years?  Was there any particular teacher or teachers that influenced you?
Speaker 2: A woman whose name was Mrs. Bell [ph.].  I just--influenced me to the extent of her being my favorite, you understand.  And in Elizabeth City [North Carolina], the woman's name was Mrs. Johnson [ph.].  And then I went on from there to high school in Pine Bluff [Arkansas].  It was J.C. Corbin High School [Pine Bluff, Arkansas], on the campus [of Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical & Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  It was a prep high school.  And we had guys like Dawson [ph.] who I remember very well.  And then my music teacher, Gene Butler Lanting [ph.] who taught me--you know, there are a lot of things that happened like this.  I remember I was kind of, well at fourteen I, I hadn't gotten but so tall but I was, I was pretty good.  I was in fourth year of music.  So we had our music concert and I played--what was this?  I was playing a [Frederic] Chopin prelude minor and crescendo and I was, of course, you get up and you announce I'm gonna play 'Crescendo' by [Per] Lasson, which is an Italian term meaning gradually growing louder.  It was a very showy piece.  And after I had completed it, I had, I got an encore.  Well, there was another, how things happen to kids, you understand.  There was a young lady, young girl who was ten.  And the mother was very, I mean I got the encore but her, her daughter didn't.  So I went out there receiving my applaudence [ph.] and then the mother came up to me and she said, "Oh you did very well, you did very well."  And then she said, "But how old are you? How old are you?"  So I told her, I mean I was--I said, "I'm fourteen."  So she really, then she said, "Oh, well that's understandable."  Her daughter was eleven, you understand.  (Laughter) So I mean, she punched me a little bit 'cause I'm, you know, I'm, by the time she gets to your age she will be able to do better than, than you, you know.  But it's kind of funny how when you talk about things that you remember, she didn't really have to say that (laughter).  But at any rate, that happened and, and, you know, I, I didn't play too much else.  I mean too many other times but.
Story_ID: 216165
Speaker 1: During this time, the elementary school years, did you have dreams and aspirations at that time?
Speaker 2: During elementary--I'm not--I can't say that I did.  I guess when you think in terms of dreams and aspirations, it was an assumption I guess growing up--growing up as we did, that you would be expected at least to proceed and do something that would be beneficial.  And having come through or being a part of families like that, I mean, college people, I had kind of thought, well, maybe I would be a college teacher or something like that.  You know, it was, it was almost a taken for granted thing that you were supposed to do something that would be meaningful like that.
Speaker 1: And during the elementary schools years what type of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was a good student.  I was, I've been a competitive student most of my life, elementary and then moving on to high school.  And I've done well, you know, I mean, I say it humbly but, but I've, it isn't that I'm, well I, I, I have to study there's no doubt about it.  I, you know, I have done that pretty well, you understand.
Speaker 1: And what type of child were you?
Speaker 2: I'd consider myself was a rather obedient child. Actually, I was not as really aggressive, if you wanna say it in that kind of way as my big brother, Alex [Haley], was.  He and I got along very well from time to time.  He used to tease me a lot but after it got to the place where I could beat him then (laughter) some of that did, I, you know, when we hustle and fight and this kind of stuff, and I got so that I could, could handle myself with him.
Story_ID: 216166
Speaker 1: And growing up did you and your family attend church?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: And what, what was that like?  What were those experiences?
Speaker 2: Well, actually we are C.M.E.s, Christian Methodist Episcopal.  We were born into that church, into, in the little, the little town of Henning [Tennessee].  And, of course, it used to be, it's Christian, formerly, Colored Methodist Episcopal church.  Backing up a little bit, my grandparents [Will Palmer and Cynthia Murray Palmer] were very active, not, not that I hadn't been as we've gone through the years but one of the things that I have, have, admired and appreciated about my grandfather, maternal grandfather, is his interests and whatnot.  He gave in his will, a thousand--twelve hundred [1,200] dollars which was considerable to the church, the New Hope CME Church in Henning.  And the school which was named for him, still is.  It's the W. E. Palmer Elementary School [ph.] in Henning, Tennessee.  Which, pleases me and Alex [Haley] and all of us no end that he, you know, that he would do that.
Story_ID: 216167
Speaker 1: So tell me what your family's experiences in church were like?
Speaker 2: I was telling you a little bit about, of course, of the, the grandparents [Will Palmer and Cynthia Murray Palmer].  My grandmother, of course, when we would come in, in the summer, expected us to go to church.  We attended Sunday school and, and church.  Henning [Tennessee] like many little towns in the South, don't really have a lot of people.  And the, we had a [Christian] Methodist [Episcopal] church, the C.M.E. church and, and a Baptist church.  The church services would be held first and, well--in the Methodist church it would be the first and third Sundays.  Sunday school every Sunday but just church service would be two, the first and third.  And at the Baptist church would, would have second and fourth.  My grandma had us in church ever summer, every Sunday.  And so I used to say I'm part Methodist and part Baptist.  But we were brought up in the C.M.E. church.  And I have continued through the church activity, I'm active now, active at Israel Metropolitan C.M.E. Church [Washington, D.C] here in the District [of Columbia].  Now, I have attended other churches but I've never actually moved my membership from the C.M.E. church in all these years.  When we moved to Kansas after I finished law school [University of Arkansas School of Law, Fayetteville, Arkansas], is when I was, perhaps most active in the church, New Hope C.M.E. Church [Henning, Tennessee].  I'm sorry, that's Henning.  St. Peter C.M.E. Church in, in Kansas City [Kansas].  I was conference lay leader Kansas, Missouri, Colorado conference for ten years.  And, and chairman of the steward board, steward board for three, I'm just very active.  My, my children [David Haley and Anne Haley] are in the church as well.  I mean christened and baptized in the church.
Story_ID: 216168
Speaker 1: Mr. [HistoryMaker George] Haley, tell me a little bit about the junior high school years.  What were they like?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Actually I started junior high school first at P.W. Moore [Junior-Senior High School] in Elizabeth City [North Carolina] the first year.  To, the transition, of course, is like going from elementary to, to junior high.  You know, you think (laughter) you're a little more adult and whatnot.  I was kind of active.  I was on the team, running, running and not too much.  There one year then I moved with my dad [Simon Haley] to AM&N College [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical & Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff] in Pine Bluff [Arkansas] to the prep school, which was J.C. Corbin [High School, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].
Speaker 1: Could you spell that, please?
Speaker 2: Of course, the initials, J-C, and then Corbin, C-O-R-B-I-N.  And it was, I guess you could almost call it an advanced high school to the extent that what happens is, in college high schools like that, they have, they have their own faculty but they also have college students who teach in high schools as well under the supervision of others.  And, and I'm sure we had good instructions.  I was there, let's see, only another year.  The seventh, eighth, ninth, went through the ninth grade because well, during that time, I just did a lot of things.  I mean, you know, I think I mentioned Gene Butler Lanting [ph.] to you already.  I was in music.  I was in the band.  The art instructor, who was really the college art instructor, took a liking to me and, and telling me a lot of things I don't recall.  Mithroppa Alexander [ph.] who was an Indian professor.  You see what happens is, many of those people who were in college if they got interested, would also be a part of the high school which was as, as I say, on the campus itself.
Story_ID: 216169
Speaker 1: What happened after ninth grade?  Where did you go (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ninth grade.  We went then to, to Memphis [Tennessee].  That's where my stepmother [Zeona Haley] was teaching at LeMoyne [College; LeMoyne-Owen College, Memphis, Tennessee].  And I went to Booker T. Washington [High School] in Memphis, as the, in my tenth and eleventh grades.  Now you talk about people, many of the instructors were ones that, not only did I come to know, but respect and appreciate.  We had from 10-A to 10, 8-A from the standpoint of classes.  Eight classes, 10-A which were I was in, was supposedly the better of the students.  So they did it that way.  Lena B. Porter [ph.] you were talking about teachers, was our homeroom teacher and she, she was quite a lady.  She'd say something like, something like, "A fool"--I've forgotten what she said.  "Don't be a fool, for a fool has no mind to change," or some kind of stuff like that we used to laugh about but she was very strict.  And I was a good student.  I recall very much that my father [Simon Haley], who was still in Pine Bluff [Arkansas], but he'd come over to Memphis on the weekends, and stepmother insisted that I take typing.  I did not want to take typing.  I remember very well there were thirty-nine girls and a boy.  I was the boy in typing.  But, you know, I have always appreciated it that I learned to type, because it, it helped me so much through the years.  For instance, when I went on to college [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], and more specifically when I went to the [U.S. military] service, I was able to use my typing--and law school [University of Arkansas School of Law, Fayetteville, Arkansas], you know.  But at any rate, I did that.  I was active in, in classes.  And to some extent, my having gone to the J.C. Corbin [Junior-Senior High School, Pine Bluff, Arkansas] in particular, as I said, it was kind of like semi-college, if you understand to from the standpoint of being back in high school.  So I was in pretty good shape in tenth grade and eleventh grades.  I was there for the two years.  I took Spanish.  Lena--no, no, what was her name?  Not Lena Porter.  Oh, Lucie Campbell.  Lucie Campbell by the way, was a musician who wrote some songs that, that we sing like 'Something Within,' you know.  Have you heard, "Something within, something within that banishes the pain," [sic.] that's, that's a song that she wrote.  And some of those were the originals at that time, during the time I was at, at school.  We are now talking like nineteen--when is it?  Nineteen forties [1940s] 'cause I finished high school in 1943, not there, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where did you finish high school?
Speaker 2: In Bordentown, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of that school?
Speaker 2: Bordentown, Bordentown High School [sic. Bordentown School; Manual Training and Industrial School for Colored Youth, Bordentown, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Could you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: B-O-R-D-E-N-T-O-W-N.
Speaker 1: And what was--what were--what was your senior year like there?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was quite an experience.  Let, let me move back just a minute to, to Booker T. Washington.  Only to say that that was a really, a great experience, those two years for me.  I was active.  I was president of the, the junior class at Booker T. Washington.  And, of course, you know, the, what do you call it the, the big deal you have at the end of the year?  What is it?  The when you have the, not the graduation but--the junior senior prom and all, you know, that, that was a big activity at Booker Washington.  So we were in charge of all that.
Story_ID: 216170
Speaker 1: Now, every summer again, wherever we were, we'd go back to Henning [Tennessee].  This was at the, the Second [World] War [World War II, WWII].  Dad [Simon Haley] was on loan now from the University of--from AM&N [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical & Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas] to the federal government.  He was sent to New Jersey, Bordentown, New Jersey to do some work.  And so it was at this school, Bordentown [School; Manual Training and Industrial School for Colored Youth, Bordentown, New Jersey], I went up there because there were possibilities of my doing some work or farm work (laughter).  You know, dad said this was fine.  So I was gone be in the truck farming business.  The four of us went from Henning up there to do some work, picking tomatoes and, and potatoes and this kinds of stuff.  Making like eight or nine dollars a day.  That was really, really good, you understand.  Well, I liked the school and, and where he, where he was and so I got, I asked him if I could stay up there and go to school, it was a boarding school.  And so I got his permission and my stepmother's [Zeona Haley] permission to go up there to do my senior year of high school.  That was a really, really nice experience too.  It was a military school, we wore uniforms.  The girls wore uniforms as well.  And we--I enjoyed that experience, the graduation from there.  One thing I remember among others was the fact that, that I, they had a two year residency requirement.  And I was there studying for one year.  So it appeared--we didn't know this, I didn't, and dad didn't, it appeared as if I was not gonna get my, my diploma because I had been there one year.  Well in the meantime, they sought a waiver based on the circumstances.  And we also had required about--inquired about Booker T. Washington [High School, Memphis, Tennessee], whether if my grades were good enough then I could get my diploma from there since they knew then I was going to have to go to service more than likely.  The long and short of it is, both things worked, the waiver was received and Booker T. Washington agreed that I got it.  So I got two high school diplomas (laughter).
Story_ID: 216171
Speaker 1: Now, tell me what happened after high school.
Speaker 2: Okay.  After high school I was then turning eighteen in August of what would be, that would be 1943, okay.  All eighteen years old males were expected to, into, sign up with the draft board, which I did.  And two months after I was signed up, I was drafted.  Two months after eighteen, okay.  And I was then sent to Fort Dix, New Jersey, okay.  But in every instance, whenever, home base first, going to grandma's [Cynthia Murray Palmer] in Henning, Tennessee.  That was always home.  Well, you know, as you can see, we moved around in so many places but, but we went first to grandma's.  Now before going, however, since I was drafted, I was drafted say about two months after I was eighteen and I was assigned to go to Fort Dix in New Jersey but they give you a little time afterwards and I was not to go until January.  In the meantime, I got a job at a glass company, and I worked there for maybe two or three months, to get a little money beforehand, you understand.  And then we went back to Henning and then, then came to, came to Fort Dix, New Jersey.  One thing people ask about education, the assumptions of what you, what you are about, when you were talking you asked me earlier about say visions, and I had said to you that that my feeling all the time was that I expected to at least finish college, you understand, to move on through.  And I remember very much how disappointed I was in having to think in terms of going to service, because among other things certainly the fear of where you go from here, but I was competitive in my, in my class.  And there were two girls, one of whom was Gwendolyn Alexander [ph.] that, that I competed with.  And, and, another I can't, I remember, well, further back in, in high school when I was at Booker [T.] Washington [High School, Memphis, Tennessee], I'd call those names, Ella Mae Hubbard [ph.] and Barbara Davis, [ph.].  They were the two competitors that I had in, in eleventh grade and, you know, I mean we all made good grades all that.  But when I went to Bordentown [School; Manual Training and Industrial School for Colored Youth, Bordentown, New Jersey], the one that I remember most was Gwen Alexander.  And I won't say I came out at the top of the class but we were kind of up there (laughter).  And what bothered was Gwen Alexander was gonna be able to go on to Bennett College [Greensboro, North Carolina], which is where she went and did very well, and here I will have to go to the service.  And it just appeared to me now the girls are gonna get ahead of me, you understand, what I'm saying?  (Laughter) And, and I was very, really disturbed.
Story_ID: 216172
Speaker 1: How much time, how long did you spend in the [U.S. military] service?
Speaker 2: Three years, three years.
Speaker 1: And then after that you went on Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: So tell me about your years at Morehouse.  So that would have been around 1947?
Speaker 2: Six [1946].
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-six [1946].
Speaker 2: Forty-six [1946].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your time at Morehouse.  You, were there when [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was there?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.  I was there most importantly, of course, Martin Luther King was important too, I mean, but the most important thing was Dr. Benjamin Elijah Mays.  He was president, Mays is an eminent theologian, philosopher, educator.  I cannot in my lifetime, well, I'll say, I do not know anybody in my lifetime who has had more influence on my life, and the lives of, of many people, not just African, not just Morehouse men, but those in particular, than that, that gentleman.  Fantastic fellow, Benjamin Mays was.  It was almost like wanting to touch the hem of his garment, you know.  That for myself, for Martin Luther, for many other people who had the influence of, of Benjamin Mays.  And, was just a fantastic fellow, you know.  Of, say raising his sons, all of us were his sons, you see.  Aside from my dad [Simon Haley], he certainly comes to be number two in my life of influences, okay.
Speaker 1: And you received your degree from Morehouse in 1949?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And what were you thinking that you wanted to do with your life at this point?
Speaker 2: Through Morehouse College, it was as much as anything, one of, of wanting to, to have some successes.  To be of benefit to my, to myself, to a family.  Really, you know, it was one of those things, the visions were there.
Story_ID: 216173
Speaker 1: And I've got something that's so much a part of me sometimes I forget it but, but it's, it's right over here. I, I'd like to say this that's on there, can, can we--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --get that?
Speaker 2: Thank you, [Edgar] Carey [Lane].
Speaker 1: I just about know it anyway but I, I wanna make specifically that I say.  This, this is Benjamin, [Dr.] Benjamin Mays which he never ever let any of the Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] guys out, you know, graduation or otherwise and not just one time but, but this is what he instilled in the minds of all of us.  Particularly if you, by the time you were graduating.  "It must be born in mind that the tragedy in life does not lie in not reaching your goal, the tragedy lies in having no goal to reach.  It isn't a calamity to die with dreams unfulfilled but it is a calamity not to dream."  Isn't that fantastic?  "It is not a disaster to be unable to capture your ideal, but it is a disaster to have no ideal to capture.  It is not a disgrace not to reach the stars, but it is a disgrace not to have the stars to reach for.  Not failure but low sin--but low aim is sin."  I wanted to make sure that I got that, I recite it so much that it's something that I know and appreciate and respect.  But I think that that is, is the philosophy that is so meaningful when you talk in terms of, you were asking me earlier about vision, about, you know, the kinds of things that you do.  You need to think in terms of, of having something to dream about things.  And I say this about [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], Martin Luther King got his idea of dreaming, of vision from, from [Benjamin] Benny Mays.  There's no doubt about it in the minds of those who knew him or knew Martin Luther as well.
Story_ID: 216174
Speaker 1: After graduating from Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you were thinking about law school?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  I thought of law school while I was at Morehouse.  My major was history and political science.  And then I thought that law school, of course, provided a lot of possibilities if you want to teach, if you wanna practice law, if you wanna go into business, it has that foundation to it.  And that was one of the reasons that I decided to go to law school.
Speaker 1: Why did you decide to go to Arkansas?
Speaker 2: University of Arkansas [School of Law, Fayetteville, Arkansas].  Much of that was based on the fact that, that the South in particular was now pressing to have students, African American students, admitted to the former white schools.  Arkansas in particular, my father [Simon Haley] now being still there in Arkansas, gave me an opportunity to, well it was kind of at his suggestion.  And we used to tease dad, I said, "Dad, now, you know, I was thinking about going to Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] (laughter)," said, "if I go to University of Arkansas since I'm domiciled there because of you and whatnot, then it would cost us much less (laughter)."  But it was more to the than that.  We, we really had the concern about doing something that would be beneficial to ourselves and others.  I spoke to Dr. [Benjamin] Mays about it, Dean [Brailsford Reese] Brazeal and other people at Morehouse and they encouraged me, encouraged me to do this.
Speaker 1: Do you recall the, the letter that your father wrote to you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: What did he say in that letter?
Speaker 2: Well, he was saying that he felt that I had the, the temperament, the ability to do something that would be very meaningful and significant from the standpoint of, let's say making race relations better.  And basically this was it.
Speaker 1: So when you arrived at the University of Arkansas law school what was that day like?
Speaker 2: Well, when I arrived, first my dad and I went up in the summer before I actually registered.  Now, actually I arrived, let me, I think I need to give a little history of, of Arkansas, it won't take--not that much, but Arkansas was actually the first of the southern states to admit black students even under totally segregated circumstances.  I'm not first, I'm actually the third student admitted but the second to graduate.  Silas Hunt was admitted to University of Arkansas under totally segregated circumstances.  Brought into the basement, white students, whites students would--I mean, the white instructors would come down to the basement to teach him, okay.  We aren't sure what happened, his second semester something happened to Silas, he was moved to the veterans hospital [Springfield, Missouri] and he died.
Story_ID: 216175
Speaker 1: You were telling us the story that you weren't actually the first African American student to graduate from University of Arkansas [School of Law, Fayetteville, Arkansas].
Speaker 2: Right, right.  The, the first one I was talking about was Silas Hunt, who did not--well in his second semester he died, Silas Hunt.  The next student admitted was Jackie Lamond Shropshire, S-H-R-O-P-S-H-I-R-E, from Little Rock, Arkansas, graduate of Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  And he was admitted under the same circumstances, separate study room, white instructors would come down to teach him.  Supposedly, some of the white students complained saying that he was getting better instructions than they, private tutorage.  They decided to move him up to the regular classroom with a chair apart from the white students and literally, not built, had a partition between him and the white students.  So that, of course, he could see the instructor as well as the white students but just at least a barrier between them.  The--one or more of the white instructors all of them were white, of course, said well this is really ridiculous.  So they moved the, the rail.  Now this incidentally was written and photographed in the early Life magazine, you know when it was a--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) About what year was this?
Speaker 2: This would have been, let's see, 1948, 1948.  This is actually the condition that existed when I came to the law school in the fall of 1949.  Having graduated from Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] in June, I went immediately to law school in September of '49 [1949].
Story_ID: 216176
Speaker 1: Now, you had asked me earlier about my first--the first time I went [to the University of Arkansas School of Law, Fayetteville, Arkansas].  Actually, my father [Simon Haley] and I had driven up from Pine Bluff [Arkansas] to meet Dean [Dr. Robert A.] Leflar and others in the law school but did the dean in particular to get, you know, whatever was necessary done (laughter).  And, so the dean was telling us about the situation, I mean the separate study room we had, and some of the things that they had another chair over there.  Another fellow went with me by the way, there were two blacks who went at the same time I came to school.  He didn't finish with me but at least he started with me, C.C. Mercer, Christopher Columbus Mercer, Jr.  So we had two more chairs over to the left of the instructor.  Other restrictions were not to sit down in the library up stairs.  We had to, we could stand and use the books but if we wanted to take it, you know, to really study we had to take 'em down two stories below to our study room.  And as we--oh, all of us stayed off campus at that time.  I stayed with Mr. and Mrs. Cashmere [ph.] Funkhouser, F-U-N-K-H-O-U-S-E-R, both of whom now are deceased.  And the daughter is kind of like another sister to me.  But at any rate, many kinds of things happened.  We were not permitted to use the, the restroom facilities.  We used the dean's private quarters until somebody got very unhappy about that and, and then we used the faculty restroom, going through the regular men's restroom to go into the faculty restroom to use.  And after a fashion--this was during 1950s the Sweatt [v. Painter, 1950] case in Texas and the McLaurin [v. Oklahoma State Regents, 1950] case in Oklahoma, they were just before us and they were decided.  And we decided after the McLaurin case in particular, just go on and use the regular restroom.  Nobody really said so much because those, those were cases that were going on before us.  I think there were various kinds of things happening to us, different hostilities but at the same time we were making progress.  We, we could feel it.  For instance, I told you earlier when I was in tenth grade [at Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee] the insistence on my learning to type, I got so that I could really type well.  One of the guys came down to our restroom--I'm sorry to our study room and he said, one white fellow said, you can type faster than I can, you know.  Well, it was at a point then when people were being, whites were beginning to see not only that we had certain kinds of abilities, that we were comparable in some instances.  We could do some things that that they did or sometimes even better.  But I think the most shocking, I told you earlier, that I had learned to play the piano.  And they started teasing sometimes about that and one time over, when we got to be a little better, better acquainted, I sat down and played a [Frederic] Chopin.  And it was almost incredible.  They couldn't think about a black being able to do something.  And, one of the guys, told me he said, "You know, I've never experienced blacks like you and C. C. or Jackie [Lamond Shropshire]."  That he had come from a--he was brought up on a farm, a plantation where his father had about forty sharecroppers of whom were black.  And that's, that was what he had experienced.  Now he felt, let's say comfortable enough to talk and share these kinds of experiences with, with us.  And it was kind of incredible, you know.  But that was, that was what was developing.
Story_ID: 216177
Speaker 1: Let's talk one about particular experience [at the University of Arkansas School of Law, Fayetteville, Arkansas] where you would use the facilities at the editorial offices of the [Arkansas] Law Review.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you recall that particular experience, you know, one afternoon your door--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, it was just one of those, another thing that, that happened where the hostilities existed, you understand, the early stages.  Where somebody opened the door and dropped some urine down (laughter) and it just, just hit, you understand.  And, you know, it was just one of those things.  You I--you certainly don't expect those kinds of things that, that happened but they do.  And, well that one--I could give you other kinds.  I was talking recently to George Howard [Jr.] who is now a, black, who is now a federal judge.  He came to the law school after I did but before I graduated.  There were five members, five blacks who were there before Jackie graduated in 1951.  Jackie [Lamond] Shropshire graduated in '51 [1951].  I graduated in 1952.  Wiley [Austin] Branton came, now C.C. Mercer [Christopher Columbus Mercer, Jr.] was there, who came with me but he didn't finish with me.  Then there was Wiley Branton, who eventually became dean of the law school at Howard [University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] here.  And then George Howard who was the last one, who is now a federal judge in Little Rock [Arkansas].  In my senior year, George would have been either a freshman or sophomore law.  The two of us were walking on the, the sidewalk in front of Razorback Hall [Gibson Hall] which was where, pretty much the football players lived.  And now I wouldn't say these were law school but it was part of the university set-up.  So the windows were up, and somebody said, "Here come, here come some of those nigga students."  And, and George has a, he has a, a temper (laughter).  Well, we were both do in various places.  So, I'm a senior student and I said to myself, now listen George, we are going to continue to walk at our present pace and just ignore it.  Don't look in their direction.  We got a little bit past where the open window was and somebody threw a golf ball.  And it, (making a sound) it, it hit the sidewalk and bounced up between us.  And I said, "Look George," I said, "we're just gon' continue to walk, don't turn."  George he said, "We've got to call out the militia," you understand.  And so some guy said, "You missed 'em."  And then they threw a Coke [Coca-Cola] bottle and it just burst between us but, you know.  And then they were laughing.  But now we're walking, see what they expected us to do was to start running.  I knew, we both knew that.  And I said we're not going to, to walk any faster.  We continued our pace and shortly thereafter we were, you know, on beyond them.  And, of course, then we went on to see Dean [Dr. Robert A.] Leflar and told him what had happened.  And then, of course, the dean went over to see the chancellor.  We could see that from where we were at that time.  But I'm just saying that those kinds of incidents would happen.  Another incident that comes to mind right now is, I'm standing on the side of a--on the curb and some boys in a car said, "Come on by," you know, how you do that.  And so I got in front of the car so I said, hmm these are pretty decent guys.  I said, "Thank you."  So I got right in front of the car and then they gunned the motor just like I'm gone run over you, really it truly was enough to frighten, of course, I jumped, you understand (laughter).  And then they, "Oh!" They just laughed about it.  So those kinds of things happened to us but we really never had any, any physical things.  None of us got hit or, you know, abused to that extent, it was all other kinds of stuff.
Story_ID: 216178
Speaker 1: --At any point did you think this just isn't worth it and perhaps, you know, I'm not cut out for this and I'm not the right person for this?
Speaker 2: No.  And I guess a part of that was due to the fact that we pretty much knew that we'd have some problems and every one of us was a veteran, you see.  All of us had been in [U.S. military] service.  And so, so we kind of knew that we were there [University of Arkansas School of Law, Fayetteville, Arkansas] for a purpose.  And I guess not necessarily am I jumping ahead of myself other than to say that we accomplished a lot to the extent of people not only coming to know that we had abilities, that we were interested in making things better for ourselves, for the country.  And there's no doubt about it I've, I've lived it, I felt it so much that if there were not people like we are and others, we as a country would definitely not have made it to this point and to the extent where we are now.
Speaker 1: So after graduation in 1952 what did you do next?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I went to practice in, in Kansas City [Kansas].  I would only like to say, back to law school, one of the major things that, accomplishments that I myself was able to make, was to become a part of the [Arkansas] Law Review staff.  Which is, not only very well accepted but received to the extent of being able to produce for the school.  I was comments editor.  I recall having come back from Kansas City on Thanksgiving vacation on a Saturday, they couldn't understand, but I had a, I was so engrossed in finishing a case note that I had.  And it was highly respected because Dean [Dr. Robert A.] Leflar was an author who had done conflicts of laws, law so he and I came to be good friends.
Story_ID: 216179
Speaker 1: Now, you were asking me about what went on.  I took the law--took the bar exam in Arkansas.  I had been asked to come if I--offered a position in Kansas City [Kansas] because people in that part, of course, had been watching what was going on.  They, they'd been following me and others at the University of Arkansas [School of Law, Fayetteville, Arkansas], so a firm there offered me a position and a partnership.  And so I went to Kansas and started to practice.
Speaker 2: And what, what was the name of the firm?
Speaker 1: Well, it was Stevens, Jackson Partnership [Stevens, Jackson, and Davis, Kansas City, Kansas].  Very soon it became Stevens, Jackson, Davis, and Haley [Kansas City, Kansas], yes.
Speaker 2: And you, you stayed in private practice for a little while and then you were going to become the deputy city attorney [for the City of Kansas City, Kansas].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: What year was that and tell me about your role there?
Speaker 1: Okay.  I started practicing in 1952.  And then I became deputy city attorney in 1954.  Now, those positions were such that you could continue your private practice along with being an assistant or a deputy city attorney.  So I was doing both.  You could, so long as it didn't involve the, the city and there was no conflicts of interests then, of course, you could continue your, your other practice, which is what I did.  And we developed in various, various areas.  As a young lawyer I did, I was in the general practice.  Going to criminal, civil, whatever kind of law there was, you know, we did.  My firm--Miles [ph.] Stevens was perhaps the, one of the best known lawyers in the State of Kansas.  And Elmer [C.] Jackson [Jr.] who subsequently became president of the National Bar Association, were the two senior partners in the firm that I came to be a part of.  And by the way, early in the stages, our firm was very active in the Brown verses Topeka, Board of Education [sic. Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] case, because we did have certain kinds of knowledge and, and were able to help, all of this was pro bono.  And my having come from the University of Arkansas with the experiences that I had and, of course, having been on the [Arkansas] Law Review staff, I was able to give a lot of research to that case.  And Jim [James P.] Davis whose name I mentioned was the son-in-law of, of Mr. [McKinley] Burnett, who was the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People [NAACP] in Topeka [Kansas].  And, of course, you know, we were very close to what was going on and being helpful to them in that regard.
Story_ID: 216180
Speaker 1: And speaking of Brown versus the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], we are now celebrating the fiftieth (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The fiftieth.
Speaker 1: --anniversary of that.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: What are some of your thoughts on education as it is today in terms of African Americans and if, if Brown v. Board of Education was successful in its endeavor?
Speaker 2: Oh, I feel very, well, I won't say comfortable, I mean about the landmarks.  Brown versus Topeka [Kansas], Board of Education and it's the other cases, were I think the, the most important and significant landmark that we have experienced up to that time.  I've thought in terms of the, the three landmarks, of course, the Dred Scott [v. Sandford, 1857] case 1856, where we at that time were chattel and you understand, sold like pigs and cows and horses.  Imagine the [U.S.] Supreme Court doing that, but that's what it did see.  And then, of course, the Plessy [v.] Ferguson [1896] case, the 1890s in which we dealt with the separate but equal doctrine.  That's what we lived with, legally lived with, and at least then comes the landmark case said no longer separate but equal legally.  Now let's face it, we still have a lot of problems yet but at least that legal machinery is there and we've picked from that, you understand.
Speaker 1: But do you think that there's a disparity in terms of education in terms of the education that many African American students receive verses white students?
Speaker 2: That--yes.  It's still--there's a lot of disparity.  There's no doubt about it.  And there are many reasons for that.  Unfortunately, some of 'em are well, economic.  But all of 'em aren't economic.  Some of them are responsibilities that we have, that we have not done.  We've, we've not taken, we've not done the kinds of things that we need to do.  And, you know, I have to say to you now at my--I'm saying, I was very fortunate.  You heard a little bit about my growing up as we did.  The teachers in these colleges at my elementary school all the way up, I can't remember, all of them were black until I got pretty much to, well there were some at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] who were white.  But, but they were very, very interested in using whatever they had to help African Americans.  I'm talking about, surely teaching us the English but also the morals and the kinds of things that unfortunately we, we have gotten so far away from it's just incredible to think.
Story_ID: 216181
Speaker 1: I'm gonna jump back to grandma [Cynthia Murray Palmer] a minute.  Morals, when I came out of Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia]--I'm sorry when I came out of [U.S. military] service, I was gonna celebrate my twenty-first birthday before going to Morehouse.  And grandma, liked to have parties too so she was gonna let me have my twenty-first birthday party.  We are forty miles north of Memphis [Tennessee].  And so I had invited a few people from Memphis to come out.  Well, there was a young lady who had had a baby, no husband, no not--you know, just right in the little town and everybody knew.  And so grandma, I mean, she saw my guest list and so grandma said, "But she can't come."  I said, "Well grandma"--now this young lady had had a party down at her house earlier in the summer and I had gone there, and she knew I had gone down there.  I said, "Well you let me go down there and you didn't say one thing about my going down there."  She said, "Well, this is my house.  This is my house."  I said, "Grandma come on, come on."  And I started, you know, talking to her about that, and, she (laughter), she just, she insisted that she could not come.  I said, "Well grandma I tell you what."  I said, "I'm not gone have my party (laughter)," you know.  So grandma said, "What?  Are you responsible?"  I said, "Now grandma, you know, I wasn't even here nine months ago," (laughter) you know, so--and well, well she knew I wanted to have this party, so I went to her and I said, I said, "I tell you what grandma," I said, "of course we gonna have the party but I am going down and tell this girl that I want her to come to my party and you won't let her come."  And grandma put her lip up, she said, "Well, if that's what you have to do, that's what you have to do."  And I went down and told her.  And, but the long and short of it is, we are so far--not that I'm--I'm pleading for the girl but we've got so far from that kind of morals.  I wish we had a little bit more of that now.  We've come to the point where, what we see, what we experience, is just really horrible.  Actually I don't, I don't think that my grandma could live through some of this stuff (laughter).  But you understand what I'm saying.  It's--I don't know what has happened but we need to have some of what was happening when I was growing up.  And let me tell you, I'm not--I still try to do something about it.  And I get back perhaps to one of the things you asked me earlier, I'm only one, but I am one.  And I think that if, many of us at least tried to do a little bit more, at least we would be in a little better shape.
Story_ID: 216182
Speaker 1: So Mr. [HistoryMaker George] Haley, after you had been practicing law, you started having political aspirations, how did that come about?
Speaker 2: Basically it may have started when I was at City Hall [Kansas City, Kansas].  You come to be active with the city administration and 'cause I was Republican in a Democrat situation.  But I got active in, in politics.  Basically in, in City Hall, you know, it's independent to some extent but the Republicans and Democrats work together.  And then I became a part of the Young Republicans in Kansas City [Kansas], and we started making a few things happen.  I was president of the Wyandotte County [Kansas] Young Republicans, got active in the state.
Speaker 1: What year was this when you were president?
Speaker 2: That would have been, let's see, boy, 1966--well I'd say the, the early 1960s, maybe in like 1962, one [1961] and two [1962].
Speaker 1: So in 1964 you decided to run for office?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: And tell me a little bit about that.
Speaker 2: There was reapportionment of the State Senate in Kansas, and we had no blacks in the State Senate at that time.  The reapportionment came at a time when we felt that now we had an opportunity to elect a black state senator.  We thought that we were going to get my partner, we are now Stevens, Jackson, Davis, and Haley Law Firm [Kansas City, Kansas].  My law partner, Jim [James P.] Davis, who was an assistant county attorney, a Democrat.  George Haley, an assistant city attorney, Republican, okay.  Democrats strongly controlled Wyandotte County, at least 70 to 30 percent.  We felt that Jim Davis was gonna be our first state senator, black.  Of course, it would require support from the Democratic central committee.  Joe [Joseph H.] McDowell who was then the senior senator, the only senator, white, from Wyandotte County.  He had announced that he probably wouldn't run for the senate because now it appeared since he was in the, in the district where blacks were, that a black might be able to, to win over him.  So he announced he wasn't gone run.  Long and short of it is, we'd hoped that Jim Davis was gonna get the endorsement support but they didn't do it.  So in the north end which is where blacks lived, we decided that well, maybe if we put George Haley's name up, that would make them know that we were concerned about what was going on.  So that's how I filed.  The, the, Democratic central committee still did come to get to Jim Davis but what they did was to go back and get Joe McDowell and say, you know, you run, blacks will support you because you are a Democratic, you know.  Well it didn't work.  I was elected from a Democratic stronghold because we got the support of blacks as well as whites, though few they may be, and created some real sensation.  There was [President] Lyndon [Baines] Johnson elected--the Washington--the Kansas City Star and Time showed pictures on the front page Lyndon Johnson, Bill [William H.] Avery who was a Republican governor of Kansas, and the third picture was mine, and under the heading, "Scores Upset," because this was the first time Republicans had had a state senator out of Wyandotte County in a long time.  At all.  And it happened to be a black Republican state senator.  It made a tremendous difference, there's no doubt about that.
Story_ID: 216183
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: Well, here the Senate in Kansas [Kansas State Senate] at that time was forty it still--was then and still is, forty states senators.  Twenty-seven of whom were then Republican, I being one of the twenty-seven, thirteen Democrats.  I come from a Democrat--Democratic county [Wyandotte County, Kansas] able to produce a lot of things for the county because of my party, Republican Party, having knowledge of the city [Kansas City, Kansas], having been assistant city attorney for ten years, so I knew what was going on, could make some demands for the city along those lines, and it just was a fantastic kind of thing from the standpoint of a power base as well as others.
Speaker 1: So, you served for four years?
Speaker 2: Served for four years.  Ran for [U.S.] Congress in 1966, didn't win and I didn't lose my seat because it was a four year term.  But I did run in '66 [1966].  Ran for my seat again in '68 [1968].  We had another reapportionment and I--which meant that I was running county-wide and I lost the seat.  But in the meantime, there was interest in what I might do on the national scene.  So I appointed in the [President Richard Milhous] Nixon years as chief counsel--
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-nine [1969], 'cause I had run in '68 [1968] so I ran in 1969.  I got appointed chief counsel to Urban Mass Transportation Administration [UMTA] which is now, of course, Urban Mass Transit [sic. Federal Transit Administration (FTA)] but that's what it was then in 1969.  So then the family and I came to Washington [D.C.] in the late '69 [1969] and the '70s [1970s].  So that's how we got here.
Speaker 1: And you served in that post until the early '70s [1970s], and then you moved on to--
Speaker 2: USIA.  I was there from the '70s [1970s] until '73 [1973].  I moved then to become assistant, assistant to--at USIA, United States Information Agency.  And then the general counsel and congressional liaison in the United States Information Agency until, from '75 [1975] to '76 [1976].  During that time I traveled in that capacity.  Of course, my first trip to Africa was still when I was at [U.S.] Department of Transportation.  I did a lecture series for USIA in, in Senegal, The Gambia, Liberia, Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Ghana, those six.  My wife [Doris Moxley Haley] and I it was our first trip to Washington [sic. Africa] in 1972.  But then when I was at USIA as such, I traveled pretty much all over the world, as its general counsel, doing things that needed to be done all over South America, Europe.  Now I had been to Europe when I was in the State Senate, that was my first trip to Europe in 1967 with my wife.  But then we went--I went South America, to the Persian Gulf, to India, to all, almost any place, everywhere.
Story_ID: 216184
Speaker 1: Mr. [HistoryMaker George] Haley, in the '60s [1960s] your brother [Alex Haley] wrote an article ["George Haley: The Man Who Wouldn't Quit"] for Reader's Digest--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --about your experiences at University of Arkansas [School of Law, Fayetteville, Arkansas].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was it like for you to see these experiences put to paper so that--to have them shared with the world pretty much?
Speaker 2: Well, of course, it was a, was an interesting experience to have that.  It--I know it's humbling too, to have people recognize and appreciate and respect some of things that your life has offered.  And I guess the thing that really got me most, were some of the letters that I received from people literally around the world.  I think that the one that got me most, incidentally I still have them as a part of my well, memories, is a letter that I received from a fellow, type written letter, from a fellow in Houston, Texas who was blind, and how impressed he was with these experiences.  And what got me, almost put me in tears, is that he kind of missed the page and, and at the end of it he wrote off the page you see but there was enough, of course, the end of it when he was saying he was blind and he had been able to read it by Braille and whatnot.  But the ones, one from Australia as I recall, several from Germany, several from Canada, and even later I've received some letters.  And sometimes they just have on there, "George Haley, Kansas City, Kansas."  Well by that time I was getting some that, you know, that had become that, that famous if you wanna say.  I mean they didn't have the address because it wasn't even there.  Some they would send them to the Reader's Digest in New York [New York] and then, of course, on to me.  So it was a fantastic experience.  Incidentally, I was able to use that when I was running for the [Kansas] State Senate and, and many people still look at that, which pleases me (laughter).
Story_ID: 216185
Speaker 1: Now, we're chronologically, we're around the mid-'70s [1970s].  And there was also something very exciting happening in your family.  Tell me a little bit about when the book 'Roots[: The Saga of an American Family,' Alex Haley] came out and the television movie [sic. mini-series, 'Roots'], et cetera, and just what impact that was having on the family.
Speaker 2: It, of course, was one of those things where you, I don't--it's hard to say how you, how I--even I felt and my brother [Alex Haley] as well, my big brother.  The success of looking at, listening about your family, you understand, and the, the significance, the meaning, the challenge, the opportunities, the responsibilities, all of those fit into the picture, your influence, you know, they just kind of fit into the picture.  And, of course, you were talking about our, asking me earlier about our Christian religious business.  We say, we call, I call God the Old Man upstairs, that he decided to use this family and that's the way I look at it.  I mean to, to show what happens, or could happen or did happen to an African American family, that we are representative.  Let's face it, there are certainly families who have more wealth than this one, and even more intelligence but we are kind of like an ideal family.  We've been blessed in the areas and people have looked at, at us (laughter) still do.  I mean with our, let's say our, much of successes.  We've had failures, still do, you understand.  But you understand what I'm saying, we are representative.  I have been talking now and people ask me various things and I say that God has blessed this family.  Like my brother, the author, myself (laughter) a lawyer, my little brother [Julius Haley], the architect, and my sister [Lois Ann Haley Butts], a musician, you understand.  Coming in my family afterwards, all of us have done certain things.  You met my wife [Doris Moxley Haley] she's come, she's a master's [degree] in education, teaching.  My two children are coming along.  David [Haley] having gone to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] like I did, then on to Howard Law School [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.].  My daughter, Anne [Haley], with an E by the way, we--Sidwell [Friends School, Washington, D.C.] here and then to Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island], then to Stanford Law [School, Stanford, California] who also was on the [Stanford] Law Review.  So I mean I'm proud of that kind of representation, you understand what I'm saying.  The Old Man upstairs has arranged this.
Story_ID: 216186
Speaker 1: And so after serving as general counsel [and congressional liaison] for USIA [United States Information Agency] throughout--in the '70s [1970s] you went back into private law, private practice (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Private, private practice, right.
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about why you went from government back to private practice.
Speaker 2: Back to private practice.  A part of it, of course, is due to the fact that, that 'Roots' was just beginning.  Though I was pretty much Alex's [Haley] advisor.  I didn't--I did very little representation of Alex other than advising him in a family capacity.  My experiences, of course, had been such that I now had transportation background having been there and international experience.  So I did much of that, and I started with a firm the Obermayer, Rebmann, Maxwell, [&] Hippel firm, which was a Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] firm and established a Washington [D.C.] base, with Hugh Scott, Senator Scott who had been on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.] for thirty-two years.  And we represented things on an international-- some clients, on an international basis.  One of my major clients was ECOWAS, that's the Economic Community of West African States.  It is similar to Common Market [sic. European Economic Community (EEC)] in Europe.  And I was very pleased to begin it in its infancy.  The senator and I were able to introduce it on the American scene, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you did that until 1981?
Speaker 2: Eighty-one [1981].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then from '81 [1981] to 1990, tell me a little bit about what you were doing.
Speaker 2: Okay, '81 [1981] that was still--I just decided to open my own firm.  Small though it be myself and Joe Blunden [ph.] who was a, I had brought him along.  He was a, a Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] guy.  He was kind of like my special assistant at UMTA [Urban Mass Transportation Administration; Federal Transit Administration (FTA)] and USIA.  And I decided I wanted to start my own firm.  Basically, because my, both my children [David Haley and Anne Haley] were thinking in terms of law.  They went to law school and I thought well, we establish a base for them as well.  But they weren't that interested in working with the old man, which was okay.
Story_ID: 216187
Speaker 1: And I continued to be active in the political world by at least appearing in various presidential appointments.  The main one was in 1984, I was on, I served first as an advisor to UNESCO [United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization], and then '84 [1984] or five [1985] as a delegate.  I was on the delegation in Paris [France] when we, as the United States, withdrew from UNESCO.  I was opposed to it but then, of course, unanimity comes after the decision is made.  We've perhaps as you know just got back into UNESCO.  I think it was a mistake quite frankly for us to leave it.  My position has been, whether we're talking law school, wherever we are, you do much better inside rather than out.  If you can't communicate--if you can't, let's say, you're just--you argue from inside if you can.  And that's what I have felt that we as a country ought to do more of is not get out but get in.  The whole business of the UN [United Nations] same kind of thing, I want communication, would like it.  I think from a standpoint of, of race maybe my having been at the university and I have explained to you a little bit of that to you earlier, we do better if we are close to you.  I mean, you know, candid and, and genuine, of course, things happen along those lines.

Speaker 1: Now, '86 [1986] I ran for the U.S. Senate in Maryland, okay.  (Laughter) I didn't win but at least I was there making some political positions known.  And you said from what?
Speaker 2: Well, lets move into the early '90s [1990s]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and your work with the postal--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: -your appointment to the postal commission (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) [U.S.] Postal Rate Commission [U.S. Postal Regulatory Commission].  I was appointed by [President George Herbert Walker] Bush, Sr. then as chairman of the Postal Rate Commission, okay.  And, of course, that position was a very interesting one where, as you know we regulated the, the postal rates for our postal service which, of course, is the largest one in the world, there's no doubt about that.  And most efficient.  I was there and the--then President [William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton came and he reappointed me not as chairman but part of the commission, okay.  Because that's a five person commission, Republican and Democrat, or whatever, Independent.  And I stayed in that capacity until President Clinton appointed me ambassador to The Gambia.
Speaker 2: What year was that?
Speaker 1: In 1998, 1998.  I was in that capacity until 2001, okay.
Story_ID: 216189
Speaker 1: What were your experiences like in Africa (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Just fantastic.  I had been to Africa several times in various capacities, speaking commitments and whatnot.  All over Africa: Kenya, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Johannesburg [South Africa], Lesotho, and all down the west coast of Africa, of course.  And my having gone this time though as ambassador, is just completely different, you know, you go and you're saying well, in three weeks I'll be back home and this kind of thing.  But when you go as an ambassador in Africa, I would say other places, of course, this is the only place, only place I've been as ambassador, but you, you sit down and it's hey look, I'm here (laughter).  I'm here now in a different capacity for years, you understand.  And it's--you have a different kind of feeling about it.  My experience, of course, of going to The Gambia was fantastic.  Where my ancestors had come from, and, of course, that was part of the symbolism of my coming to the Gambia, from Kunta Kinte now seven generations later the same family sends home its ambassador.  It was a very emotional thing for me, for the Gambian people, and on that scene, of course, they said you're a Gambian who has come home, you know.  And they expected me to do really, more than I was able to do.  Because I had to remind them that I am here representing the United States of America with its policies, with its laws to represent this country.  Now, you have to keep this in mind, and I promise you that I will do everything I can to help the country under those circumstances.  And we did.  I'm saying we now because my wife [Doris Moxley Haley] was with me, who helped assiduously.  We did a lot of things for the Gambia.
Story_ID: 216190
Speaker 1: So after serving [as U.S. Ambassador] there [the Gambia], you, I think, so, in 1990--
Speaker 2: Two thousand one [2001]?
Speaker 1: Two thousand one [2001], I'm sorry.  So from 1999 to 2001--
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-eight [1998].  Well, we were there three years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  2001.  What did you do next?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Since that time I have been working on various kinds of projects.  One being in the Gambia for instance.  We've done a lot of things there.  Let me, if I may, mention two or three significant things.  My wife [Doris Moxley Haley], who is in education, established two or three educational projects, products there.  For instance, she had a, she had a--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Okay.  She, she had a contest that now is a national annual, national thing that they do for all of the high schools across the country now have poem, prose contest for the high school students where they had judges that are selected and they, they then make the, you know, select the contestants.  And she had The Links [Inc.] and the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] help from this end to send prizes to them.  It's a fantastic thing.  The cabinet officer of education, who incidentally has her master's [degree] from Vanderbilt [University, Nashville, Tennessee], were very interested in it, and it's an annual thing that they do.  One of our very good friends, couples who visited us, Dr. And Mrs. Charles Epps [HistoryMaker Dr. Charles H. Epps, Jr. and HistoryMaker Dr. Roselyn Payne Epps] who was dean of the medical school at Howard [University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], visited us.  They have provided a portable x-ray machine for the country and that's over there.  It's kinds of things like that we were able to do for them in addition to--oh, one of the really major things was to get, was to be able to get direct air service between BWI [Baltimore-Washington International Airport; Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, Baltimore, Maryland] and Banjul [International Airport, Yundum, the Gambia] which was, which we were able to do with Secretary [HistoryMaker Rodney E.] Slater, using Rodney Slater who helped us get that done.  There were those kinds of things were major for, for us to, to do.  Now your question actually was what am I doing since.  We have a project going in The Gambia which is similar to Williamsburg [Virginia] over here.  Not as sophisticated but I have that going and it's up river from Jufureh [the Gambia] right now, where we will have another tourist attraction similar to that.
Speaker 1: Similar in what regard?
Speaker 2: Well, you're familiar with Williamsburg, are you?  Okay.  And the same kind of thing, I mean, talking in terms of where we are in the U.S. to some extent, comparing it or working together with the African tradition working together on it.  And it's a--it will be a small convention center where African Americans can go, which we hope you will go to and others to, to see where we have come from, to see where we are now kind of thing.
Story_ID: 216191
Speaker 1: Mr. [HistoryMaker George] Haley, you were telling me a little bit about the project that you are currently working on in Africa, the one that's similar to Williamsburg [Virginia].  What else are you doing right now?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, I am the executor of my brother's [Alex Haley] estate.  It's still in existence and with the, the residuary trust relationship.  And we are in the early stages of working on two or three projects.  One of 'em is very fascinating from the standpoint of what we will be able to do from the standpoint of influencing and really earn money to the extent, an Alex Haley racing team, motorsports cars.  And we are really working on, on getting sponsors together right now.  That's a fantastic operation.  It was suggested because of the diversification that is needed that we work on this.  So I'm very much into that right now.  We have a project going with reference to the 'Roots[: the Saga of an American Family,' Alex Haley], video right now.  So we've got two or three things going like that, you know.  In addition, to that I've been making certain speeches.  Very recently, I did some lectures for state department [U.S. Department of State] three weeks in South Africa, which I have found very interesting and a challenge.  I spoke--my wife [Doris Moxley Haley] said I did twenty-eight lectures, she went with me.  We went to Botswana, Namibia and Swaziland.  And, and spoke to all kinds of groups, to universities, to colleges, high schools, grammar schools, professional groups, officials in government and whatnot.
Story_ID: 216192
Speaker 1: And what haven't you done yet that you'd still like to do?
Speaker 2: My goodness.  I suppose at this point what I'd like to do is to encourage for myself and others better economic bases.  This is what I'm trying to, to work on as we move along.  We as a people, African Americans, still need to develop better economics between us and Africa.  And one of the many things that I want to do is to try to stimulate better economic connecting links between African Americans and Africans.  I believe that if we can do that, we will develop better power bases for ourselves and for the country.  Let's face when I talk in terms of us, I mean collectively the country.  The United States needs all of its elements, racial elements, to work better together than we have, than we are doing.  I want us to use our abilities, to really use the intelligence that we have developed for our benefit again and for the country.  My theme that I used pretty much when I was on my Africa lecture series was from Kunta Kinte to [HistoryMaker Gen.] Colin [L.] Powell and the development of where we have been to where we are now.  And, of course, we look at so many things have happened in my lifetime, you understand, I would like to project it more.  I would like not only for my family to feel good about me and my, whatever my experiences have been but the race, and, and the country, you understand.  I mean my experiences, they're all challenges.  And somehow I'd ask again, I ask the Old Man upstairs to let me stay here a little longer to get at least some of these things accomplished that I'd like to see.
Story_ID: 216193
Speaker 1: And just in terms of the 'Roots[: the Saga of an American Family,' Alex Haley] legacy, do you think that kind of inspired many African Americans to really begin to research and learn their history?
Speaker 2: There's no doubt about it.  Not only African Americans, it went greater than that.  Many others who hadn't thought about it, I'm talking about white Americans, did as well.  For instance, shortly thereafter they asked Alex [Haley] to come to the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.] because the archives were the, the archives building I'm not, I'm, I guess, I'm, well, of course, where the building, the archives--
Speaker 1: National Archives [Building, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: National Archives, were becoming, so many people coming in to try to, you know, inquire about their history and whatnot that they needed more money (laughter).  So they used him, asked him to come and talk a little bit more about, about that.
Story_ID: 216194
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) How would I like to be remembered?  I'd like to have people think in terms of whatever my accomplishments have been, I've worked at, and will continue as long as I can to work at helping to make things better than where I found them, and they are.  They, I mean, that I can work to, toward helping the family, the race, the nation, the world.  I really mean that.  I mean it sounds, you know, well it's a vision.
Story_ID: 216195
Speaker 1: And why do you think history is important?
Speaker 2: I think history is important so we can at least look at where we have come from and hopefully develop relationships better than they are.  I like a statement that Winston Churchill made, in which he said, "What is the use in living unless it is to make the world better for those who come after you," [sic.].  And I would certainly like to think that the world will be better by my having lived.
Story_ID: 216196
Speaker 1: --Go ahead Mr. [HistoryMaker George] Haley.  Just tell us, yeah.
Speaker 2: This picture is one when the vice president, then Senator [Hubert] Humphrey came to Kansas City [Kansas] and was greeting us there in 1967.

Speaker 1: That would have been nineteen--approximately 1972.
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)

Speaker 1: That's my big brother, Alex, at the time he--after he had produced the book 'Roots[: The Saga of an American Family,' Alex Haley].

Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is the director of history and political science of Kansas State University [Manhattan, Kansas], [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] and myself when he came to make a speech at Kansas State University--

Speaker 2: That's right.  I'm right there
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Senator Strom Thurmond's office.
Speaker 1: About what year?
Speaker 2: Now I think that would have been, wait a minute nineteen--I'm thinking 1980s.  I'm not exactly sure.
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighties [1980s]?  1980s?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, I believe that would have been 1980s.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is of course, [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson, my wife [Doris Moxley Haley], and me at Shiloh Baptist Church in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: About what year?
Speaker 2: See--again, that would probably be 1978.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I think that's it.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Haley.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, yeah, this was [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett and myself.  Lerone and I are classmates at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: About what year?
Speaker 2: And this was done in 1967.  He's the senior editor of Ebony then and now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Very historic picture.  This picture is of the relatives in Jufureh [The Gambia], West Africa, my, my relatives, the, the Kunta Kinte clan.  Beatur [ph.] is on the, sitting next to my wife, and then there's my son [David Haley] and wife, their then two children, they now have four, and they had come.  We had invited them to come over, and they spent the 2000 year over in The Gambia with us but we took them out there.
Speaker 2: About what year?
Speaker 1: Two thousand [2000].
Speaker 2: Two thousand [2000].
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Mr. Haley.  I'm sorry.

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A Christmas function at the White House with President [George Herbert Walker Bush] and Mrs. [Barbara] Bush, Doris and me, and that would have been like 1991.  Does it say?
Speaker 1: Yep, 1991.  Good guess.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Make sure you get that one. That's my dear grandma, Cynthia [Murray] Palmer, and me.  And that was made just after I finished my basic training and I had gone to Henning [Tennessee] before I was traveling.
