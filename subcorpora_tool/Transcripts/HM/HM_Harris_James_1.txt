Speaker 1: So, I want talk you about your family now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I'd like to start off by talking about your mom.  So, if you could tell me her name and spell it, and tell me where she was born and where she grew up.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My mother--I, I was born, I'm the third child in a family of four, three girls and one boy.  My mother, Emma Jones Harris, was born in Charleston, South Carolina.  She moved from Charleston, South Carolina to Jacksonville, Florida where she met and married my father, Grover Harris.  And they migrated to Boston [Massachusetts] I think maybe in 1940--
Speaker 1: Do you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) from Jacksonville.
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about your mother's childhood, like did she ever tell you any anecdotes about when she was growing up?
Speaker 2: My mother's biggest desire back when she was born, she was born in 1919, so back then, her biggest desire was to graduate from high school, and which she did manage to do in the early '60s [1960s].  She went back to night school, and back then, she graduated--it was, it was high school then, but it was night school.
Speaker 1: Does she have, did she have to drop out of school? I mean, did she get any schooling when she was young (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They dropped out--I think because of the Depression [Great Depression], you know, during the Depression, a lot of people in this country, not just black, black and white.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: So, you were talking about the Depression and saying that a number of people had to drop out of school.  Could you tell us about that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  Like my mother and them in Jacksonville [Florida], I didn't think it was the biggest economic community.  So, a lot of people in her era did not graduate from school.  So, therefore, she had to drop out to help my grandmother [Essie Jones], and the rest of the family because it was like thirteen of them.
Speaker 2: And how did she help?
Speaker 1: They helped by working.  My Aunt Vi [Viola Jones] worked in a funeral home.  She was a hairdresser, went to Apex beauty school [Apex School of Beauty Culture] in Jacksonville.  My Aunt Anna [Anna Harvin Grant] went on to further her education.  She went to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], I think it was.  And she also went to FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  And she later became the head of the sociology department for Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia.
Speaker 2: And are those--does your sister have--does your mother have how many sisters?
Speaker 1: (Makes sound), it probably was, like thirteen of them.
Speaker 2: Oh, there are thirteen altogether?
Speaker 1: Thirteen altogether.  And, in the family, they had your children, my children, and our children.  When my grandmother married my grandfather [Isaac Jones], she had two kids, and he had four.  And then, from that union came, my mother was the first of that union.  It was my mother--which is Emma [Emma Jones Harris], Anna [Anna Jones], William [William Jones], Vi, Buster [John Jones], and Essie Mae [Essie Mae Jones].
Story_ID: 598404
Speaker 1: You talked a little bit about your aunt being at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And what was she doing there?
Speaker 2: She was the head of the sociology department for Morehouse.  Her name was Dr. Anna Harvin Grant.
Speaker 1: And you mentioned that she had a number of interesting friends and colleagues?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, she taught Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], and Calvin Butts [HistoryMaker Dr. Reverend Calvin O. Butts], just to name a few.  I was supposed to go to Morehouse.  I went for freshman orientation, and with me being from Boston [Massachusetts] back then, it was such a Chocolate City so it made me nervous, so I went back home.
Speaker 1: And what about your--
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: So just a bit of repetition, your, you said your aunt's most prominent students or most memorable, memorable students were--
Speaker 2: Dr. Martin Luther King, who ended up being the Nobel Peace Prize winner and the head of the Civil Rights Movement, and Calvin Butts, who is now the head minister for Abyssinian Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: Which is in Harlem [New York, New York].
Story_ID: 598405
Speaker 1: What about your father?  Where was he from and what was his name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, my fath- my father's name was Grover Harris, G-R-O-V-E-R, and Harris, of course, H-A-double R-I-S.  And he was from Oglethorpe, Georgia.  He also moved to Jacksonville, Florida--again, where he met my mother [Emma Jones Harris], and they became married, and produced the children.  I have two sisters who were born in Jacksonville, the late Emma Sellman, and Barbara Roach [Barbara Harris Roach].  And I was born in Boston [Massachusetts].  My father, being a blue collar worker back then, he moved to Boston.  And when they moved to Boston, my father became a master welder.  After working for--it was Bethlehem Steel [Bethlehem Steel Corporation] for so many years, and we called him Gugga [ph.].  My sister, Yvonne [Emma Harris Sellman (ph.)], could not say Grover when she was a baby.  She would always say Gugga, so with her calling him Gugga for so long, that was my father's name throughout the entire family, Gugga.
Speaker 1: And did you call him Daddy or did you call him--
Speaker 2: We called him Gugga.
Speaker 1: And do you have any stories about Gugga when he was growing up?
Speaker 2: The reason the family got to Boston was my father was involved back then with some racial dispute.  And in the dispute, someone got killed.  And my father left town, and came to Boston, and with him coming to Boston, so came the rest of the family.
Speaker 1: And so, what are the--could you describe your father for us?
Speaker 2: My father looked--his mother, Mary Sue [Mary Harris (ph.)], was black, and they came from the Blackfoot tribe of Indians [Native American].  So, he all- he was very proud of that, and he always spoke of that.  And my father was really dark, dark, brown skinned gentleman.  We all look alike.  He was more handsome than I was, though, 'cause he was really black, so black is really pretty.  So, we looked an awful lot alike, the whole family looks like to this day.  If you saw a roomful of Harrises, you would pick us out.
Story_ID: 598406
Speaker 1: What was his temperament like?
Speaker 2: My father [Grover Harris] was very cool.  We never had to go outside at fifteen to beat your butt.  My father--one day I came home.  I was too grown, and I came in the house, and he said something to me, and I said something back to him, and closed the door.  My father walked down the hall, knocked on the door, and said, "Yo champ, I think it's time for you to put your show on the road."  So, my father never--we never had--he never beat me because we never--I never crossed that line.  I always respected him and knew what he was.  I respected, knew who my mother was.  That's where I come from.  We respected your adults.  Your mother could look at you, that meant shut up.  My father was never a problem.  He would look at you, and you knew when to shut up, but I wasn't a bad kid either.
Speaker 1: What was your mother [Emma Jones Harris] like?  Could you describe her temperament?
Speaker 2: My mother was, like all black mothers of the time, very strong, was the, she was the one that made sure--she was the disciplinarian.  She was the sergeant in arms.  If you ever wanted to get, or had to get a beating, my sister said, you wanted to have a beating from your father, and not your mother, 'cause your mother would wear that butt out, and your father would give you one or two hits (laughter).  So, we were fortunate in that aspect to have a mother that was caring.  I do remember my mother working, I remember my father working.  I think back in our time, what we have to be proud of is I came from a black community.  I didn't come from a black poor poverty stricken ghetto.  And my age group, I don't know--we, we were all poor, but poor was relative.  When you had a mother and father in the same household, and they both were working, that's a difference.  You know, my mother wasn't on welfare, my father wasn't on welfare.  Both of them worked, and we made the best of whatever we did with that money.  Whatever they brought home, they, you know, provided for you.  We had a house, we went to school, and that was that.  I know when my father died was when I realized I wish I could tell him, thank you.
Story_ID: 598407
Speaker 1: Did you spend time with your grandparents on either side?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandmother was blind so--
Speaker 1: Your mother's mother?
Speaker 2: My mother's mother was blind.
Speaker 1: Do you know her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Emma Boyd Amica Jones [Essie Jones], okay.  And as a matter of fact, she and [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt were cousins.  She was from South Carolina also.  So, when you hear Eartha Kitt talk about her family in South Carolina, my grandmother was one of them.  My grandmother, being blind, which is probably one of the reasons I'm a hairdresser, not because she taught me how to do hair--the dexterity, my grandmother taught me how to sew.  I would have been a wonderful designer because she taught me how to sew, and I know how to feel with my hands, so the dexterity with my hands, which is so important for the hairdressing industry, I got from her.
Speaker 1: And did you spend time with her in Boston [Massachusetts], or did you spend time with her in South Carolina?
Speaker 2: In Boston.  My grand- when the family moved to Boston, everybody came to Boston.  So, my grandmother came with us also.  My grandmother stayed with my Aunt Vi [Viola Jones] until she died.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: What about your father's parents?  You said your father--your grandmother was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) My--
Speaker 2: -- a Native woman [Native American].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: My father's mother stayed in Jacksonville [Florida].  She came to Boston maybe once or twice when I was a, an infant, but I went down to Jacksonville to meet her, and I had met her a couple of times.  And her name was, like I said, Mary Sue [Mary Harris (ph.)], and she, again, being a Blackfoot Indian, my father's side of the family is very, very dark, very Indian like, with high cheekbones and long black hair.
Story_ID: 598408
Speaker 1: What's your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: I can remember one of the instances that happened to me as a twelve year old.  When we talk about segregation, and we talk about black people and where we come from, I can remember going to Jacksonville, Florida.  I was twelve years old and we went to Jacksonville on the train.  And this was right when segregation had been lifted, and we had black people that were integrated.  And I can remember being in the train station in Jacksonville, Florida at twelve years old, seeing the sign that said colored only.  I can remember going back to do a shooting for Revlon [Revlon, Inc.] when I was in my forties, and we took a picture of my model.  And she was in front of the same train station, dripping in Chanel, and this would have been thirty years later.  Here I am, in front of the train station that I had to go in the back door, so that was one of the best moments I could have ever had in my life for me and my family.
Story_ID: 598409
Speaker 1: And what was your family life like when you were living at home with all your family together?
Speaker 2: My family life was very, very easy.  I was the oldest of my mother's siblings so, therefore, it was me, Deborah [ph.], Charles [ph.], and Snoop [ph.], and it was the four of us.  And we were raised together.  We went to school together.  After school, we went to Aunt Vi's [Viola Jones] house after, after school.  We went to dancing school together.  We went to Diana Cohen School of Dance in Boston [Massachusetts], and we were known as the Joneses.  And we used to dance all over the city.  So, I guess we were the Jacksons [The Jackson Five].  So, we were--I mean, my childhood was not without pain, as anybody's is, you know, you have to grow up.  And being a teenager, you will try them.
Speaker 1: Well, give us some context.  You said your parents [Emma Jones Harris and Grover Harris] moved to Boston in 1940.  You came along in 1948.
Speaker 2: Forty-eight [1948], yeah.
Speaker 1: What is Boston in the, in the '40s [1940s] like?  What, what's, what's the Boston area like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, in--
Speaker 1: --and then, let me ask you later about your personal community?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Boston--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Boston, in the '40s [1940s], I don't remember, simply because in '48 [1948], I was born.  In 1954, I think it had to be, we moved to New Jersey.  My father had a trucking company and we moved to Newark, New Jersey.  And I started school at the Miller Street School [Miller Street Elementary School, Newark, New Jersey] at the age of six, so I'm going to imagine it was about that time.  We stayed in New Jersey for a year, and then moved back to Boston.  Boston was one of the most segregated cities I have ever witnessed.  I didn't realize how segregated it was until I became a teenager, and it came time for me to register for the draft.  I was registered for, for the draft during the Vietnam War.  And at that time, they also had Louise Day Hicks and the picture of the man waving the American flag down on city hall [Boston City Hall Plaza, Boston, Massachusetts].  That was the same day I got my beauty license.  That was in 1974.  So, for me to see that, and to witness that, it was very imperative that I became a very strong representation of my people.  As I say earlier, I was also raised in the Nation of Islam from a little boy 'til a teenager.
Story_ID: 598410
Speaker 1: How old were you when your parents [Emma Jones Harris and Grover Harris] joined the Nation of Islam?
Speaker 2: My sister, Yvonne [Emma Harris Sellman (ph.)], joined.  And my Aunt Sarah [ph.] and Uncle Willie [ph.] were, were members.  The whole family didn't join.  I went because my oldest sister went.  You guys know him as Louis--I mean, Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], and I know him as Louis ten, X [Louis X].  My Aunt Sarah and them had a restaurant, which is called Unity Lunch--no, the T and W, T and W Snack Bar [ph.], which was on Blue Hill Avenue and Stanwood Street.  And I remember in the summertime being there in the restaurant waiting tables, and waiting on Malcolm X and Louis ten, X.  I'd be waiting on them and I was like a little kid with big eyes.  I didn't realize the giants I was working on, but I realized who these men were, and the conversations they would have.  Malcolm X would come to the restaurant.  He would have breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the same table, so it was always an experience around them.  My Aunt Sarah and them made a recipe for the bean pie.  She and Betty Shabazz, and I just got finished speaking with Aunt Sarah last week, and she was saying how Sister Betty wanted her to teach a cooking class.  And Aunt Sarah said that she only went to the fifth grade and she thought she couldn't do it.
Speaker 1: She was interested in her--having her teaching a cooking class--
Speaker 2: Teaching a cooking class and a health class (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Speaker 2: --with her back when they were--this, this is back in the '50s [1950s] when, '50s [1950s] and early '60s [1960s] when the temple was really on its rise.  It was a--might have been Temple 39 [sic. Masjid Al-Quran] on Intervale Street [Boston, Massachusetts], but this was back before Sister Betty even married Malcolm X.
Speaker 1: When they created, when she was interested in having her teach a cooking class?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when, yeah, Betty was, Sister Betty was, the nurse, and she was all about health.  And with her having these classes for the Muslim women, she wanted Aunt Sarah to do a class teaching women how to cook, and put together the recipes.  And she told--Aunt Sarah told her that she only had a fifth grade education, and she didn't feel as though that she could do it.  And Betty told her that if you can do it, we can see it.
Speaker 1: So, your parents did not join the Nation of Islam?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Instead, your sister joined with your aunts and uncles?
Speaker 2: Yes, with my Aunt Sarah and Uncle Willie.  Aunt Sarah and Uncle Willie were husband and wife.
Speaker 1: And you decided to join?
Speaker 2: I was always going, so I decided to join.
Speaker 1: And Aunt, did Aunt Sarah and Uncle Willie join in Boston [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, about what year do you think that they joined, or about what time do you think the Nation of--came to Boston?
Speaker 2: They joined--the Nation was there from what I can remember.  And Aunt Sarah and Uncle Willie joined maybe in '56 [1956].
Speaker 1: And do you have any sense of why they joined?  What resonated for them with the Nation (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the family was always involved with the church.  All black families have a spiritual background and a spiritual connection, so Aunt Sarah and them were Christians and Baptists.  And they went to New Hope Baptist Church [Boston, Massachusetts], I can remember.  And the whole family was a member of the church.  They had the, the gospel choir, the senior choir, and the men's choir, and all of the men and the women in the family participated in those choirs.  Of course, I was with the youth choir, so I don't know where the split came, and why they went to Islam, but that's just the way it was.
Story_ID: 598411
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember at all your experience of being a, a member of the church, what the atmosphere was like, what kind of things you did (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I've always had a spiritual connection.  I believe in God, just like I did a show in California with Clifford Peterson. And Clifford was on La Cienega [Boulevard].  And Clifford and [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson's niece had a salon called Shear Joy [ph.], and there was a gentleman that had a restaurant there.  His name was Billy Bongo [ph.], and he said he was going to court the next day for a, a driving violation.  And I said, "Well, just pray to God that everything is going to turn out okay."  And he said, "Well, I'll pray to Allah," and I told him, "I will take the Arabic name for it," okay.  So, I believe in God, and everybody does.  It's just how you serve Him and how you plan to approach Him.  You know, everybody has a different avenue of getting to Him, whether you be Hebrew, Muslim, Catholic, Protestant.
Speaker 1: Well, do you remember any of that Nation of Islam experience when you were a kid?
Speaker 2: The experience I had, I was like eleven to twelve, so it's--I can remember going to the Nation, and me not getting my X because you had, they would say was a process.  And the whole entire process, I wasn't able to fulfill.
Speaker 1: And so, once you didn't fulfill the process, did you move on from the church, and sort of return to a different church or--
Speaker 2: I may still would go, you know, Sunday in Boston [Massachusetts], you went to a house of worship, okay.  So, I went to the mosque with my sister and them.
Speaker 1: And so, how long would you say you were involved with the Nation of Islam just--
Speaker 2: Until about thirteen, 'til about thirteen.  And then, I went to Catholic school, transition, went to St. John's [St. John School, Boston Massachusetts], and from St. John's, we went up to the William E. Endicott School [William E. Endicott Elementary School, Boston, Massachusetts].  And from there, you go to the Sarah Greenwood [Sarah Greenwood School, Boston Massachusetts], which is like the middle school.  Then you go from the Sarah Greenwood to Oliver Wendell Holmes [Oliver Wendell Holmes School, Boston, Massachusetts], and that's the junior high school.  And after junior high school, I went to Hyde Park High [Hyde Park High School, Boston, Massachusetts] where I met Stevie Shepard [Steven Shepard], and that's when my hairdressing career took off--
Story_ID: 598412
Speaker 1: Just backing up just a little bit.  Can you just name your siblings in order and spell any--
Speaker 2: Okay.  My oldest sister is Emma Harris, Emma Harris Sellman [ph.], and we called her Yvonne.  Yvonne had four daughters--Michelle [ph.], Travon [ph.], Cassandra [ph.], and Rona [ph.].  Barbara Jean, we call her Barbara Jean, Barbara Jean Harris Roach [Barbara Harris Roach].  Barbara has two boys and a girl.  She has Webby, Webster, Jr. [Webster Roach, Jr.].  Then we have Keith [Keith Roach], who I have his two granddau- his two daughters here with me today--they're twins, they're my grand-nieces, and Tanesha [Tanesha Roach], who was her baby.  And then, we have my youngest sister, Cindy, or her name is Glynis, so we call her Cindy, Glynis Harris, her last name now is Rogers, so it's Glynis Harris Rogers, and she has one boy.  And they (air quotes) tricked into this one--his name is (background noise) James (unclear) Harris also.
Story_ID: 598413
Speaker 1: What street did you live on?
Speaker 2: We started off--it was in Madison Park [Boston, Massachusetts].  If you ever saw the movie with Bette Davis, the 'Now, Voyager,' that movie was filmed in Madison Park where I grew up.
Speaker 1: And can you describe that block?
Speaker 2: It was a block, very similar to Brewster Place, where, again, like I said, you had the black community.  There was a store on the corner called Walters [ph.].  Next to Walters down the block was Janice McElvaine's [ph.] father.  And he was like, very spo-dee-o-dee because he had--that was Johnny McElvaine [ph.], and they had, like these after hour clubs down there.  Then we had the Kellys who lived around the corner and she had a set of twins.  It was Bernice Kelly [ph.], and then she had twins.  One was Joan [ph.], Jean [ph.] and Joan, and one got killed.  Then there was the Youngs [ph.] around the corner, there was thirteen of them.  Then, on the next block was my Aunt Sarah [ph.] and Uncle Willie [ph.] who never had any kids, so all of the children were, were theirs.  Then, we had my Aunt Marie [Marie Jones].  Marie had four kids.  Then we had my Aunt Essie Mae [Essie Mae Jones] who had thirteen.  So, that whole park was really, instead of it being Madison Park, could have been renamed Jones Park.  I go home to Boston [Massachusetts] now when they have Juneteen [Juneteenth], and when you go there, you see everybody you have ever known throughout your entire life.  The one thing about Boston, which I enjoy, Bostonians have always been together, and true, true Bostonians are still together.
Story_ID: 598414
Speaker 1: What sights, sounds, and smells remind you of that Jones Park [Madison Park, Boston, Massachusetts] from when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: The one thing I can remember about my youth is snow on my face.  I can remember the snow hitting my face, so whenever I see snow, I always think of home.  We used to go to Franklin Park [Boston, Massachusetts] to go sledding and whenev- whenever--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Some of the smells I can remember, I, I love the smell of barbecue because the family always had barbecues going on.  I love to, to this day, get on the floor, 'cause as a kid, whenever the family got together in the dining room, there was enough room for the adults, and the kids had to put the newspaper on the floor.  And I always find myself gravitating to the floor.  I feel very strong and very secure when I'm sitting down on the floor.  That's just the natural order of things for me.
Story_ID: 598415
Speaker 1: So, with holidays, did you all--everyone in the neighborhood gather together at your house?  What did special occasions and holidays look like (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the central point, my [maternal] grandmother [Essie Jones] stayed with my Aunt Vi [Viola Jones].  So, therefore, everybody, everybody went to Aunt Vi's house, so you were at Aunt Vi's house until my grandmother died.  And when she died, I was fourteen.
Speaker 1: And, so did they do a lot of cooking?  What--
Speaker 2: There was always--
Speaker 1: What was, what was the most important holiday?
Speaker 2: I mean, everybody, everybody in the family can cook.  There was always Labor Day, you spent together.  Memorial Day, you spent together.  The 4th of July, you spent together.  All of the holidays was always spent in a family cluster at most picnics, we always went to a place called City Point, and City Point in Boston [South Boston, Boston, Massachusetts] was a beach where there was a, a--what do you call those things--the bandstand?  And the black people sat around the bandstand because that's where the trees were.  Then you would cross the road, and it was nothing but sand and the beach, and that's where the white people were.  They suntanned and we chilled.
Speaker 1: Where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: I went to, like I said, I started school in Newark [New Jersey], and it was the Miller Street School [Miller Street Elementary School].  We moved back to Boston, and I went to St. John's [St. John School, Boston Massachusetts].  From St. John's, that was at the third grade.  Then, from the third grade to the sixth grade, I went to William E. Endicott School [William E. Endicott Elementary School] in Dorchester [Boston, Massachusetts].  From the William E. Endicott School, I went to junior high school, which was the Oliver Wendell Holmes [Oliver Wendell Holmes School, Boston, Massachusetts.]
Story_ID: 598416
Speaker 1: --Tell us a little bit about your elementary school experience.  What kind of a student were you?
Speaker 2: I was always energetic, and always in the forefront, and always wanted to be an entertainer.  I remember in St. John's [St. John School, Boston, Massachusetts], I won a gold cross because we had to--they did a talent show.  And I went around with Miss, Sister Ann Marie [ph.], and I went to each of the classrooms, and we were singing.  And I sang--I can't remember the name of the song--it'll come to me tomorrow.  And I won, so I had that gold cross.  Then, of course, I got to be the celebrity of the school, and ended up being--pissed off one of the, the nuns.  And she gave me, a, a spanking one day with that ruler.  See, they didn't use the rack then, they used the ruler.  So, she whacked my hands with the ruler, and sent me back to my classroom, and put me under her desk.  So, that was my grammar school days with St. John's (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, what--
Speaker 2: But from that, it just let you know--no matter how good you are, you still have to toe the line.
Speaker 1: What were your dreams when you were in elementary school?  You said you were interested in being an entertainer.  Did you think that was what you were going to do?
Speaker 2: I was always--being around the family, even up to this day, I have a hard time saying no, I never say no.  I'm going to try to do it for you.  We never said no.  I mean, "Yvonne [Emma Harris Sellman (ph.)], I need so and so, and so." "Fine, you got it."  "Gugga [Harris' father, Grover Harris], I need so and so," you got it.  We--it's hard for us to say no.  'Cause I was raised around the family, and your family never abused you.  They never wanted to hurt you.  They never stole from you.
Speaker 1: Well, what, what did you think you wanted to be in life when you were in grade school?
Speaker 2: In front of the camera.  We ended up, like I said, we had the family, and it was me, Deborah [ph.], Charles [ph.], and Snoop [ph.].  And we danced, we went to dancing school, so we were always in front of the public in some aspect.  Either, we were dancing in dancing school, or in charge of this in, in, in high school.  You were always in charge of some group, and you were always involved in programs, always involved in programs, whether it be the student council, whether it be the glee club, you were always involved with some program.
Speaker 1: Did you have any teachers that influenced you in grammar school?
Speaker 2: There was one.  She was in the Sarah Greenwood School [Boston Massachusetts].  Her name was Ms. Valarosie [ph.], and Ms. Valarosie dressed her butt off.  And with her dressing so much, and my sister, Barbara [Barbara Harris Roach], the whole family dressed.  Well, my sister, Barbara, was always impeccable.  So, it always had me being dressed up.  I didn't get my first pair of jeans until I got grown and I had to buy them.  We always dressed up.  And Ms. Valarosie was always, she was always impeccable, always sharp, and that registers to me 'til this day.

Speaker 1: Where did you to junior high school?
Speaker 2: It was the Oliver Wendell Holmes [Oliver Wendell Holmes School, Boston, Massachusetts], and that was, again, a real integrated school.  I didn't realize until maybe when I became an adult how ignorant people were.  Here, you have a school of mixed cultures, you have black kids, you have white kids, you have Asian kids, and we're all day in the same school.  And what made us different was color, the same girls--I can't remember all their names, but some of the girls that I went to school with, they were bums back then.  These were white bums, there were black bums, there were Asian bums, and guess what?  They're still bums to this day.  You had some girls that inspired to be something.  There was also a lot of the kids that came from the hill.  We call Humboldt Avenue the hill.  We had Lawson Riley--his father has the funeral home [Riley Funeral Home, Inc.; Riley Antoine Funeral Home, Boston, Massachusetts].  His name was Lawson Riley.
Speaker 1: And who lived over the hill?
Speaker 2: On the hill was the bougie blacks, okay.  We had, there was another girl, Sharon Moore [ph.].  Sharon Moore was like the lead dancer.  There was a woman, [HistoryMaker] Elma Lewis.  And Elma Lewis had the Elma Lewis National Center of Afro-American Artists [sic. National Center of Afro-American Artists, Boston, Massachusetts], and Elma Lewis won one of the MacArthur Foundations [John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation].  And Elma Lewis taught me something as a kid.  I heard her say it.  I didn't go to her dancing school.  I went to Diana Cohen dancing school [Diana Cohen School of Dance, Boston, Massachusetts], so I, I tapped--we did tap, ballet, and modern jazz.  And Elma Lewis, she did African dance mainly, and ballet.  And Elma Lewis said something to me as a teenager, "You don't mean anything to white people unless you mean something to black people," and that has stuck with me to this day.
Speaker 1: When you were in junior high, did you have any teachers who influenced you strongly--
Speaker 2: In junior high was when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) at Oliver Wendell Holmes?
Speaker 2: --my rebel, rebel thing started.  That was when my first black teacher--there wasn't but three.  And I went all through school with only, with having all white teachers.  And when I got to junior high school, there was Barbara Garlington, she came.  There was Hughie [ph.], but Hughie came on the last year, and he was the physical ed [physical education] teacher.  And Elizabeth Teixeira, and those are the only three black teachers I have had throughout my entire education.
Speaker 1: Wow.  So, when you were in junior high school, you said you were getting a little rebellious.  Did you still think that you were be an entertainer?  What were your aspirations?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess at fourteen or fifteen, you, you'll, you'll--I, we always wanted to be grown.  So, I always wanted to be adult, me in a suit was never a problem.  I was a mischievous kid, but I wasn't harmful.  We did teenage things.  You snuck out of school to go to get a pizza.  You snuck out of school to go down to catch the sale at Filene's Basement.  That was all we did (laughter).  We didn't smoke, we didn't drink, we didn't jump anybody.  There was no gangs.  It was always a clean cut neighborhood, but you did not--it was some areas you didn't go it, and some areas they didn't go in.  The Four Corners in Boston [Dorchester, Boston, Massachusetts] was where the poor white kids went, so you didn't go over there, 'cause, you know, you're going to fight them.  In Grove Hall [Boston, Massachusetts], you didn't go to Grove Hall 'cause that's where the poor black folks and the hip black folks hung out, and you didn't go there.  So, I would take my butt right on home and sit down.
Story_ID: 598418
Speaker 1: And what was the name or title of your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: I lived in Dorchester [Boston, Massachusetts].  Dorchester was like, again, it was a black community.  Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] and Dorchester was the first of the black community when they started busing, when they were, during the--we had de facto segregation.  And when they started the busing, I think when they started bringing people from the south on the bus, it opened up a floodgate of people that learned to deal with white people on a certain level.  See, I was not insecure around white people, I was their equal.  People that came from the bus and came up here on the bus, they felt a little inferior, see.
Speaker 1: Now, you said that Boston [Massachusetts] was particularly racist, but you didn't notice until later.  And now, you're also saying that it gave you a familiarity with white folks, so can you talk just a little bit about the atmosphere of Boston being racist, and how it affected you and your counterparts (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It didn't become nasty until Louise Day Hicks.  She made some statements a couple of times.  And then, when some poor Irish folks, I had nothing to do with the world, I was just born.  And in Boston, you had an Irish community, which was South Boston, which you did not go to.  When South Boston played Dorchester [Dorchester High School, Boston, Massachusetts], every policeman in town was at White Stadium [Boston, Massachusetts].  These two groups did not clash, and it was the ignorance that they clashed.  They were ignorant towards what black people liked, and black people were ignorant to what, what Irish people liked.  And that kept us apart, but you didn't, you didn't want to go to South Boston High [South Boston High School, Boston, Massachusetts], and they didn't want to go to Dorchester, so that was it.  When Louise Day Hicks said that when they were starting the busing, "You're not going to bus these kids over here," and blah, blah, blah, blah.  I thought they did--my kids are in a, in a disservice.  Why would you take my kids out of their neighborhood to go over here, and deal with these poor element of people in South Boston to go over there, and to abuse their selves?  No, no, no, I wasn't down for that.  There was a guy--I know we had a radio station called WILD [WILD Radio, Boston, Massachusetts].  And WILD, I was driving up to the Southeast Expressway [Interstate 93] one day.  And there was some white guy that called the, the radio station, and he, he said the N word.  "If you want some trouble, you come over here to South Boston, and we'll give it to you."  So, I ran, and before cell phones, I took the car, and I just took an exit.  I don't know where I was, took an exit, and found a phone, and I called the radio station.  I said, "This phone call is for this gentleman that just called here.  And what I want you to realize is that my brother is in--fighting in Vietnam.  And with him fighting in Vietnam, he's fighting for these Vietnam children to swim, or to go to school wherever they damn well please.  What I want all of the veterans to do, is to put your uniforms on, and let's all meet down here at South Boston, and meet these buses, and let's fight.  If you can go to Vietnam and fight, if you can go to France and fight, then you can come to South Boston and fight, so your kids can go to school, wherever they damn well please to."
Speaker 1: And did a fight precipitate from that?
Speaker 2: No, that was just me get, blowing off steam, honey.  But I rant because, and I minded- what is wrong with this man getting an education?  What's wrong with that girl getting an education?  Education will save the world.  We had a black man that--Charles Drew [Charles R. Drew] invented the blood plasma [sic.].  We had the black guy that laid out Washington, D.C.  We have had the black guy that made the SAT scores.  He was black.  So, we have had black people that had, did more contributions to this country than anybody else.  We still don't have the cure for cancer.  We don't have the cure for AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] and, again, a black child might have the answer.
Story_ID: 598419
Speaker 1: Where'd you go to high school?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I went to Hyde Park High [Hyde Park High School, Boston, Massachusetts] for a hot minute.  There was eleven blacks in the whole school, and there was never any problem.  I'm not a runner.  I'm a fighter, and at that point, I realized that I'm black, and I want to be a black man.  And being a black man, I also want to be an American.  And Americans, I don't know second best.  I have never been second best to anyone.  So, therefore, I went to high school--I had one fight.  Her name was Ms. Doavitch [ph.], was the English teacher, and we were in the lunchroom.  And she said, "James [HistoryMaker James Harris], I want you to go upstairs, and write on the board--to have the kids to write a paragraph on how it feels to be an elephant."  So, I went up after lunch and wrote on the board--English class, Ms. Doavitch wants you to write a paragraph on how it feels to be an elephant.  And the biggest kid in the room, in the school, their last name was Hirsch [ph.].  He come walking down the aisle.  He gave me the finger, so I said, "Well, you can take that, and give that to your mother."  You know, we're all kids.  So, he came walking down the aisle to get me--big strapping football player--he was walking down the aisle to get me.  And all I saw was the window pole, we had pulley windows back then.  And he walking down the aisle, and he walked up on me, and I don't--and I blanked out.  And when I came to, he was laying on the floor with two or three hits in his head, okay. So I don't know who threw the first part, but I know I was standing when he got finished (laughter).
Speaker 1: What kind of a student were you in high school?
Speaker 2: I was a--
Speaker 1: And where did you go after you left Hyde Park (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was a B student, and in high school, I was grown.  By fifteen or sixteen, I was grown.  I knew what I wanted to do.  I started selling wigs.  There was a name--her name was Carol [ph.].  Ms. Carol was a, a typing teacher, and she taught typing to the other good--I wasn't in typing.  I was a college, a college major, and I sold her some wigs, and I started selling wigs in high school.
Story_ID: 598420
Speaker 1: And how did you start selling wigs?
Speaker 2: Well, it was me and Michelle Singleton [ph.].  We were buddies.  And they introduced me to Stevie Shepard [Steven Shepard].  So, I'm fifteen, and Stevie was a ex-tech for Boston City Hospital [Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts], and Stevie was selling wigs at the time.  So, we all became friends, and next thing I know, I started selling wigs, too.
Speaker 1: And were you already interested, involved in the hair industry or (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, my Aunt Vi [Viola Jones] was a hairdresser, and I'd been doing hair ever since I was like about twelve or thirteen.
Speaker 1: At her shop?
Speaker 2: No, it was in her house.  You know, Aunt Vi went to Apex [Apex School of Beauty Culture]--I said in Jacksonville, Florida, and she was doing hair in her house.  And she did everybody in town, so I was watching her, so I could press and curl back since I was, ooh, whenever.
Speaker 1: And was your uncle a barber?
Speaker 2: And my uncle was a barber, Uncle Buster, but his name is John Jones.  He had a barbershop on the corner of Blue Hill [Avenue] and Faysting [sic. Fayston Street].  That was back in the '60s [1960s] where the guys wore the cravatses [cravats] and stuff, and they would set the guy's hair with the conks, and wave them and push them up.  And when I graduated from high school [Newman School for Boys; The Newman School, Boston, Massachusetts], I went to his barbershop to work.  He put a salon for me down in the basement, and I was doing quite well.
Speaker 1: And you were mostly doing women?
Speaker 2: I did all women, yes.
Speaker 1: Press and curl?
Speaker 2: No, at that time, we were doing perms.
Speaker 1: So, talk to me a little bit about that hair history.  So, what kind of hair when you show up, when you become old enough to do hair in your aunt's shop, what's she doing with black hair?  And then, what do you subsequently do?
Speaker 2: Well, I--by then they were press and curls.  And back then, I think the hottest thing was Lustrasilk.  And they used to take the Lustrasilk, and you would put it on dry hair, and you'd put the solution on, and you would press it in, and it made the hair silk, just feel like silk, very light and very silky, that had that oil and everything.  And then you would curl it.  So, watching her press and curl, when I got to be old enough, I'd ask her to show me some things.  I know how to Marcel. I know how to water wave.  And all that, I learned from Aunt Vi, 'cause that's what they learned in beauty school at the time.
Speaker 1: And the Marcel and the body wave are different forms of pressing with the hot comb (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Marcel, when you take a Marcel wave, you would take it, you'd go to the left when you want to put the ridge of the top.  And then you go to the left, when you want to put your wave on the bottom.  So it's right, left, right, left, you go up, you go down, you pull.  So, it's a technique that is probably dying today simply because the beauty schools don't teach that anymore.
Speaker 1: Now, were the women in your aunt's shop wearing wigs, such that when you hooked with Steven, wigs were an obvious market desire?
Speaker 2: Well, Aunt Vi could handle in the house, like I said.
Speaker 1: I apologize--in her home.
Speaker 2: That's okay.  Vi did hair in a home.  Then, when I met Stevie, I started selling wigs.  Up the street was a beauty salon, and her name was Ms. Troy [ph.], and it was the House of Troy [ph.].  And Troy, we became friends.  And Troy allowed me to come into her salon, and rent a booth to do my wigs, and I was doing wigs.  She--
Speaker 1: When you say, do wigs, you were styling wigs?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was my, that was my main focus.  We did--
Speaker 1: So, women would bring their wigs in, and then you would tend them (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They would bring their wigs, and, and Boston [Massachusetts] was a fast town, so, I did a lot of fast ladies.  That was back when you had the Sassoons and the cluster curls.  You had a lot of hairpieces and falls.  And it was a natural thing that came to me.  I had no desire to even go to beauty school at that time.  My first customer, I was selling hairpieces, and her name was Mrs. Snead, Agnes Snead [ph.], to be exact.  And her daughter ran Model Cities in Boston--Vera [ph.], and Barbara [Barbara Harris Roach], my sister, Barbara, and Vera, and them went to school together, and they worked in Model Cities together.
Story_ID: 598421
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What is Model Cities?
Speaker 2: Model Cities was a government program in Boston [Massachusetts], very similar to ABC, or the ABCD [Action for Boston Community Development, Boston, Massachusetts], and stuff like that, one of the government programs.  And Ms. Snead [Agnes Snead (ph.)] wanted to know if she could buy some hairpieces from me for her daughter's wedding.  I said, "Sure," so I sold her the hairpieces.  Then, she said, "Well, could you do my hair, too?"  I said, "Sure," and that was my first customer, and the rest became history.
Speaker 1: And you were doing hair at this point in the basement of your [maternal] uncle's [John Jones] barbershop (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, at that time, I was at Miss Troy's [ph.].  I was still in school.  I was working at Miss Troy's.  It was the House of Troy [ph.], which was on Washington Street in Dorchester [Boston, Massachusetts], which was really in high school.
Speaker 1: So, you're meeting Steven [Steven Shepard] in high school, and where are you getting the wigs from, that you're selling?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was on Temple Place, and it was a wig company.  I can't remember the name of the company to save my life, but it'll come to me.  I remember the people, one name was Benny--can't remember--Goldberg [Benjamin Goldberg (ph.)] I think it was, Goldstein or Goldberg--Bobby Goldberg [Robert Goldberg (ph.)] was the owner of the company.  And Stevie was entering competition, they used to have wig competitions back then.  And Stevie entered the International Beauty Show, and came in first and with him--
Speaker 1: This was while you were still in high school?
Speaker 2: Still in high school.  And with Stevie winning, they gave him the opportunity to set up a wig line which was called Champion Wig Line [ph.].
Speaker 1: And did you get an opportunity to actually sell Champion Wig Line at the time?
Speaker 2: I worked with Stevie with the design, and we did a couple of in store appearances.  We did Jordan Marsh [Jordan Marsh Company] at the time in Boston, was the main outlet.  And I put a wig on, and put a suit on, and we'd go down and style the wigs at the counter.
Speaker 1: And people would come and buy?
Speaker 2: They would come and buy the wig, and you'd cut them on them, and razor them, and, and tailor make them for their particular bone structure.
Speaker 1: I see.  And then later, they would come and get their--
Speaker 2: Later on, yeah.
Speaker 1: --wigs.
Speaker 2: They'd come, they'd buy the wig, and then, they would call you later on to get it styled.  At that time, to get a wig shampooed and clean is five dollars.
Speaker 1: Gee, that was not, you know, you're not doing badly at all.  So, at that point, did you decide that you wanted a career in wigs, or did you think that you wanted a career in hair--
Speaker 2: Well, at--
Speaker 1: --styling?
Speaker 2: --at that time, it was both.  We were just making money and doing it.  So, therefore, you didn't know what was going on.  I think, like in 1969, when Olive [HistoryMaker Olive Lee Benson], opened up her salon across from Lord and Taylor in Boston, that was the first black salon downtown.  I went over there and we were doing wigs.  Of course, I had more customers.
Story_ID: 598422
Speaker 1: Now, what's Olive's salon called?
Speaker 2: Now, it's called Olive's Beauty Salon and Spa, International Textures [sic. Olive's International Textures Beauty Salon and Day Spa], in Chestnut Hill [Massachusetts], but I go back in 1969 with her in the salon business.
Speaker 1: It was Olive's Beauty Salon [Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: It was Olive's Beauty Salon.
Speaker 1: And can you tell us a little bit about Olive Benson [HistoryMaker Olive Lee Benson]?
Speaker 2: Olive was somebody I met when I was sixteen.  My father [Grover Harris]--I met her at Peter Fuller Cadillac dealership.  I was sixteen, and we went, my father was taking me for my sixteenth birthday to buy me my first car.  So, he was buying me a Cadillac for what reason, I don't know, but he was that kind of high roller.  And Olive was in there changing her Cadillac around.  And when I met her, she was not flamboyant, but she was just a little bit sharper than, than that, than the norm.  And I said, well, if she does hair and can do it like that, then I want to be a hairdresser, too.  So that's how we met.  And then, we turned around at one of the competitions, which they had in Boston [Massachusetts], which was the Boston State Beauty Culturists' League [National Beauty Culturists' League].  They had a student competition, and I entered the competition, and won a trip to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: What did you enter the competition with?
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: This is in about 1967?
Speaker 2: This was in 1967, to be exact.
Speaker 1: And what did you, what did you enter into the competition?
Speaker 2: I entered into the competition as a student stylist and it was a student competition.  And the Massachusetts Beauty Culturists' League sponsored the winner of the student competition to the national competition in Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: But did you bring a model and style the hair (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The model I chose was the same one that we started off introducing me to Stevie Shepard, and it was Michelle Singleton [ph.], was the first young lady I met at Hyde Park High [Hyde Park High School, Boston, Massachusetts].  And we're all friends until this day.
Speaker 1: And after you won the beauty cultural league show, did you become a member of the Boston Hair Fashion Group [sic.]?
Speaker 2: No, we went down to Philadelphia, and we participated in the competition, and I came in first.  So, that was a win-win for everybody.  In 1968--that was in '67 [1967]--in 1968, we went back, and they had the new talent.  And we won new talent, and when we did new talent in July, then in October, we went to Chicago [Illinois] to participate in the competition.  And we met Henry Childrey and Henry Bundles [Samuel Henry Bundles, Jr.], who had Summit Laboratories [Summit Laboratories, Inc.].  And Henry Bundles, I think, was the son-in-law of Madam C.J. Walker.  Okay, that was Summit Laboratories, and they hired us to do platforms for them.  And we started a group at that point, which was called the Boston Hair Fashion Guild.  That was Steven Shepard, Olive Benson, Adrian Brown [ph.], Stacy Jones [ph.], [HistoryMaker] James Harris, and Jean Mosman [ph.].  There were six of us, and we would do this skit, Hair Magic [ph.].  And Stevie Shepard was a big buy, bigger than, and funny just like Tyler Perry is today. Stevie was this big, and we did a thing.  They had just opened up the Playboy Clubs in Boston.  So, we did a takeoff on the Playboy Clubs.  And Olive and Stacy would have on Playboy Bunny outfits.  And Jean Mosman and myself were the little waiters.  And Steven Shepard was the drag queen bunny, and he had to put, like old fat lady shoes on with the little mini dress.  It was a hoot.  And he would have a cape, and we put the cape over the girl.  We'd have a plant in the audience and she looked a wreck.  And we sprayed hair spray, and the smoke would come all up, and then we turn her around and, viola, then you presented this hair magic.
Story_ID: 598423
Speaker 1: So, after you tour with the Boston Hair Fashion Group [sic. Boston Hair Fashion Guild], do you decide to go to beauty school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I signed up for beauty school in 1967.  It took me eight years to get my license.  The reason it took eight years, I had too many customers.  I did everybody's hair in Boston [Massachusetts].  And the ladies would call down to the school, "Boy, you better get up here and do my hair."  So, I was working in my [maternal] uncle's [John Jones] barbershop at the time.  And they were calling down to the school.  My uncle got pissed off with me one day, "Leave."  So, I left, and we went, I went into the store, to the printing store, and had some flyers made.  And they had just killed Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And we were going to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] to do the beauty trade show again.  And I went, and had some flyers made.  Sorry, but this is how the story went.  And I had some tickets made up for the Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King's scholarship fund.  And the proceeds from that was the money that I made to go to Philadelphia to participate in the beauty trade show (laughter).  I didn't steal anything, but that's, that's an entrepreneurial mind.  It was the scholarship fund, and it was my scholarship (laughter).
Speaker 1: And you went to--
Speaker 2: Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: --for the beauty school training (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that's, yeah, that was from the beauty school training but--
Speaker 1: What was the name of the beauty school that you chose?
Speaker 2: I went to Wilfred beauty academy [Wilfred Academy of Hair and Beauty Culture] and, again, this was black people.  We pioneered everything.  When we went to Wilfred beauty academy, they used to have a competition.  And because of the exposure that I had in school, and going out with the--it was the National Hairdressers and Cosmetology Association.  After getting, not getting involved, I was exposed, so I knew what a trend was.  And when it came time for my senior class to have a competition, it was obvious that this black man is going to win.  They stopped the competition.  There was no more competitions, and they never had them anymore.
Speaker 1: Wow!
Speaker 2: So, we pioneered a lot.  I came along in an era where we were the first blacks to do everything.
Story_ID: 598424
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned that you went to one high school for a very quick moment, but we did not get back to where you went to high--the second high school.
Speaker 2: The second high school was Newman preparatory school for boys [Newman School for Boys; The Newman School, Boston, Massachusetts].  It was on Marlborough [Street] and Ex- and Fairfield Street.  I was the only black child in the school, and even some of the Kennedys went to that school, if I'm not mistaken.  It was a townhouse in a all-white community in--that would be Beacon Hill [sic. Back Bay, Boston, Massachusetts] at the time.  I remember being in my English literature class, and sitting in the front row.  And I can't remember what my teacher's name was, but he taught me English.  And I sat in the first row, and the man looked over my head for the whole entire session.
Speaker 1: So, would you say that there were any teachers there who influenced you or was it much like that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I, I have been on a campaign since I was a teenager.  I just wanted to let them know that we were their equals.
Speaker 1: While you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, obviously, you were active selling wigs, and you were in business while you were in high school.
Story_ID: 598425
Speaker 1: So, was your business more of your focus than school itself?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, the business ended up taking the front running for me.  I was supposed to, again, go to a school, Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was going to say, did you think that you would go to college?
Speaker 2: --but my aunt--yeah, I was supposed to go to Morehouse.  And I flew down to Morehouse for freshman orientation, and realized that, that's not what I wanted to do.  I have always wanted to be a hairdresser, and my father [Grover Harris] said, "Come on home."  And I flew back to Boston [Massachusetts] and with that, I ended up finishing beauty school [Wilfred Academy of Hair and Beauty Culture] in April of 1974, and opened up my salon in June of 1974.
Speaker 1: Who did you open your salon with, and what was it called?
Speaker 2: The name of the salon at that time--this was back in the age of Aquarius days, opened up the salon, and it was called Libra Studios.  That salon was in Mattapan Square [Boston, Massachusetts].  I had had the experience of meeting Frenchie which is, which was the big hairdresser here in New York [New York], Camillo Casimir.  And he and Audrey Smaltz [HistoryMaker Audrey Lavinia Smaltz] were tight friends.  Audrey used to be the commentator for the Ebony Fashion Fair.
Story_ID: 598426
Speaker 1: After meeting Audrey and Frenchie [Camillo Casimir], before I opened the salon, I went to Paris [France].  And I met Audrey Smaltz [HistoryMaker Audrey Lavinia Smaltz] in Paris a couple of years before that.
Speaker 2: Tell us about meeting Audrey Smaltz.
Speaker 1: I knew Frenchie from doing the competitions during the big show expo, which is called Beauty trade magazine, which is the first black trade magazine that we ever had.  And meeting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And as you discuss this, give us an idea about what year we're talking about.  You're in Boston [Massachusetts] doing hair and selling wigs, and you're just out of beauty school [Wilfred Academy of Hair and Beauty Culture], so when do you meet Frenchie?
Speaker 1: I met Frenchie in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] when I was a student and won the competition.  And we all formed a, a bond from that point on, and we remained friends until he died.  Frenchie always talked about going to Europe, going to Europe, and they called him Frenchie because he was Haitian.  And the New Yorkers, not knowing at that time when he first came that Haitians spoke French, I always called him Frenchie.  Frenchie told me, "Okay, well, I'm going to Paris," and we went in April and October.  So, I graduated in April, went to Paris in April, and we went to Jacques Dessange, which is a, a chain of salons.  And they had presentations, and we would go to see what the new cuts were, to see what the new finishes were.  There was Jacques Dessange, it was Carita of Paris, Jean-Louis David.  On all these, all the salons, someone (unclear) would present, and we would go.  So, this one year, we went, Frenchie had one appointment on the Left Bank.  And I had to go over to Saint Laurent [Yves Saint Laurent] to pick up my jeans.  But next to Saint Laurent was this store called Discount [ph.], and they had the narrow pencil like jeans.  And they gave me a shopping bag that was this big.  And it had Discount, Discount, Discount, Discount in French, but it's a big old shopping bag.  I thought it was the prettiest shopping bag I ever saw.  But I was meeting Audrey and Eunice Johnson at the Plaza Athenee on Avenue Montaigne [Hotel Plaza Athenee, Paris, France].  That is the biggest five star hotel on the planet.  I'm walking in the front door, and realizing I'm in the wrong place with this big Discount shopping bag.  So, I rolled the bag up, and by the time I got to the elevator, that bag was this big.  When I got on the elevator, which knocked me down even further, there was these two French women getting off the elevator going to dinner.  One had a diamond brooch on as big as my fist.  The other young lady had on pearls, and the emerald and diamonds, and the earrings to match.  I had never seen so much jewelry before in my life.  When I got off the elevator and got to Audrey's room--when I came in and knocked on the door, I was wiped out.  I said, "Listen sister, if you got any jewelry, would you do me a favor--put it all on tomorrow.  I just saw two ladies that killed me."  She said, "Child, go on over there, and get yourself a drink."  I couldn't have been--I was eighteen.  I go over to the bar that's under the little minibars they have.  The Plaza Athenee had the minibar of life.  I opened the bar up.  There's every bottle of champagne you want, every white wine you want.  And I drink Budweiser, 'cause that's what I drink, so I picked up a Budweiser.  And she will tell you that story to this day.  She was so impressed.  I didn't, I nev- I do what I like.  I happen to like it.  It happens to be real.  I don't like Dom P [Dom Perignon].  I don't like, I like Cristal.  But at that time, I was drinking Budweiser, and that's what I took.  And she said, we have been friends ever since because I didn't abuse the situation, you know.  Sure, I could have taken the bottle of Dom P if I wanted to, but I wanted a Budweiser.

Speaker 1: So, what was happening at that meeting with Audrey Smaltz [HistoryMaker Audrey Lavinia Smaltz] and Eunice Johnson (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, at the meeting, Frenchie [Camillo Casimir] had just got finished doing a fashion show in Harlem [New York, New York] at his salon.  Frenchie had the largest black salon in New York City and it was called Casdulan [Casdulan Hairdressers].
Speaker 1: Is it 1974?
Speaker 2: This is even before '74 [1974].  He was doing [HistoryMaker] Diahann Carroll when she did 'No Strings' [Samuel A. Taylor].  Frenchie had this salon, and they had a chandelier this big, goes to the top of the stairs.  There's a picture of him in Jet with Diahann Carroll looking at this chandelier for this salon.  And Frenchie had did a fashion show.  He had moved across the street.  And when he moved, he blocked off 125th Street, and gave a fashion show with Naomi Sims.  So, that idea always stuck in my mind.  So, when I opened up my salon in Mattapan Square [Boston, Massachusetts], which is called Libra Studios, I had Janet Langhart [HistoryMaker Janet Langhart Cohen], who, at that time, was on the 'Good Morning!' show ['Good Day!'].  And it was the first 'Good Morning!' show where she--and I can't--with the other guy's name, whether it was either Bob or Jim.  They were co- they were cohosts.  And Janet Langhart and Stevie [Steven Shepard] were friends, so therefore, me, Janet, and Stevie became close, friendly, 'cause Janet always wore wigs.  And Janet and Stevie commentated my fashion show 'cause we blocked off Mattapan Square for the opening of Libra Studios.
Speaker 1: And what'd you, just to sort of take you back, what were, you talk, what was the meeting with Audrey Smaltz and Joh- Ms. Johnson (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Audrey Smaltz and Frenchie gave me--when I saw Mrs. Johnson, they were going out to dinner.  And with them going out to dinner, Mrs. Johnson had the prettiest pocketbook.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Was Ms. Johnson one of the women who came down in the elevator?
Speaker 1: No, no, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Mrs. Johnson was the, is the--okay, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know who she is, but when you went to the jewelry, it made me think that perhaps you had passed her.
Speaker 1: No, the jewelry were these two other women I saw.  Mrs. Johnson had the biggest pocketbook.  It was a gold box, and the gold box was a Bulgari pocketbook.  She had one.  Frank Sinatra's wife had one, Madame (Unclear) had one, and these were the gold pocketbooks.  They were like ten to twenty thousand dollars; evening bags, so.
Story_ID: 598428
Speaker 1: And then, after you came back from Paris [France], you're opening your salon, the Libra salon, and how long are you with the Libra's.  How long do you have that?
Speaker 2: I'm in Libra Studios [Boston, Massachusetts] until '77 [1977].  In '75 [1975], Olive [HistoryMaker Olive Lee Benson] and I opened up the first black training center in the world, and it was called Hairmetrics.  Okay.  We opened up the training center.  And we did, we were very successful.  All the classes that we held were sold out.
Speaker 1: What kind of classes were you holding?
Speaker 2: This was advanced education for excessively curly hair.  So, at the training center, you learned how to relax properly.  You learned how to cut properly.  You learned how to set and design excessively curly hair.
Speaker 1: And by excessively curly hair, you mean Afro hair?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah--
Speaker 1: But not necessarily, it could be--
Speaker 2: Well, hair that needed a relaxer.
Speaker 1: And so, do you continue to do the International Beauty Show while you are--
Speaker 2: Well, what happened, I, I had won more national awards and international awards than any in the black world.  There was a chain that started, and it was called Soul Scissors.  Soul Scissors had me come down to do a class in New York City [New York, New York] for them to train their trainers, and that was in July of 1977.  And when I came down, I asked Art Dyson, who was the president of Soul Scissors at the time--I said, "Art, do you guys have a styles director?"  He said, "No, are you interested?"  So, when I came back to Boston [Massachusetts], and went to Paris, I met Olive in London [England], and we had a dispute about the Hairmetrics.  And when I got back to Boston, I called Art, and told him I was interested, and they flew me down to New York.  We negotiated.  They bought my salon, and moved me to New York.
Speaker 1: Now, your salon is still Libra Studios at that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was still Libra Studios at that time.
Speaker 1: And that's operating while you're doing Hairmetrics with Olive Benson?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We--I sold my salon to Soul Scissors, and the salon became a Soul Scissors.  And as I always say, there was no hairdresser in New York City good enough.  That's why they sent for me.
Story_ID: 598429
Speaker 1: So, tell us about your experiences at the International Beauty Show, those that you did without--the one that you did with Olive Benson [HistoryMaker Olive Lee Benson], and later with Patrick Kelly, if you could tell us that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, we go back--during these competitions, again, we were the first blacks to pioneer the international circuit.  The first time we did the show, I did it with Jeannine, and I should have won.  And there was--Jeannine Spinola [ph.] is one of the models from Boston [Massachusetts] who worked in the Brigham's ice cream parlor under the salon [Libra Studios, Boston, Massachusetts].  The next year, I went back with Nadina [ph.].  And when I went back from Nadina, I did a black girl, and I cornrowed her hair, beautiful black girl, and she was going to do the Ebony Fashion Fair.  Her neck was, like maybe ten inches long, fabulous black girl.  I still have her pictures.  We did that, and there was some designers that designed out of Boston.  It was Gus [Augustus Bowen] and Lucy Cordice, and then, when they were called--I think it was the Beauty Carousel [sic. Fashion Carousel], but that was their line.  And they did a handkerchief dress for me, and we had it on Nadina.  We came in second.  The next year, I went back with Nadina, which was in 1976, went back with Nadina, and that time, I had Lavinia, Lavinia Roch [ph.], who was a designer for me in Boston.  And we knocked off Valentino. And we did silk Valentino, which is beautiful black braided headdress at the time.  I've always believed that taste, ignorance, and character have no color barrier, so therefore, I took couture fashion, and put it together with ethnic dressing, and it made such a wonderful look 'til you couldn't bypass it.  Then, in '77 [1977] again, end up being Soul Scissors.  I left in '79 [1979].  Olive and I--I think it was '79 [1979], but don't--it gets a little hazy, you know.  When you get to fifty, it kind of slips.  Olive and I did the International Beauty Show, and it was a team competition.  And I'm going to say it was '79 [1979].  At this team competition, it was three hairdressers that participated.  You did a comb out.  And then you created a theme, and you did your models in the theme, your clothes was in the theme, and your presentation was in the same theme.  The theme that we chose was from the trunk of Josephine Baker. We rented, I rented Vuitton [Louis Vuitton] steamer trunks from Ed Grant [ph.], who was Forever Granted [ph.] on Columbus Avenue.  I took my Vuitton hard sides.  I took Frenchie's [Camillo Casimir] Vuitton hard sides.  I took Audrey's [HistoryMaker Audrey Lavinia Smaltz] Vuitton hard sides, and we loaded up the stage.  That was our presentation.  We had models that were done.  Thomas [ph.] did research for us at Ebony, and we recaptured some of the actual looks that Josephine Baker wore on her last presentation.  Patrick Kelly, at the time, was like my--really my assistant.  Whenever I did a show, "C'mon, Patrick, c'mon Patrick," and Patrick redesigned Courreges [Andre Courreges].  And there was another--I think one of the Mary Quant's.  But Patrick redesigned these clothes to create the clothes for from the trunk of Josephine Baker.  [HistoryMaker] Pat Cleveland was our muse.  Pat Cleveland brought us the light.  Pat Cleveland was who Diana Vreeland and the rest of the fashion world, they wanted Pat Cleveland to play Josephine Baker.  And I think that's why the Josephine Baker story has not been done justice yet.  Patrick made the banana costume and everything.  So, he dressed our whole entire show for from the trunk of Josephine Baker.  We did the show.  And, of course, we came in second.  We won--came in second because some ethnic piece came about, which we thought was horrible, but everybody, when they announced the winners, and we came in second, they were throwing over chairs.  We almost caused a riot.  It's impossible to take something that classy and that smooth, and not to have it go all the way through.  So, we came in second.  When we came in second, there was a, like a, a cash bond prize.  And the prize that we won was a thousand dollars, or its cash equivalent.  The cash equivalent was $750.  Olive gave me the check.  I turned, and gave the check to Patrick Kelly, and that was how Patrick Kelly got to Paris [France].
Story_ID: 598430
Speaker 1: And once he got to Paris [France], what did Patrick Kelly do (laughter) in Paris?
Speaker 2: Patrick Kelly went to Paris.  He ended up studying under--he always--he was a designer.  And Patrick Kelly was the first--I'm going to say, American designer 'cause at that point, we were American and not black, we were all American.  He was the first American designer to become a member of the Chambre des Syndicale [La Chambre Syndicale du Pret-a-Porter des Couturiers et des Createurs de Mode].  Patrick worked with Courreges [Andre Courreges].  He worked with Pierre Cardin.  He worked with Givenchy.  He and Toukie Smith were tight.  And Toukie--Patrick lived on rue des Saint Peres, and Toukie and somebody else lived on rue des Saint Germain [Boulevard Saint Germain].  You know who the other one is.  They've since gotten married and had babies.  But we go back that far.  Patrick did his first presentation for the Chambre des Syndicale at the Hotel Grand [Grand Hotel], which is right there at Boulevard Capucines [Boulevard des Capucines], right at the opera house [Palais Garnier, Paris, France], right there at the opera.  And we all went.  I went, Audrey [HistoryMaker Audrey Lavinia Smaltz] went, all the models.  The one thing, I think what the world and all the black models, really miss Patrick for, Patrick hired--if you're a black model, and you went to Paris to model, you were guaranteed to doing one show, you did the Patrick Kelly show.  And the money that you made from the Patrick Kelly show, got you airfare there and your hotel paid, which was wonderful.  So, he really helped a lot of black models climb to the top.
Story_ID: 598431
Speaker 1: So, after the International Beauty Shows, I have that you founded something called Shear Energy.
Speaker 2: After Olive [HistoryMaker Olive Lee Benson] and I split Hairmetrics, and I came to New York [New York], when I left Soul Scissors, I've always been a firm believer, like I said before, taste, ignorance and character have no color barrier.  And first class is the only way I'm going.  First class is the only thing I think we should be looking at.  We have enough gut bucket.  Where is this other level?  And this other level, I represent.  We have a lot of professional black women.  And I don't think the professional black woman has to be stuck going to Elizabeth Arden's Red Door.  I think the professional black woman can come to [HistoryMaker] James Harris.  I have a brother who has a salon in New York, which we're taping now--Johnny Gentry.  We have first class black salons that have risen to the occasion for the professional black woman.  I've always felt as though that I was the world's equal.  I am not inferior to anyone, and neither are we.
Speaker 1: So, what did Shear Energy do for excessively curly hair?
Speaker 2: Shear Energy was a organization that I put together which was Rudy Townsel [ph.], Delores Snow [ph.], and Louis Moore [ph.].  We worked for Revlon [Revlon, Inc.] at the time, and we did platform education for them.  We did platform shows throughout the world, Africa, South Africa, Mexico, France, and all over the U.S.  That Shear Energy was a system, and that system was advanced education for hairdressers via the mail.
Story_ID: 598432
Speaker 1: Did you ever work for Eunice Johnson?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So, you didn't necessarily feel a tension between Revlon [Revlon, Inc.] and Johnson Products [Johnson Products Company]?
Speaker 2: There was never--that was their problem.  I'm just a hairdresser trying to make it in this world all by his self, so we worked--I'm color blind really.  When I mean color blind (simultaneous) --
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, what was working at Revlon like?
Speaker 2: Revlon was--
Speaker 1: I mean, did they have an atmosphere, or you as a contractor perhaps?
Speaker 2: There was a gentleman over there that was the president of the professional products division, and his name was Irving Bottner.  And Irving Bottner and I were buddies.  Irving Bottner understood the plight of the black hairdresser or the march that the black people in the movement that we were doing at the time, you know, it was never, we were never inclusive.  There was always a special market for the black people.  You know, you had your general market, then you had special markets.  Irving was the one that made the statement that in the future, in the near future, there's going to be a lot of black companies that are going to be bought up by larger conglomerates.  That has happened.  They, they had caskets flying up and down 5th Avenue [New York, New York] because of what Irving said.  And what Irving said, he was not a racist.  I knew this man from, like I said, a teenager, and he was not a racist.  Whenever we had a problem, I never had a problem with white America.  I always had problems with black Americans.  Irving said--he called me in his office one day and he said, "James [HistoryMaker James Harris], I'm going to make you a pretty rich boy."  So, of course, my eyes lit up.  He said, "I'm going to call the guys in.  I'm going to do a hair care line in your name, a wig line in your name, call the black guys in," and this is, this is a true story.  He called the black guys in, and he said, "I want you guys to give me a name of a black hairdresser that we can create a line of products for, and a wig line, and get behind it, and push it."  They're sitting around the room looking like 'Amos 'n' Andy,' still wondering where's the black guy that they, that they could figure out--
Speaker 1: Are these employees of Revlon?
Speaker 2: They were employees of Revlon.  And there was only one guy that said it.  His name was Ron Robinson who ended up going to Africa.  He said, "Irving, you know, and I know, and the rest of the guys in this room know, the only one that fits that bill is James Harris.  He's sitting right here in the room."  So, all of the, with all of the pioneering that you've done, with all of the marching that you have done, the only one that were able to stab you in the back was your black brother.  In my instance, I mean, a lot of people might have gone different routes, but through the experiences that I have had, every time I see the opportunity to help and bring one along, and push one through, I do.  And a lot of people don't do that, so this is why we're in, I think, the position that we're in today because we don't help each other enough.  If I can't get it, and you can use it, guess what?  I'm calling you.
Story_ID: 598433
Speaker 1: After you do some platform education, and I think product development at Revlon [Revlon, Inc.], what do you do subsequently?
Speaker 2: I started at Revlon one day, I took it out on Irving [Irving Bottner].  I keep talking about Irving.  I really ended up loving him as a person for what he stood for and what he meant.
Speaker 1: And Irving was correct that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the large, like Soft Sheen [Soft Sheen Products, Inc.] and Johnson [Johnson Products Company] are ultimately going to be bought out.
Speaker 2: Well, Irving ended up telling me one day, 'cause I was, I've always had this black awareness.  I've always been aware.  And I was always fighting for helping this, helping that, you know, bring this one along, you know, we're not like that.  You shouldn't do that.  And Irving kept saying, "Well, James [HistoryMaker James Harris], you're different."  And I'm not different.  And that was in 1990 when I got off the subway, after being with my aunt [Anna Harvin Grant], and they were doing a thing on her twenty-five years after King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  So, my year, I may be off by a year, they were interviewing my aunt for Life magazine because she taught Martin Luther King, and they were doing a story on her.
Speaker 1: While she was at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) While she was here, they followed her, they followed her, talking to her on how we have progressed in twenty-five years.  And she was here, putting her daughter's wedding together.  And they were taping her.  And I was living in Lenox Terrace [New York, New York] at the time, and I dropped him off back at the hotel, ran over to Columbus Circle to catch the A train to Harlem [New York, New York] to go home.  And when I came out of the subway, I saw the sign, and the sign said for rent.  And that was when I opened up the first salon in Harlem.
Story_ID: 598434
Speaker 1: The James Harris New York salon?
Speaker 2: James Harris New York salon was a byproduct of me telling him [Irving Bottner], (background noise) "No, I'm not different.  I'm just like my brothers and sisters.  As a matter of fact, I'm going to go up there with them."
Speaker 1: And before you did the salon in Harlem [New York, New York], did you do any product development for Naomi Sims' line?
Speaker 2: The Naomi Sims line came in between that period and the New York [New York] salon.  So, in the '80s [1980s], the latter part of the '80s [1980s], I worked with Naomi Sims and her brother-in-law, Alex Erwiah, to develop a line of hair care products.  She did a skin care line, and we were instrumental in that and, of course, doing her hair.  Then, we put together a hair care line, and we also opened up a salon right across the street from the Motown Cafe [New York, New York].  And it was called the Naomi Sims Beauty Salon and Spa [sic. Naomi Sims Beauty Salon, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Can you tell us some anecdotes about Naomi Sims?
Speaker 2: Naomi Sims was the first black model to appear on the cover of Life magazine.  Naomi Sims was a beautiful, stately black woman, and she was a model, and she always had such a stature and a posture.  There was another young lady who was up for that call and that cast that day, and her name was Charlene Dash, but Charlene Dash was a light-skinned black woman.  And Naomi Sims was a brown-skinned black woman.  So, therefore, it was more advantageous to use Naomi Sims than it was to use Charlene Dash.  And Naomi was the first black model that graced the cover of the leading magazines such as Life magazine, Cosmopolitan, and I don't know whether or not she did Vogue.  I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: You mentioned her earlier.  How did you meet Naomi Sims?
Speaker 2: God, how did I meet her (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was in the mix?
Speaker 2: Through Frenchie [Camillo Casimir], through Frenchie.  Met her, and there was another guy, Andre Douglas was a wig designer.  And Andre Douglas was designing wigs for Naomi Sims.  Naomi Sims was before Andre Douglas.  So, Andre was designing wigs for Naomi Sims.  And Naomi Sims could be a bit, a bitter pill to swallow sometimes.  So, therefore, him and her fell out.  And he started Andre Douglas wig line.  I'm try- I can't remember the exact date when I did meet Naomi.  But we got, we got involved, and were very, very decent.  I'm not--we're close.  I'm close--hairdressers are your best friends, you know.  Any time I can wash your hair and look up in your--and you're looking in my face and we're talking secrets, that's close, just like when I did Diana Ross.  When we did the 'Workin' Overtime' video, everybody kept saying, oh, Diana Ross is a (gesture), she's not.  That is the nicest warmest lady in the industry.  It's people that are around these celebrities that are B-Is, but the stars are never not.  I know we got there--the call time was seven o'clock.  And I'm living on 132nd Street at the time.  So, in order for me to get down to the site, I got to get up and leave my house by--I had to get up at 5:30 to leave at 6:30 to be there for 7:30, 'cause Audrey, Audrey Smaltz [HistoryMaker Audrey Lavinia Smaltz], my rep at the time, "You're always on time, honey, you're not on time, you are before time."  So, I got there at about quarter after seven.  Diana Ross is not going to come until 8:30, so I went and got in the bed in the Winnebago.  So, when she got here at 8:30, they said, "C'mon, you guys have to all leave the Winnebago."  Honey, I've been here since a quarter after seven.  It is now 8:30, quarter to nine, and if I get off of this Winnebago, and got to go down here, and wait for somebody to get on this bus, I'm going home.  So, they said, "No, well, you stay."  Nine times out of ten, from the hairdressing standpoint, whenever you're working backstage, I'm going to see you almost in the raw.  Every time Diana Ross, we did her hair where she put the T-shirt on, "James [HistoryMaker James Harris], does this look all right?"  I mean, you become close with these people, just like you have--I did a shooting in that same period where, uh, went up to do Tyra Banks.  And Sam Fine was the makeup artist that put that all together.  And he brought--what's the child's name, Oscar James, with him.  That was Oscar's first shoot.  He was, he was sitting there looking, and he, he got inspired by seeing that.  But nine times out ten, I'm, nine times out ten, I'm seeing your (gesture) underwear.
Story_ID: 598435
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you some follow up questions.  You amuse me with (laughter) with the underwear.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, we had just, in the salon--
Speaker 1: So, yeah, tell me a little bit about--where is that salon located, the James Harris New York salon?
Speaker 2: The James Harris New York salon was located at 321 West 125th Street [New York, New York] on the second floor.  That salon--
Speaker 1: What's the cross street?
Speaker 2: It was 125 and St. Nicholas [Avenue] right above the A train.  And the ad was take the A train to James [HistoryMaker James Harris].  My--I have, have a little brother who's down in Atlanta [Georgia].  And he was down there doing hair, struggling along down there, just, and at that time, I said, "No, honey, come on up and get in the mix, get in the mix, get in the mix."  And brought him, not brought him, everybody comes on their own.  But I was able to expose my brother to the other side of the beauty industry.  And his name is Johnny Gentry, and he is now one of the leading hairdressers in the world today because of coming here to New York [New York], and somebody having something to share.  That's what I mean about sharing.  You got to share with people today.  Johnny, would you turn around, please?  Um-hm.  Johnny does everywhere--he was--Johnny was the one that put, that gave Tyra Banks the red hair.  Johnny is in Iman's book.  Johnny does all of the fashion models here in New York City.  But again, Johnny and Sam [Sam Fine] and Oscar [Oscar James], they came out of the same pile (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 598436
Speaker 1: Did you tell Naomi Sims that she didn't have a face for modelling?
Speaker 2: No, that was Naomi Campbell.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, Naomi Campbell?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it was so--at that time, during the--I've been involved with the fashion industry via Audrey [HistoryMaker Audrey Lavinia Smaltz] and Frenchie [Camillo Casimir] since for- forever, like participated in the fashion shows for Gucci; Mary McFadden saw some African headpieces that we did one time and she died them to have them for her clothes.  Mary McFadden, we did Thierry Mugler when he opened up here in Bloomingdale's at Club Bond [ph.].  Betsey Johnson, Ghost [ph.]; Patrick Kelly, of course, and that's just to name a few.  It's always been kind of key when we talk about fashion, and Naomi Sims being the frontrunner.  At that time, I was going to do a, a human hair hairpiece line.  And Vogue ended up cloning the phrase that I used.  They didn't call them hairpieces anymore.  They were called hair extensions, hair accessories, so everybody has to have a hair accessory.  I did a shooting for Vogue where I supplied the hairpieces for them for Saint Laurent [Yves Saint Laurent].  And I think Garren ended up doing the hair.  It was on rue Cambon, I think it is, but it's, it's in Vogue, and Kevyn Aucoin did the makeup.  So, we go back with a lot of, again, fashion and pioneering, and then walking through, and walking with people to make this whole thing happen.
Speaker 1: So, what happened with your Naomi Campbell comment?
Speaker 2: We were all, we were, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was just a, a function of experience and--
Speaker 2: Naomi first came here.  When she came here, she was hanging out with some hairdressing friends of ours.  And, at that time, they were not using any black girls.  And Naomi came here, and having the experience with Naomi Sims, I just told her, "Be careful because by their standards, you're not pretty anymore."  You know, they don't want--I thought they might have wanted the Beverly Johnson type girls. So, therefore, do not leave your black community alone.  You know, get involved, and make sure you leave a legacy, so you can, in turn, you know, go to the next level 'cause by their standards, you're going--I mean, she didn't have the keen white girl nose.  She didn't have the keen white girl lips.  She wasn't the Beverly Johnson for the cover.  She was the Naomi Campbell for the cover, which was a difference.  And lo and behold, they embraced the look.  And, as you see, here she is one of the supermodels of the world.
Story_ID: 598437
Speaker 1: Let's talk about Sam Fine, and how you inspired him to move into makeup.  What was he doing before he started doing makeup exclusively?
Speaker 2: Sam, Sam and Johnny [Johnny Gentry] were all buddies.  And, one day, I was going down to do, going down to do--okay.  Sam Fine and Johnny were buddies.  And I was going down to Naomi Sims to finish off the hair care line.  When I got--before I went down, Sam was here visiting a friend of ours.  And I said, "Sam, you can do makeup, can't you?"  He says, "Yeah, I think I can."  I said, "Well, come go with me, I'm going down to Naomi Sims'.  And they're putting their makeup line in Marshall Field's in Chicago [Marshall Field and Company Building, Chicago, Illinois].  And since you're going back to Chicago [Illinois], I will let them know that you do makeup, and they can, in turn, put you behind the counter."  So he said, "Okay," so he went down, and they liked him, and they hired him.  Then they brought him back here when they opened up A and S.  A and S was Abraham and Straus in Herald Square [New York, New York].  And Sam and them called me Daddy 'cause I'm a little bit older than them by a couple of months.  So, Sam said, "Daddy, I'm bored."  I said, "Well, okay."  I mean, he was here testing and everything.  I was going up to Audrey Smaltz's [HistoryMaker Audrey Lavinia Smaltz] right after that.  And when I went up to Audrey's, Fran Cooper was visiting Audrey.  So, I said, "Fran, do you ever need an assistant?"  She said, "Yeah, I need one tomorrow for Fernando Sanchez over at Saks [Saks Fifth Avenue]."  I said, "Well, I got one for you," so I called Sam and told him, "You call Fran Cooper tonight."  He called her.  She used him.  At that--see, what we do, we, when somebody recommends somebody, it depends on who you are, and who you recommend.  When you recommend somebody that you know is going to do the job, Sam went over there, helped Fran.  She loved him.  Fran was doing Aretha [Aretha Franklin], or Patti [Patti LaBelle]. I can't remember how the story goes, but she couldn't do them for Atlantic City [New Jersey].  And she asked Sam to go.  And Sam went down and did whoever and they liked him, and the rest is history.

Speaker 1: Tell us about earning, tell us about Intercoiffure.
Speaker 2: Intercoiffure (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What it is, and what it's meant to you.
Speaker 2: Intercoiffure is the most prestigious hairdressing organization in the world.  When I joined in 1991, was when I did my atelier and my first membership with them.  I joined, and the same day I joined was Frederic Fekkai, Louis Licari, and [HistoryMaker] James Harris.  It was one other gentleman, but, of course, I don't know who he is, and he probably doesn't know who I am.  But that was the lineup of the four men that joined Intercoiffure that October.
Speaker 1: And what was the process--
Speaker 2: The process you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) before you joined?
Speaker 2: --you send your book.  You send pictures of your salon.  And you send a financial breakdown of what your business is.  At that time, I was so fortunate Johnny [Johnny Gentry] was in the salon, Calvin [ph.] was in this--no, Calvin wasn't there.  Johnny, Frankie [ph.] was around, Rudy [ph.] was around, Byron Barnes was around, Sam [Sam Fine] was around, Joe Grant--not Joe, Joe, oh, wasn't--John Kellerman Greer [ph.] was around.  So, I had all of these people--Britannica [ph.], all of these people were supporting me becoming a member.  So, I was the first black male member that they had.  Audrey Smaltz [HistoryMaker Audrey Lavinia Smaltz] did my commentary.  The models were Magic, Alva Chinn, Melanie Landestoy, Adrienne Washington [ph.], Tam- Tammy Ford, Avis [ph.], oh, Kristina Clemons [ph.].  So, there was a, a bevy of black models that they had never seen before.  And me doing fashion the way I do, I opened up with Chanel. The second scene was--the first scene was Chanel, the second scene was CD Greene [CD Greene Inc., New York, New York]. And the last scene was Gustavo [Gustavo Arango].
Speaker 1: Did you send this on video?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's on video.  We taped it.  It was wonderful, it was wonderful.  It was the first thing that Intercoiffure had ever given anybody a standing ovation.
Speaker 1: So then, they're airing your piece?
Speaker 2: Well, that was like ten years ago.  You get--I mean, all the editors are there, all the different manufacturers are there.  Joining white organizations like that, it gives you a credential, but it also does you an injustice because you can't, you really don't benefit from the association because there's nowhere to market your wares.  See, I mean, the only thing--I mean, Essence is going to write about you no matter where you are because that's who Essence is.  Essence, Essence is going to help you.  So, I had Essence.  Vogue will give you a story every now and then.  But Essence has been the pillar of the ethnic community.  So, therefore, the other magazines--Elle is not going to write about you.  At that time, they were not writing about blacks.  They were not giving you any of your main pictures or your main pages, you know--no editorial blurbs.  I got more editorial blurbs in Vogue when I was at Revlon [Revlon, Inc.] than I've ever gotten.  But we, the president at the time, John Jay, he loved me, he loved Olive [HistoryMaker Olive Lee Benson], and anything you guys want to do.  And we were the only two black members that ever did anything.  I had to go to Italy to do the world congress with them.  And we were always there, but we never benefitted.  I never benefitted from the association, like Frederic Fekkai does.  I've never benefitted from the association like Louis Licari did.  The industry is not as embracing to black hairdressers when I came along as they are now.
Story_ID: 598439
Speaker 1: So, have you not started an organization to provide that kind of network and recognition for black--
Speaker 2: We started--it's me and Johnny [Johnny Gentry], started the Hair Fashion Group.  The Hair Fashion Group is an organization of a selected group of hairdressers, and it's exclusive because it's not for everyone.  You have some people that go to school, and some people that don't.  I want to make sure that the professional black woman and black man gets the opportunity to present their self in a professional manner.  This organization, it's high end salons.  We do professional people, we take the professional approach, and we network.  If you're here in New York [New York], and you want to go to a salon in Atlanta [Georgia], we'll recommend the Purple Door [Purple Door Salon].  If you want to go to a salon in Chicago [Illinois], we'll recommend Dino [ph.] or Al Vander [ph.].  It's a network because you want your people to be on that level and stay at that level, and to expose their self to people that are on that level.  And that level is the level above--not the norm.
Speaker 1: So, similar to Intercoiffure, do you have the same kind of requirements that the person be an astounding business person, in addition to having beauty, fashion, and makeup expertise (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, ours, ours differs.  Every member of Intercoiffure is millionaires, they're all millionaires.  We don't have the million dollar status yet.  So, therefore, I'm trying to make sure that I can show them how to get to that level, maintain that level, and grow from that point.  You have a lot of members that are like $15 million dat--their annual income is $15 million.  So, I don't think that the black salons are able to do that yet, but I'm going to make sure that we show them how.
Story_ID: 598440
Speaker 1: And how do you do that?  Do you do that through being able to price and provide a particular level--
Speaker 2: Well, what our--
Speaker 1: --of service?
Speaker 2: --our, our approach is going to be--I just came back from Atlanta [Georgia].  And I received a Legend Award from the Bronner Brothers beauty show.  And at--
Speaker 1: Can you just spell that for us--B-R--
Speaker 2: B-R-O-N-N-E-R Brothers International Beauty Show [Bronner Brothers International Beauty Show].  It's in Atlanta.  And they're the largest black beauty show in the world.  They just celebrated their sixtieth, sixtieth anniversary.  And when I got the award, I was honored, and then I sat down.  And afterwards, they honored the black manufacturers.  Here was Dudley's [Dudley Beauty Corporation, LLC], Dudley's is making million dollars, millions of dollars a year.  There's Lusters [Luster Products, Inc.], and they're making millions of dollars a year.  You have Soft Sheen [Soft Sheen Products, Inc.], they're making millions.  All of the hair--
Speaker 1: Soft Sheen which is now owned by L'Oreal [L'Oreal S.A.].
Speaker 2: L'Oreal, okay, but even before they got sold, they made mill- a hundred and something million dollars.
Speaker 1: And who bought Johnson and Johnson [sic. Johnson Products Company]?
Speaker 2: Johnson and Johnson was bought by--who owned Flori Roberts [Flori Roberts Cosmetics]?  Johnson and Johnson sold--it went like this.  Johnson and Johnson ended up being bought by Carson [Carson, Inc.].  And Carson was bought by Soft Sheen.  And Soft Sheen was bought by L'Oreal.  Okay, so that's how it unfolded.  See, one bought one.  You couldn't have the monopoly, but one could buy the other one, and one could buy the other one, and one could buy the other one.  You happen to have a monopoly, but you're just out now--kill them all at the same time.  They're all under the same umbrella, but--
Speaker 1: So, you're providing this service to black salons--
Speaker 2: See, it's black salons--
Story_ID: 598441
Speaker 1: We were actually on to the Bronner's awards [Bronner Brothers International Beauty Show] in Atlanta [Georgia] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) See, the Bronner awards opened my eyes to really what the objective was for the organization.
Speaker 1: The Hair Fashion Group.
Speaker 2: It's not just a group of hairdressers.  These are hairdressers that are going to capitalize off of their talent, off of the energies, and put forth the best effort we can to establish ourselves as leading black salons.  We don't have to be black salons.  Johnny's [Johnny Gentry] on 5th Avenue [Johnny Gentry NYC Salon, New York, New York].  5th Avenue runs from the East Village up to Harlem [New York, New York].  So, we canvassed the whole area.  We happen to do hair, so if we can't be included, then we can go ahead and be your equal.  There is a difference.  With the manufacturers, I hope that the manufacturers get behind us and support us.  If I can make sure that the hairdressers get some of the money that we supported these companies with, if I can make million dollar companies, then I've been supporting you.  Can you support us?  That's all we need.  We need your support back, you know, everybody's--when I went back to my class after watching these manufacturers, I asked the hairdressers, which were three hundred in the room.  I said, "How many of you hairdressers are millionaires?"  I didn't get a show of hands.  That threw me.  And I think we have to show them, or show us how to get to that level.  And we cannot do it without getting the support of the people that we supported.  All of these people that are millionaires--they do not sell drugs, they sell hair care products to me and people like me, but what are you doing for me and people like me?   Don't take my money.  Give me back some of my money.  I see them all the time, and they want to say, well, I'm giving back to the black community.  I'm your community.  My business is in your community, so support me, so I can help you maintain that community.
Story_ID: 598442
Speaker 1: Now, your second--I'm calling it your second salon (background noise) in Harlem [New York, New York], the Mahogany Door Beauty Center [Mahogany Door Beauty Center and Spa]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You had that in the past, and now, you're rejuvenating it.  What's the difference between it and the James Harris salon that you had initially, and what do you plan to do with that?
Speaker 2: The James Harris salon at first was very contemporary, very hip.  I was younger, we were rolling.  We were hip sophisticates.  When we opened the Mahogany Door, we were sophisticated.  The next wave is the hip sophisticate again.  We were before the curve, okay, always before the curve.  Now, the curve done caught us, and now we're in the curve.  I just want to make sure that the exposure that I get, I'm able to bring it, so it can be an inspiration to others.  You know, each one, teach one; each one, bring one, and that also comes back to the hairdressing industry, just like relaxers.  You have been receiving a relaxer since 1950.  You got a burning sensation in 1950.  You got a burning sensation in 1960, uh, 1960.  You got a burning sensation in 1970.  You got a burning sensation in 1980.  You got a burning sensation in 1990.  We are in a new millennium, forty years later, you still got the same sensation?  At some point, we have to realize we have to develop better technology to provide services for the professional woman.  And it's with technology--technology and techniques.  And that's what the Hair Fashion Group is going to do--provide new technology and new techniques.
Speaker 1: And are you going to do some of that production development under the Mahogany Red Door [sic.]?
Speaker 2: No, everything is under--I'm sorry, I skipped past you.  I, I was staying with the Hair Fashion Group because the Mahogany Door, at that time, we were always, like I said, before the curve.
Speaker 1: So, you didn't really have the clientele to support such a salon (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We had the clientele--I mean, we had Suzanne de Passe was a client.  Suzanne de Passe would come to the salon in Harlem to get her hair done.  And in New York [New York], we just don't have that comfort yet being in Harlem until Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] moved up there, black people weren't running up like that.  Now that Clinton's up there, oh, no, it's the place to be.  I was there before Clinton, just like Audrey [HistoryMaker Audrey Lavinia Smaltz] says, over here.  She is on 55th Street.  Donald Trump moved [President Donald John Trump] on 56th Street.  She said she welcomed him to her neighborhood.  So, I said the same thing about Clinton, but a quarter of a million dollars later, it was time for me to run.
Story_ID: 598443
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about appear- a little bit about appearing on the various talk shows, what, who you've appeared with, and what was the information that you shared?
Speaker 2: We did--I was recommended to a company called Kizure [Kizure Iron Works, LLC], and that's a curling iron company in California, so I was bicoastal.  And Audrey [HistoryMaker Audrey Lavinia Smaltz] got the opportunity for us to do the 'Ricki Lake' show.  And when we did the 'Ricki Lake' show, we became the (air quotes) fashion police.  And we rode around the city, and we would stop people, and do makeovers on you.  So, we were the first of the makeovers, so whenever they had--of course, the black makeover, let's get James [HistoryMaker James Harris].  So, when they got me, we did the 'Ricki Lake' show, and I would even, I would cut your hair and color it.  And this was always new.  It was always taking a average black woman, and making her a fabulous black woman.  And that's what I've always done, and that's what we do.  We did 'The Montel Williams Show' with the same thing.  We, on that show, I think, it might have been school teachers, took the school teachers, and another woman was a manager of one of the supermarkets.  And we did the makeovers on them, so, we started the makeover craze.  Like I said, we were always crazy about the, the makeover craze we started, and we were always in front of the curve, right behind us, here they come.  Everybody's doing makeovers now.  And we've been doing them.  When we did the fashion, Christmas fashion for Oprah [Oprah Winfrey], she wasn't Miss Oprah then.  She was Oprah--now, she's Miss Oprah.  And Oprah has been one of the--all of them--Ricki Lake has been fabulous, Montel Williams has been fabulous.  And, of course, Oprah is ultra fabulous.  She is--I can't say, I'd patted myself after her, or mirror myself after her, but she and I come along the same mindset as far as exposure.  You know, you came from the back of the room to the front of the room.  Now, you're leading the room, okay.  And this is what she's done, but she's not afraid to give back and to help.  And always not afraid to speak of where she came from and who she is.
Story_ID: 598444
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit more about some important people.  You mentioned Oscar James.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you want to just give us anecdotes and I'll just ask you a couple of different people?
Speaker 2: Well, Oscar, and, and, and Oscar--it was really three of them--Oscar, Sam [Sam Fine], and Johnny [Johnny Gentry].  And the three of them boys make me so proud of being a hairdresser, and being involved in the beauty business because all three of them are on top of the game.  Okay.  And they all came via our association.  Did I do anything for them?  No.  It might have been somebody that said, use this one, use that one, but you probably would have met them on your own anyhow.  But knowing that you're able to say, "Call my brother, call this one, call that one," is important to me.  Okay.  We have Oscar and Johnny--they do more celebrities, ethnic celebrities, than any general market hairdresser, you know, so I think that's important.  Them boys do everybody, everybody.
Speaker 1: Who's everybody?
Speaker 2: Everybody from Tyra [Tyra Banks], Iman, Alek [Alek Wek], Naomi Campbell, the women from 100 Black Women [National Coalition of 100 Black Women]. Johnny does all of them.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Jewell Jackson McCabe?
Speaker 2: All them girls, they all come to Johnny.  They had this cruise that they had.  And it's like the sophisticated--it might be the 100 women cruise, or the professional black women cruise.  And Johnny goes down and he does that every year.  You got the CEO, maybe any black CEO comes to him.  Any up and coming starlet comes to him.  Any of the models in New York City [New York, New York] come to him.
Speaker 1: Did we talk about Joey Mills at all?
Speaker 2: Joey Mills, I know when I mentioned to you earlier, there has been some people that have really walked New York City.  You have makeup artists like Joey Mills, Quietfire, John Kellerman Greer [ph.].  You have hairdressers such as--well, Johnny and Oscar.  Then you also have before them, you have Ruth Sanchez.  You have Joseph with Hairstyles by Joseph [sic. Hair Styling by Joseph, New York, New York].  They did a tribute to me in 1981, the cultural event committee, and when they did the presentation, it was the past, the present, and the future.  Dr. Katie Whickam, who was the head of the National Beauty Culturists' League, was the past.  Joseph Plaskett [Joseph Plaskett, Sr.] was the present, and [HistoryMaker] James Harris was the future.  And when we did that, Joseph said something when he bought his salon on 60th Street, which, of course, is right there around the corner from Bloomingdale's--when he bought the salon, how the woman told him, that he had to have thirty-five thousand dollars up there by the close of business today, or he would blow the property.  And he said, he just so happened to have it.  So, I understand what it takes to get there.  I know what it has taken a lot of my brothers and sisters to get here, and to arrive at a point where that, that they can sustain their self.  I just want to hope that I can show them how to get to the future.
Story_ID: 598445
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned with Intercoiffure that the organization, particularly for a white millionaire or more member, provides a media outlet, and a network coverage that benefits the person who has the symbol.  Do you feel that you're going to be able to do the same with Hair Fashion Group?  When you said Essence was an outlet, but are you going to be able to generate enough (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's a, that's our, that's our immediate objective is to put forth the front running hairdressers, and put them in their main vehicle, and give them the opportunity to expose their selves to the Essences, to the black hair sophisticates, to Hype Hair, so that the woman can open a magazine and see that there are women like her, and who is doing them.  You know, Essence always provides the editorial page.  And some of these hairdressers may have shown their work in Essence, but they may not be affiliated with a group.  See, when you get a group, there's so much strength in numbers, and the numbers is going to represent what we stand for.  It's not the salon where they're coming and selling hot goods.  It's a salon where you can come in and get professional service, get retail service, get quality products that the Hair Fashion Group is going to make.  See, I'm going to show them, we--I keep saying I--I've had the opportunity to be the spook that sat by the door.  When I got to Soul Scissors, they were doing $2 million.  When I left Soul Scissors, they were making five.  Taking credit for that, when it happens on your watch, it's yours.  When I got to Black Hair Is, they were making $3 million.  When I left them, they were making six.  When I got with Mizone [ph.], they were making $6 million, and now they're making thirteen.  So, I might know how to make money, haven't made any for myself, so if I can't make it for myself, let me show you how to make it, like I've shown other people.
Story_ID: 598446
Speaker 1: You've explained the Hair Fashion Group, but outside of that and, and your vision for it, is there anything that you'd like to do that you haven't done?
Speaker 2: Retire, but that's not going to ever happen.  No, I have, through the grace of God, this is all God given.  I had the opportunity to be on the road with Jennifer Holliday for eight and a half months.  We did the play, 'Sing Mahalia, Sing,' and George Faison [HistoryMaker George W. Faison] wrote it, and choreographed it, and everything.  And I had the privilege of standing behind her for eight and a half months.  And she sang one song that stuck with me, and it still sticks with me to this day, God gave it to me and you can't take it away.  So, the talent, I can't even stop it.  I get up in the morning.  I can think of a hairstyle.  I can think of a trend.  I know where it comes from so, therefore, making it is just God given.  With God's talent, with these two hands, I have been able to touch every last one of my dreams.
Story_ID: 598447
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?  What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well, I hope I ain't going nowhere, but when it's all said and done, I just want to say thank you to everybody because if it wasn't for you, there'd be no me.  If it wasn't for my mother [Emma Jones Harris] and father [Grover Harris], there'd be no me.  If it wasn't for my sisters [Emma Harris Sellman (ph.), Barbara Harris Roach, and Glynis Harris Rogers], there'd be no me.  If it wasn't for Aunt Sarah [ph.], there'd be no me.  If it wasn't for the Nation [Nation of Islam], there'd be no me.  If it wasn't for my sisters and my brother, my brother, Johnny [Johnny Gentry], there'd be no me.  If it wasn't for you, there'd be no me.  And if it wasn't for the struggle and the plight that we had to go through, there may not be any me.  And if it wasn't for God, there would definitely be no me.
Speaker 1: We want to thank you for taking the time to speak with us today--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and telling us a little bit about hair care.
Speaker 2: Well, it's hair care.  It's what we know, it's what we do.  It's been the only stronghold that we have.  And if we don't grab it, we're going to lose it because the stick people are coming.
Speaker 1: What do you mean by that?
Speaker 2: And I'm going to leave that alone (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) The stick people are coming (laughter).  The Chinese (laughter).  (Background noise) I call the people that write with sticks.
