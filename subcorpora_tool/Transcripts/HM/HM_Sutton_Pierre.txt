Story_ID: 652555
Speaker 1: So I want to have--start out--I want to start actually with your mother's background first.  Because--I'll go to your father's [Percy Sutton] background.  But can you tell what you know about--give your mother's name and her birth year--but what you know about her background.
Speaker 2: My mother [Leatrice O'Farrell Sutton], first, is the sweetest person on earth.  She is of West Indian heritage.  Her people come from Barbados in the West Indies.  Her father was the product of an Irish father and an African American mother.  I'm sorry, I didn't say that right.  My grandfather was a product of an Irish father and an African American mother, who was Bajan or Barbadian.  My grandmother [Edna Tyrrill Stanziano] was straight up Bajan.  My grandfather's name was Patrick O'Farrell [Cecil O'Farrell].  He was fair enough skinned to pass for white.  And he rose from being a dockworker to being head in Bond Bakery [Brooklyn, New York]--a vice president of Bond bakeries here in New York [New York] for sanitation.  And he wore a suit every day, a three piece suit.  I remember him for his dignity and his posture and the gold chain on his vest.  His precision--he taught me how to play pool and handball.
Speaker 1: Did your (cough), did he talk about growing up or did he ever share any of those stories?
Speaker 2: No.  I learned about him--his passing as a matter of my own passage of learning of the history of--I was unaware of the time of what he did, or how he did it.  He may even have marched in the parade, the--where they, I think they--
Speaker 1: St. Patrick's?
Speaker 2: St. Patrick's Day Parade.  I don't know that, (laughter) but he may have.  But I look more like him than any other human being on--that has existed on this planet.
Speaker 1: And what--did your mother share any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Some, a few stories about her growing up, but not many.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what about--but she was born here?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was.
Speaker 1: She was born here in New York?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your grandfather had migrated here or--
Speaker 2: My grandfather was born here in New York [sic. Bermuda] as well.  My grandfather and--my maternal grandfather and maternal grandmother met three blocks from here, from where we sit--St. Marks Catholic Church [St. Mark Roman Catholic Church, Brooklyn, New York] where he was the head acolyte.  And she was a schoolgirl playing improperly on the swings, and he had to correct her (laughter).
Speaker 1: That is--that's--because your mother had told me that.  But I don't, I--they were--I didn't know they were young like--that's--okay.  So really strong roots, back at New York roots, on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: This neighborhood, yes.
Speaker 1: In this neighborhood.  So your--what time period would that have been around, though?  Is it--I'm wondering.  It would have been--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --nineteen hundred [1900]?
Speaker 2: It would have been--
Speaker 1: Early, early 1900s (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) considering that my mother--I was born in '47 [1947].  So you'd have to say that if you do generations by twenty years, let's just say that it was in the early--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --part of the 19th century.
Speaker 1: Right, the 1900s.  Because that was the time like Harlem [New York, New York] was changing really, you know.  I mean originally it was supposed to be white.  And then there was in the early, early years of Harlem--okay.  But it changed.
Story_ID: 652556
Speaker 1: Now can we talk about your father?  You know, his, his year of birth and what you know about him--his growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, my father [Percy Sutton]--the best way to describe my father is to describe my father's environment.  And I can say that his father [Samuel Sutton, Sr.] was born during slavery.  And looking at me--as odd as that may seem, my father's father was born during slavery, and he was very dark of skin.  And he and his bride [Lillian Smith Sutton]--God bless my grandmother--shared in the birth of fifteen children, my father being the youngest of that fifteen.  So my father grew up in a very large family, him being the baby on a farm outside of San Antonio, Texas.  San Antonio's location was interesting because it was in South Texas.  And my grandfather was a very, was what you call notable because he was an educated man.  All of my father's brothers and sisters went to college, the older ones putting the younger ones through school, some of them even teaching the younger ones in school.  My father would tell the story of his sisters being his teachers (laughter) when he was a kid.  San Antonio was, as I said, is in southern, is in southern Texas.  And the trains would stop there last before they went to Mexico.  African American dignitaries or personages, if you will, of the time, could not vacation comfortably in the United States anywhere.  They would go to Mexico, and the last stop in America was San Antonio, Texas.  And often they would stop at my father's house, my grandfather's house before going to Mexico.  So the great notables of the time, African American notables of the time, were--would sit at my grandfather's table.  And, so there was a sense of dignity, of heritage and of purpose that was instilled in my family through that kind of communication.
Speaker 1: Do you know who some of the notables were that they--or did you hear those stories of who the notables were, some of the notables?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mind freezes at the moment, but George Washington Carver would be one of them.  I say that only because my father's oldest brother worked for George Washington Carver as he developed the peanut.  And was, in fact, instead of, instead of George Washington Carver, he elected to go to Russia during one of the five year plans that Russia had as it was developing its Communist state to teach the Russians the peanut.  And he in fact lived in Russia until he was repatriated just prior to the outbreak of World War II [WWII].  Married a Russian woman and had a Russian kid, (laughter) and whose name is Juan Suttonovich [ph.], who lives now in San Antonio, Texas.
Speaker 1: So that was one of your father's brothers?
Speaker 2: Yes, his oldest brother.
Speaker 1: His oldest (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who--yes.
Speaker 1: I see.  So this is, so, you know, a lot of what, so what did your father describe--he's the baby, so a lot of them are--I mean I wonder how old the oldest was from him, you know, the oldest.  I don't if it was a brother?
Speaker 2: Old enough to be his father basically.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The oldest there, John [John Wesley Sutton], was certainly old enough to be my father's father.
Story_ID: 652557
Speaker 1: So what did your father [Percy Sutton] talk about in terms of life in San Antonio?
Speaker 2: Hard work, working hard on a farm.  That was--and his escape from that (laughter), that hard work on the farm.  He told us the story of him having run away from home at a very early age and coming to New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: So how old, how old was he at that point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I--
Speaker 1: You don't know?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he came to New York City.  Did any--another brother came with him though, too, right?
Speaker 2: No, I think he went back to San Antonio.  Excuse me, this is all very cloudy to me.  I don't remember.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: I wasn't there (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, that's okay.
Speaker 2: But he tells the story of having come, having run away--come to New York and then for some reason going back to San Antonio, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then do you know what time period, you know, you don't even know what age he was at that point?  Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I assume a teenager.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, so did he ever talk about his attraction for New York?  A lot of people were migrating back then.  But that migration, Texas to New York, is a, you know, people would migrate maybe Virginia to New York--but Texas to New York.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Shakes head) New York City, the Big Apple.
Story_ID: 652558
Speaker 1: So what's your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory--not being able to speak, crying because I couldn't be understood.  People think I'm crazy, but that (laughter)--I remember being very angry about that.
Speaker 1: So you were, you were, you were young?
Speaker 2: I--yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: So they didn't under- you're talking and no one understands you.
Speaker 2: Not a word (laughter).  It seems odd, doesn't it?
Story_ID: 652559
Speaker 1: Let me also go back to your parents.  How did your parents meet?  Do you know that?
Speaker 2: Well, my father tells the story, my mother [Leatrice O'Farrell Sutton] concurs, that he was, he was a military man.  He was I think a young lieutenant here on a gambling spree in New York City [New York, New York] when he chanced upon my mother, who was walking down the street with her mother [Edna Tyrrill Stanziano] and uncle.  And he walked up upon them and introduced himself.  This dashing young lieutenant walked up to my mother, her mother and her uncle, introduced himself and virtually declared that he would marry my mother (laughter).
Speaker 1: So he, Percy Sutton, was Percy Sutton back then.
Speaker 2: I guess.
Speaker 1: So he swept her off her feet.
Speaker 2: One could say that.
Speaker 1: So you are the--in terms of children--so your parents were married in maybe, what?  Do you remember the year they were married?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're, you're the oldest, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Of that union, yes.
Speaker 1: Of that union, okay.  So--
Speaker 2: And the only of that union.
Speaker 1: Oh, the only of that union, okay, okay.  And there was another--so how many other--okay.  You're the only one of that union, okay.  So how did your name come to be?
Speaker 2: My father had a sense of humor (laughter).  (Shakes head) That's--I have no idea (laughter).
Story_ID: 652560
Speaker 1: Let's talk about growing up and where you were raised, where you lived as a little person, I mean as a young person.
Speaker 2: Well, I--my--very young, though I was born here in Manhattan [New York], I lived, early on I remember living in Queens, New York, southeast in Queens, the South Ozone Park, Baisley Pond Park [Queens, New York], going to schools there.  I did live for a period of time in Harlem [New York, New York].  And my parents [Leatrice O'Farrell Sutton and Percy Sutton] when I was one or two, separated, then divorced.  They later remarried but for that period, that interim period, I lived in Harlem with my [maternal] grandparents [Edna Tyrrill Stanziano and Cecil O'Farrell].  But some summers, my--I remember being sent to San Antonio, Texas to learn farm values, and I guess to keep me out of New York City trouble.  So I got into San Antonio trouble (laughter).  But yeah, it was another experience.
Speaker 1: So how many summers would you go?
Speaker 2: Oh, I have no recollection of that.
Speaker 1: So, but it would be, it would be regular trip to San Antonio (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it was, it was kind of, part of my education.
Story_ID: 652561
Speaker 1: And when you think of growing up, what sights, smells and sounds remind you of your childhood?
Speaker 2: That's being on my hands and knees in the dirt or on the sidewalks--playing games, marbles--games in the, in the, in the dirt very early on--stickball, handball, basketball as I grew older.  The occa- the occasional ice cream truck, knowing that when the streetlights came on you were supposed to be home.  Shining my father's [Percy Sutton] shoes and getting paid for it as a job.
Speaker 1: What about sounds?  You mentioned the ice cream truck.  But are there other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My grandfather [Cecil O'Farrell], my maternal grandfather, was a big blues and jazz fan.  And I still have some of his records, the singles, made of hard plastic--vinyl now.  Those were the real sounds of my, of my youth, blues and jazz.
Speaker 1: And smells?
Speaker 2: Smells, I'm not blessed with a good sense of--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't have good olfactory senses.  I can't smell, even--
Speaker 1: Right, no--
Speaker 2: --to this day.  Perhaps that's why I'm not an eater.
Speaker 1: Right.  Well, because people, people have different senses.  Different senses are stronger.
Story_ID: 652562
Speaker 1: So can you talk about growing up?
Speaker 2: I could, but I wouldn't know what to say about it.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: I made it.
Speaker 1: Okay, (laughter) no, no, no.  I'm sorry, I'll be a little more sensitive, I'm sorry (laughter).  So how long were your parents separated?
Speaker 2: A couple of years, I guess.
Speaker 1: Oh, just a couple of--okay.  So what was, what was life like in the Sutton household?  Because you were raised literally almost like an only, only child.
Speaker 2: I was, I was.  I did know my sister, but we were not, we were not raised in the same house, and we were not together much.
Speaker 1: That's Cheryl Sutton, right?
Speaker 2: That is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Cheryl, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was life like for you as, you know, as [HistoryMaker] Pierre Sutton--you know, as the only child?  What is life like?  And did you have chores or you--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I had chores.  That was important, to have chores.  What was life like?  Gee, I'd have to say we moved a little bit.  We moved when I was--very early on, my father [Percy Sutton] was in, was in the Korean conflict [Korean War], in the [U.S.] military.  I lived on air bases for a little while.  I think I attended elementary school in the [U.S.] military.  I think I got kicked out of elementary school, that's what my mom [Leatrice O'Farrell Sutton] tells me.  It must be true (laughter).  I don't know why.  Or maybe I was just separated because my father was separated from the service, I don't know.  But anyway, but I attended various schools.  And my father, my mother and father did move.  I moved from, I think I lived in three separate communities in southeastern Queens [New York] as I was growing up.
Speaker 1: So when you say you moved around a bit, is this every year or is it every few years?
Speaker 2: No, every few years.
Speaker 1: Every few years.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So I recall having lived in South Ozone Park [Queens, New York] or Baisley Pond Park [Queens, New York], which was almost country.  There were dirt roads (laughter) in--on the way to grandmother's [Sutton's maternal grandmother, Edna Tyrrill Stanziano] house there.  Then moving on to Springfield Gardens [Queens, New York].  And my senior year in high school [Andrew Jackson High School, Queens, New York]--between my junior and senior year, I moved to St. Albans [Queens, New York], which was a very interesting community.  Not far from me lived James Brown.  And it was a very good black neighborhood to live in.  I imagine that the kids who were actually growing up there should have been very happy because it was a, it was a really--it had trees, and it was well kept, a very, very nice neighborhood.
Speaker 1: St. Albans is--has a lot of history to it as a neighborhood (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, it does.
Speaker 1: So you moved there when you were in high school, you said?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I want to go back (cough) a little further.  So where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: P.S. 123.
Speaker 1: And that's in Brooklyn [New York], in Queens?
Speaker 2: No, that's in, that's in southeastern Queens, that was in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Queens, okay.
Speaker 2: --that was in Jamaica [New York].
Story_ID: 652563
Speaker 1: I want to understand, what are you like as a little boy?  Are you quiet?  Are you shy?  Are you--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I'd have to say, yes, I'm quiet.  I read a lot.  I still do, I read a lot.
Speaker 1: So would you, were you--so you had chores.  Who were your friends?  And, you know, who, are you--because only children a lot of times, they sort of create--I mean they're off by themselves a lot.  But was that the case or was there a lot of family around?
Speaker 2: Well, in Texas, I had lots of family.  My cousins, and boy, I had cousins, lots and lots of cousins.  And it was like a big family.  And I'll tell you a story about Texas.  My [paternal] grandfather [Samuel Sutton, Sr.], a proud leader of his family, we would march to church as a family.  And interestingly enough, even though my father [Percy Sutton] was the youngest of his children, I was his first grandchild to bear his name--the name of Sutton--seeing that all the boys, all his sons had girl children.  And all of them, all of his daughters, had male children until I came along.  So I got to march up front next to him (laughter), as opposed to being at the back of the line of the family as we marched to church on Sunday morning (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you were much anticipated.  Were you spoiled?
Speaker 2: Oh, I hardly--no, that was just a fond recollection.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I still had to slop the hogs and feed the pigs (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's hard as a kid.  You know, I mean it's different.
Speaker 2: It was just, it was just part of what, you know, you just had to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's a different experience, right.
Speaker 2: And on a farm, if you ever milked a cow, you know that you don't want to be inaccurate in your milking.  Because if that milk gets on you, on your clothing, during the course of a summer, a summer's day, that milk can get very sour on you.  And it's not a pleasant smell.
Speaker 1: See, I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: That makes sense, and I didn't know that.
Story_ID: 652564
Speaker 1: So you're growing up, you're spending time in San Antonio [Texas].  You're going to school at, you said P.S. one twenty--?
Speaker 2: 123 [P.S. 123, Queens, New York].
Speaker 1: --three.
Speaker 2: Junior high school 59 [J.H.S. 59; I.S. 59, Springfield Gardens School, Queens, New York] and then on to Andrew Jackson High School [Queens, New York]--
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: --where I graduated.
Speaker 1: --29 [sic.].  That's also in Queens [New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All Queens?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Andrew Jackson High School, from which I graduated, I played some sports there--basketball, handball, ran some track.  I was never very good at any of those things, but I played them.  I graduated from that school in 1964.  Some six years later that school was closed down.  It seems that they had discovered a heroin factory in the basement; and, so it was closed down.
Story_ID: 652565
Speaker 1: Brooklyn Law School [Brooklyn, New York], somewhere between the time that he was in World War II [WWII] and Korea.  Because he was in the Judge Advocate's General Corps [sic. Judge Advocate General's Corps] in the [U.S.] Air Force, which it was then.  It had gone from being the [U.S.] Army Air Corps to the Air Force, in between those two wars.  And he was in the judge advocate general's office during the Korean conflict [Korean War].
Speaker 2: And, so you grew up--do you remember growing up and hearing about his law practice, or being in the practice?
Speaker 1: No, I'm--I have only memories of being told about some criticisms, from my perspective.  My father [Percy Sutton]--I guess had painted the shelves on his, in his office so that they would look good.  And from my perspective, it didn't look good because I could see under the shelves that they had not been painted at all.   I saw that, you know, his perspective was different from mine (laughter).
Speaker 2: So you are a stickler for detail, aren't you?
Speaker 1: Well, that was my perspective, I couldn't see the top of the shelves.  It might have looked very well, very good.  I'm sure they did.
Story_ID: 652566
Speaker 1: I want to understand before we get you out of high school [Andrew Jackson High School, Queens, New York].  You know, what subjects you're interested in--you know, what--who are your friends, what are your hobbies, what are your likes?
Speaker 2: I liked being, I liked reading, I liked being outside.  I liked being in the streets.  I was very comfortable in the street.  And when I was home, I liked to read.  That is basically it.  I experimented with things, explosives, I guess, (laughter) bottle rockets, and I liked science kits.  I built model airplanes.  I think I really liked that, building model airplanes.  I'm sure I really liked that, the detail required.  I don't know what to say.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you sound like a--so what were the things that you liked reading?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: What did you like reading?
Speaker 2: History.  I read a lot of biographies, and I enjoyed the evolution of history very much.  I still do.  I team--seem to look at life, I'd like to think, from a historical perspective.
Speaker 1: And, so when you--because part of me makes--you sound almost like a scientist, you know, that you gravitated more to things like science and math.  Is that what you were--
Speaker 2: No, I'm absolutely (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) More--
Speaker 2: I'm peculiar in that I have a dyslexic, dyslexic, dyslexic as- aspect.  I invert numbers very easily.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Very easily.  So I guess my hope to be an aeronaut- nautical engineer was thwarted by my lack of capacity, mathematical capacity.  I just couldn't do math.  So I guess I couldn't be an engineer.
Speaker 1: So what--did you, were you diagnosed as dyslexic?
Speaker 2: No, you were just stupid.
Speaker 1: No, I mean--that's back then (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There was no such thing as dyslexia back then.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: My oldest daughter [Keisha Sutton-James] is also dyslexic.  She's a graduate of the business school at U Penn [Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], a highly respected institution.  But by that time, there was such a thing as dyslexia, and we were able to find ways to overcome that disability.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.  Yeah, 'cause my sister, she said she couldn't tell her right hand from her left hand and didn't know it.  (Laughter) (Unclear).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You know, it's tough.  Because mathematics is of course, very, very important.  I, but I hear well, and I read fairly well.
Story_ID: 652567
Speaker 1: What's forming you?  Because your father's [Percy Sutton] busy building his law practice.  You know, so what are--
Speaker 2: Very busy.
Speaker 1: Very busy, right, very.
Speaker 2: My father was a very busy man, very busy.  He was always doing something.  He was--I never remember seeing my father comfortably idle.  As we sit here in my father's apartment and I look at this table over here to my right, I remember even as an adult coming in here and seeing my father sit at that table with papers strewn all about the table, as he sat with a pen or pencil in his hand.  My father was, despite of his work, was not entirely comfortable with people, I think.  I don't think he was entirely comfortable with his thoughts.
Speaker 1: Pierre [HistoryMaker Pierre Sutton], that is shocking.
Speaker 2: For a man, a public servant, if you will--I don't like the word politician.  But as a public servant, he was extraordinary in that regard because he really didn't enjoy the--I guess, having to smile.  I don't think he was comfortable with that (laughter).
Speaker 1: So he was passionate about things but not comfortable with the--
Speaker 2: Process.
Speaker 1: --the process, right.
Speaker 2: Right.  He knew what had to be done, and he did that.  But that didn't mean he had to be happy with certain aspects of that job.
Story_ID: 652568
Speaker 1: So as you're growing up, how aware are you of the people that, you know, are, you know, are around you?  And, you know, I mean later they're, you know, known nationally--they're national figures.  But how aware were you of this as you were sort of growing up?
Speaker 2: There are two lives here.  All right.  One was a life in Queens [New York], growing up.  And then there's another life here in Harlem [New York, New York].  So you had the Queens, San Antonio [Texas] life.  And then you have--
Speaker 1: I see (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) this.  The--
Speaker 1: The Harlem life.
Speaker 2: --phase two.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how old were you during phase one?  And when does phase two start, in terms of--
Speaker 2: Well, high school [Andrew Jackson High School, Queens, New York] and then--I guess high school--graduated from high school in 1964 being a very poor student in college, basically because I didn't have good study habits.  I didn't want to do it.  I had an ability to pass tests that was extraordinary.  I seemed to know instinctively what the answers were.  So I was really quite lazy.  If I could pass a test without studying for it, that's what I was going to do, and which didn't really develop for me good study habits.  And while that was okay in high school, and if I had stayed as I did for a short period in a certain school in the South, then I would have been fine.  But as it, as it were, that doesn't work in college, not in the real world.
Speaker 1: So, how did you end up--because you went to the University of Toledo [Toledo, Ohio], right?  Is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, um-hm.
Speaker 1: In Ohio.  So how did you end up at the University of Toledo in Ohio, from New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: They would take me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And then I had a couple of friends from high school that went there.  And, so off we went.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  So you, so do you go the whole four years?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  I--a couple of years, and then I was forced out and came back to New York.  And then I--because my uncle [John Wesley Sutton], the one who was my father's oldest brother, had founded the chemistry department at a southern black school, I went to school there for a while.
Speaker 1: And that was where?
Speaker 2: In East Texas.  And then I left there driving a very good GPA [grade point average] but being essentially bored and just left.  And then I was exposed to the draft, and I entered the [U.S.] military.
Story_ID: 652569
Speaker 1: This is what year, you entered the [U.S.] military--it would have been?
Speaker 2: Sixty-seven [1967].
Speaker 1: Sixty-seven [1967]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's the heat of all the, you know, the draft dodging that we were talk- you know, that's--
Speaker 2: That was pretty much right in the, right smack dab in the middle of it.
Speaker 1: Vietnam [Vietnam War] is going on.  So you entered, so you go into the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: No, the [U.S.] Marine Corps.
Speaker 1: Marine Corps, okay.  And your father [Percy Sutton] is in the Arm- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) [U.S.] Army Air Corps.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And [U.S.] Air Force.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you go in, and how long do you stay?  How long were you there?
Speaker 2: I was in the Marine Corps almost three years.
Speaker 1: So, how did you find that experience?  And where were you stationed?
Speaker 2: Well, I--it really taught me how stupid I am, thinking that I was smart (laughter).  So not applying myself in college [University of Toledo, Toledo, Ohio] led to me (laughter) being in the Marine Corps, as I look back upon it.  And being in the Marine Corps led to being in a war.  And being in a war is something that I did not enjoy.  And I was there basically because I was foolish enough not to apply myself earlier.
Speaker 1: So where were you, where were you, where did you do basic training?  And then where were you--
Speaker 2: Parris Island [Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island] in South Carolina [Parris Island, South Carolina], Camp Pendleton, California [Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, San Diego County, California] and off to I Corps [I Corps Tactical Zone] in Vietnam, I Corps being the northernmost part of South Vietnam.
Speaker 1: Now how long were you there?
Speaker 2: The Marine Corps required that you be in country for thirteen months.  All the other branches of the service, twelve months.  But the Marine Corps is tougher than every other branch, so we were required to be there thirteen months.
Story_ID: 652570
Speaker 1: So were you seeing combat?  Were you actually--?
Speaker 2: I saw combat.  And I saw another side, which was, which was interesting.  The war [Vietnam War] was a corrupt one.  I saw the black market in Vietnam and it made me, it changed a lot of things for me.  I saw true corruption and it--apart from the wrongness of the war, wrongness of war and wrongness of this war--from a political standpoint I saw another wrong side of life.
Speaker 1: Now when you say that you saw the black market--black market can exist on lots of different things.  Are you talking about drug black market?
Speaker 2: No.  Interestingly enough, I think I got there just before the heroin epidemic hit Vietnam.  There were some drugs, but it was a lot of smoking pot and some other things but noth- nothing like heroin.  That turned out be the case later on.  No, it's simple enough as going into a village at first and--myself for entertainment, as it were--and bringing fruit for my consumption, and then the mama-san saying, "Can you get more fruit?"  So, "Sure, I can get more fruit.  I can just go over here and get fruit and bring it in."  And then being paid (laughter) to have fruit for that fruit, which then turned into a fan, an electric fan and then other small appliances.  And then seeing that there were others who were more highly placed than I was who were also involved in larger exchanges--the selling of a fire engine, the rental of jeeps--just business going on that really shouldn't been going on but was in fact going on.
Speaker 1: So you saw that.  So what--how are you seeing those things at that level?  Were you working office jobs or you just saw it all around you?
Speaker 2: Well, no, I--yes, I--yes, by the end of the war, of my war.  I was in disbursing, and we paid--disbursing in the [U.S.] Marine Corps is the same thing as the Paymaster Corps in the Army [sic. U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps].  And so we paid the battalion of the--we paid everybody, including the generals.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Okay, I see.  So that's why you were in a position to see what kind of deals and things were being done.  So was--so there--the service was eye awakening for you, then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in many ways, yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And, so when you--you served three years.  Isn't that one more year than you were required?  Or you said the Marines--you were--it was--you said thirteen months.  But you said you were in for three years. So--
Speaker 2: Well, I said almost three years.  Because if you were a Viet vet, then they had an early out program.  So that when I got back, I was just beyond anxious to get out of the corps; and I got out as soon as I could.
Story_ID: 652571
Speaker 1: So when you get out, how have you changed?
Speaker 2: I can't even begin to answer that because I had no answers, I had no direction (laughter).  I was, I was a mess, I have to say (laughter).  I was a mess, it was--I don't have any words to describe how--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) how that whole experience affected me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was just, I had no--suffice it to say that I really didn't have any, any sense of direction at that time.  I came back, and I went to NYU [New York University, New York, New York] in a daze.  And my father [Percy Sutton] helped me.  He knew that I liked to write, that was some--I used to write stories.  So I forgot, I forgot that I used to write stories (laughter).  So he knew that I liked to write.  And, so he came upon the idea--and he knew how that, how I felt about the war [Vietnam War].  And he helped me by, helped me to start a newspaper.  And I don't know if you know Mal Woolfolk [Charles M. Woolfolk], who introduced me to your organization (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, that's right, I do.
Speaker 2: But Mal Woolfolk--first let me begin by saying my friend, Mal Woolfolk, his father [Mallalieu Woolfolk] was my father's lawyer.  While my father had an LLB, which is a law degree, Mal's father had a doctorate in the laws.  He was rather well versed in (laughter), in the law.  And, so Mal and I grew up as contemporaries.  I mean we really, from the time we were very, very young, knew each other.  Mal and I--my father helped us, if you will, to start a newspaper called The New York Courier.  And we worked on that newspaper, which was a weekly--we had purchased--the Courier was a national chain of black newspapers.  We had purchased, my father had purchased the then defunct New York Courier brand.  And we started that business in the basement of a brownstone about five blocks from here and produced that newspaper, which was a Harlem [New York, New York] newspaper, weekly for a few years.
Speaker 1: And this is--is this 1968, '69 [1969], '70 [1970]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the--
Speaker 1: Oh, in the--
Speaker 2: Seventy [1970], early--
Speaker 1: Early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968], '69 [1969], sixty--I'd have to say '69 [1969] to '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Okay.  I even have '71 [1971], for some reason.
Speaker 2: Well, that's--probably '71 [1971], too.
Speaker 1: Okay, I have '71 [1971].
Story_ID: 652572
Speaker 1: Did Mal [Charles M. Woolfolk] have a similar growing up as you?  I mean you were--
Speaker 2: Well, Mal lived in New Jersey.  I lived in Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Harlem, okay.
Speaker 2: His--Mal's mom, was a very significant person in this community.  She was Dr. Petioni [HistoryMaker Dr. Muriel Petioni] and an absolute star.  She was my pediatrician.  She was a very, very strong woman, petite (laughter) but strong of character and spirit, a very beautiful woman.  And I remember her with great love and affection.  I remember Mal's father [Mallalieu Woolfolk] being the only one that I ever knew that could say, could look at my father and say, "Come on, Percy [Percy Sutton], really," (laughter).  Nobody talked to my father in that fashion.  He didn't--no one, no one would, that I was ever aware, would speak to my father in such a fashion.  But Dr. Woolfolk could speak to my father in that way.
Speaker 1: You know, we were lucky.  I was, I actually interviewed Dr. Petioni years ago.
Speaker 2: Oh, did you?
Speaker 1: I did, that's how I met Mal.  Because I was going, I was trying to find next of kin and sent him, you know, the thing.  Because Muriel, she was lovely.  It was in the very early years of our project.
Speaker 2: Let me tell you a story.  Mal and I one time went to Haiti.  And I can't remember, cannot remember the purpose of our trip at that time going to Haiti.  It was an organized trip, and it was before the--I think maybe the pope [Saint Pope John Paul II] had gone to Haiti.  I don't remember exactly what--why we were in Haiti.  But shortly after we landed, Mal disappeared, completely disappeared, and I didn't see him for days. "What happened to Mal?  Where's my man, where did he go?" Well, it turns out Dr. Petioni's forebears, one of her forebears, was a hero of the Haitian Revolution.  So (laughter), and Mal was a descendent of that, of that hero of the revolution.  So he was treated to a very special Haitian experience.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, Haiti is a fascinating place, too.
Story_ID: 652573
Speaker 1: No, she [HistoryMaker Dr. Muriel Petioni], she was lovely.  And she, you know, she would actually send us small checks from time to time.  I mean, she was in her nineties.  And frank- I mean, probably early nineties because she lived quite a bit after that, um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, my.  On her deathbed, she had instructions for me.  Absolutely told me exactly what I should be doing, on her, on her deathbed.  It was, she was remarkable in that she was able to tell--and I wasn't the only one.  She had instructions for everybody (laughter) as to what they should be doing now.  There was much that could, she could have done, but she did all that she could do within the period of her living.
Speaker 1: Because she and her husband [Mallalieu Woolfolk] were like, two career couples, you know.  She had her practice and, you know.  So you grow up--how--when did, when did you and Mal [Charles M. Woolfolk] become friends?  And what age were you?
Speaker 2: I don't, I just don't remember that far back.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: I remember him always being--
Speaker 1: In your life?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Okay.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father [Percy Sutton] and his father had a little boat, a little cabin cruiser, that they parked somewhere out here in Queens [New York].  And we would go out on that boat.  I remember being with him on that boat.  And I remember being--Mal can sleep with his eyes open, half open, he does that--being told the story of when our fathers and I and he were fishing out here in the bay [Sandy Hook Bay] or the Atlantic Highlands [New Jersey].  A fishing line came up, and there were two crabs.  And he and I declared that these two crabs were in mortal combat.  And our fathers later must have chuckled because they were in--had been engaged in sex (laughter).  Where we, where we saw mortal combat, they saw what was really going on here (laughter).  But they didn't disabuse us of the notion (laughter) they were, they were in, they were in combat.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You were little kids.  That is adorable (laughter).  You were little--
Story_ID: 652574
Speaker 1: I'm going to go back to The Courier [The New York Courier].  And, so let's talk about that, the newspaper.  So it's starting out.  But see, I have it, this is what I want.  So just to jog your memory.  I have it that Inner City [Inner City Broadcasting Corporation] began the year before.  Does that seem right, or does that seem wrong?
Speaker 2: No, we--no.  First, it was The Courier and then Inner City.  And the incorporation of Inner City Broadcasting as a company didn't follow immediately the business of broadcasting.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you incorporate, when you were running The Cou- The Courier--
Speaker 2: The Courier, The Courier, that's kind of--let me help you with that because that was a very interesting period of time.  The revolution was on.  There were the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party].  There were the, there was the Nation of Islam.  There were other Muslim groups here in Harlem [New York, New York].  There was Joanne Chesimard [Assata Shakur] a little later on--just before Chesimard.  But there was, there was--the revolution, if you will, was going on.  And it was certainly going on in this neighborhood.  There were the Ten Percenters [sic. Five Percent Nation].  There were just so many groups.  And what was interesting about it is that I--we had--The New York Courier was a--we were self-contained.  We had what you call an IBM Selectric Composer unit, which was an early, an early ability to cold type a newspaper.  That is to say rather than using lead pieces to drop letters into a rack in order to form a word, which would then be rolled into--onto a press, we were able to print out columns with a typewriter and paste them to a board and then take them to be photo shot, which would then be used to print newspaper.  It was--while the Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News], for example, was hot typed, was hot pressed, we were cold pressed--and it was very, very simple for us to put together a newspaper.  And, so we had the opportunity to interact with a number of these groups who wanted to print their rags, if you will.  So they would come in with their words typed out, and we would print them out for them.  I mean, we would, we would set it up so they could print their messages.  And, so we got to know a number of the players in the revolution in that fashion.  Others got to know that as well.  We discovered at one point that we hadn't paid our telephone bill.  And then we discovered that we didn't have to pay our telephone bill because (laughter), because the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] was interested in what was, what was being said on the telephones.  So it was an interesting period of time.
Speaker 1: So how many employees and--
Speaker 2: Oh, they were just--we didn't have employees, per se, it was just us (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So it was you and Mal [Charles M. Woolfolk]?
Speaker 2: You know, and, right, there was a volunteer.  There were pieces, and we used columns that would come to us that were free.  'Inside Rhodesia' [ph.], one that comes immediately to mind, 'The Current Zimbabwe' [ph.].  Just--we printed local stories.  We printed stories about the political goings on, that is, the revolution in general.  We printed a twenty-four to twenty-eight page newspaper every week.
Speaker 1: That's a lot.  So let me ask you.  Is this--are you, do you and Mal consider yourselves part of the revolution at this time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --ideologically?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So you--
Speaker 2: Not really, not really.
Speaker 1: But it's a business for you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We--it is.  You know, I think we made our own contribution, yeah.  But not in the sense that we were, you know, on the barricades.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But we made our own contribution, and I, and I think a valuable contribution.
Story_ID: 652575
Speaker 1: See, now I had that at the same time you were doing this that you were also--see, this is the thing.  You were vice president of Inner City Research and Analysis [Inner City Research and Analysis Corporation, New York, New York].  Is that possible, does that sound right?  No.
Speaker 2: That was, that was, that was just a, such a small thing.  And it didn't really last very long.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We--there were very, there wasn't any real polling of the African American community and its tastes, likes, dislikes, preferences, attitudes.  And we thought there may be some value in that, in getting--doing that kind of polling.  And there would have been had there been any interest in what we (laughter) ate or pre- preferred.  But there really, really weren't any (laughter) interest in what black folks wanted.
Speaker 1: Well, at that point black people are almost invisible outside of Harlem [New York, New York], you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We were--when I--you didn't see anybody black on television.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: There was no real interest in what we thought.
Story_ID: 652576
Speaker 1: This is at the beginning, where a lot of things were go- are starting to happen, you know.  But I want to go back to Malcolm X.  Because your fa- that's before this time period, right?  And, so can you talk about your father's [Percy Sutton] role with Malcolm X?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, when you say that, a certain chill comes over me, when you say his name.  Because it was--I did not know him well, but I knew what it felt to be in his presence.  And all I can is that it was an aura, it was a, just a, he was just a very different man.  He was--you sensed the tiger in the man.  You sensed the beast in the man, you sensed a force in a man, in that man, just a force.  He was a force, a force of nature.
Speaker 1: Did you attend his memorial service?
Speaker 2: p	I did.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about it?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was, it was extraordinary.  Are you talking about the one at the mosque [sic. Faith Temple Church of God in Christ, New York, New York]?  Because there were many memorials.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the one at the mosque.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was my first experience in a mosque, and the whole experience of men being on one side and women being on the other side was a unique experience for me.  I remember, in particular, I think the most important words that were spoken were spoken by the actor--
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis.
Speaker 2: --Ossie Davis, who anointed him, our shining black prince.  So beautiful.  I think it was a shock to all of us when he was murdered.  And his--as it turns out, while his murderers met justice, they were never named.  Or no one was arrested for the--no one was--his murderers, his murderers were never specifically identified.
Speaker 1: I know.  So how do you know if they met justice?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I don't want to talk about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, I got you, okay.  Okay, that's fair enough, okay.
Story_ID: 652577
Speaker 1: I mean but that--this is your father's role.  This is the new role in Harlem [New York, New York] in many ways.  You know, you said there was the life in Queens [New York] and then there was the life in Harlem.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, so--
Speaker 2: Two different experiences.  My father had--his family was in, was in Queens, my mother [Leatrice O'Farrell Sutton] and myself.  And he would commute back and forth.  I came back from Vietnam and (laughter) went to where I thought I lived in Queens, and my parents had moved (laughter).  So there I am knocking on the door, and they don't live here anymore.  You know, I didn't write to my folks when I was there.  I just didn't know if I was going to live or die.  And I just--you--and the idea of sending regular letters and then having them be interrupted because I don't, I don't feel like wri- writing, or I can't write--and then having anybody be upset because I, you know--but yet I'm still alive because I--a letter hasn't been received--was something I thought about.  So I didn't really write letters.  And, so I didn't know that my folks had moved (laughter).  So going to my home and discovering I didn't live there anymore was quite a surprise.
Speaker 1: And I bet they were worried the whole time, though, too?
Speaker 2: I guess so.  I would--you know as a, as a parent I think I would be worried if my, if my son, my only child, was in a warzone.  I'd be very concerned, I'd be worried to death.
Speaker 1: So your father [Percy Sutton]--
Speaker 2: Having been there, I would really be worried.
Speaker 1: Right.  Your father probably wanted to keep you close after that, in some respects.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so.  I think so, yeah.  I would, I think my instincts would operate like that, so I could see that in my father, yeah.
Story_ID: 652578
Speaker 1: So shortly after then The Courier around--Inner City begin- becomes--it starts.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were talking about how 1970, '71 [1971] is a critical time period.  Can you explain that again?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  I--all that period, that whole Courier experience, that whole--the things that were happening in the revolution of that period, lent itself--in that experience of helping to get information, disseminating information--that whole business of being involved, in that sense, really was very important in our development of Inner City Broadcasting Corporation.  We could reach Harlem [New York, New York] with our newspaper when it was sold, if the headline was good enough and for those who would read.  But the radio was something that everyone could hear and understand and could reach a lot a more people.  So Inner City Broadcasting became an extension of that experience, a growth, if you will, exponential growth of The New York Courier experience.
Speaker 1: So can you talk about how the whole deal happened?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sure, I remember it like it was yesterday.  Actually I don't because it actually happened before--and when I was in Nam [Vietnam].  There were riots that took place here.  And during the riots, my father [Percy Sutton] went on the radio, on WLIB [WLIB Radio, New York, New York] and spoke to the community.  And the owner of the radio station was suitably impressed.  And he could see the handwriting on the wall.  WLIB was located at the corner of 125th Street and Lenox Avenue [Malcolm X Boulevard], the very heart of Harlem.  He really didn't think that he was going to be able to stay there very much longer.  After all, there are riots taking place all around him.  And he committed to my father that when he made the decision to leave, that he would give my father the opportunity to purchase WLIB.  And that's what happened.
Speaker 1: So who was the owner?  What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Harry Novik.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right.
Story_ID: 652579
Speaker 1: WLIB [WLIB Radio, New York, New York] is AM at that point, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He [Harry Novik] also put something else in the deal, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, he put an FM signal in there as well.  At the time, FM signals would bounce off the leaves of trees and the sides of buildings, of very little value.  AM was king.  WLIB was a very limited--all black radio stations of the time, they were not black owned, they were white owned and they, and they were always the weakest signal.  They were--black radio was known as the station at the end of the dial.  That is, 1600, as WWRL [WWRL Radio] here in New York [New York] is.  At the front of the dial, 57, 56, those are the strongest signals in the AM band--at 1600 and 1700, those are the weakest signals on the AM band.  The black signals were always at the end.  An owner of the weak signal didn't know what to do with it--and look, the only way I can make money on this station is by serving this community over here.  And that's why black radio stations at the time were always at the end of the dial.  But that FM was a different story altogether.  Now here was an untapped resource.  It didn't operate the same as the, as the AM band.  Here, the higher tower and the more power you produce--there were limitations--the more okay you were, the more equal you were.  In fact all FM stations are pretty much equal, depends on how high the tower is.  And in New York, most of the, most of the FM signals now are on, are on top of the Empire State Building [New York, New York], giving them the greatest ability to see over the buildings.  AM waves go like this (gesture) they can have ground waves--go down into the valleys of the city and come back up.  AM signals are very, FM signals are very line of sight--straight from the top of the antenna to the receiver.  That FM signal had a value placed at the time of $1.1 million.  The AM signal, the money maker, WLIB, had a value of $1.9 million, almost twice the value of that AM signal.  Well, then came along something called the circular polarized antenna, which enabled FM technical signals to be received.  And lo and behold, FM is now viable.  We have this now on our newly acquired WBLS [WBLS Radio, New York, New York].  And what we have there is a radio station that is playing black music but with a difference. The difference being that we really, being black, we kind of respected the music that's being played.  So our programming--most of the deejays were in fact teachers--they were schoolteachers.  They were people who knew how to use the King's English and didn't make mistakes or butcher the King's English, as they say.  We would not allow the kinds of commercials that had previously been heard on black radio stations, which tended to denigrate our community.  We wouldn't sell prayer bricks and holy cloths and we'll finish your basement for ten dollars down and ninety-nine dollars a month for the rest of your life kind of stuff.  We wouldn't do that.  There was--we were very careful about our selection of commercials and reject those that were inappropriate for our community.  And in so doing, we built a radio station that was not only---we found, we discovered that this black music, if properly presented, everybody loves.  And, so we became the number one radio station in New York.  We became the first FM signal, FM radio station, to become successful in America.
Speaker 1: So can you talk about the--
Speaker 2: To become, I'm sorry--successful.  I mean that, to become number one in a market.  When we took over as the number one slot in terms of listenership in America, in New York, that was the first time an FM signal in a major market had done.
Story_ID: 652580
Speaker 1: So can you talk about the, you know, the early years of the station?  So you get, so Novak--Nov- Novik--
Speaker 2: (Pronunciation) Novik [Harry Novik].
Speaker 1: Novik.  He decides he wants to leave, he calls your father [Percy Sutton] up.  There's this opportunity.  What--how soon are you brought into the mix?  And who are the--and they're all, they're shareholders, too, right?  Like, a star attraction with a large group of shareholders.  So can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  My father was of a man of this community [Harlem, New York, New York].  And no money--(laughter) he wasn't a man of money at all.  The development of Inner City Broadcasting [Inner City Broadcasting Corporation] required money.  And there are two aspects to money in the, in the establishment of a corporation.  One is equity and the other is bank.  There were thirty-six as I recall, maybe fifty-six, I can't remember exactly--quite a number of investors in Inner City Broadcasting.  And--
Speaker 1: I've heard sixty-two.
Speaker 2: There may have been sixty-two.
Speaker 1: But some of them weren't maybe necessarily investors, I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: No, no, there were, there were a lot of investors.  I mean they were, they were members of the community.  They were preachers and teachers, lawyers, doctors.  I mean, people who--all of whom were im- important to this community and interested in its success.  And it's virtually a community affair.
Speaker 1: It was a community radio station [WLIB Radio, New York, New York] and the biggest--
Speaker 2: In the, in the most accurate sense, yes.  And I guess the way we conducted ourselves with dignity--I like to think that we did all of those people proud, in the way we conducted the business of Inner City Broadcasting.
Speaker 1: So you had people, like I think Betty Shabazz was one of the--
Speaker 2: Dr. Betty Shabazz.
Speaker 1: Dr. Betty Shabazz.  There was [HistoryMaker] Hal Jackson, who would come on.  I mean, there were a whole litany of--
Speaker 2: In many ways, the father of modern black radio, Hal Jackson.  Whole, his whole story, remarkable.
Speaker 1: We interviewed him, too, (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did you really?  That's great.
Speaker 1: We did, but this in the early years.
Speaker 2: Did you know that he owned his own professional basketball team [Washington Bears], world champion (laughter)?  A remarkable man.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Billy Taylor, too, you know.
Speaker 2: Billy Taylor was among them.  Judge Bruce, (unclear) Bruce Wright [Bruce M. Wright], Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson], whom my father advised for years.  Gee, I can't think of--Dr. Roscoe Brown [HistoryMaker Roscoe C. Brown] who is still on my board of directors who was, who served with my father in the, in the Tuskegee Airmen and who shot down the first German jet or one of the first German jets with a propeller driven airplane, a remarkable feat.  I can't name them all.
Story_ID: 652581
Speaker 1: So talk about the early years.  So you get started.  There's a lot of community support.  But it's putting together the whole organization at that point, you know.  Knowing--so who is, who is--how do you put the team together, and who is the team?
Speaker 2: Well, it's already there.  The structure is, you know, you have--
Speaker 1: The structure is there.
Speaker 2: You have, you know, you're buying an organization--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --all right, that is in place.  The FM was not--
Speaker 1: Not--it wasn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) wasn't kicking at the time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: My father [Percy Sutton] said he visited many, dozens of banks, before he'd get a bank to give us the loan part of the deal.  One of our shareholders who later turned out to be the publisher of the Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News] had apparently saved the child of the president of Chemical Bank [New York, New York] when he was a lifeguard.  And was willing to--that is the background--loan this black group the money necessary to complete the purchase of Inner City Broadcasting [Inner City Broadcasting Corporation].
Speaker 1: So you're talking--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, WLIB [WLIB Radio, New York, New York] and WBLS [WBLS Radio, New York, New York], or WLIB-FM at the time.
Speaker 1: You're talking about Tatum [Wilbert Tatum], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.  So Tatum, Tatum found the--you know, was able to help make introductions so you could get the financing.
Speaker 2: Well, that's, that's--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Bunny Berkeley [Norborne Berkeley, Jr.], who was the president of Chemical Bank at the time, did in fact make us the loan.  There's a part that we're missing.  The Am- we--I sold The New York Courier to the Amsterdam News.  And they used it as an insert for a period of time in the Amsterdam News.  And I, and as a result of that transaction, I served on the board of the Amsterdam News.  And with Will Tatum.  John Procope was the publisher of the newspaper at the time.  Carl McCall [HistoryMaker H. Carl McCall], who later became comptroller of the State of New York was also on that board, John Edmonds, others.  There were about six of us on that board of directors.  Tatum, Tatum, of course, was also on that board of directors.  So part of that transaction provided us with some of the money to get started with In- Inner City Broadcasting Corp.  And many, and some of those people who were in fact on that board at Inner City Broadcasting became shareholders in Inner City Broadcasting.
Speaker 1: So there's a lot of energy here around this, you know, that's happening.  Because you know, like in Chicago [Illinois], I mean it was later, but really WVON [WVON Radio] was owned by, you know, the Chess brothers [Leonard Chess and Phil Chess].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So that was different, you know.  So let me ask--also you know, you were talking about 1970 and how this was--you know, around this time Essence and Black Enterprise and, you know, are getting started too, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you know, that's interesting that you sold the newspaper.  So your newspaper did okay.  It didn't go, you know, it was actually purchased.
Speaker 2: Thank god (laughter).  Because (unclear), while we were having a fun time doing it, I don't, I don't think we made, we didn't make a lot of money.  I think we annoyed the Amsterdam News, more than anything else.
Speaker 1: So they wanted to get rid of you (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Let's get these people out of here.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Just buy them out.
Speaker 2: Let's buy them out, let's get rid of them.
Speaker 1: Put them out of their misery (laughter)--and out of our misery, too.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 652582
Speaker 1: I want you to just tell me the story as much as you can about those early years, and what role you first come in.  You know, how you come into Inner City [Inner City Broadcasting Corporation].
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what's your goal at the beginning?
Speaker 2: I came in news and public affairs director.  That was my initial role.  Even though I was the president of the, incorporating president, I was not the president of the corporation as it started.  That was an evolutionary thing.  As the news and public affairs director, we were, we were pretty aggressive with our news.  We did many of the things that we were doing with The New York Courier.  That is, reporting on the revolution as it was taking place.  And this is the whole, this is what--again, the early '70s [1970s].  We're talking about the revolution going on here still.  And, so we have, we have special relationships with the people who are in fact players in the revolution.
Speaker 1: And so, talk about (unclear).
Speaker 2: I mean, I--you know, we knew things that the government didn't know--about the location of fugitives (pause), the leaders and the underground--even some white underground activists we had knowledge that others didn't.   We didn't broadcast these things but because of our involvement with those groups, we became aware of a lot of things that the government wished that it knew.
Story_ID: 652583
Speaker 1: So many, many competitive groups.  I remember going to a meeting in Manhattan [New York] when--where Jesse [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] asked if--a number of us, if we could support something that he wanted to do, which was to start an organization called PUSH [Operation PUSH; Rainbow PUSH Coalition] in Chicago [Illinois].  And I said, "Well, we support everybody else, why not you?  Sure, we'll support you."  You know, I'm just (laughter), you know, why not, what's new?  You know, somebody else starting an org- an organ- an organization.  So there were a lot of, a lot of players, all very, very significant in the changes that later took place.  In 19--I remember going to the, to the only convention, National Black Political Convention, which was held in Gary, Indiana, and actually being attacked with a machete there (laughter).  And being disappointed because I was so proud to have been elected delegate from here [New York, New York] to attend that and to have a voice in the selection of our first African American candidate for president of the United States, only to be absolutely angered at the destruction of that process by Shirley Chisholm announcing her candidacy for the presidency, destroying our process in the process.  And then as she ran, she ran more as a woman than a black woman--being very, very angry at her for that, you know.  Because it was important--I--the process of our gathering nationally to select a black person to run for president of the United States was a remarkable thing for us.  The reason why by the way that it was Gary, Indiana, is because we had our first big city mayor, if Gary could be considered a big city, mayor, black mayor, in Gary, Indiana.  But the process of our gathering together as black people to select a man to run for president or a woman to run for pre- if we could have done that we would have made history.  Just our being together was making history, in how that was just--the possibilities of that were destroyed by Shirley Chisholm.
Speaker 2: You know, it's interesting.  Because she always--her story is that she never got, you know, got respect from the men.  And--
Speaker 1: I guess she showed us (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's her story (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They would never, they would never pay attention to her.  So that's her story.
Speaker 1: Oh, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But this gathering, I mean this is a time period--see, I really think, I shouldn't be interjecting myself, and I would like you to provide context.  But this is a very, this earl- these early '70s [1970s], it's very significant in the, in black history.  Because mayors are being elected because that was [HistoryMaker] Richard Hatcher you spoke of, you know, and that was the start.  And then you had, you know, others that came on after that.
Speaker 1: Tuskegee [Alabama], Mayor Washington [Harold Washington] in Chicago--
Speaker 2: Well, he was in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: But in the seven- in the '70s [1970s], you have Cleveland [Ohio]--Stokes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Stokes, Carl Stokes.
Speaker 2: I think you even have some southern mayors coming on, you know, a little later, too.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Carl Stokes, very significant, because that's Cleveland, truly a big city.  Who later came here.  I got to know him well, enough to introduce to him a woman who would later become his wife.  But that was a very significant happening.
Story_ID: 652584
Speaker 1: Everybody is coming through.  This is a small community, they're all coming through.  These--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --campaigns and things are happening.  Everybody is involved, right?
Speaker 2: You know, it's almost like when you say, when you say, when you use the word coming through, it's almost like my [paternal] grandfather [Samuel Sutton, Sr.] in San Antonio [Texas], where things are happening all around us.  While we were not moving and shaking, it's all coming through us.  We are aware of everything, we are disseminating the information about the events.  We are talking about them, we're encouraging discussion, we are having to--radio enabled us to communicate, and we did more two way communication than we did just simply broadcasting.  We did a lot of interactive work with our radio stations, so we were able to do more than disseminate information.  We were in fact able to influence opinions about certain subjects.  That's why it's so very vitally important that, I felt, the work that we do.  Because, you know, it's a, it's a--a movement has to move.  It's not just an action, it's movement in a direction, and it's not just a series of disparate events.  It is a movement towards a goal.  And while those events contribute to that movement, they contribute in very different ways.  And we are in media able to, if you will, put our interpretation on the significance of these events and create the truths (laughter) as we see it.  When an event takes place outside of the context of the, of the existence of black radio, it can mean very, very different things.  Most recently if--with the murder of that child down in Florida, no one would have known about it had it not been for black media.
Speaker 1: That's right.  You're talking about Trayvon Martin (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm talking about Trayvon Martin here.  No one would have known about it.  So the tree would have fallen in the forest and no one would have heard about it.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: The significance of black ownership means that you can make the difference, you can make the decision as to whether or not that is news.  That's not news to some folks.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Story_ID: 652585
Speaker 1: So let's talk about those early years and what you're learning about radio and the immediacy of radio.  You know, because you spoke about a little bit, you know, the difference.  So you--you're head of news and public affairs.  What are--who is already in place on air, and who do you bring in place?
Speaker 2: Well, we were fortunate in that we had a terrific program director, the famous Frankie Crocker, Frankie "Hollywood" Crocker, a unique man who became--we spoke about the club scene earlier.  We became number one for a reason.  It was, it was in ra- in radio because we were, we would, we had it all.  We had all--on FM radio, we had all of the music.  They came to us first, and they came to us often with their music.  We got it first because we're the biggest radio station, as we saw it, in America (laughter), you know.  Frankie Crocker--we used to--he is something, Frankie Crocker.  "I am the originator, not the imitator, not the flower or the root or the rod.  While others are laughing and joking, Frankie Crocker," or he would supplant that with WBLS [WBLS Radio, New York, New York], "WBLS is taking care of business, cooking and smoking, too much to take too soon.  If you don't dig where we're coming from, you got a hole in your soul.  Don't eat chicken on Sunday" (laughter).  You know, you know, that is kind of a rap.  But it's--it was, it expresses pride, and it certainly got people's attention.  We would, so we had a great deal of influence of course in music that's being played.  But we brought the music to the people.  There was, record day was an interesting day.  That was the day when people from the record companies would come to our place of business and would bring their wares.  "Will you play this, will you play this?"  And it was kind of well organized, that day.  However, if you would walk into our lobby, I sometimes described it as a scene, the bar scene from 'Star Wars,' because people looked wild, you know.  They were from a different kind of world.  You know, the music scene is very different from our relatively conservative (laughter) broadcasting environment.  So, but it, but it was--there were two sides of it.  It was, there was entertainment, which was WBLS.  And then there was a much more serious side at WLIB [WLIB Radio, New York, New York], where we were still on the AM band.  We were doing more talk radio, we were doing black news and information.  We were, we were communicating with the Caribbean.  We would, we had shows where we were interacting with continental Africa.  We were doing our best to interact with the African diaspora on WLIB--a very serious other side of Inner City Broadcasting [Inner City Broadcasting Corporation].  The AM station made no money.  It was completely flipped.  FM is god now; and all the money is coming in from the FM side in order for us to do this work on the AM side.
Story_ID: 652586
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So when did the FM side come into being?
Speaker 2: Well, when--with the circular polarized antenna that we employed--
Speaker 1: Right.  So you--
Speaker 2: --back in 1972, '73 [1973], I don't remember.  And shortly thereafter we became number one.
Speaker 1: And you--okay, right, okay.  And you--so was it always, do you remember the whole thing, the process with the antenna and what that took, and who was sort of leading the charge on that?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  There was a guy, Mitch, his name was Mitch Hastings [T. Mitchell Hastings] who owned WBLS--I'm sorry, BCN, BCN [WBCN Radio].  BCN was in Boston [Massachusetts].  He had a metal, he had a metal plate in his head, a very nice guy.  In fact I went up to visit him because I wanted to see if I could buy his radio station sometime at some point in the, in the '70s [1970s].  But he had played a large role in the development of this circular polarized antenna.  And our putting it on--our having that on W- on WLIB-FM, made WBLS [WBLS Radio, New York, New York]--enabled us, to compete effectively in the commercial radio market.  Did I answer your question?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Well, you explained how that sort of came to be.  But did you have to--so you didn't even--the good thing about WLI- WLIB-FM then--you know, the good thing is that you didn't really--did you have to raise money for that, for the F--because you were given that.
Speaker 2: There's such a thing as being lucky.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) The right place, right time.  WLIB [WLIB Radio, New York, New York], destined to become, destined to become poor, relatively poor, was in fact saved by the existence of WBLS--suddenly with riches--because we had this miracle of the circular polarized antenna.
Speaker 1: That's a miracle in a lot of respects.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because (clears throat), because they were giving away the F--FM had no cachet. And then all of a sudden FM becomes--considered its larger spectrum, right?  And then you said the antenna is what--because it reached a larger area.
Speaker 2: Yeah, if--and you can't find music, not even big band music, anymore on the AM band.  FM has certain advantages, intrinsic advantages, over AM.  Its tonal range is broader, the highs to the lows.  It had the advantage of stereo.  So the depth of the sound from music--the breadth of the sound from music, was far different from the tinny sound of music on AM, therefore appreciated more.  And some music just naturally migrated rather swiftly after our success with it in New York.  It just moved, it was a rush of movement to the FM band, the use of the solar, solar polarized antenna and the, and the, and following that with the music.  So the FM band.
Speaker 1: So you, so what I had read, you're right.  It happened about two years after you ex- you exercised the clause of first right, first right of refusal.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then you were able to--well, not--I think it was given to you for like a do--
Speaker 2: Well, no, no, no.  Well, we had a--it was an option to purchase.  But the purchase price was let's say, I'll just round it out, okay.  The FM, we had an option to purchase--the FM we had an option to purchase it for a fixed price of $1 million.  The AM, this AM station, which was only daytime, from sunup to sundown, it was on only half the day--that was valued at $2 million.  So the AM was very surely a giveaway in that sense.
Story_ID: 652587
Speaker 1: Was Frankie Crocker first with LIB [WLIB, New York, New York], and then he moves over to LIB-FM?
Speaker 2: He was on WLIB-FM [WBLS Radio, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: I see.  Oh, that--he got recruited.
Speaker 2: He was on WLIB-FM when we, when we took it over.
Speaker 1: I see.  You inher- so you inherited him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in that sense, if you can inherit a Frankie Crocker (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Because everybody--I remember [HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick, you know, that was her thing.  She was upset because he wouldn't play--you know, he was a god.  And, so he wouldn't play her music.  He--
Speaker 2: I did not know that.
Speaker 1: Right.  So she--
Speaker 2: I love Dionne, I'm sorry, Dionne.  I love Dionne Warwick.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, she said (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Burt Bacharach and--
Speaker 1: It wasn't, you know, black enough, you know.
Speaker 2: You know, it's--it was, it wasn't.  And it was a, you know, that was, that was--yeah, she was a casualty, I guess.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) She is.  So you acknowledge that.
Speaker 2: I acknowledge that, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: She was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was a pop singer, a black pop singer.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Story_ID: 652588
Speaker 1: So what are the other things that are important, you know, at this point?  Are you, in those earl- I'm talking about the first, let's say, four years, if we could talk about, you know, if we say--because I have another date of '72 [1972], so that's probably right.  So far--I've got all these dates.  But I have to, (clears throat) but if we start--now is [HistoryMaker] Lois Wright on at this point?  She's not--is she--she's not there at that point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's what I'm wondering, who is the core group then?  Your father [Percy Sutton]?
Speaker 2: Well, no, no, my father never, my father came to the radio station--to Inner City Broadcasting [Inner City Broadcasting Corporation]--
Speaker 1: After--
Speaker 2: --in 1980.
Speaker 1: Oh, because after he had worked for--
Speaker 2: Sorry, yeah, he--
Speaker 1: --(unclear).
Speaker 2: All right, kind of flash forward if you will to '78 [1978].  My father ran for--
Speaker 1: Mayor.
Speaker 2: --mayor of the City of New York [New York].  We unfortunately lost, in part because his son was the campaign manager of his, of his, (laughter) of campaign for a while.  We lost.  We put up everything, though, we really did.  Mortgaged everything for that effort, just to put on a good show because we did not want to look bad.  And we knew that we were going to go, we knew that we going to lose, but we did not want to look bad in losing.  So we put a lot of money into losing.  That was '78 [1978].  For two years, my father then was of counsel to a law firm in Midtown Manhattan [New York].  I asked my father then to come aboard in 1979 or '80 [1980], maybe right after we lost.  And he didn't want to do that, for whatever reason.  By then of course I was, I was running the radio stations during the '70s [1970s], with success.  Somewhere in there with the success of WIL--BLS [WBLS Radio, New York, New York] and because of WLIB [WLIB Radio, New York, New York] and the political strength of WLIB, I was able to make myself into the chairman of Inner City Broadcasting.
Story_ID: 652589
Speaker 1: See, Pepe [HistoryMaker Pierre Sutton], what you don't--what you're not--I'm trying to sort of understand those early years.  Because look at this, I'm just telling you the way I'm hearing the story.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm hearing the story that you were sort of like--you're smart enough, but you were sort of not directed.  Then you go to the [U.S. military] service and you come back, and you're totally confused.  Then you run The Courier [The New York Courier], and next thing (laughter), you're like a total succe-.  I mean you--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's odd.  But let me just--but this is born of con- can I--this (unclear) this is born of conflict.  And I don't like to share stories that are, that are negative within our--in--within our family.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And there was, there was some negative things.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: First of all, you would, you would understand that most of the people who were investors in Inner City Broadcasting [Inner City Broadcasting Corporation] were not my contemporaries.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: They were contemporaries of my father's [Percy Sutton].  And there was some resentment over, over my being there.  But I--much of which I was able to overcome because of the positive impact that our success on, not on so much on WBLS [WBLS Radio, New York, New York], which was kind of a given.  Okay, we played music over there, and that's what we do well--but our success as a communicator, as a communications force on WLIB [WLIB Radio, New York, New York] which was the political arm of our, of our company.  And everybody understood politics, and I certainly did.  I'd been observ- an observer--I slept on tables in my father's political club [Martin Luther King, Jr. Democratic Club] since I was a child.  I understood politics, and I understand that you don't--not everybody is your friend who may appear to be your friend.  I continue to learn those lessons by the way.  But, so there were conflicts that existed.  But I emerged from that conflict on top, largely because of the strength of WLIB and what we were doing politically with WLIB.  And there I have to say that my ally, my very strong ally, was a man by the name of David Lampel who was our news director, who was--
Speaker 1: He's Jewish, right?
Speaker 2: No, he's not.
Speaker 1: He's not.  Someone told me he was Jew--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's not, he's--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, maybe his father was.
Speaker 1: Maybe his fa- I see, okay.
Speaker 2: But he was, he was never.  So he went to George Washington High School [George Washington Educational Campus] up here in Harlem [New York, New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a--
Speaker 1: So he was black, okay.
Speaker 2: He was a black guy and he was, and he was every inch the revolutionary--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of the time.
Speaker 1: So tell me what his role was.  At this point--
Speaker 2: He was the news director, he became the news director.
Speaker 1: So you brought him on as news director?
Speaker 2: News director, and when I, and when I became the chairman, he became the general manager of WLIB.  It was like as I moved up, he came up as well.
Speaker 1: So how--
Speaker 2: But he was instrumental.
Speaker 1: So how did the two of you met?
Speaker 2: At the radio station.
Speaker 1: He was already at the radio station?
Speaker 2: Let me tell you.  This kid--there were riots up at his high school, and he had grabbed the microphone and got reports and brought them in as a sixteen year old.  And he became a radio guy at the age of sixteen with no education.  He became an extremely--he--a self-educated man.  And I believe he is now an officer among other things in the United States Coast Guard.  But a taught, self-taught man and an extremely effective communicator.
Speaker 1: So that's why I'm wondering, who's your team at WLIB?  Can you name some names?
Speaker 2: I just did.
Speaker 1: Well, you said Frankie Crocker.  You said David Lampel.
Speaker 2: Yes.  But the team is a, is a difficult thing because it was--
Speaker 1: Fluid?
Speaker 2: --fluid, there were people coming and going.
Speaker 1: Coming and going (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Parts would come and go.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's fair enough, that's fair enough.
Speaker 2: I think I fired Frankie Crocker three times (laughter) for one thing or another.  But the machine kept on moving, one way or another.
Story_ID: 652590
Speaker 1: So LIB [WLIB Radio, New York, New York] comes in.  So what--I want--if you could talk until your father [Percy Sutton] gets on.  I want to know the things that you consider that were very significant during that period.
Speaker 2: The things--what do you mean?
Speaker 1: I'm talking about from a business standpoint and setting up systems.  I'm talking about some of the things that you helped, you know, from, you know, races you may have helped, political races or causes you may have helped.  I mean that's what I'm talking about.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't have good answers for you there because there's nothing that we weren't involved in.
Speaker 1: Okay, everything (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Everything, everything happened.  David Dinkins [HistoryMaker David N. Dinkins] becoming mayor--
Speaker 1: Mayor.
Speaker 2: --there was no question about that.  The man who is the mayor of the City of New York [New York] now, Bloomberg [Michael Bloomberg], you can go back to when he was first elected.  And the Village Voice will have reported--you'll see that.  The Village Voice will have reported that if it were not for black radio, i.e., us--then he would not have been elected mayor of the City of New York.
Speaker 1: I guess I'm trying to understand what you consider significant about that period or--
Speaker 2: Oh, the period was that it, that it existed and that it ended, you know (laughter).  You know (laughter), you know, and I was one of those kids at Woodstock [Woodstock Festival; Woodstock Music and Art Fair] that thought this was the beginning (laughter), you know, of the, of everything, when in fact it was the end of that period.
Speaker 1: That's true.  I hadn't thought about it in that way, but that's true, that's a profound statement.  But I'd like some details in between.  But--
Speaker 2: You know--
Speaker 1: It was too much (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Even historically, it's hard to analyze what in fact happened.
Speaker 1: Because it was too much.
Speaker 2: Certain things happened.  We got voting rights, you know, there are things that happened that's cause and effect.  We talked earlier off camera, we talked about the benefits of segregation, in that there was a, there was--it allowed for the cream of our crop to become Tuskegee Airmen in World War II [WWII].  The fact that the, that the Apollo Theater [New York, New York] and the Howard Theatre in Washington [D.C.] and other small, very small venues in cities around America were part of what was called the Chitlin' Circuit, where black entertainers would go and sometimes play at the Apollo Theater eight shows.  But as soon as segregation ended, they didn't need the Apollo Theater anymore.  Why should they play eight shows when they can go play at a larger house of five thousand seats rather than fifteen hundred seats and get paid the same amount of money for doing one show?  Why?  You know, so all of those theaters around the country (unclear) became churches.  It was the end of an era.  The success of the revolution, if you will, if you can call it that--the signing of the Civil Rights Act [Civil Rights Act of 1964], I remember being very frightened when this guy from Texas, Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], took over as president of the United States.  Because I remember picketing him as a youth, with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in Texas, knowing he was a racist.  And here this, here this guy turns out to be the driving force in passing (laughter) the most significant civil rights legislation ever in the United States.  But that had its consequences.  That--I, and I believe what happened there was a sense of complacency.  Gee, we won, we've, we have arrived.  Never thinking that that the, that just merely being able to use the water fountain--it was such a relief to be able to do that--that we weren't thinking about, about how insidious racism really is, just how deep it is--that the struggle, now that we can eat next to them.  But can we work next to them?  And can we work, can--is equality--have we achieved equality?  The answer is no, we have not achieved equality.  We have just, (laughter) we just got certain shackles, certain bonds released, that's all.  The economic st- struggle obviously continues, and it will be continuing for some time.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's true.
Story_ID: 652591
Speaker 1: You don't hear of the--I'm telling you, you don't.  I was just reading, and I thought, there're five?  You never hear about the five.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, Ess- Essence magazine?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah, those--it's a small miracle that those guys were able to put together an institution like Essence magazine--men (laughter).
Speaker 1: Men?  On top of the, and that's the other thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On top of everything else, men (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) On top of everything else--that's fu- you go figure (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: They got [HistoryMaker] Susan Taylor (unclear) over there (laughter), and it was men running it the whole time.
Speaker 2: The whole time, yes.
Story_ID: 652592
Speaker 1: So I want to go back to the first, the first like five years.  And you, you know, you have spoken--okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: I was going to say here we are with this tremendous success with WBLS [WBLS Radio, New York, New York].  And I said, "If I can do this in New York [New York], I can do this anywhere."  So then I set out to expand, if you will, and found that people weren't really anxious to sell to an African American, even having the money.  Because I found that I could get people to invest, rather, banks to support this effort.  So because of our--
Speaker 1: Success.
Speaker 2: --success.  And if it doesn't work, they can always take away WBLS, you know.  (Laughter) So we first went to Detroit [Michigan].  And there we named the radio station WLBS [WLBS Radio; WPZR Radio, Mount Clemens, Michigan], stealing from WBLS.  Then from there I went to San Francisco [California], where there existed a station that was KRE AM and FM, which I renamed into KBLX [KBLX Radio].  It's phonetically similar to WBLS.  That was an interesting story because as we were opening up our doors there to do business as KBLX, there existed there at the time a radical left wing newspaper called the--I think it still exists--called the Bay Area Guardian [San Francisco Bay Guardian].  And they put a very large headline on their newspaper that said, "The Rumble at KRE over Disco."  It was a jazz radio station, this station.  KRE was a jazz station.  And then the subtitle to it, "A Case Where White Liberals Confront Black Businessmen to Save Third World Programming."  "The arrogance of these people," (laughter) I'm saying to myself.  So they actually set up a picket line at our radio station, picketing us.  Here we are, we're black, we're taking over a previously owned white radio station, and we are being picketed by white folks for being black.  I don't know where--they assumed that we were going to be disco.  But the station had its roots in jazz.  And what we did was, we--it was complete jazz, which was, which was to the majority of the listeners would be a complete bore.  And we, what we wanted to do is go more to the mainstream.  So we just slotted in vocals--just intersperse vocals into jazz.  Jazz vocals, vocals--just simply vocals.  And it exploded as a, as a, as a power in that marketplace, with fewer than 10 percent black population, yeah.  By the way, WLBS cost us $1.5 million.  KBLX the AM and the FM--cost $1.8 million.  By the time I got down to Los Angeles [California], word had gotten out, and I had to pay $5.6 million for an AM-FM combination there.  But then we're bicoastal, and we're kind of happy.  A recession hit in the meantime, and made everything a lot more difficult.  But we survived that as well.
Story_ID: 652593
Speaker 1: So the recession you're talking about in the late--around eighty--
Speaker 2: In the '80s [1980s]--
Speaker 1: Eighty--
Speaker 2: --there was a bit of a recession.
Speaker 1: Because in the '80s [1980s], the interest rates are out of the roof and--
Speaker 2: Inflation had gone crazy.  It was, it was a, it was, it was a--quite a dramatic period of time economically and a very difficult period of time.  Because, of course, your bank interest, interest rates are tied to the economy, and you pay--you're paying a higher and higher interest on--during a difficult period economically, you're getting less and less money, and you're paying higher and higher interest rates.  But, you know, that was, that was the nature of the beast.   Anyway, we survived that period of time.
Speaker 1: But politically, too, it was different, too, because Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] was in office, right.
Speaker 2: Yes, Ronald (pronunciation) Reagan.  Interesting to think that he was scary then, when you compare him to these characters on the political scene today but these characters--and it's my belief that the characters that you see on the scene today will not exist four years from now because the boogey man [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] will have left the White House.
Speaker 1: That's true, that's true.
Story_ID: 652594
Speaker 1: You were in the acquisition mode.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now what are, what are you learning from each--now is--
Speaker 2: I always--I learn by, I actually go and I live in the city.  I actually live in the city to get a feel for it and then begin the--working with [HistoryMaker] Hal Jackson just to get a feel for how to program the radio stations--giving the, you know, the notion of the city because every city is different.  We kind of moved in, I live- I certainly lived in all of those, not all of those--but Detroit [Michigan], San Francisco [California] and Los Angeles [California] and New York [New York] simultaneously.  I did a lot of traveling during that period of time, moving.
Speaker 1: So when you would go live in, you'd get--you--how long were you living in, then?  I mean, even (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh, I, when I say live there, I'd stay for a month.  I'd stay for a month and a half, two months in each place as we were developing the radio stations.  And I would keep traveling around just to make sure that we were, I thought we were on the right track in each one of those places.
Speaker 1: So that's good so because you were getting a sense--you were listening and also observing the station itself, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were you making changes?
Speaker 2: All the time.
Speaker 1: All the time, okay.
Speaker 2: All the time.
Speaker 1: Were you shipping out some of the people who were in the New York operation?  Did they--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: From time to time, yes, yes.  If we needed help of an expertise that I knew that we had in New York, I would certainly do that, sometimes temporarily, most often temporarily, until we could adjust appropriately the satellite market, if you will.
Speaker 1: So did, but you did, you also--was it later that you also got into or looked at other markets?  Like, wasn't San Antonio [Texas] at one time and Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and--did those come later?
Speaker 2: No--yes, San Antonio later.  That was a--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was--
Speaker 1: That's your--
Speaker 2: --more of an emotional thing (laughter) than anything else (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because you're from San--your father [Percy Sutton].
Speaker 2: My father was there.  And I think by that time, my father had come on board [at Inner City Broadcasting Corporation].  I--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All of the, all the acquisitions that I discussed thus far occurred prior to my father coming on board.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: He came on, he came on in 1980 and he was here until, he was on board until 1990.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And he came in as chairman of the board.  And he was on board in that capacity for that decade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 652595
Speaker 1: So for this first decade, are--you're learning that you have capacity for business then?  Is that--that's what you're learning?
Speaker 2: I think I learned that in Nam [Vietnam], yes (laughter).  But yes, yes, I think I'm learning that I understand how this thing goes.  At least I understand my business.  I know radio at least as well as anybody else.  I have no superior in that regard.
Speaker 1: But you--so, now are you involved--is NABOB in ex- in existence at this point?
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so when do you get involved with NABOB?
Speaker 2: At the very beginning.  A guy by the name of Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] became president of the United States, and he brought in some people.  And I'm going to kick myself because I can't remember the name of this sister who was there in his White House, who decided it would be a good idea to gather at the White House all of black broadcasters in America.  And, so here we are meeting each other for the first time, we're all in the same place.  Well, we couldn't let this opportunity go without forming an organization (laughter).  So that's what happened there at the White House.  On that day was born the organization, National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters, which is kind of an odd name but that's what we decided upon on, on that day.
Speaker 1: And, so who were, who were some of the key members besides you in the group?
Speaker 2: You know, I can't--I'm sorry--with accuracy recall (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no, I can't--that's okay.
Speaker 2: At some point--I don't remember right now.
Speaker 1: Who was the first executive director, though, I wonder.
Speaker 2: I, you know, I don't, you know, I don't really remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I don't remember that.
Speaker 1: But this--that would be amazing, to see who the other people were around the country.  Because it's not--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're--most of them are older than me, if they still live.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Remember, I'm very, very, young.
Speaker 1: You're young, right.
Speaker 2: Very young to be doing what I'm doing.  Most--
Speaker 1: So what are people thinking of you with that?  Did--was there--did you ever have to sort of assert yourself (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I had to fight all the time.  I had to fight to get control over Inner City Broadcasting [Inner City Broadcasting Corporation], especially once it became a success (laughter).
Speaker 1: Because everybody's looking--
Speaker 2: Yeah, like, everybody wanted to--and we have some pretty powerful characters in this, in this community who were, who had invested who were not an- anxious to see my egg hatch.  And talk of nepotism, I've heard that.  But, you know, I've heard worse.  Now what--having an effective broadcast team, I can't say enough about the feeling that we had, the spirit of camaraderie.  We were a beautiful thing in those early--when I say the earliest days, you know, distributing turkeys at Thanksgiving, being, just being--every--there was a love that is hard to describe that was, that our community shared with us.  It's just hard to describe.  There was a unity of spirit that--it's just impossible really to reclaim today.  I mean, for me to imagine now.
Speaker 1: Well, everybody's excited that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because we were new then.  I'm saying we were new then--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and now we're--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It's not new.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And then of course with--once you have success, there are others who will imitate that success.  So, you know, we were number one.  And then somebody comes along and copies--takes the significant thread of your success and copies it and throws some money into, into the advertising and promotion of it, and you're knocked out of the top spot.  Then you got to come back and say, "Okay, let me just do this again."  And, so it became number one again.  It was just, it was always a battle.  And then it occurs that--comes to pass that there are three or four guys (laughter) doing the same thing, all of them, all of them going for that small black population.  So it's impossible to be number one in the, in the, in the ratings in New York [New York] anymore, because there are just so many people who're trying to do what you're, what you're doing.
Story_ID: 652596
Speaker 1: So I'm still in, you know, around the time your father [Percy Sutton], you know, is about to run for mayor.  And the significant things--I just want to--we're going to go back to the business.  But there are a lot of things happening in the '70s [1970s].  You know, we talked about the political things.  Here in New York [New York], I don't think Koch [Ed Koch], is he mayor at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, he became mayor in 1978.
Speaker 1: Seventy-eight [1978]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.  Oh, that's right, okay.  Because your father--okay.  So, but before that was--was it (unclear)--who was before Koch?  I can't remember.
Speaker 2: Beame.
Speaker 1: Beame, okay.
Speaker 2: Abe Beame [Abraham D. Beame].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so I want to ask one question, though, also.  And it's about the political clubs which are--you know, I don't want to say they're an anomaly, you know, to New York or Harlem [New York, New York].  But I haven't heard--you know, we don't have, we never had political clubs in, you know, in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Are you kidding me?
Speaker 1: Unh-uh.
Speaker 2: Chicago, to my mind, is the best organized community, black community, I've ever seen.  Chicago is totally organized.  Everybody belongs to something in Chicago.  In New York, we don't belong to much of anything.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.  But you do have the political clubs (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, but we're talking when you, when we're talking about an organization, we're--New York is just a--how can I describe it?  When we talk--I've got to--let's try to think historically about where we come from.  New York is a couple of, a bunch of different communities, black communities.  You have people from, some people from the South, largely from the Carolinas, coming to New York during the great black migration [Great Migration], if you will.  Chicago, you have people coming largely from Mississippi to Chicago.
Speaker 1: Mississippi and Alabama.
Speaker 2: And Alabama, right.  In New York, we have this huge West Indian population.  And when I say West Indian I'm talking about there's a lot of islands in the Caribbean (laughter), and all of them have people here.  At least one of those islands has a very large, very large population here--Jamaica, Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago], Haiti.  I don't want to continue because I'm going to mess up here.  But, and they all are kind of--they're together but fighting each other, but together as a community unless--when they're not fighting each other.  But there isn't this, there isn't a, there isn't a community kind of organization that organizes all of, all of them, if you will, into a, into a so- into a civic group like you have in Chicago where people be- belong to organizations and work within those organizations.  That doesn't exist in New York.  This is, this is, this is Dodge City.
Story_ID: 652597
Speaker 1: So I understand that difference though that has sort of fallen apart, too.  But I understand that difference.  But what about the political club that it--what was the name of your father's [Percy Sutton] political club?
Speaker 2: The Martin Luther King Democratic Club [Martin Luther King, Jr. Democratic Club].
Speaker 1: And how many members were that, in that club, do you know?
Speaker 2: I have no idea (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Idea, okay.  But out of that club came the election of--your father is borough, Manhattan [New York] borough president, you know, Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel].  I mean lots of--David Dinki- did David Dinkins [HistoryMaker David N. Dinkins] come out of that club, too?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All of that came out of that club.
Speaker 2: Well, they were, they were all separate people, popularly known as the Gang of Five, really.  I'm sorry, the Gang of Four was really four different guys, each trying to make his own way, and found a commonality, a purpose, over a period of time which I will call a struggle.  Because it takes--for those four men, all of them strong, to coalesce as a, as a force took some, I would imagine, (laughter) yeah, some- something special to have happened.  And so, they had different clubs.  In answer to your question, they had different clubs, they had different organizations, and they just kind of coalesced.  I think the unifying force was the absent congressman, the great Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.], who was, who was largely absent.  And the knowledge that, un- until he was gone, none of their aspirations would be realized.  So I--my guess is--I wasn't there, I wasn't sitting there listening to these guys talk.  But I have to imagine that that had to have been, if not part of the discussion, certainly a part of their awareness.
Speaker 1: So, you--so that, I think that helps.  You know, because I think that helps.
Story_ID: 652598
Speaker 1: So you're there, though during this time of the '70s [1970s], the black voi- the black community has voice.  I mean, that's what you're--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And it's funneling everything.  And, so your father [Percy Sutton] is politically--but you're taking care of the voice in that way.  And then you have entertainment on top of it.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, so how much does the money roll in?
Speaker 2: We're doing good business.  It ebbs and it flows, but it was a, was--the funny thing about it, it was always more of a mission than it was about the money.  And, now it's odd to say that, but it always just, it seemed like it was the mission that was more important than the money.  Yeah, I remember, you know, living two blocks from here, not being able to pay myself enough money with my little daughter [Keisha Sutton-James].  Gee, how am I, how am I going to give my wife [Karen Bunche Pierce] the money to buy this and that kind of thing.  Because the money--other people had to be paid.  I remember having that kind of--that struggle early on with the newspaper [The New York Courier].  Later I could have taken larger salaries, but I just never did.  I just never became a rich man because, you know, I just never thought it would, it would go away, I'd always have enough.  My father--you sit here in my father's apartment.  And it is effectively a three bedroom apartment, two apartments kind of put together.  He never accumulated any money, not really.  He had his hand--a lot of money went through his hand--
Speaker 1: Hands.
Speaker 2: But he never accumulated anything.  He had a farm that he built that he named after the farm down in San Antonio [Texas], Upstate New York, that's now gone because his estate couldn't pay for it.  It's continual upkeep.  My mother [Leatrice O'Farrell Sutton] didn't want it, so it's gone.  There was, there was, there wasn't enough greed, ironically (laughter).  I think there wasn't enough greed in us, you know.
Speaker 1: I understand.
Speaker 2: You know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now people, people often mistake that.  You were really on a mission and--
Speaker 2: I would say so.  Yes, I think so.  You know, I'm not living in poverty, but I'm just saying, there was no, there's no, you're not looking at a millionaire here, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: That's just the way it is.
Story_ID: 652599
Speaker 1: So your whole process is that when you go (cough) into a market, you're going to go and understand that market.
Speaker 2: It's important to understand.  You know, you think you know, okay, they're black, I'm black, I understand.  You know, but it doesn't work like that.  Just as I said earlier, Chicago [Illinois] is very different from New York [New York] in terms of the way it works politically.  Each town is different, each city is different.  Detroit [Michigan] was far different than San Francisco [California] or Los Angeles [California].  I had the experience of (unclear)--I'd like to share this with you--of my father [Percy Sutton] insisting when I went to--when I told him I was going to move into Detroit, he insisted that I go and meet Coleman Young, who had been with him as a Tuskegee Airman.  And I was received warmly by Coleman Young one day.  And he insisted that I travel with him throughout his day.  And though I really didn't want to do that, I did it anyway.  And this is something that you're going to cut from your, from (laughter), from this taping.  But one, at the end of the day he had a press conference.  And a cub reporter, a young white fellow, asked him, "How do you feel about raising all this money for your reelection when there are children starving in the City of Detroit?"  And he looked at the young fellow and said, "Fuck you, motherfucker.  Next question?"  But you had to appreciate this is a press conference, and the cameras are awhirling, the scribes are ascribing, the microphones are, you know, in his face.  But he says this.   And I know you can't do that in New York because that's, you know, that's out there.  But Coleman Young in Detroit could do that (laughter), you know.  And I suddenly said, "Oh, my god, this man really is the man in Detroit."
Story_ID: 652600
Speaker 1: San Francisco [California], a whole different place.  We--it's--they're--most black folks, most people of color live in Oakland [California] and not in San Francisco.  And, so there wasn't really a San Francisco--our transmitter was in Oakland, right next to the Berkeley [California] border.  And the city that we were serving was San Francisco, just across the Bay [San Francisco Bay].  Totally different, something like 7 percent, 8 percent black population and not well to do.  So there it was not a direct appeal to a black community of substance.  It was just not there and didn't, didn't really exist in great enough numbers for it to be healthy.  Los Angeles [California], large black community.  There were no black owned radio stations there.  We would become the first black owned radio station there.  There was--I made a couple of forays into, into Los Angeles.  The first one was to buy a traditionally black oriented radio--I'm sorry, there was one black owned radio station, it was KJLH [KJLH Radio, Los Angeles, California].  I remember those call letters because it was the name of the man that--John Lamar Hill [John Lamar Hill, Jr.] was the, was the owner of that station, and it was located in his funeral parlor in the hood [Angelus Funeral Home, Los Angeles, California].  And he--I made an effort to buy his radio station from him.  And he quoted me a number that I just--(laughter) it was absurd to me.  I wouldn't do it, it was far beyond, you know, what I was willing and prepared to pay.  I later made another deal to purchase an AM and an FM combination there.  Years--some--during that period of time, I knew a few artists.  And among the artists I knew was Stevland Morris [Stevie Wonder].  And Stevie had an interest in that radio station, but he never talked to me about it.  He never, he never talked to me about it, maybe because he thought I was--you know, I had been trying to get the radio station.  He bought that radio station.  I think he paid more than I refused to pay for it (laughter).  But he bought that radio station, and he still owns that radio station today.  But there you have a very different kind of comm- black community.  A lot of folks went east from here.  Some of my best friends left New York [New York] to go to California to settle in Los Angeles and in San Francisco, mostly in Los Angeles.  And they, and I don't know where they came from.  I think they came from east to west.  I think that was another kind of mi- migration.  I think they for the most part came from the East Coast.  But it was a different kind of community there altogether, one which I to this day, I don't--I'm not really comfortable with.  I really don't like Hollywood, you know, I--the emphasis put on the bling, if you will.  I have no jewelry, I have no rings, no bracelets, no--never have.  I just, I--I'm just not like that, and I'm not a showy guy.  So I guess I don't like showiness, and Hollywood is all about showiness, seems to be that way.  And I just, I just, I was never terribly comfortable with Los Angeles.  Eventually sold that radio station, those stations there [KGFJ Radio; KYPA Radio and KUTE Radio; KSCA Radio].  But that was part of a mission.  Detroit [WLBS Radio; WPZR Radio] and Los Angeles were sacrificed but to the rebirth of the Apollo Theater [New York, New York].
Story_ID: 652601
Speaker 1: Your father [Percy Sutton] comes on.  I want to move into the Apollo Theater [New York, New York] because that besides--that becomes part of Inner City [Inner City Broadcasting Corporation], but that's a huge project, take on project.  And you're really, you're becoming an entertainment conglomerate sort of, with--am I right?  No?
Speaker 2: That would be the idea, but that's not really how it worked out (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  I know, I know, I know.  But that was the concept, that was--
Speaker 2: That was--oh boy--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was it the concept.  There's--there was very few monies that we saw that we could make money in this man's world and one of whom of course is entertainment.  And you have to put sports in there, too, that's part of entertainment.  It is what it is.  The Apollo Theater, we talked earlier about the death of the Chitlin' Circuit and the radio--I'm sorry, the venues, the theaters, that were a part of that Chitlin' Circuit that existed, that died with the end of segregation.  Well, the Apollo Theater was like many of these other theaters, going to become a church, and it was in bankruptcy.  And my father thought it was a good idea to buy it out of bankruptcy.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Now here was the trick.  There would be a conversion of this theater, taking its mere fifteen hundred seats and making it into a television production and post-production facility, thereby effectively increasing the size or the seating capacity by the number of people who had television sets, potentially.  So that--the theater was bought and it was supported by--and its--bought by Inner City, basically bought and supported by Inner City Broadcasting--and its, and its building, its state of the art television production and post-production facilities--only to discover that the people who were producing things wouldn't come to Harlem [New York, New York], just would not come to Harlem.  I can kind of understand.  The only thing that was on Harlem that was still sta- was standing was the Apollo Theater.  The rest of 125th Street was an absolute mess.  And to get through that mess to get to the Apollo Theater--why would they, why would they do that, when they can stay downtown and be comfortable?  So the grand idea of the Apollo Theater becoming, re- revitalizing the Apollo Theater, bringing back the glory of the Apollo Theater was greatly diminished by the lack of enthusiasm for the project in the producing community downtown.
Story_ID: 652602
Speaker 1: There's a host--
Speaker 2: So, so you find, you say that--okay.  So here you are, you've invested all this--you bring it out of bankruptcy, you raise the money.  Now how are you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We're losing money hand over fist, losing money hand over fist.  That's the reality.  Just, it was, it was--I said De- Detroit [WLBS Radio; WPZR Radio] and Los Angeles [KGFJ Radio; KYPA Radio and KUTE Radio; KSCA Radio, Los Angeles, California] went into the Apollo Theater [New York, New York] (laughter), literally.
Speaker 2: So you had, you had to--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, we--
Speaker 2: You sold them?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now you sold them in what years?
Speaker 1: I don't remember.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's okay, okay.  Let me, let me stop asking you this, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm very bad with years.
Speaker 2: That's okay, no problem.  That's okay, we'll stop that.  So you--let's see, darn it.  Why don't we--see I had, the reason I was looking here--because I had another outline that was I think better, that was supposed to be sent to me.  Okay.  So you get in and you cannot get people to come to produce anything there?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, so (cough), but there's a belief in the, you know, what the potential is.
Speaker 1: There wasn't when we first started.  We believed it made sense on paper.  We didn't understand.  We were disappointed in the, in the lack of enthusiasm for coming to this very new, very--as I said, state of the art production facility.  It was state of the art.  We had, you know, we had the flying (unclear)--I don't know the terminology.  But we had the newest and best equipment available at the Apollo Theater.  (Laughter) We had--there was none better.  So why wouldn't you?  Well, because you had to go Harlem [New York, New York] (laughter), you know.  The ironic part about it is that because the Apollo Theater and the traffic that it created, it really--
Speaker 2: Anchored the new Harlem--
Speaker 1: Anchored, anchored (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) the new Harlem.
Speaker 1: --anchored the development and redevelopment on 125th Street.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  And anchored what you see now--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --in Harlem, which is--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --sort of unbelievable.  And it's--
Speaker 1: It's certainly ironic, yes (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, I mean--but it's true.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You were a pioneer in that way, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: There're hard lessons being applied here, but you were a pioneer.
Story_ID: 652603
Speaker 1: Who do you sell the Detroit station [WLBS Radio; WPZR Radio] to and who do you, do you remember (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who?
Speaker 1: And who do you sell the--
Speaker 2: Los Angeles [California]?  I don't, you know, I don't remember, again, who--I guess Detroit was such a small thing because the Los Angeles thing was a big thing.  I sold Los Angeles to the Singing, Singing Cowboy.
Speaker 1: To who?
Speaker 2: The Singing Cowboy.
Speaker 1: The Singing Cowboy.
Speaker 2: Can we go off for a second?
Speaker 1: Yes, we can.
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: So we sold the radio stations [KGFJ Radio; KYPA Radio and KUTE Radio; KSCA Radio] in Los Angeles to Gene Autry who was, he was not a young man at the time, I'll put it like that.  His--the person--Gene Autry loved his bourbon at lunch.  And, so our negotiations devolved in the afternoon.  So it came to pass that I negotiated primarily with his banker, who had later become his wife [Jackie Autry].  And it was a fair price.  And, so he put that within his empire, then known as Golden State Broadcasting [sic. Golden West Broadcasters].  He was a very shrewd man, buying radio and television stations as he was a star in Hollywood.  But he was an interesting character.  He had Roy Rogers', I believe his horse Trigger, he had his--Trigger's stuffed in his office (laughter).  He was quite a character, that Gene Autry.
Speaker 2: So you sold it--okay, no, I can't ask that.
Story_ID: 652604
Speaker 1: You know, the thing that I was just looking here, that when you--Janice Campbell, she went, she was one of the people that worked for you.  And then she went out to San Francisco [California] for a time period.  Is that, that was sort of, when you would sort of ship people out?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Right.  Because she was, was she one of your assistants, I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --at the time?  And then--okay.  I--
Speaker 2: If you name names, I'll remember them and I can, and I can--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would help.
Speaker 2: --try to--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you talk about her and her role?
Speaker 2: No--she was an administrator in the--
Speaker 1: How about (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --nuts and bolts, to make things, you know, happen the way I knew that they should happen.
Speaker 1: So she's one of the people you brought on?  Or was she at the station?
Speaker 2: I brought--she came (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You brought her on?
Speaker 2: Brought on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Almost--
Speaker 1: And then [HistoryMaker] Vy Higginsen, what role did she play?  Because I interviewed her a long--she was one of my early interviews.  But that, by that time, she had another life I didn't really understand, you know, as an outsider.
Speaker 2: Dear Vy Higginsen, I love her to this day.  She was one of those--she was the first, she was there when I got there.  She was that voice that--not, you could not describe her as being sexy, she was not that.  She was, she had dulcet tones.  She had an on the air presence that was confident and perfectly suited to what we were doing.  She was just perfect.  I, and I--after she had left I remember in the later iteration, wooing her to come back to WBLS [WBLS Radio, New York, New York].  She was a great one.  She of course went on to produce 'Mama, I Want to Sing!' to great critical--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --and economic success.
Speaker 1: And that's when, that's where I knew, you know, I knew, I knew of that part.  So I may--I would have gone back and maybe looked at that interview, too.  Now the thing--
Speaker 2: (Humming).
Speaker 1: Hold on one second, hold on one second.  Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 652605
Speaker 1: So I want to go back to, I want to go back to the, to the Apollo Theater [New York, New York].  So you're dying here and you have to sell the stations.  You know, you're sort of--and, so what do you do with the sale of the stations?  Does that go back into money, into the organization [Inner City Broadcasting Corporation] or, you know--
Speaker 2: It keeps the core alive.
Speaker 1: It keeps the door alive.
Speaker 2: The core alive.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: It keeps the core alive, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: By then we were anchored by our radio stations in New York [New York] and San Francisco [KBLX Radio, Berkeley, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so what is happening in the market?  Has KISS [WRKS Radio; WEPN Radio, New York, New York], did the whole thing--KISS comes on later, right?
Speaker 2: The first, our first competitor was--it's interesting.  I came, I come from the islands and I'm in a taxicab, and I hear this radio station.  And I'm hearing this disco beat.  And I'm saying, "That's pretty nice."  And I just know that it's my radio station, you know.  And it turns out it's a (laughter), it's a brand new radio station.  And it was a disco station, and it wasn't KISS.  This was pre-KISS.  I cannot remember now, I'm having another mental breakdown.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that station becomes number one in New York because it did, it took, it took the thread, the essential thread of our music, which was, which was a danceable music and their--it was part of a new thing called disco.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: 180 beats a minute, twenty-four hours a day.
Speaker 1: So this is the disco craze in the early '80s [1980s], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Or maybe even before.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was whenever that was.  But I was taken aback by this development and had to adjust to it.  So we reckoned--this is the programming guy in here that's saying, "Okay, like people cannot live, their hearts cannot beat like this.  It's not good for their health.  It's not healthy, 180 beats a second--I mean a minute, twenty-four hours. This can't work like that."  So we came back with disco and more, which would pace down and people, you know, could breathe more comfortably.  And we became number one again (laughter), again with just that simple adjustment.  But as always that's--there was a constant war going on.
Story_ID: 652606
Speaker 1: The advent of KISS [WRKS Radio; WEPN Radio, New York, New York] was quite different.  They were a much more serious competitor and had been the bane of our existences and quite well funded.  And they attacked us from both ends, if you will, because they also owned--it was KISS and--
Speaker 2: Oh, god, hold on.  KISS and--I had it yesterday, hold on.
Speaker 1: I'm having another, I'm having another senior, senior moment.
Speaker 2: Let's keep going and then we'll go back.  That's okay.
Speaker 1: Anyway--
Speaker 2: So they attacked you both ways?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the upper end of our audience and the lower end.
Speaker 2: Because they had the young people, right?  KISS was the young people?
Speaker 1: No, KISS was the older.
Speaker 2: Older.
Speaker 1: The older audience, the much desired eighteen or twenty-five to fifty-four or twenty-five to forty-nine audience.
Speaker 2: Shoot.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Take it off for a second.
Speaker 2: Okay.  'Cause I can't--
Speaker 1: Take it off for a second.
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: So KISS and Hot 97 [WQHT Radio, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: They owned both KISS and Hot 97.  Hot 97 went after the youthful audience with hip hop or dance, hip hop or rap music, much of which we wouldn't play.  And that was kind of like a moral stance, if you will.  We were, we being based in the community of very serious people could not countenance music on the air which we felt to be--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --appeal to an uglier side of our, of our nature.  You don't say certain words.  You don't utter thoughts which are misogynous in nature.  You just don't, you don't want to appeal to the, to the negative side.  We never appealed to the negative side of our community.  And we--that's what was being done by people who just didn't care, as we saw it, about our community--what--certainly the way we feel, felt and feel about our community.  We cannot do that and in some ways we can't--right now you hear the argument about the N word, the use of it.  Should it be used, should it be--well, there was never any question in my mind--as to whether or not in our mind--as to whether or not it's appropriate for any of us to use it--or smart or, you know.  We have self-respect here, and we don't, we don't countenance that.  So (unclear) (laughter), but there--that--the other view would be supported by some folks, you know, and certainly encouraged by the people who own the other radio stations.  So that kind of cuts out a whole slice of our community which we will not be able to reach.  And then on the upper end, they are playing music that is competitive with us.  Because they copy, you know, if you copy you're going to gain a certain audience.  And, so we went back and forth, we went back and forth.  Who was in the lead--we're in the lead, they're in the lead.  And as I said, they were financed, and they had two radio stations and we only have the one FM radio station [WBLS Radio, New York, New York].  And they have two FM radio stations.
Speaker 1: Right, which was un- unusual.
Story_ID: 652607
Speaker 1: That had to do--that was starting (background noise) to be the change in the government regulations, too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was a battle being fought in Washington [D.C.].  And I was one of those who testified, by the way, against Rupert Murdoch becoming an automatic citizen solely so that he could purchase radio stations and television stations in America.  So that was wrong.  I know a lot of folks who would have liked to become citizens but aren't rich.  He was.  And he was given citizenship so that he could purchase these radio stations and television stations in America.  And, now you see what has happened there.
Speaker 1: The impact of that--that's right.
Speaker 2: But their--radio--the business of radio changed.   When we first came in- into business, you could have one AM station, one FM station and one television signal.  And you could not have those three if you had a newspaper.  So it was divers- was a diversification of communication in America.  When I came into business, you had to ascertain a community's needs and conduct surveys.  You would literally have to go out and survey the community and come back with survey results and how you would program to meet the needs of the community.  Every four years, we were, we were required to do these things in order to have our licenses renewed [by the Federal Communications Commission].  Well, all those--they'll say relaxation--but all those rules and regulations went out the window over a period of con- which resulted in consolidation of the broadcasting industry, so that entities could own more than one FM station in a market.  And there was a buying frenzy and a selling frenzy.  And, so these--a cheer, Clear Channel [Clear Channel Communications, Inc.] could grow to--CBS [CBS Radio] could grow rather exponentially because of their acquisition and the resources that they developed for purposes of acquisition of radio properties, which is a shame.  Because what it does, it takes away a lot of the local aspect which is some of the beauty of radio--it's local.  As I mentioned earlier, I would go and live someplace because I wanted to get the flavor, so I could reach it.  But, so much of the programming now is produced in one studio in, let's say Iowa, and then that is disseminated to radio stations throughout the country in some organizations.  And I use the State of Iowa just as--for whatever--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --could be.
Speaker 1: Right, (unclear)--
Speaker 2: But certainly in New York [New York] it would be, it'll happen in New York, and it'll be disseminated elsewhere.  And the originality is, factor is--and the loca- and the local flavor is diminished tremendously.
Story_ID: 652608
Speaker 1: In the instance of KISS-FM [WRKS Radio; WEPN Radio, New York, New York], they actually hired Charles Warfield [HistoryMaker Charles Warfield, Jr.] out from the station, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, they did.
Speaker 1: And that was--I--that was, that would be like hiring--I mean were there other hires like that?  You know, because--
Speaker 2: That was, that was, that was the nature of the beast, I guess.  I'll put it to you like that.  There are some people--
Speaker 1: That's the nature of the industry.
Speaker 2: I put it, I put it down to that at the time as simple competition, you know, a simple competitive mood--move.  Charles Warfield, I hired him, I think he worked for one of my auditors (laughter) at the time.  And I hired him basically as a, basically as an accountant.  And as he grew--I remember how he became general manager of the radio station.  And it was, there was a local organization of radio station general managers called NYMRAD, New York Market Radio Advertising [sic. New York Market Radio], whatever.  And it would have, we would have periodic meetings.  But it wasn't dynamic.  It was not a dynamic organization.  I know that because I had participated in a similar organization in Los Angeles [California], which was very dramatic, they were very active.  They would go out and en- enlargen the radio advertising pie.  This group in New York [New York] just, they didn't do that.  And I was very unimpressed with, and unwilling to take leadership of that, even if they would permit me to take leadership.  I didn't see that having a positive impact, therefore not worth my time.  And I said that I would, I was, I would resign--announce to the board that I was resigning, and my assistant general manager would sit in for me.  And they said, "Well, that's not, you know, that's not going to happen, because only general managers can sit here."  I said, "Okay, now he's the general manager."  And I came back to the office and told Charles he was the general manager (laughter).  Yeah, and that's how he became the general manager at that time.  It was perhaps whimsical.  But that doesn't--that's not to say he was not an effective general manager.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I'm just saying that's how that happened.
Speaker 1: But that's how he got in the business (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's how he became a general manager.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's how he got into the business.
Speaker 2: Into that side, supposedly just counting shekels, yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: And, so, now he helped put systems and things in place, right?  Or you had the systems in place?  I mean you were growing at such a rate you needed to have that, some of that infrastructure.
Speaker 2: Oh, unh-uh, no, no, no, I'm sorry.  He came in, he's relatively late in this thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean he's very late in this.  This thing, this was machined long before he got back.
Speaker 1: Okay, got you.  Okay, go ahead, okay.
Speaker 2: You know, there was a lady by the name of Dorothy Brunson who was the general manager.
Speaker 1: Yes, okay.  So can you talk about Dorothy (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was, Dorothy was a real go getter, largely a, again self-educated person who was just a very effective manager, a very effective manager.  And when she left us, we were all sad to see her go.  She went on to be a television station owner.  And I'm very proud of her to this day.
Speaker 1: And where did she--she went to own--
Speaker 2: Television properties [WGTW-TV, Millville, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: --property.
Speaker 2: Farther south.
Story_ID: 652609
Speaker 1: So I want to get back to the Apollo.  So at what point do things--when does 'Showtime at the Apollo' start?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I'm not really sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or how--what--I mean if it's not a date, why does it start?  Can you talk about--
Speaker 2: Well, because--well, why did it start?  Well, it was grown out of necessity, I think.  Here we have a perfectly good television production and post-production facility that is lying fallow.  Had to do something with it.  So why don't we put on our own show?  Others aren't coming here, we have to do something with it, and we did.  We put on 'Showtime at the Apollo.'  And one of the mainstays of that show was--what I enjoyed was the amateur hour. Because that's--when I was a kid the amateur show ['Amateur Night at the Apollo'] was a big thing.  When it was a stage without the television, the amateur hour was a big thing.  The contestants would come and touch the stump, and go on stage and perform their hearts out and be judged rather honestly by the audience (laughter).  I think it was the judging of the, the honest judgment of the audience that made it such an attractive feature of our show.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they said there's no audience like that Apollo audience.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes.
Speaker 1: That gave you cre- you know, street credence.  Or credence in the industry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, if you can pass that test, you know.  Michael Jackson did.  If you could pass that test, you're real.  It's a tough audience.  They can, they can sense if you're--your reality, you know, your commitment to your craft, your skill, your--and they'll let you know one way or the other if you're good.  If you're not good, they will let you know that.
Speaker 1: So there are--the people that are--Cheryl [Cheryl Sutton], your sister, was also helping, right, at the Apollo?  I mean who were the people that were running the--
Speaker 2: My sister, Cheryl, became--I don't know what the title is, but she was absolutely the boss of the Apollo Theater [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  She was director of operations but--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So how involved were you in it?  And how--what was the--you weren't, you weren't running it?
Speaker 2: I was not, I was not involved in that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I wasn't involved except for the very beginning in the show.  I was listed as a producer in the beginning, but I wasn't--my name came off at some point.  But I was, I did not have an involvement in the, in the production of that show beyond its very beginning.
Speaker 1: But the show helped, at some point the show is helping.  It may not, it may have been, it may not have been--did it become a money raiser at points?
Speaker 2: You know, it never made a dime.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: It never--you know that's the--that's the honest--because my cousin [Clifton Sutton] used to produce that show.  And I used to get into these arguments with him, not arguments, but I just--if you have a show as successful as this show was, that is your toe in the door.  That is the opportunity to produce shows.  Once you produce one, you can't produce shows.  And no television show lasts forever--reality.  You have to begin to produce other things.  And that was just never done.  And, so, you know, the way it goes.
Speaker 1: So 'Showtime at the Apollo,' it lasted though, I think it lasted what, nine years, ten years?  It lasted (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It had a good run, it had a good run.
Speaker 1: It had a good run, um-hm.  And it created--let's talk about some of the--I mean we had started to talk about Steve Harvey.  I mean it created a lot of careers that came out of--
Speaker 2: I can't give you names, I'm sorry with names.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But there were all the comedians.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, I mean every well known comedian.
Speaker 2: And everybody came through there, everybody did.  My oldest daughter [Keisha Sutton-James] who kind of grew up at the Apollo Theater, you know, just--she was a little girl growing up and seeing all the stars come through there, many of them, you know, to this day know who, know and like her.  Because she was that little girl that was always underfoot at the Apollo Theater.  She was, you know, she--her high school prom--she was taken to the high school prom by the leader of a group called A Tribe Called Quest  which was kind of interesting because he [Q-Tip] didn't wear a tie.  I tried to teach him how to tie a tie, and he was so uninterested (laughter).
Story_ID: 652610
Speaker 1: Now the other thing that you were getting involved with earl- you know, around the early '80s [1980s]--or your father [Percy Sutton] was.  And I'm wondering if you were involved with cable television.
Speaker 2: Ah, cable--
Speaker 1: Now were you involved with that or--
Speaker 2: Yes, I will say this.  Cable television was cool.  First, we were worried about how cable television was developed.  There was a town in Pennsylvania, a hilly town.  And it was, and a guy [John Walson] owned a store, an appliance store.  And he had all these televisions, televisions that he could not sell, because people could not get reception for them.  So he put up an antenna and he ran a wire down from an antenna on the hill down into the community and wires off of that wire that he ran down from the top of the antenna.  And that created something called CATV, Community Antenna TV, which later on became cable.  That's how cable started.  And the antenna, a single antenna serving a direct wire as opposed to the rabbit ears, if you will.  Cable TV was young.  My father was the borough president of Manhattan [New York] when cable was very, very young.  And he negotiated the, he was there and saw this developed.  To put it lightly, he just saw it develop.  And, so later on we negotiated for the, for Queens [New York], for the borough of Queens.  And we were successful in getting one third of Queens, which included the neighborhood I grew up in, which is kind of cool.  And cable was great.  It was a better way to receive television signals, clearer signals--just more consistent signals.  It was a better way for TV.  And we tried to do that in other, as in radio, we tried to do that elsewhere.  We went to Detroit [Michigan].  We went to Chicago [Illinois].  We went to D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  We went out west.  But we were never successful, and there are a lot of reasons why.  But we never, we never did not have the best product, I'll put it to you like that.  We always had the best engineering in our applications for those, for the opportunity to pro- to provide cable service in those communities.  We always had the best engineering.
Story_ID: 652611
Speaker 1: --Talk about some of the cable--
Speaker 2: Well, I'll just say that city politics can be very rough.  And in some cases, shock.  Money changes hands.  We would not do that, we just wouldn't play that game.  And, so of course, we lost.
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories out of Chicago [Illinois] or--
Speaker 2: Not that I'm going to--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --tell you.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  Or D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: I--Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], D.C., I can tell you the stories.  But I, you know--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: But I, you know.  Some of these players still live (laughter), you know.  (Laughter) But it's, really it's a, it's a rough game because there is a lot involved here.  A lot of money's involved in that franchising process.  And after all, once you got the franchise, it's like a utility.  Electricity, people pay for it automatically, like the roof over, over their heads--the telephone bill.  They pay for the, for that television to serve them well.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It's almost--because it is, you know, you're getting paid up front.  You can get paid at the beginning of the month.  You have to pay out the franchise fees to this.
Speaker 2: You pay out the franchise fee.  But I don't know how things are now.  But it is, but you're provid- you're required to provide community programming as well.  But the percent--I just got a tele- a cable bill which included a payment that I have to pay to the cable company for community programming.  Well, wait a second.  It used to be that I would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 2: I, if I owned the cable system, part of my job is to provide that for free to the community.  Now the customer is paying for that.  I--go ask your city government why that works that way now (laughter). I don't have the answers for that.  But it was a different game at first.
Speaker 1: I didn't know that was happening, but that's because they were--the city was u- the cab--anyway.
Speaker 2: In order to get it franchised (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --you had to commit to providing a certain amount of dollar--commit a certain amount of dollars to the production of community programming so that people could come in for free and produce programming, which you would air.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: But things have changed.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Story_ID: 652612
Speaker 1: So you end up with Queens [New York] being awarded in--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) let's say, '80s [1980s].  Well, okay, I won't ask dates.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But it, but it was awarded.  And, so does that come--are you--then does that fit under the radio station operations (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --or is that a separate--
Speaker 2: Very, very separate thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact we did that in partnership with some other icons.  Well, not icons, but Sid Small [Sydney Small] who owns WWRL [WWRL Radio, New York, New York] down the street, black man, and Gene Jackson [Eugene D. Jackson] who owned the National Black Network that they did in partnership.  We formed a partnership with them and the development of that Queens company, which I named by the way, QIUCS, Queens Inner Unity, Inner City Unity Broadcasting [sic. Queens Inner Unity Cable Systems, New York, New York].  It was silly, but that's what I named that.  I later went into and purchased the cable system serving Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], which is a tough town.  And there I came up with the name of the company being Urban Cable Works [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], a play on words meaning urban cable works.  So that was to be, that was the parent company, if you will, of that enterprise.
Speaker 1: And, so were you, were you successful in the award in Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we--
Speaker 1: You were?
Speaker 2: --we got that franchise.
Speaker 1: There was a black man there, too.  I forget his name, you know, who--
Speaker 2: That was Gene Jackson and was Sid Small (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was--oh, in Phila--
Speaker 2: In--
Speaker 1: There was another--no, no, there was another one who was buying.  Maybe he didn't get it or--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: There was, there was another.  I'm not talking--because I know Gene Jackson and Sid Small.  But no, there was, there was someone else.  But he wasn't--I--he may have gotten it and then lost it or something.
Speaker 2: I'm--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you, so you--so how successful were you as a cable operator?
Speaker 2: Not very.  I mean we were not able to grow beyond our borders.  Those two--
Speaker 1: Well, don't forget, many people didn't grow beyond their borders.
Speaker 2: No, no, it's very--it made a whole lot of business sense to get cable systems.  And there was a whole lot of money, buying cable systems.  So, you know, what--we can only consider ourselves lucky for having been able to dip our toe into that pond.
Speaker 1: Right.  But you know, in--but you also should consider yourself, is that you had a real deal.  Because there were a lot of fake deals going around.  Not buss- they were not business deals.  Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I mean, yeah, I'm--that--there were a lot of fronts that happened.  We call them fronts, and it's exactly the way they, and they, and it's alive and kicking to this very day.  We have people who don't really own what they appear to own.  But their name is on top, and they get compensated very well for their name.  Giving, giving you a non-black name, I'll say--give you an example of Donald Trump [President Donald John Trump], who you see all over New--his name you see all over buildings in New York [New York].  Does he own them?  No (laughter).
Speaker 1: It's a naming opportunity, he gives him the right to use it, that's right, that's right.  We--in fact I don't know if Matthew [Matthew Hickey] and I were talking about that.  Matthew, I think we were talking about--
Speaker 2: There are black guys like that, too.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, there are.

Speaker 1: Who was your partner? The president of Time Warner Cable at the time was--was it Richard Aurel- Aurelio, Aurelio [Richard Aurelio]?  That's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, he was one of the, he was one of the guy--
Speaker 1: Okay, who--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --was one of the higher ups in cable.  And I'm going to try to remember the chair at Time Warner at the time who was a lovely guy.  I can't, I just--I'm so bad with names. His wife was a great person, too.  It'll come back to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is the whole thing.  When you, but you go to Time Warner, though, to help out with the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York] at some point.  There's a deal that's made between Inner City Broadcasting [Inner City Broadcasting Corporation] and the Apollo, right?  Yes?  No?  No?
Speaker 2: No.  I go to Time Warner with a deal.  I'm sorry, let's go off because I'm having no recollection at all.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: In the cable business--
Speaker 1: In the cable business (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not in, not in the Apollo.
Speaker 1: But I thought that Time Warner, Time Warner--did they take over the--
Speaker 2: No--oh, okay, oh--
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is later (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay, okay, I got it now.  Okay, that's another--that is later.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's--okay, that's good, okay.
Speaker 2: All right.  Let me try to do the timeline here.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) okay, good, good, good.
Speaker 2: All right.  We--as I said, this is a very capital intensive business--building, putting these cables into the ground--and Manhattan [New York] is all underground and the, and the, and the outer boroughs is strung up on wires.  It goes underground (unclear) bringing them into every household, every building in the, in the community that you have the franchise for, very capital intensive, before you can make a dime.  Right.  We became partners ourselves and Gene Jackson [Eugene D. Jackson] and Sid Small [Sydney Small] became partners with Time Warner in our development of that Queens franchise [Queens Inner Unity Cable Systems, New York, New York], that's it.
Story_ID: 652614
Speaker 1: Now fast forward.  Years pass, okay.  Gene [Eugene D. Jackson] and Sid [Sydney Small], they sell WDAS [WDAS Radio] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  Gene and--there's a merger of the network, National Black Network and, National Black Network which had been Mutual Network--I'm sorry.  Ron Davenport [HistoryMaker Ronald Davenport]--
Speaker 2: Sheridan Broadcasting [Sheridan Broadcasting Network].
Speaker 1: --Sheridan, bought what had been Mutual Broadcasting Network--Mutual, Mutual Black Network, Mutual Black Network.  At the same time, Sid Small and Gene Jackson created the National Black Network, two competing radio networks.  At some point, they merged.  I'm sorry, let's not go there yet.  It wasn't until Sid, until Gene Jackson left altogether that Sid Small entered into the deal with Ron Davenport to combine the two networks into, into one network.  Gene Jackson by this time had cashed out of the Queens deal [Queens Inner Unity Cable Systems, New York, New York] and had, and had cashed out of business with Sid Small and moved to Africa where he reinvented himself.
Speaker 2: It was the African Ne- he did the African Heritage Network [sic. World African Network], I think there or started it, right?
Speaker 1: (Mumbles).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Gene Jackson was also selling palm trees.  I, you know, Gene Jackson was quite an entrepreneur.  Don't see much of him anymore.  But he--I understand he's very content.  I don't know much about him.  He comes into America very, so very seldom now.  And I don't, I don't, I haven't seen him in years now.
Speaker 2: So that, that's what happens.
Story_ID: 652615
Speaker 1: Now what I'm trying to understand--so you have the radio properties.  You cash out the--so you have the three markets.  Well, you, though, but you start picking up other markets, too.
Speaker 2: Well, sometime later we buy Mississippi and South Carolina.  We buy--don't ask me what year--but there was a notion that we should go public.  And you can't, you have to have a critical mass in order to go public.  And I, unfortunately I--there was such pressure from my shareholder base that I, that I got into the feeding frenzy, which meant buying radio stations.  I didn't need to, but it was--bought five or six radio stations by that time in Mississippi and five radio stations in South Carolina.
Speaker 1: So you then, you financed them, you had to go--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Stan- standard finance.  That--they didn't add that much--it just--when I say didn't add that much, it really didn't--they were, they didn't--
Speaker 1: Your top properties were already (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They--still, my anchor is in New York [New York] and California. And that's still--the amount of money that they throw off pay--makes those properties relatively insignificant.  I don't mean that those markets are themselves insignificant.   I'm talking about the amount of money that they throw off to our company [Inner City Broadcasting Corporation]--signif- you know, significant but not by comparison to New York and California.  Just the size of the, of the markets, that's all.
Speaker 1: So you--so are you saying, so there's pressure from the investors?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that doesn't, that doesn't work out until you can get some thirty, forty, fifty radio stations.  And that's not going to--you know, and the radio stations are becoming more and more expensive as people are (laughter), you know, saying, "Oh, we're going to buy."  So (unclear) you know, "Oh, no, I can't go for that anymore, I have to have this."
Story_ID: 652616
Speaker 1: Radio One [Urban One, Inc.] had started, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, early.
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) While--but I would--they had started when I was having to sell radio stations to keep the Apollo Theater [New York, New York] alive.
Speaker 1: Right.  So they come in.  They weren't a factor up until that point.
Speaker 2: And I couldn't--no--look, when I, when I bought Detroit [WLBS Radio; WPZR Radio], I talked with Cathy Higgins, [HistoryMaker] Cathy Hughes at the time about her managing the radio station in De- in Detroit [Michigan] for me (laughter),  you know, you know, yeah.  You--and here's a funny story.  We had made a deal, but then she wanted a fur coat, too.  I was, I was just, I should have given her the fur coat (laughter), yeah, you know.
Speaker 1: So then she be- I mean because they became a real, a real competitor.  I mean--
Speaker 2: I mean they became a real force in the radio business (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A real force in the, in the, in the--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --industry.
Speaker 2: While I'm trying to, you know, hold things together.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, my--the Apollo Theater was huge in terms of the impact it had on Inner Broadcasting as a radio company.  At some point, I split it off.  I had to split it off from Inner City Broadcasting [Inner City Broadcasting Corporation] because it was such a drain.  So I had a radio and cable business only.  And my father [Percy Sutton] and my cousins, they all have the Apollo Theater and all, you know, Apollo Theater records [Apollo Records] and all that stuff, because I could not finance Inner City Broadcasting with all that uncertainty business, if you will.
Story_ID: 652617
Speaker 1: So was that a difficult discussion with your father [Percy Sutton] 'cause, you know, he was moved by passion and politics?  And what was the potential?  Which is how, you know, the radio station had come about in the first place, too.  So was that a difficult discussion?
Speaker 2: Yes.  But ultimately it was, it was--(laughter) my father once told me that, "I'm--I will respond to a solid argument, not to emotion."  And I was very analytical in my approach to this argument.  And with great reluctance, I must say, he ultimately agreed that this had to be done.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And, so it was done.  But by that time much of the damage had been done.  I had, I had to sell those properties in California and in De- and in Detroit [Michigan], and that was, and it co- and it continued to be a real drain.  Because that money--I'm saying to you, I call it, the Apollo Theater [New York, New York], the black hole.  And I don't mean black from a black perspective.  I mean a hole into which a lot of money went, a lot of money to no--without any return on the investment.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It was in fact a labor of love.  It was his love and, you know.
Story_ID: 652618
Speaker 1: There were other things, that wasn't the only thing.  There was, there was, there was--my father [Percy Sutton] was a bit of a wildcat so, and it was, and he, and he had a dream.  My father was a man of great dreams.  And one of those dreams was in telephony.  I don't know if you know this or not, but those of us who have had the pleasure of traveling through Africa have found that communication is--has been very expensive.  If you were in a francophone country and you wanted to talk to someone in another francophone country, the phone call would go through Paris [France] and then re- be re-routed back.  Likewise, if you were calling from, you know, say, Kenya to another English speaking cou- country, the phone call would be routed through London [England].  There--the idea here was to create a satellite over, over--a geostatic satellite, if you will, over the continent of Africa which would re- relay signals up and down.  And so, there would be a telephon- rather, a satellite delivered telephony.  It made a lot of sense because actually at the time we calculated that there was less than 2 percent by capita penetration of telephony in the entire continent of Africa.  So there was a 98 percent opportunity.  I--a few tens of millions of dollars went into, into that--the promise of that, of that idea.
Speaker 2: So you're saying that much money from Inner City [Inner City Broadcasting Corporation] went into that idea (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Because of the potential?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  It was--
Speaker 2: It made sense.
Speaker 1: It just, you know, it made a lot of sense if you manage it and you go after it aggressively.  And you have to hire the right people.  There are a lot of variables involved.  But you know, you know, it's certainly possible, certainly within the realm of possibl- possibility.  And what better thing could we possibly do, being in the business of communication than to provide communication in the, on the continent of Africa?  What better thing could we de- devote ourselves to, hm?  An expensive proposition (laughter) as it turns out, but what better good could we possibly do?  Those--and that was major, but that's not the only thing.  As I said--may or may not have said--a lot of things were thrown at the wall, a lot of things that might have been app- a lot, a lot of money thrown at things on the wall that might have been applied to business of broadcasting, but were not.
Story_ID: 652619
Speaker 1: We're in the, I think in the '80s [1980s] still when all of this was happening.  In (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, my--yeah, my--
Speaker 1: Your father [Percy Sutton] joins in '87 [1987].
Speaker 2: In '80 [1980], in--he was--
Speaker 1: No, in '80 [1980], he joins in '80 [1980].
Speaker 2: In '80 [1980] to '90 [1990], he was in that one decade.
Speaker 1: Eighty [1980] to '90 [1990], um-hm.  So that's--those are the things where--
Speaker 2: Those are the cable years, if you will.
Speaker 1: The cable years, the Apollo years--
Speaker 2: And the Apollo years, yes.
Speaker 1: --and these other projects.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you know, I supported my father in ventures beyond, beyond and into the, throughout the decade of the '90s [1990s] as well.
Speaker 1: Nineties [1990s], right, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The Internet came along, and there's, and there were tremendous early opportunities in the Internet that were not developed well.  But you know, that's history.
Speaker 1: But your father was a visionary, though.  You have to give--I mean you had--
Speaker 2: You could follow my father anywhere, because the ideas were correct, the idea is, makes sense.  The Apollo Theater [New York, New York], it just--gosh, if you're, if youre normal you want to be able to--the prices are the same, maybe a little bit cheaper--but you want to produce your stuff at the Apollo Theater just for economic incentive.  But that didn't take into the really, the negative of it being in Harlem [New York, New York].  You--the idea of putting a satellite over, over Africa to put into effect a really solid means of tele- telecommunication for--telephonic communication in Africa--how do you argue with that?  Because by the way, it's very expensive to make those calls the way it was going, you know, back and forth from Europe.  But it was not--those things, you know, while they make sense--as I say, sit here and relate to you these tales--there are factors which rendered those possibilities impossible for us to do.
Speaker 1: But they set the groundwork.  I mean you were just thirty--I mean first of all you've laid the groundwork for the regeneration--regentrification of Ha--
Speaker 2: Regentrification of Harlem.
Speaker 1: Of Harlem, and--
Speaker 2: Certainly along 125th Street.
Speaker 1: Right.  And a hundred--I mean thirty years later, you're seeing the effects of what was sort of set in motion, thirty years later, um-hm.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Now what are the things going on?  What are the other things you're dealing with?  Because, you know, we talked about the--the '80s [1980s], the '80s [1980s]--okay, so the Apollo.
Story_ID: 652620
Speaker 1: In the '90s [1990s], you're dealing with the new telecom act [Telecommunications Act of 1996].  It comes into existence, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That really, that really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is there anything else that I'm jumping over?  Is there any--
Speaker 2: Well, no, the telecom act re- really just co- commoditized radio.  It just said no more rules, you know, laissez-faire, whatever you want to do.  Just go ahead, wild, wild, west.
Speaker 1: And this was really the Bush [President George Herbert Walker Bush] administration?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: A deregulation under Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Reagan started, Reagan started it, and then--
Speaker 1: And then it went all hog wild under Bush.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And I think--you know, is that--is [HistoryMaker] Michael Powell, Powell--no, was he--he made--was he at the FCC [Federal Communications Commission]at the--no, no, he came under Bush, Jr. [President George Walker Bush], but, yeah, he came under Bush, Jr.  But the thing is that--so this--the telecom act--explain what it says in the telecom act.
Speaker 2: I wish I could tell you.
Speaker 1: It says (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It says deregulation (laughter), you know.
Speaker 1: It says that you don't have to have--
Speaker 2: No regulations.
Speaker 1: --one station.  Everything can be owned by--
Speaker 2: Virtually every--it takes away all regulations on the ownership and, by the way, the operation of radio.  I mean you don't have to ascertain the community and you want to know what it--and submit yourself to the judgment of the FCC.  By the way, a number of people were empowered, got into the radio and television business because they were able to successfully challenge the owners, the white owners of those businesses because those owners had not properly serviced their communities.  And the FCC heard their arguments and transferred the licenses to those black entities or groups of individuals.  So we had to get rid of those rules.  I'm saying that sarcastically.  Those rules were dangerous to the status quo.
Speaker 1: You're talking about the tax certificate?
Speaker 2: No, the tax certificate was something that was very, very different.  That was one of the first things that was, I think it was Reagan who did that [sic.].  One of the first--oh, no, no, that was Newt Gingrich who did this.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: One of the first things that Newt Gingrich did was to get rid of the tax certificate which meant--by the way, which we never took advantage of.  The tax certificate in essence held that if an entity was transferred, was sold to a minority entity, a television or radio company, then the taxes on that sale would be deferred for a period of time.  Not that the taxes wouldn't be paid, but the taxes could be deferred, which had some economic value.  So that provided the opportunity, or the impetus, to some sellers to seek out minority buyers, because there was a tax advantage to--not a big thing.  Not that they wouldn't have to pay taxes, but that the taxes would be de- deferred, which was of some value to sellers.  And that would just about, I think that was the first thing that Newt Gingrich got rid of.
Speaker 1: Which affected--showed the purchase by mi- you know, minority stations (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Of selling to minorities.
Speaker 1: Of selling to minorities, because people could find all kinds of ways that they wouldn't sell.
Speaker 2: Well, there's no incentive to sell to blacks or other minorities (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 2: There's no incentive at all.  That provided some, and it was a brilliant idea actually.  Again, a name is--Reagan--I'm trying to remember, remember the name of the brother whose idea that was.  He's--again, I'm very bad with names.  But it was such a great idea.  And when we were able to have that tax certificate promulgated, it was a, it was a boon to the, to the ownership of media properties by minorities.
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2: And it was summarily removed--
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: --by Gingrich.
