Speaker 1: Alright, my name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMaker's archive.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Ma'am, can you give please give us your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Ayanna Howard, A-Y-A-N-[N]-A, H-O-W-A-R-D.
Speaker 1: Do you have a middle name?
Speaker 2: MacCalla, M-A-C-C-A-L-L-A.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there a story behind your name?  I know it's an African name.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  (unclear)
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Doesn't sound like she's (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay, I was asking you about your name, Ayanna.  I know it's an African name.  Is there a story behind that?
Speaker 2: So Ayanna actually means beautiful flower.  It's Swahili.  And the reason I was named that is when my parents, you know, I was about to be born--they wanted to come up with a name that was different enough that they thought would express what I would be.  And so they looked through a book and they, they come up with Ayanna.  I think it was because it was in the A part versus the Z part.  But that's how the name came about.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know today there's so many names.  Names are made up, you know.  But I know that's another thing.  I just wanted to make sure we, we talked about that.  Okay, and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: January 24, 1972, and I was born in Providence, Rhode Island.
Speaker 1: Okay, now we have that you were born in Altadena, California.  But--
Speaker 2: I grew up in Altadena, Calif.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you were born in Providence, okay.  All right, and, ma'am, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am a robotics engineer, but currently I'm a professor at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: And aren't you in charge of the robotics program?
Speaker 2: So I'm the chair of the robotics Ph.D. program, which is the, actually the first interdisciplinary program in the United States for robotics.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is April 15, 2011.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are in Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.
Speaker 1: And there's a specific thing about this room--I just want you to describe (unclear)--
Speaker 2: So this is my lab.  I'm also the director of the Human-Automation Systems Laboratory.  And so we are in a lab with robots at Georgia Tech.
Story_ID: 30769
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People Magazine-ish type questions that we ask as sort of a warm up, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is:  Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I do.  My favorite phrase is by William Faulkner, and it's "Dream bigger and do better than your predecessors.  Challenge yourself to move forward."
Story_ID: 30770
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side separately.  So we're gonna start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Johnetta MacCalla, J-O-H-N-E-T-T-A, M-A-C-C-A-L-L-A.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: September 24th--I'm not quite sure the year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In the forties [1940s] you think or in the--
Speaker 2: So she's in her sixties [1960s] so she was born--
Speaker 1: In the forties [1940s], I guess, yeah, 1940s.  Okay.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Monroe, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, now what do you know about the generations that preceded your mother on her side of the family?  What did your ancestors--
Speaker 2: I actually know a lot more about her side.  I know that I'm fourth college educated.  So my, guess, great grandmother and my great grandfather was a pharmacist, and this was just back in, you know, when things were definitely segregated.  So he had the pharmacy in the black side of town.  And there's a lot of stories about that.  And then my grandmother was a schoolteacher.  She went off to college when she was sixteen, seventeen.  And she did grad school in Atlanta [Georgia], Clark University.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, where did your great grandmother go to school?
Speaker 2: I believe it was Pierce (ph.) College, but don't quote me on that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay. And your grandmother, does--she's a teacher.
Speaker 2: She was a schoolteacher.
Speaker 1: Um-hum, and--
Speaker 2: And she actually majored in math.
Speaker 1: Now you can give their names, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, so I (laughter), so my--well, see, I know--so my grandmother's name is Mamu (ph.)--what is her real name?  Francis (laughter).
Speaker 1: Francis--
Speaker 2: Francis Reddix, R-E-D-D-I-X.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, all right.  So--and your mother went to--and she has to college, too, I take it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mom went to college, and she majored in math.  She was an applied math major as well.
Speaker 1: And where did she go?
Speaker 2: Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is, it's a pretty good family record for education.  And are there any stories behind, you know, how they got started?
Speaker 2: I think it was just back in the day they were open to social change.  And so education--and, you know, it started from way back then.  And so it just permeated throughout the family.
Speaker 1: So does your great grandmother's life go back to the turn of the century or how far back can you trace her?
Speaker 2: I couldn't even tell you.  So my grandmother is in her eighties, so my great grandmother would have probably been in her--
Speaker 1: Yeah, about 1900, I guess.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was probably born around 1900.  Yeah, if your grandmother's in her eighties, she was born in the '20s [1920s].
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Mother in the '40s [1940s].
Speaker 2: So around the turn of the century.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I think--now, did they all live in--where did your great grandmother--
Speaker 2: Louisiana, so they all--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So they all lived in Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Around Monroe?
Speaker 2: In that Monroe, Shreveport area.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Now there's--okay.  All right, okay.  All right, now are there any, any stories of what your family was doing back in the days before freedom and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: There are.  I don't remember any of them.  I remember I heard my--this would have been my great, great, great grandfather was a trader.  That's all I remember.  I think he had, he was part Native American.  But I'd heard he was a trader so he would grab goods and (unclear) resources.  And that's about the only story I've heard.
Story_ID: 30771
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what did your mother [Johnetta MacCalla] say about growing up?  What was it like growing up in Monroe?
Speaker 2: So my mom, she grew up in the Catholic schools so--and it was in--it was definitely segregated at that time.  And the reason, in fact, her and all her sisters went away from college, for college--they went away outside of Louisiana because the whole thing was that they, my grandparents wanted their kids to see something besides the South and experience, you know, a different era.  So they--all the kids went to schools in the North.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  What's your sense of what life was like in Monroe [Louisiana] for black people in, well, I guess, the twenties [1920s], '30s [1930s], '40s [1940s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so my sense was that--so I never got the horror stories about how you weren't, you know, supposed to go on the other side.  It just seemed like it was a community.  I mean I've heard stories about, you know, people just coming by and they needed, you know, something.  It was like, oh yeah, I have some food, you know, here it is.  Or, someone would come as like my, my daughter needs help in math.  And they didn't--my grandmother [Francis "Mamu (ph.)" Reddix] wouldn't even know this person--be like, oh yeah, come in.  So, my sense was that there was a very strong community back then.  People watched out for each other, other kids.  That was the biggest sense that I, that I got.
Speaker 1: Now, now was there was a certain part of town in Monroe that black folks lived in?
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter), which my side--in fact that's where my grandmother still lives--on the, the other side.  So I guess it's--there's Monroe and West Monroe.  So--
Speaker 1: So they're in West Monroe?
Speaker 2: They're in East Monroe.
Speaker 1: East Monroe.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Versus West Monroe.
Speaker 1: Is there a physical barrier that divides the sides of town?
Speaker 2: I almost want to say it's a railroad track, but--yeah, I think it is a railroad track that divides the two.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, so, so your mother went away to school to Brown.
Speaker 2: To Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And she majored in--
Speaker 2: Applied math.
Speaker 1: Applied math.
Speaker 2: She was an applied math teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did she go on to get a graduate degree?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So she went to Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California] and then she majored in engineering, I think, electrical.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's actually how we ended up in California.
Speaker 1: All right, now did she get a terminal degree in--
Speaker 2: Um.
Speaker 1: Ph.D. in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she has a Ph.D.--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California].
Story_ID: 30772
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, now that's--all right, now can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Eric, E-R-I-C, Conway, C-O-N-W-A-Y, MacCalla.
Speaker 1: McCallister.
Speaker 2: MacCalla, M-A-C-C-A-L-L-A.
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, MacCalla, okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: April 9th--ooh!--April 9th.  I forgot to call my dad.  I'm sorry.  April 9th--not sure what year, but he's early sixties [1960s] so a little bit--so I guess in the forties [1940s] in terms of the year.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, late forties [1940s].
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut.
Speaker 1: All right, now what do you know about the ancestors on his side of the family?
Speaker 2: So I do know--not as much.  I know my great grandfather came from Jamaica.  That's where MacCalla came from.  It was twisted--think it used to be M-C or McCallister and then when he came over it got changed at immigration.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And then from there it's mainly my great grandmother--who just passed away.  So she was a hundred.  And then my grandmother and grandfather--my grandmother was a nurse and my grandfather worked for the post office for--until he retired.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Are there any stories passed down about Jamaica or about coming over?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: Or even in the change of the name.  I know you just said (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was, that's actually the only story that I know, not--I don't know as much about his side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did they have relatives here already or--
Speaker 2: They--no, I think his was the first.  I think he moved here with his sister and brother at the time.  And I think that was the first generation that had come over.
Speaker 1: Did they serve as hosts for future generations to come over and--
Speaker 2: No, I think that was it, 'cause I don't know any like folks that came after him from, from there.
Speaker 1: Is there any--do they have any history with the Marcus Garvey movement, the UNIA [Universal Negro Improvement Association], or anything?
Speaker 2: I have no idea, have no idea.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I know very little about that side of the family.
Speaker 1: So I'm, I'm thinking they might have come over during that period of time, you know, during the--
Speaker 2: Oh, during that--
Speaker 1: --period of time when the UNIA [Universal Negro Improvement Association] was big in New York on the East Coast, like that, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, that would make sense.  That would make sense.
Speaker 1: But it didn't, doesn't have to be.
Speaker 2: (laughter) But that would make sense.
Speaker 1: A lot of the West Indian people were coming to (unclear) (simultaneously)--
Speaker 2: Okay, it was around that time, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, but--so there are no stories that you remember that have passed down by them at all?
Speaker 2: No, very, very little.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All I know is that my grandmother was--she kind of grew up a little difficult.  So she had been moved from home to home.  So I think that's why the connection isn't there because my grandmother didn't have a tight connection and so, of course, my dad didn't.  Therefore, I didn't, so--
Story_ID: 30773
Speaker 1: Okay, now what did your father [Eric Conway MacCalla] say about growing up?
Speaker 2: He said he had a lot of freedom, and he also grew up in a--so they sent him to a Jesuit school for his academics and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, he was very defiant is his stories.  So he got in trouble all the time.
Speaker 1: Hmm.  Did he say why?
Speaker 2: 'Cause he would question authority (laughter).  He basically thought he was smarter than everybody else.  But he's very intelligent, so, yeah.  So he would question, question a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there a story about a time he got in trouble?
Speaker 2: Um (laughter), yeah, so one time--this is, I guess, one of the, the priests, Jesuit priests was doing some type of problem on the board.  And, you know, my dad--I don't even think he raised his hand--but he basically said, "You're wrong."  And then, you know, the priest turned around and it's, you know--of course, you don't speak out, first of all.  And, you know, there was a exchange and, yeah, he got kicked out of the classroom (laughter).  So--
Speaker 1: So did they--did he go to several Catholic schools there?
Speaker 2: No, he just went to--
Speaker 1: To one.
Speaker 2: I mean in terms of--
Speaker 1: I mean if he got kicked out of this one, I was (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, no, he got kicked out of the, the classroom.
Speaker 1: Oh, but he's--not out of school.
Speaker 2: So he got sent to the--yeah, not out of school, not out of school, yeah.  The only thing--'cause he was the only--I do know he was the only minority student in, in the entire school, and so he had got in based on, they made him take a test and then he got in based on that, so--
Speaker 1: This was in Bridgeport [Connecticut].
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: This was in Bridgeport.
Speaker 2: This was in Bridgeport [Connecticut]. This was in Bridgeport.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So did he have a chance to go on to high, finish high school, go to college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he actually--that's where he met my mom [Johnetta MacCalla].  He went to Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: He was a good student, I would think.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, he was.  He was very smart.  He was just very contro-, but he's also the only one of that immediate side that, you know, quote unquote made it.  'Cause I think he was the most aggressive and basically if you told him he couldn't do it, that was a challenge for him to show that you were wrong.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what did he major in at Brown University?
Speaker 2: He was an engineering major.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did he go on to get a terminal degree, too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, same, Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California] and then USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California], so he has a PhD.
Speaker 1: Okay, right.
Speaker 2: And he was actually a Hughes Fellowship, so Hughes paid for his education.  Yeah, he was a smart guy.
Story_ID: 30774
Speaker 1: Okay. All right, now.  Okay, now is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: (laughter) Yeah, so, so my mom [Johnetta MacCalla] went to Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island].  At that time it had just changed over from a girls boys school--I forgot what the girl's school was.  And literally in her class there was maybe ten minority.  And so she felt coming from the South and coming from a very social, active family--she said this is a problem.  So her and her cohorts they came up with an--they still have it--which was called basically a weekend where you invite all the minority students together and you basically show them the campus.  So she and her cohorts started that program.  And the next year, which was class of '73 [1973], was the largest class that Brown ever had--in fact, it was the largest class until my class of '93 [1993].  And so she met my dad through that program.  Basically, he was one of the cohorts.  And his first year he needed a math tutor (laughter) and she volunteered to be his math tutor.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So she was successful and he was too, right?  That was--
Speaker 2: (laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: (They felt?)  That's good, that's good.
Story_ID: 30775
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you, when you think about our parents and their, their attitudes, their dispositions, their habits, their looks, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I take after my mom [Johnetta MacCalla] in terms of personality.  She's very calm.  She, she deals with conflict so that at the end everybody seems like they're happy.  But I take after my dad [Eric Conway McCalla] in terms of aggressiveness.  Don't tell me I can't do it 'cause that's a challenge.  So I think in terms of attitude and approach on my career, my life, it's definitely my dad.  But my approach toward people is definitely after my mom.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have siblings?
Speaker 2: I do.  I have a brother.  Don't ask me much about him, though.  He left home when he was sixteen so I don't know much about him.
Speaker 1: So he's still, still--so he left and never came back.
Speaker 2: He never came back.  Occasionally he'll call me out of the blue, you know, a blocked number.  So, I know he's in Washington, but that's about all I know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is he older than you or--
Speaker 2: No, he's younger.  He's younger by two years.
Speaker 1: All right, but you all--so your household growing up consisted of your mother, father, and you and your brother (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, until, yeah, until high school.
Story_ID: 30776
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So, well, tell me about growing up.  You, you grew up in California, right?
Speaker 2: I grew up in California.  I grew up in Altadena.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What's Altadena like?
Speaker 2: It's very--I would almost call it a outdoorsy type of environment.  So we lived right up against the San Gabriel Mountains.  So, literally, you wake up and it's just a mountain is your backyard.  And so growing up we would hike. There was waterfalls.  We would go up to the waterfalls.  Plenty of parks.  So very much a, a nature type of environment.  So it was very nice.  We, we lived in a--it was slightly mixed but majority--when I was growing up it was majority black.  But there was some, some mixture of families.  It was working middle class.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now we always ask this question:  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds.  So the sights were definitely the mountains.  That was always there.
Speaker 1: Did they have snow caps or where they just regular--
Speaker 2: No, they were just--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They had trees, so they were green and brown (laughter) depending on the time of year.  So those were the sights.  I can't even think of the smell.  It was tree smell at that time.  So fresh--it usually smelled fresh.  The best smell was after the rain, 'cause California has issues with smog.  And so you wouldn't notice the smell until after the rain.  And then when it rained it just smelled fresh.  So I guess before it wasn't fresh, but I just remember you, you could smell everything was crisp and clean.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sounds were birds.  That was the dominant sound.
Speaker 1: So the quiet (unclear) (simultaneously)--
Speaker 2: Oh very.  It was, it was a quiet place. It was quiet.
Speaker 1: The houses, I take it, weren't very close together, I don't--
Speaker 2: The homes actually had a lit--for California, they had a little bit of land.  So where I grew up my parents [Johnetta MacCalla and Eric Conway McCalla]--we were actually sort of a corner house.  And they had--it was about an acre.  So--and those houses--because it was just mountain, you couldn't do anything.  It was just mountains, so we're pretty kind of spread out.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I do.  My earliest memory was being in school and playing on the monkey bars.  That's my earliest memory.  Yeah, and I had a teacher who I really liked, and she was actually from India 'cause I remember she had a dot on her forehead.  So I thought that was so cool.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you go to a neighborhood school or--
Speaker 2: I actually went to a Montessori school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --up until kindergarten.  So I guess this would have been preschool or--yeah, preschool and kindergarten.  Then I skipped first grade and then went straight to second.
Story_ID: 30777
Speaker 1: Okay, now what did your parents [Johnetta MacCalla] and Eric Conway McCalla] do for a living?  They both had Ph.D.s, and this is a good situation, sounds like.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well they decided--again, I think this was my dad [Eric Conway McCalla] that--so they started--like my dad had a Hughes fellowship.  So when he first got out they started working for Hughes and within a year they both realized that they weren't going to get anywhere in the company.  They just didn't like the structure.  I think my dad didn't like the authority.  So they started their own business.  So they--and that's when, you know, they packed their bags and, yeah, started their own business in the basement of the house.  It was a little cellar that we had in the house.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what kind of business did they start?
Speaker 2: At that time they were making--they're called switches.  So at the time when computers were coming out companies were--in order to go from printer to printer, you literally would have to plug in a printer into your computer and, if someone else wanted to print, they'd have to go to that one computer.  And so they wanted to create a device where all you would do is--it's, it's almost like what we have now where you can have a network.  So it was the early stages of a, of a networking system.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so this switch you can hook up, you know, n-number of computers to this switch and you would just turn the switch and you'd have access to the resource--the printer in this case or whatever resource that the switch was connected to.
Speaker 1: Hmm, okay.  What, what, when was that--was that in the late seventies [1970s], eighties [1980s], or--
Speaker 2: That would have been late seventies [1970s].  Let's see, so I was born in '72 [1972] so this would have been early eighties [1980s] maybe.
Speaker 1: Early eighties [1980s].  Okay, all right.  That's when the, the small computers, I mean the personal-size computers started--
Speaker 2: Exactly, were coming out.
Speaker 1: --making their appearance.  'Cause before that time, for the sake of the audience they were like huge mainframes--
Speaker 2: They were huge mainframes, so--
Speaker 1: --with punch cards.
Speaker 2: --early eighties [1980s] is when personal computers were coming out and operating systems.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So they, they--what was the name of their business?
Speaker 2: It was called Automated Switching and Controls.
Speaker 1: Okay, and does it still exist?
Speaker 2: It actu-, it does.  It's not Automated Switching--it's gone from that.  So now they work on communications systems for transportation--so like railroads.  So some of the same kind of concepts, but for the transportation industry.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Well that's, okay, that's interesting.  So this--so they've had their own business now since the eighties [1980s].
Speaker 2: Yeah, so twenty plus, thirty years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That, that's probably a--that's a different situation than a lot of people find themselves, especially in a high-tech business, high-end, you know, business.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was--yeah, I was exposed quite early to just stuff around the house.
Speaker 1: And you have two engineers to explain to you what--
Speaker 2: (laughter) What's going on--
Speaker 1: --what's going on.
Speaker 2: --to help me with homework (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's right.
Story_ID: 30778
Speaker 1: So these--now, I mean, when you look back on it, this is quite an advantage.
Speaker 2: Oh it is.
Speaker 1: But do you realize now, I mean, at the time you probably took it for granted that everybody's parents can help them with advanced math and (laughter)--you know.
Speaker 2: And I think what the biggest advantage was--exposure to information.  Because there was a lot of--I went to--you know, my parents [Johnetta MacCalla and Eric Conway MacCalla] never made any money at the business--a living.  So I went to public schools all my life.  And the public schools were in black neighborhoods.  And so there was certain situations that I do remember where they didn't want to let me do certain things.  And my parents were like, no, that doesn't make any sense.  And I think it's 'cause they had the information like, wait, this doesn't make sense, and so they would challenge--in education they would always challenge the teacher, the principle, in order to get things done.  So, for example, I took geometry in the seventh grade because I--that was--I was ready for it.  But that was a challenge 'cause, you know, geometry wasn't offered at the school.  So, just little things like that.
Speaker 1: Those are very important--
Speaker 2: Oh, they are.
Speaker 1: --things to have a parent that's--that can understand what's going on in the school and--
Speaker 2: Right, and feel confident enough to challenge it.
Speaker 1: Right, and I think your parents probably knew more than the average person who challenges the school.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this is a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so.
Speaker 1: --it's quite a, yeah, quite an advantage, quite an advantage to have.
Story_ID: 30779
Speaker 1: And so, okay, so now when you were growing up what were some of the influences around you in popular culture?  What did you--now I know television, I guess, was big.
Speaker 2: (laughter)
Speaker 1: I just don't know.  What else was cool, what was going on?
Speaker 2: Michael Jackson, Duran-Duran.  You know, in terms of clothes, it was colors, so you would wear different colors that were mix-matched, be a, a high-top fade, Kid 'n Play--these were the things that were--grew up with.  Beginnings of rap were, was during my generation, what we consider--like the rap now is not rap.  But back then it was conscious rap where there was a message that was being told in, in the songs and the words.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your favorites in those days?
Speaker 2: So--believe or not, I like Public Enemy back in the day.  I mean, some of their songs are a little edgy, but they definitely had a message about just the state of affairs in United States, the state of affairs with black folks, and all of that.  So, I also liked Queen La--well, not Queen Latifah--before Queen Latifah, the precursor to Queen Latifah. I can't remember her name.
Speaker 1: I know who you're talking about [Sister Souljah].
Speaker 2: And she was like the first female rapper--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --and I liked her.
Speaker 1: KRS-One.
Speaker 2: Oh, KRS, yes, KRS-One.  Oh, yeah, he was awesome.  He was awesome.  So, yeah, yeah.  Well, it was some good music then.
Speaker 1: Okay, we have to pause here to make a notation.
Story_ID: 30780
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we can't think of this one person's name [Sister Souljah], but we will think of her.
Speaker 2: (laughter)
Speaker 1: But she was like the--she was a small person.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And she was--
Speaker 2: She was a precursor--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to the female rappers.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right. That really powerful speaker.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Speak around the country.
Speaker 2: She was great.
Speaker 1: These are the days when videos hit the screen for the first time and the early days--
Speaker 2: Yes, MTV [Music Television] actually had started.  And even then it was--even some of the videos they won't--they wouldn't show.  But my generation, they actually started showing the very first, you know, R and B [rhythm and blues] and rap videos for the first time.  And MTV, though, you couldn't get unless you had cable, and nobody had cable then.  So, you'd have like the one kid who had cable and everybody (laughter) goes to that house to watch and basically the (easy?) situation.
Speaker 1: So, did you all have cable at home?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, we didn't have cable.  No, we didn't have cable.  We actually didn't.  So the gadgets we had in the house were things like wires and circuits.  We didn't have--and computers, but we didn't have, you know, the cable or the, you know--we had the tape deck, not the--the record player, you know, not the cassette, and got the cassette when everybody else was moving on.  I remember an eight-track, we had an eight-track in the home.  So, in turns of consumer products, our house wasn't very much in gadgets.  But in terms of the things needed to build the products--full of it.
Speaker 1: I thought of it--Sister Souljah.
Speaker 2: Yes!  There it is.
Speaker 1: Sister Souljah.
Speaker 2: There it is.  You remembered!
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh yeah (laughter).  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And she was, she was, she could have been no taller than me.  I mean, she was a--yeah, petite.
Speaker 1: I love the (unclear), yeah, those were the days with, you know, KRS-One and the--
Speaker 2: KRS-One, Curtis Blow, Salt-N-Pepa, yeah.
Speaker 1: So those--I think they got together--I remember one song they got, they all got together on this one song and they kind of--and they talked about stopping the violence in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the communities.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I think that was when--'cause up until that time it was mainly East Coast rappers.  And when 'Stop the Violence' came, West Coast rappers were starting to make a name for themselves.  And I remember 'Stop the Violence' was the first time that had on the same song West Coast and East Coast and didn't--you know, in the same field together.
Story_ID: 30781
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, now was church a part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I grew up in the Catholic Church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we would go--and I went through communion and confirmation.  So I have a confirmation name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I grew up Catholic.
Speaker 1: So what was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: It was called Saint Andrews.  It was in Pasadena [California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My confirmation name was Athanasius for the Saint Athanasius.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had to take on for--for confirmation you were supposed to take on a new name after a saint.  So--and Athanasius was the only saint I can find that had any association with Africa (laughter).  So, that was who I chose.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was that a chord in your household to be relate--you know, to have some sort of connection to Africa, or black conscious--
Speaker 2: Well, to have connection to black, yeah, that was definitely, you know--we had the big--yeah, you know, during that time you would buy the big emblem with the Africa label.  I--that was, that was what we did.  That was what everybody did.
Speaker 1: We had the medallions with the cutout of Africa with the red, black, and green and--
Speaker 2: Yes, that was, that was just what you did.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So Pasadena was close by--
Speaker 2: Yes, so Altadena [California] is, I mean, they're smack dab next to each other.
Story_ID: 30782
Speaker 1: Now there's a--I know the history of black people in Pasadena [California] and going back to Jackie Robinson and all that.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did they talk about that?
Speaker 2: So Pasadena has a lot of historic names.  And so we have the Jackie Robinson Center, for example, which is a local park and recreation kind of thing.  There's--so Pasadena has the Rose Bowl and the story it is that when the Rose Bowl was built they had, you know, basically all of the lucrative families would move in.  And so their servants used to be black.  But their kids, who had a better life because they had, you know, working parents, became the middle class of Pasadena.  So very early on there was a, you know, middle class of African Americans in Pasadena that came from that first generation of people who worked in the home and then sent their kids off to college.  So that was very on, very, very early on.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Pasadena was an affluent white community class at one time.
Speaker 2: Right, and as a derivative you started having an affluent black community as well--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --so a middle class.
Story_ID: 30783
Speaker 1: Okay, now so you started school.  What the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: First school was Loma Ala, Loma Alta Elementary School [Altadena, California].
Speaker 1: Okay, and--okay, so, I take it you liked school.
Speaker 2: I did.  I liked school, yeah.  I enjoyed--I was the teacher's pet, which I actually got joned about by my friends, but, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now was this a mixed school or did you--or was it--
Speaker 2: It was majority, it was--so elementary was majority African American.  Junior high school is when they started busing.  So my junior high school and high school was mixed 'cause they bused the predominant majority kids (chuckle) to the black schools.  So that was when busing had, had started and it was in full effect.  Now they don't do that.  But then they were trying to institute busing.
Speaker 1: Now you were a teacher's pet.  Now did you have any pet teachers, any favorite teachers that--in elementary school?
Speaker 2: I did.  And for--right now I can't even remember her name.  But she was my fourth grade teacher.  And then she transferred to fifth grade, so then she became my fifth grade teacher.  And she would invite me to her house, and I became best friends with her--when--it wasn't her daughter, it was her granddaughter.  So when her granddaughter would come into town--her granddaughter didn't live with her and didn't go to the school.  But when her granddaughter would come into town, she'd call and say, "Hey, my granddaughter's in town.  Do you want to come play?"  So I would come and play with her granddaughter and things like that.  So--and I kept in touch with her for, for a good many years.  And then she got sick and actually passed away when I was in early college.
Story_ID: 30784
Speaker 1: Okay, now the era you grew up was a big movie era, a lot of--I mean, for sci-, especially for science fiction movies.  A lot of things--'Back to the Future' and 'Star Wars,' all these--
Speaker 2: 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek' and--
Speaker 1: 'Star Trek' on TV and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: 'Battlestar Galactica.'
Speaker 1: Now were you interested in those movies and--
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved the movies.  I wasn't star struck, but I loved the movies.  I love watching 'Star Trek.'  I love watching 'Bionic Woman,' 'Wonder Woman,' 'Battlestar Galactica.'  So anything that had a sci-fi in it, you know, 'Star Wars'--not the new ones, the old ones, the original ones.  So all of those were, they're good to watch.
Speaker 1: Okay, now we have a note here that the 'Bionic Woman' really made a big impression on you.
Speaker 2: It did.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: So back in the day in--so in middle school, one of--and they still do this now--you know, that's the time when everybody's asking, you know, what do you want to be?  What do you want to be when you grow up?  What do you want to be when you grow up?  And I had no idea.  Actually did not originally want to be an engineer because, you know, my dad [Eric Conway MacCalla] was.  So I was like I don't want to be what my dad is.  But I was into sci-fi and 'Bionic Woman' at that time they were starting to show very powerful females in, you know, good roles, not as, you know, subservient.  And so 'Bionic Woman' was about this one woman and she would have been in a car accident, and they put her together.  And they put her together and she was out saving the world.  So she was this--she was beautiful, but she could, you know, save everybody.  And I thought it was so cool.  And when I saw that I was like, you know, oh, it would be so cool to build a bionic woman.  So when everywhere I was like I want to build a bionic woman.  That's what I wanted to do.  And so at that time I thought that meant I need to go to medical school 'cause the people who have created the bionic woman, they were doctors.  There were some doctors and there were some scientists, but, you know, that was what her team consisted of to work with her.  So I wanted to build a bionic woman.  So I wanted to be a medical doctor when I first started off.
Speaker 1: Okay, about how old were you when you--
Speaker 2: That was definitely middle school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was middle school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you know, seventh, eighth grade.
Story_ID: 30785
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now where did you go to middle school?
Speaker 2: I went to Eliot, Eliot--it was actually Eliot Middle School, also in Pasadena [California].
Speaker 1: All right.  Did you have any mentors there?
Speaker 2: So (pause) not really.
Speaker 1: Now this is a school you were bused to?
Speaker 2: No, so this was in a predominantly black neighborhood, so the other kids were bused.  So the majority kids were bused to the school.
Speaker 1: Well, that's interesting.  I, I haven't heard about that--
Speaker 2: It was different.  It, it was different.  We call them the Sierra Madre kids.  So it was like, oh, the Sierra Madre kids are here, 'cause Sierra Madre kids were the ones that were bused.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They weren't actually from, you know, the core Pasadena.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you didn't have a--no teachers took a special interest in you at all, huh, in middle school?
Speaker 2: Not in middle school, not really.  I mean, I was a good a student.  And I've always been a quiet student, so it wasn't, you know--it was like, oh, there's a smart kid.  They knew they didn't have to worry about me, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now you said, you said there earlier that your parents [Eric Conway MacCalla and Johnetta MacCalla]  had to go to the school and--in middle school to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in middle school--
Speaker 1: --make sure that you took geometry or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so what happened was when I first started I had--so even in elementary I was accelerated at math, so--and, of course, it was from a very early age--my first computer was in the third grade.  And I remember trying to--I got this little manual--I don't know, I think it was my dad's [Eric Conway MacCalla] office, and I was like, oh, what is this?  And I--so I actually started programming in the third grade.  And I didn't know what I was doing but started programming.  So elementary I was--I knew math, I liked math.  So the teachers would give me extra assignments.  So by the time I was in middle school, you know, they're supposed to go into sixth grade math.  And my parents like, no, she knows this.  She needs to be in--at that time she'd need to do algebra.  And they were like, well, no, she can't do algebra 'cause she's not in, you know, at that time she wasn't in the right grade.  So they said, well, give her whatever you need to do.  And they gave me an exam to basically place out of sixth grade math.  But what they gave me was the final of the algebra exam, which, of course, you know, little ways of trying to dissuade you.  And I think I got like a C or something.  And so, you know, they were like, well, she doesn't know the stuff.  And my parents came and said this is algebra.  She got a C for a course she's never taken, you know.  And so they basically, you know, sat down, closed the door, and then next thing I knew, it was a week later I was in, you know, the algebra class.  Now some of these stories are like years later, like, you know, you just know your parents--
Speaker 1: But you're saying that they had an algebra class in that school, but they wouldn't let you take it.
Speaker 2: Take it, right, because you weren't supposed to take it until the eighth grade.  And so--and then what happened with geometry is they didn't have geometry because that's ninth grade.  And so my parents were like, well, she has to take math.  What is she supposed to do?  And so they had to argue that I actually had a special section so--in the algebra class I would sit in the back of the room and I would work with the geometry.  So they made--got a book in geometry and I had to self-teach myself geometry.  So--
Speaker 1: The teacher would check with you, write problems and--
Speaker 2: Right, they would check.  She would, she would give me the assignment and say, okay, you need to work on, you know, chapter one, and then I would do it.  She'd grade it.  And so, you know, it was a self-taught geometry.  And actually that is the one course I don't like (laughter) is geometry.  Even now, it's like, oh, I don't like geometry or trigonometry (chuckle).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: (WHISPERED VOICE):  Now it's go--it's coming in.
Speaker 1: So were you--
Speaker 2: Stopped, I think.  Okay, never mind.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were you, were you bored at all in sch-, in gra-, in school.  I mean, did you--
Speaker 2: No, I was never bored.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I was never bored.  Yeah, I was never bored.
Speaker 1: Now what about the other subjects?  Did you like, you know, social studies and reading and--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't like reading.  I didn't like history.  These were all necessary evils.  And actually I have a story about history in high school.  I liked science.  I did like science.  I liked computers.  At that time they were starting to offer computer classes.  And, you know, it wasn't programming.  It was usually the Excel version of whatever was back then.  They used, I think, Windows 3.1 or DOS or something.  So you learned commands and things like that.  So I liked those courses.  And I liked sports.  So I liked gym (chuckle).
Story_ID: 30786
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you play any sports in--
Speaker 2: In high school I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In high school I, I played, but, yeah, not in--I don't even know if they had a team in middle school, but--yeah, not in middle school.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, all right, so now what--where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: John Muir High School, and, again, in Pasadena, California.
Speaker 1: Okay, a name from the great naturalist, right--John Muir?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you say you were raised in this nice, fresh--
Speaker 2: (laughter) outdoorsy--
Speaker 1: Outdoorsy environment.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --at John Muir High School.  Yeah, now did your family travel a lot when you were coming up?  Did you take trips around the country?
Speaker 2: Not around the--well, let me rephrase that.  Typically, we would have a summer trip somewhere we would drive.  So they liked going to museums.  So we would drive up the coast, stop somewhere, go to whatever local museum or cave or, you know, what the landmarks-- Hearst Castle, things like that.  So we would do a trip a year.  So that was a lot of the traveling that we did.  And occasionally we would go to Louisiana.  So in the summers my parents [Eric Conway MacCalla and Johnetta MacCalla] would ship us off to Louisiana for a few weeks.  Now I understand it was to get (laughter)--get us out of their hair.  It was fun to me, you know, went to the grandparents.  So that was always fun.
Speaker 1: Okay, just for few weeks right or--
Speaker 2: So that was the traveling outside California.
Speaker 1: Now did you ever go down to the East Coast to (unclear)--
Speaker 2: To Bridgeport [Connecticut].  We would go there on Thanksgiving maybe once every few years--not a lot, not a lot of time.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Did you ever do any travel outside the country when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: No, not at all.  My first trip was after--well let me rephrase that.  So Mexico is a two-and-a-half hour drive from--so we would go to Tijuana [Mexico].  And that was before you had to have passports, driver's license (chuckle), to cross the border.
Story_ID: 30787
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in high school [John Muir High School, Pasadena, California], now were there any special teachers or mentors in high school?
Speaker 2: So, in high school my favorite teacher was actually the physics teacher.  And she's the one that encouraged me to think about engineering.  Again, even though my dad [Eric Conway MacCalla] was an engineer, you know, I didn't want to do that 'cause it was my dad.  And so she identified that I had, you know, I always was good at math.  And she was like, "you know, you're really good at math and computers.  You really should think about engineering."  It was like she want me to have those engineering.  She's like, no, I mean if you should--you know, it always takes a--so, you know, you don't listen to your parents a lot of times.  And so she was like, "you know, just--it doesn't matter.  You can always change.  If you don't like it, you can always switch, you know.  You should think about engineering."  And I know my dad was so happy when I said okay I'm gonna think about engineering.  He was like, okay (chuckle).  I know he was tickled pink.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay, would you consider your mother [Johnetta MacCalla] an engineer, too, or was she--
Speaker 2: She is an engineer, but she's much more of a computer scientist.  Even though her degree is in engineering, she is a computer scientist deep down.  And I think it was because her early training was in math, in applied math.  And applied math was computer science before it--you know, computer science didn't exist then.  So she was a computer sci-, I mean, even now she programs, that's what she does.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, now, did you do the typical high school things in high school?  You know, did you become part of student government or did you work with a newsletter or--
Speaker 2: I, I joined a club.  So I joined our--we had a outdoors club.  So--which is we would hike in the spring and go skiing in the winter.  And so what we'd do is we would sell stuff like cookies and--so we could have enough money to do these trips.  So that was the outdoors club.  I also joined--it wasn't called student government.  It was an organization to beautify the school.  So we would do fundraisers to have things like cleanup day or, you know, we wanted a, a banner made that says "John Muir."  And so it was things to do to pretty up the campus.  We needed a new--the bell--we had a bell.  Most schools have these bells, and ours was very old.  So we wanted to get it clean and it cost so much money.  So, okay, let's put on a fundraiser to do this.  So those kind of activities.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the high school kind of lived up to its name in terms of--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  High school was--
Speaker 1: --the environment and that sort of--
Speaker 2: I liked high school but not a hundred percent.  High school was when you definitely have classes of folks.  So you had--so my school was a sports school.  If you didn't--if you weren't part of the track or football or basketball, you were pretty much--there was that and then there was the others.  And then in the others there was the geeks, so I was part of the geeks.  And then there was the ones who did the plays and choir.  So it was definitely a class system in it.  And so sometimes it was good, sometimes it was bad.  I remember, you know, I would take the public school bus.  And, you know, on the negative side is, you know, I'd be sitting there and you have all this noise.  On the positive, if anyone ever messed with me, you know, you'd have the popular kid go, don't mess with her.  She's too smart, you know.  So it was like a negative, but then it was like, you know, I was not the one you're supposed to mess with.  And it--I think it was because at that time if you looked at all of the geeks, I was probably like the one or two dots in the geek section.  And so I was like the, I was always the smart one.  I was the--you know, she's the smart one.  She's okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, now it--now this is a mixed school, right, in terms of the population--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What would you--what was the racial makeup of John--
Speaker 2: Oh, it was probably 10 percent Asian, probably 30 percent white and then 60 percent black.  So that was, that was about the ratio.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So--
Speaker 2: And now it's about 40 percent Hispanic and 60 percent black.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The whole concept of being a geek or a nerd or something seems to be, it seems to be like something out of white popular culture rather than black popular culture.  And did, did you, did other black folks refer to you as a geek or a nerd or--
Speaker 2: No, I was just the smart one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was (laughter), that was my name.  She's a smart one.  Yeah, she's a smart one.  You know, don't mess with her, she's a smart one.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there was some respect for--
Speaker 2: There was definitely some respect.  There was some--definitely, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I wasn't popular, but everybody knew who I was.
Story_ID: 30788
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, so you began in high school [John Muir High School, Pasadena, California] to seriously consider becoming a engineer.
Speaker 2: Yes, definitely, especially after I took biology.  So I took biology as a freshman, and I absolutely hated it.  I just di-, I just didn't vibe.  It was like the one science I just didn't get.  I didn't like doing the frog stuff.  I didn't, you know--and that was the one thing that you're supposed to do in order to go to med school.  And I thought, oh my gosh, how am I gonna do this bionic woman thing?  And so that was why the whole concept of, you know, what do I do in order to get to the next step.  And, you know, my teacher saying, well, maybe you should think about, you know, this career thing, you know, give it a shot, you know.  It was a good, it was a good move.  It was a good move.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now were you a member of the National Honor Society and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so the way that at California works is you have--so there is the SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test] and then we had--and I think it's everywhere--but in California we had something called the PSAT [Pre Scholastic Aptitude Test], which was an early exam.  So you could take it at any time.  And so I had taken it in the, the ninth grade and had scored--what happens is, if you score at the top, you know, x percent of the state, you become this National Merit Scholar.  And so I had scored at the top, and I don't remember, maybe 10 percent of the state for the exam.  So, became a National Merit Scholar.  It doesn't, it doesn't really necessarily mean anything except you can put it on your, your resume and your college applications.  So and then I was, I wasn't valedictorian.  I was salutatorian because I did not take the honors history.  I took the regular history and, and the regular government, and the teacher did not like my viewpoints on--my political viewpoints.  So she gave me a B.  My only B was in the regular class.
Speaker 1: Well, how did you--what were your political viewpoints and how did they differ from the teacher?
Speaker 2: So at that point there was a--if you remember military was pretty strong then.  And so they had come up with a system, Star Wars, which was a system.  So Star Wars was--
Speaker 1: --was Ronald Reagan's [U.S. president 1981-1989] defense system with the satellites.
Speaker 2: Right.  And I thought it was fascinating.  You know, I--my thing was this seems like a very good thing.  It's like it allows you to shoot down the missiles, you know, before they hit the United States.  It just seemed brilliant.  And so, you know, I wrote the--I--basically, I was for it.  You know, I wrote the pros and so I was--I had a pro--I guess you would have considered a pro-military view.  I just looked at it as this is good technology, and it makes sense.  And so, and so all of my papers had this--now I guess you would call it pro-military--but then it was about the technology 'cause that's when they were starting to do a lot of the technology and putting it into--and military was what's paying for it.  So all the good technology was in the military.  So it was like, oh, here's another good technology.  And so, yeah, she didn't appreciate any of my viewpoints.  She didn't see the value of--so, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's interesting 'cause I would have, I would have thought that you had been left of your teacher, but you're actually right of your teacher (laughter) on--
Speaker 2: (laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, as I remember correctly, and I, well, correct me if I'm wrong.  See, and you probably know more about it then than I knew about it then, but the, the critique of it was that it just, it wasn't possible to do anyway at that time.  So he was wasting money.  That's how it was--
Speaker 2: That's, that was the biggest thing.  And I thought that that was not a valid reason.  And it's only because, you know, as a technologist--even then I was, I, you know, you don't call yourself that at that age, but as a technologist even now, it's like cost--don't think about cost.  Can you get it done?  And then figure out, okay, now can it be done at a reasonable cost, else we'll never get anything done.  And so then my philosophy is like--it can be done.  It made sense.  You know, I looked at the--you know, I evaluated it.  It made--all the components seem to make sense.  So, yeah, it could be done.
Speaker 1: When you look back on it now, is it something that--I mean, we're further along now than we were in the '80s [1980s]--
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: --but, but does it, do you think it made sense when you look back on it?
Speaker 2: So we could not have done it then.  Now we could without, I mean, without an issue at probably reasonable cost.  But then, you know, it's, it probably was not do-able based on our current state of knowledge of--
Story_ID: 30789
Speaker 1: Now what--how is your family, I guess, politically oriented?  I mean in terms of--'cause I know here they give you an African name and, you know, it gives me some sense of it, but I'm not sure--how does the, the issues for black folks in the '80s [1980s] or largely what they are now and were before and a lot--they haven't really changed that much.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, was Ronald Reagan [U.S. President 1981-1989] seen as a hero at your home or--
Speaker 2: (pause) Not necessarily.  Maybe in a, maybe in the first era, 'cause he did, he did--I mean, Reagan was a weird one 'cause, you know, he came--he was an actor.  So, if you look at his viewpoints, at his, you know, first term, they were a little bit different and his rules and how he did things was slightly different than in his last term.  And, of course, you know, they say the reason was because he really--last term he really wasn't doing the stuff.  He was being directed.  But you can actually see there was definitely a change in the things he did from first to the second.  And so I think in the first term my parents [Eric Conway MacCalla and Johnetta MacCalla] were probably--not all of them, but some of them--and it--well, my--and my parents actually say that, as business people, most business people have Republican viewpoints.  It's only on the social issues that most black folks are Democrats.  In, in terms of if, if you are a businessman, if you are a black business owner in America, a lot of your viewpoints are Republican if it deals with the finances.  But the social issues, such as, you know, planned parenthood and things, are definitely Democratic.  And so typically we make a decision.  We're like, well, we're gonna go with the social issues, so we'll be Democrats.  But, you know--and so I think at that time as business owners my parents, you know, they would, they wouldn't call themselves Republicans or Dem-, in fact, I think they called themselves Independents because it was like I'm going to vote on the law, and I'm going to vote on the person that has the most, that makes the most sense based on what I believe, and not just because they're a Democrat or Republican or something else.
Story_ID: 30790
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, okay.  Now, now when you were in high school [John Muir High School, Pasadena, California] you had some exposure to some real--didn't you do some work with a jet propulsion laboratory in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, in--not in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: High school I actually got a summer position at Cal Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So my actually junior and senior year I worked at Cal Tech [California Institute of Technology].  I worked with a lady who I still keep in touch with.  And she was, she did some things in grants and development, but I was hired to work on computer programs for her.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so your senior year at John Muir [High School] you worked at Cal Tech [California Institute of Technology]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually after my junior year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, as soon as I turned sixteen (chuckle) and I was legal to work.  And I worked at Cal Tech [California Institute of Technology].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  (unclear)
Speaker 1: Okay, so did--you graduated from high school what year?
Speaker 2: I graduated in 1989.
Speaker 1: 1989, okay.  We're gonna take another short break.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 30791
Speaker 1: Each summer in Cal Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, for two, for two summers.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And you were, what were you doing again?  You were--
Speaker 2: Basically, you would call it database programming now.  But at the time I was writing mini programs to manage their data.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now by the time you were a senior now did you, did you have yourself pretty much aimed at being a engineer--
Speaker 2: Actually I was gonna be, I was gonna do robotics.  By then I was gonna do robotics.
Speaker 1: Okay, now and that was an outgrowth of your interest in 'Bionic Woman' and--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: and then how to--
Speaker 2: In building a bionic woman.  And if I was gonna go into engineering, 'cause obviously I wasn't gonna be a good medical student, you know.  What could I do in engineering?  And it was robotics.  And, at the time there was no, nothing called a robotics degree.  But that was what I was gonna be, a robotics engineer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what was--had you been exposed to any robots before?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Besides the TV, I actually built a robot car in, must have been my sophomore year.  We had a--so NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] had a competition called ACT-SO [Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics].  And so I competed in ACT-SO.  I did a piece on Sojourner Truth, and I did a autonomous car in their science competition.  Basically, it was I hacked a car and tried to program it.  Interesting enough, it didn't do much.  But it was really hard to do (chuckle).  We just went forward and backward.  I remember the judge is like it still goes forward and backward.  I was like, yeah, but I hacked it.  That's a big thing!
Speaker 1: So you--this is a remote-control car.
Speaker 2: Remote-control car.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was able to control it through a computer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --which now I go, wow, it was amazing.  And at that time I just thought, oh my gosh, this is really hard.  And the scientists were like, oh, it doesn't do much.  Like the judges for ACT-SO, like, eh, it doesn't do much.
Speaker 1: So what did you have to do--create a program that would operate another device that would give a, another frequency to the--
Speaker 2: That would give another signal, right--
Speaker 1: --signal to the--
Speaker 2: --to the remote control, basically.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  The judges weren't, they weren't really impressed?
Speaker 2: No, they weren't.  They weren't.  Even though, if I think about it now, it was actually an amazing (laughter) invention.  Yeah, and at the time I remember being disappointed.  I was like, it was so hard.  It was like the hardest thing I'd done and, yeah.
Story_ID: 30792
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, okay, so tell us how you chose Br--well, it's easy to--your parents [Eric Conway MacCalla and Johnetta MacCalla] went to Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island], so--
Speaker 2: Right, so that was--they were some motivation, but definitely a requirement for school was that it had to be outside of California.  That was their one thing.  And they wanted--and I think that's my mom's [Johnetta MacCalla] philosophy 'cause her parents sent her away for school.  And so their philosophy was like you need to go away for school.  And so, I mean, I applied to the UCs [University of California] as backup.  So my backups were the UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] and UC Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley] and things like that.  And so outside I applied to Brown.  I also applied to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] 'cause MIT, you know, that was--you want to be an engineer and, you know, they had these things called robotics, you know, that's where you would go.  So those were my top choices--Brown University and MIT.  MIT because it was science; Brown because, you know, growing up in a household where your parents are Brown alums--you go to all these Brown events and so, you know, that's always in the back of your mind.  And so I went to go visit both of the campuses.  You know, they have their little, their weekend where they'll try to get their multi-cultural students to enjoy.  And I went to Brown and--so it wasn't the right reasons, but I went to Brown and I got off the plane Friday--
Speaker 1: Now, what do you mean?  You say it wasn't for the right reasons.  What, what do you mean by that.
Speaker 2: So, the reason I chose Brown versus MIT (chuckle)--I chose Brown because I had such a blast.  It was like, oh my gosh, this is what college is like?  I am going here.  MIT, I remember, I went to a class and I was like, oh, this guy is so boring.  What--I can't do this.  You know, the kids were a little dry.  So, it wasn't about, you know, which one would have given me, at the time, you know, which one would have given me a better science.  It was, you know, which one would I have more fun at.  And, clearly, Brown was much more of a fun school where I could see myself being there for four years.
Story_ID: 30793
Speaker 1: Now, before you leave, I know you said your brother ran away at age sixteen.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Now, was he, had he run away--
Speaker 2: Actually--
Speaker 1: --at that--before you went to school or around the same time?
Speaker 2: No, he was gone by then.
Speaker 1: He was, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so actually it was when I was sixteen.
Speaker 1: Oh, when you were sixteen.
Speaker 2: So, it was when I was sixteen.
Speaker 1: And he's younger than you or older?
Speaker 2: He's younger than me, so I was in, I guess I was a junior in high school.
Speaker 1: So, that--well, how did that affect you at that time, you know, 'cause you have this--
Speaker 2: Um.
Speaker 1: Did you have, did you sense it coming or did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so by that time, he'd been doing a lot of stuff, so it was--and we had argued--I mean, I was a teenager and he was a teenager, so, I mean, for the last five years we couldn't stand each other.  So, you could see it coming.  You could definitely see it coming.
Speaker 1: What do you think did--do you have any ideas of what was wrong with, you know--
Speaker 2: I think so.  He was, he was adopted, and I think that when he became a teenager he started questioning his identity and questioning, you know, is this the family he belongs to and things like that.  I think that's what, that's what drove it.
Speaker 1: Do you think he's, he sought out his biological--
Speaker 2: Oh, I know he did.  So he--like I said, he every so often he calls me maybe once every year and a half.  So I know he has found his, his biological mom and his, I guess, biological sisters and brothers.  He has like ten of them.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay, that puts it in some, a better perspective than--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: So he's, he's, he did find, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he did.
Speaker 1: So your parents [Eric Conway MacCalla], did they know where he was in a certain, after a certain point, and they, did they, I don't know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I, I tell them.  So I, you know, relay the informa-, 'cause he's the only, out of the entire family, he's the only one, I'm the only one that he reaches out to--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --for whatever reason.  I'm not quite sure why.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So when did he come along in your childhood?
Speaker 2: When I was about three.  So he was, yeah, so about three, three or four.  'Cause he, he wasn't, he was about one when he, when he came.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's like two, two years--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's two years younger.  So I was like three, three, four.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, okay.  All right, so when you go to Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island], that's not, he, he finds, he's, whatever he did, he's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's, he's, yeah, he's not around.
Speaker 1: He's (unclear) (simultaneously) to whatever what was--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --everybody kind of knew that.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, good.  I just want to make sure--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That people weren't looking for him and all that--
Speaker 2: No, no, at that point, yeah, he was--in, in fact, we did know where he was because he ended up being in Las Vegas [Nevada] and the woman who took him in, just some random woman, she requested permission because she couldn't--and it was like well my parents can either try to force it or give him permission for him to enroll in school.  And so he ended up being in Las Vegas.
Story_ID: 30794
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island]--all right, you're on a--you get off the plane and (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (laughter) Yeah, so I was definitely at the end of the day I chose Brown just 'cause it seemed like a really fun, good school to go to.  So--and it, and it was.  It was--college at Brown was one of the best experiences I could have had.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  So, well, tell us about Brown.  I mean, who were some of the other students who were there and--
Speaker 2: So my year--so I, my class was also a little bit different.  So ever since--so my dad [Eric Conway MacCalla] graduated in '73 [1973], which was at that time the largest class of African Americans before.  And after that it started to decline.  So the number of students started to decline--just mainly they didn't have as much activism--and that was in the '60s [1960s] and things like that.  And so my year they decided to a do a version of what's called need-blind admissions, which is--so the way that Brown works, and I guess some of these colleges, is that they look at your academics and then they have, you know, a hundred students and then they look at your finances.  And that's how they start doing it.  So this year they decided need-blind, which is, they're just gonna look at the academics and not consider whether you can afford it or not.  And my class was the largest class in '73 [1973] of African American and Hispanic students.  So, so it was a--our class was very large in terms of--I think we had about a hundred black students, which is, was huge for, for our school, for black and Hispanic students.
Speaker 1: Now, was there a Black Student Organization?
Speaker 2: Yes, we had the Black Student Organization.  We had a National Society of Black Engineers.  We had something called Rights and Reasons, which was a black cultural group.  So they did plays.  They did music, things like that.  We would bring on, we would sponsor people.  For example, Desmond Tutu came to our campus.  We petitioned to have--was it KRS-One?  I think it was KRS-One--we petitioned him to come.  Maya Angelou came to our--so we were very ac-, and Brown has money.  So, you know, enough of us were able to petition and say, look, this is a valid, you know, reasons.  And, you know, we had some brilliant orators and writers in our group, so they could actually write very convincing arguments to, you know, the government, or student government, to fund us to do a lot of these different activities.  So, it was a very good time.  We, we got a lot of things done.  It was a great experience, culturally as well as academically.
Speaker 1: Okay.  These are the days when South African independence was like major topics in the news and--
Speaker 2: Correct, correct.
Speaker 1: --Desmond Tutu--
Speaker 2: That's why Desmond Tutu (unclear) became a big, big issue.
Speaker 1: Nelson Mandela, I think, was released while you were in college, right?
Speaker 2: So he is, his release--
Speaker 1: 1990, I believe.
Speaker 2: Okay, so it was toward the, yeah, so it was toward the end.  I guess I was a junior or sophomore.  That's also when the [Rodney] King trial happened in LA [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Oh, Rodney King, right.
Speaker 2: Rodney King.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: That happened and I remember that 'cause that was a big issue there on campus.  That's when [Bill] Clinton, not [Bill] Clinton, yeah, [Bill] Clinton--that was his first term.
Speaker 1: Ninety-two [1992], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was his first term.  And that's when I actually first became active in politics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually at Brown is when I, when I started becoming--and I won't consider myself a strong activist, but there's certain things that I think are important.  So, getting people to vote I thought was important.  So, getting more students to see--so in the sciences, for example, I was an activist trying to increase the ranks of any minority engineer at Brown, 'cause there were none.  So little things like that I was, I tried to get involved in.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any black faculty in engineering?
Speaker 2: Nope, zero at the time, or Hispanic, zero.
Speaker 1: Were there any Asians or Indians on faculty?
Speaker 2: At that time, there was maybe two.  I never took their class.  But I think there was like two.  But it was basically European, majority European, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Like did you have any special relationships with any of the teachers as a mentor or anything at Brown?
Speaker 2: In engineering besides--you know, there was one who I thought was really nice.  So I became president of the Black Engineering chapter, NSBE [National Society of Black Engineers], there, and I don't even know who our advisor was.  So, the one person who I asked to be our advisor, he was really, he was nice.  He was a nice guy.  He taught materials science, so I took materials science with him.  But none that was very, like I could say, oh, I would like to go visit when I (laughter) when I go back 'cause there's none that I'd actually go visit.
Story_ID: 30795
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now you've--just off the topic, it just, for somebody on the outside, it seems like you were really prepared to do this, coming out of the home situation you came out of and your own, you know, inclinations, you know.
Speaker 2: I was.  I think I was prepared in terms of information.  As an example, I went to a public school.  So my teachers, you know, they were good.  Like my, you know, my calculus teacher, he, he was pretty good.  But he was really a tennis coach that needed another job.  So he taught math.  So this is, you know--so I thought I knew calculus; I thought I knew physics.  And I go to an engineering class where people, you know, went to Andover [Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts] and they went to boarding schools and they went to private schools.  And that type of--and I, and I learned this lesson:  One-on-one I could not compete.  I mean, my first exam, you know, they're getting B's and A's and I'm getting C's.  And, you know, I've gotten A's all my life.  I'm like, what, I'm smart.  I know I'm smart, you know.  And, and this is where, I think, preparation comes from is, you know, when I was crying to my mom [Johnetta MacCalla], I don't know, you know.  Her thing was, you know, have confidence in yourself and think about what is it that you have to do in order to compete.  And I realized that my problem is that my starting line was way behind the starting line of these other students.  And so I had to--it wasn't that I couldn't compete against them, it's that I just had to run faster to catch up.  So, yeah, my first two years I was in the library, you know.  I, I really didn't go to libraries.  I was going into the libraries bringing out these old books made 1960 (chuckle) trying to figure out, you know, what the teacher was saying.
Speaker 1: Did your mother have the same experience when she went to Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island]?
Speaker 2: She did.  She did.  And her--yeah, she had a lot of the same experiences 'cause she, again, went to Catholic school.  She was in a, you know, predominantly, I mean, all black environment.  And she came in with--in her class she was like one of ten.  So she definitely, she was even further behind in terms of the starting line.  And so I, I learned that very early on--that it has nothing to do about your capabilities. It has everything to do with where you're starting.  And so you can bridge that gap.  You just have to work harder.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And that's what my upbringing helped me deal with.  Whereas some students came in and were like, uh, I'm not gonna be an engineer.  It's like, but you're, you know, really smart.  It's like, yeah, but I just can't do this.  And it's like no you can't do it 'cause you just don't have the background.  If you get the background, you know--so it's, it's that.
Story_ID: 30796
Speaker 1: Did a lot of--well, I'm--how many black students were trying to be engineers?
Speaker 2: It wasn't even a lot.  So in my class we had--well, in my freshman year we had about--maybe a good fifteen.  I mean, you know, that's not a lot, but fifteen.  Terms of like graduated with, I graduated with six.  So about half of them dropped out.
Speaker 1: More than half, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and none of them are engineers.  So they all did something else.
Speaker 1: None of the ones who graduated--
Speaker 2: --except for me stayed as engineering.  So, they either went to med school, they--I mean, they probably make a whole lot more money than me.  In fact, I know they make a whole lot more money than me (laughter), but none of them stick, stuck with engineering.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was because of the toughness of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was tough.  And, in that, you know, we're doing much better in terms of engineering education.  But then engineering education, it w-, it's a boot camp.  It's like we're gonna, you know, make it grueling.  And even at, at Tech, at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia]], I mean, this was the whole, you know--if you can't make it through engineering, you know, with hair on your chest even if you're a woman (chuckle), you're not a good engineer.  So it was grueling.  I mean, we had, not just in the minority ranks, but across the board, you know, people would switch majors very easily.  And then they would do very well in other majors.  And so it's just the way the academic system was set up, you know, yeah.  It was just the way that it, it was done then.  And now there--engineering education is being reformed so that, you know, it's like, okay, maybe we have to make it, I won't say baby steps, but, you know, it should be a gradual transition.  It shouldn't be just a, you know, ninety degree slope where, okay, day one, we're gonna show you the hardest, you know, Maxwell-Einstein's theory of, and expect you to get it coming from a high school background where we don't know who is it that taught you, where they came from, what their background was.  And so--
Speaker 1: This week I've discovered there are a couple philosophies in science departments on college campuses.  One philosophy was reported as being the philosophy of Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] where they--if you made it into Harvard, they were gonna make sure you got out 'cause you, you had to be top-notch to get in.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And then there's another philosophy, which I think they said it prevailed here at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology] and (chuckle) and at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] at a certain point where it's if you--they'd make it so hard and if you hit the wall, you just, hey, you fell to the wayside.  And those that, I mean, they really didn't--they, they were trying to weed you out--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --almost, you know, weed you out.  So the philosophy of Br-, what was the philosophy of Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island]?
Speaker 2: So, the philosophy of the school was--you got in, we're gonna get you out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the philosophy of engineering, I mean, we would call them weed-out courses.  Oh, you're taking the weed-out course--oh, good luck!  I mean, we had a couple of them, you know.  I would say we had like four, maybe five weed-out courses, which is a lot considering you're only taking like four courses a semester, yeah.  And that's what you'd call them, the weed-out course.
Speaker 1: Okay, courses that are so tough that you--
Speaker 2: They're so tough that you're just praying that you're getting a seventy.  It's like, oh my gosh, I studied all week.  I, I just--please just let me pass--that kind of--
Story_ID: 30797
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was your progress in trying to catch up?  Did--was it--did you catch up fairly rapidly or did you--and what did you have to do to catch up?
Speaker 2: So I, I maintained.  So I graduated from Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island] with about a 3.2, which isn't wonderful, especially because--so for engineering at Brown, it was pretty good.  In terms of general, there wasn't, you know--people who graduated--again, Brown's philosophy in general is if you come here--so most of my friends were getting, you know, 3.8s, 3.7s and 3.2s just at, you know, that's borderline.  And I would say in my engineering courses the only course that I did not struggle in was robotics.  And I took a computer science course, took a couple programming courses.  Everything else--it was a struggle--like I had to always do more.  It always seemed like I was--it was always hard.  So when did I catch up?  I caught up when I went to grad school.  Grad school for me--the courses were simple.  I was like--and it's because I think what Brown, the lesson that Brown taught me was how do you study really hard.  And so when I went to SC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California], I studied that same way.  But grad school is not a weed-out course.  So, I mean, I, I graduated from grad school like a 3.9, you know, with all my courses.  And I, I will be honest.  I probably put in about half the effort that I did from undergrad.  So what Brown taught me was:  How do you figure out things?  How do you think about things?  How do you study real hard to solve these problems, these difficult problems?  The grad school--the problems weren't as difficult because their philosophy wasn't to try to weed you out.  So it was a very good--it was an amazing learning experience.  At the time I was like, oh my gosh (chuckle), you know, robo-, again, I loved robotics and I loved the computer science course.  I was like, okay, I--those are the things I want to do.  All this other stuff, I just got--it's more the I got to get through it.  So that's what kept me focused.  But then grad school was--academically, I loved grad school.  In terms of the courses I took, everything was interesting.  Everything seemed easy.  And I know it wasn't easy because I had students who weren't doing so well.  But for me it was like, oh, I can do this.  This makes sense.  All of this makes sense.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, you still had some time in undergraduate school to get involved with some political activities, take advantage of some of the cultural things on campus, and to get involved in the [William] Clinton [U.S. president 1993-2001] campaign, right?
Speaker 2: No, that was in undergrad.
Speaker 1: That was--yeah, that's what I mean.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, so undergrad--I--socially was much more rewarding in terms of the things that I was involved with.  Academically, it was rewarding, but it was darn hard.  It was hard (laughter).  I would say it was very, very hard.
Speaker 1: So you were at Brown until from '89 [1989] until '92 [1992]?
Speaker 2: So I went '89 [1989] to '93 [1993].  I graduated in '93 [1993].
Speaker 1: '93? Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 30798
Speaker 1: And so in ninety--did you take any time off in between schools--
Speaker 2: No, graduated in May of '93 [1993], started grad school in September of '93 [1993].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now where did you go to graduate school?
Speaker 2: University of Southern California [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you stayed there through the entire process towards a PhD?
Speaker 2: Yeah, master's and Ph.D.
Speaker 1: So did you get a master's first and then a Ph.D. or did it just go all the way through?
Speaker 2: Master's first then Ph.D.  And actually when I started my master's I also started working at JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California].  It's because I was tired of being poor as a student.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you got a job at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause I'd been working there in the summers.  So it was easy--they were like, oh yeah, sure, you can work here.  We have no problem.
Speaker 1: So that was your summer job?
Speaker 2: That was my summer job and then it became my--I became twenty hours a week.  So that was like the cutoff to still get benefits (chuckle).
Speaker 1: Now this is the historic JPL, Jet Propulsion--
Speaker 2: Yes, it's the historic J--
Speaker 1: --Laboratory.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Once, again, I saw the NOVA special on JPL--
Speaker 2: On JPL.
Speaker 1: --and it--but--so tell us a little bit about the place and what your expectations were when you started working there in the summertime.
Speaker 2: So I wanted to do, again, I wanted to do robotics.  I knew I wanted to do this.  And, of course, in the summers you come back home.  So there's not a lot of places that would--I--that I knew of that were doing robotics except for JPL.  So, I applied to JPL.  And my first summer jobs weren't in robotics--not even close.  My first summer job was doing a user-interfaced database for the Deep Space Network, which is the network that's used to communicate to the satellites.  So we did a, a data conversion of Fortran, which is an old language, to C with some type of interface so that, you know, general people could use it or general mission scientists could use it.  So I did that for two summers.  And then I, after that I said, you know, I really want to do robotics with all this robotics going around.  And my next summer after my junior year I actually found a guy who said, yeah, sure, next summer you can come and do some robotics.  So the next summer after that I started working with a guy to do robotics and then he left (chuckle) like two weeks when I was there.  So I got moved to another project.  Still did not do robotics, but got involved in what's considered artificial intelligence, which I had no idea about.  I didn't even know what this artificial intelligence machine learning was.  So I got involved in that based on work at JPL.  And that's actually why I do what I do in robotics is I focus on intelligence in a machine.  It's because when I started that as an intern--
Speaker 1: Now what's the difference between artificial intelligence and just a computer?
Speaker 2: So artificial intelligence is the ability for the machine to think without having all the information that's present there.  So a computer program--typically it's programmed to do exactly step A, step B, step C, step D.  If anything's different, it won't work.  So you can't ask it to do anything it doesn't know.  Whereas artificial intelligence--you can ask it to learn a new task.  You can ask it to--for example, imagine that you're using a word processor and you're typing.  And you're like, you know what, I keep typing my name, Ayanna Howard, Ayanna Howard.  I would like it to be able, as soon as I type in A-Y, it should automatically say Ayanna Howard.  That's a form of artificial intelligence.  It's actually thinking.  It's not program that says--it's learning a pattern, saying, oh I, I've seen this once, twice, three--oh, you know what, I'm gonna automatically type it.  And so, if you notice, your word processor actually has some intelligence in it because it does things like automatic correction.  So that's intelligence versus just the standard computer.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, in those days what could artificial intelligence do that a regular computer--you know, you hear the expression garbage in, garbage out computer, whatever you put in, it comes out.  But with artificial intelligence you might put garbage in and get something else out, right?  Is that--
Speaker 2: Correct.  Although, if you, if there is--so the way that artificial intelligence works is you can put garbage in, but you also have to put good stuff in.  And it's able to figure out what the good stuff is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it is still garbage in, garbage out, but garbage in plus good stuff equals good stuff out--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --if you do it right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.  Okay, so this in the summertimes, so that last summer is spent--what was, what project did you work on that summer that specifically in terms of artificial intelligence--
Speaker 2: So, interesting enough, I worked on a military project, and I actually didn't know it until later on.  So what happened was, at that time, what they, what the military wanted to do was figure out what was the best way to maximize their resources in terms of troops.  So, if you're in the battlefield and you have, you know, say, a hundred soldiers, where should you place them so you optimally can cover the whole area?  So typically the generals, what they would do is they just man--well, you go over there, you go over there.  So what I did was created a program that looked at the terrain.  So it looked at, you know, were there hills, were there, you know, flat areas, things like that, the size of the area we wanted to cover.  And it came up with a scheme to automatically determine where you should place all of the troops to maximize whatever you wanted to do.  And so I used the example of what's called neural networks.  That's when I learned a concept called neural networks, which is, it's the cognitive model of how the human brain does pro-, in it does processing--how we think, how we store and learn different things.  So that was, that was that experience.
Story_ID: 30799
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Okay, so when you get to grad school [University of Southern California, Los Angeles], what's your--you're--are you focused on robotics exclusively?
Speaker 2: I am, I am focused on robotics.  Now the challenge of grad school was--so at Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island] the way that they do engineering is all the engineers take the same, pretty much the same courses the first two years.  And then in your last two years you start specializing.  So you can a, again, a robotics course, a computer science course, and things like that.  And so when I applied to grad school, I applied to engineering departments, electrical, computer engineering departments.  USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles]--there were--most of the robotics was in computer science.  And so my challenge was I had been accepted into engineering, but most of the things I had to do and the courses I had to take and faculty I had to interact with were in computer science.  And that's actually when I started becoming this hybrid engineer computer scientist 'cause I had the engineering background, but I had to learn what it was to be a classical computer scientist.
Speaker 1: Okay, we have to pause here again.
Story_ID: 30800
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what was the state of, you know, robotics in the early nineties [1990s]?
Speaker 2: So in the early '90s [1990s] robotics was still pretty young in terms of what you consider intelligence.  Primarily, when anyone thought of robotics they thought of industrial manufacturing.  So, at that time Ford [Motor Company] was starting to bring in their industrial manipulators to build the cars and things like that.  So, factory automation was where robotics resided primarily.
Speaker 1: So industrially, I mean, a robot would be a arm that swings over and--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --screws a part on.
Speaker 2: Screws a part, picks up a door, welds, things like that.  I mean, that was robotics.  In fact, a lot of times when you said I do robotics they immediately like, oh, you're taking away all the factory jobs.  Like, uh, I don't do that kind of robotics.  In fact, that was the response you'd get, you know.  One out of two people would respond in that way--you're taking the factory jobs away.  But that was the state of robotics.  That's what existed in society.
Speaker 1: Now what would be the difference between a robot and a animatronic thing?  I mean, what would be the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean, the--I remember Henry Ford had a animatronic [Abraham] Lincoln that would give the Gettysburg Address [1863] at the Greenfield Village museum [aka Henry Ford Museum, Dearborn, Michigan].  I saw that when I was ten.  So, you know, what--but that's not a robot, is it?  It's not--
Speaker 2: That's not a robot.  So an animatronic is basically a very highly redundant, highly sophisticated remote-control car.  That's basically what it is.  It's, it's a, it's a car.  It's a toy.  But it has very fine resolution, a lot of motors, a lot of actuators and linkage, but it's pro-, it's preprogrammed.  So you know exactly what it's gonna do every single time.  Every second I can tell you, well, this is the angles of the joints, this is what it's gonna be holding, this is what it's gonna be doing.  So it's preprogrammed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Where as a real robot is one where at any point in time, unless I know what it was doing, you know, two steps before, I wouldn't be able to tell you what it's supposed to--what it's actually doing.  I just know the end goal.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so a robot can react to--
Speaker 2: A robot can react based on its environment, yes.
Speaker 1: A animatronic thing does the same thing.
Speaker 2: No, it cannot react.  It does the same thing.  I mean, and that's actually one of the reasons why factory automation--they're starting to get more intelligent in it, but those are basically in the realm of animatronic.  They're a preprogrammed sequence.  In fact, that's why, if anything goes wrong on the factory floor, they have to shut the whole plant down because it's like, oh, wait, we're, we're off, we're off step.  And everything has to be aligned.  So, those--the factory automations--they're actually getting into the realm of becoming true robotic systems because they're starting to do things like feedback and reaction.  Some nice things are coming out in that regard as well.
Story_ID: 30801
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  In popular culture in the early nineties [1990s] the most popular kids' show--was 'cause I had a little kid then--were 'Go-Bots' and Transformers.
Speaker 2: 'Transformers,' yes.
Speaker 1: Was a thing that could turn himself into another thing.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And they sold the toys, which were really remarkably engineered.
Speaker 2: Right--from the car to the robot to the--yeah, those were, those were nice.  Those were nice.  I liked those.
Speaker 1: All right.  There's always a lot of popular culture stuff about robots for some reason.
Speaker 2: No, I mean, if you think about society in general, robots have, you know, Isaac Asimov, with 'I, Robot' back in the day.  There's always been a fascination about two things:  space, Mars specifically, and robots.  Those are the two things that popular culture have existed for eons.  And we're starting to slowly see the things that people wrote about in science fiction in terms of space and robotics coming to fruition, actually coming true, which is nice.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was reading about as far back as fourteenth century there were animatronic fortune tellers and the chess players--
Speaker 2: Chess players, horses--I remember there was--I read something about a mechanical horse, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And at any rate so here you are in grad school and this is just a culture back, but you're in graduate school and you're working on artificial intelligence and robotics and--at Southern Cal [University of Southern California, Los Angeles].
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And now did the movie industry needs influence you all's work at all in terms of those special effects and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: At that time, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Later on I started thinking about, you know, those things that I'd seen and, you know, how to make it a reality.  But in grad school it was about, you know, what was the immediate--what could we do to solve an immediate problem, not something that was more fantasy.
Story_ID: 30802
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was your thesis in graduate school?
Speaker 2: So, the title of my thesis was, 'Recursive Learning for Deformable Object Manipulation.'  So that was the title, which, you know, kind of sounds kind of fancy.  But basically what I was doing is--the motivation was:  At the time there was starting to be a scare of needles.  If you remember, this was when there was--drug usage was going up.  AIDS [autoimmune deficiency syndrome] was becoming this dominant thing.  And they were worried that in the hospitals nurses and assistants would start getting stuck by needles.  You know, they didn't have--you know, nowadays you, you do a needle and it has these special compartments.  Then, you know, you do a needle and get thrown in the trash can.  So my thought was, well, what if we had robots actually handle the bags--basically, be your, your trashcan delivery.  So they would pick up the bags that would have needles and then deliver it.  So, that would save human lives, and you wouldn't have to worry about it.  And so one of the issues with robots still is that they don't know how--this goes with the reaction especially in factory automation--trash bags deform.  So, when you pick them up, they change shape.  So that means you can't have a preprogrammed kind of way of grabbing the bag because as soon as you grab it, it shifts weight, it changes.  And so you have to be able to react.  And so I designed a methodology that one, learns how to pick up bags.  So it looks at a bag and it figures out where the best place is to pick it up.  And then, as it's delivering, if it starts to shift, it changes it's--it either changes the force that it's applying or changes its position so that it doesn't drop the bag.  And so it has this learning component as well as this reactive component.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And it actually worked out.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I built a, a mini prototype.  So I had a small manipulator arm.  And it had these little bags of--and I put different stuff.  So I had a bag of sand, I had a bag of cotton--just things that had different deformation characteristics so that I can test that you can look at it as you grabbed it.  How can you react even if you don't know what's inside the bag?  'Cause sand deforms differently than, say, a bag full of the pillows 'cause it's actually going to the laundry room.  So, yeah, so that was, that was a nice experience.
Speaker 1: Okay, now was there any mentors in graduate school?  Were any of these teachers--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  So I had two professors.  One was my main advisor who was a guy named George Bekey, Professor George Bekey.  And he is one of the--which of course I didn't know before I got there--he's one of the fathers of robotics in the United States.  So, now he's in his, he's hitting eighty [years old].  But he was one of the early pioneers in robotics.
Speaker 1: Okay, how do you spell his last name?
Speaker 2: B-E-K-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, and who was the other one?
Speaker 2: Professor Kenneth Goldberg, G-O-L-D-B-E-R-G.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Were both of these, these professors--
Speaker 2: It also--the story is that Goldberg was my first advisor.  And after my first year there, maybe my second year, he left USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles] and went to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley].  And so I wanted to stay at USC and so I had to find another advisor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that was the--but I still--in fact, I keep in touch with both of them to this day.
Story_ID: 30803
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so, so you got your master's degree in '94 [1994].
Speaker 2: Ninety-four [1994].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now did you stop to get a job or did you--
Speaker 2: No, was still working at JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California] and just, you know, fall semester I was in the master's program.  They mailed me my degree (chuckle).  Spring, January, I was Ph.D. student.
Speaker 1: Now, did your work at JPL like correspond to the work you were doing for your graduate degree?
Speaker 2: So, the linkage was that I was learning the different artificial intelligence concepts at my job.  So that was the, the primary linkage.  For example, in my job I was using neural networks.  Just so happens that my thesis' main (chuckle) algorithm deals with neural networks.  So, I used a lot of the same approaches and methodologies in both.
Speaker 1: Now is that fair to (laughter)--no, I'm just kidding.
Speaker 2: Oh, actually it's perfectly reasonable.
Speaker 1: And it's good for JPL and for USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles].
Speaker 2: Correct.  And one of the things is that the--what was nice about me doing the methodology is I could show that it didn't matter what the application was--the approach was sound.  As long as I have data and an objective, I can use the same methodology.  So, it was nice to show that the method itself could be applied in multiple domains even though the appli--in one instance we wanted to do, you know, military troops, in another one we wanted to do learning how to grab deformable bags.  But the, the nugget of it was still this neural network package.  So, it was actually pretty nice.  And it showed me how--even now in my research, if you look under the engine, you could say, hey, this has 20 percent of what this has.  Oh, wow, that must be some really good technology if it has multiple ways of being used.  So, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But what I said before--but that's pretty much true that JPL would encourage, you know, benefits, too, from interaction with a Ph.D. candidate working there.
Speaker 2: Um (pause), not so much (chuckle).  Not so much.  I was probably one of the few who was also a student.  So it wasn't a lot of Ph.D. students because it's, it's basically as if you have two jobs.  So, because you are a full-time student--so that's your, you know, forty plus hours.  And then, however many hour--and I was about twenty hours.  So, that means I was spending, you know, sixty plus hours a week working on something.  So, so that, that could get kind of, you know, you have two masters now.  And if there's conflict, you know, which one is supposed to give.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So what was your dissertation about?
Speaker 2: So the recursive learning--that was the dissertation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, was the, the same as the master's thesis?
Speaker 2: Oh, so, no, my master's was coursework.  So I could do coursework option.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, so you didn't have to write a dissertation.
Speaker 2: I didn't have to write a dissertation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because by the time I was there for a year I knew I was going to continue on with my Ph.D..  So I basically applied, whatever that spring, my first year there for the Ph.D. program.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, yeah.  So then it didn't make sense to do a, a master's--
Speaker 1: So the written work actually that you already done was enough to--
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: The written, the thesis or whatever for--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was for the Ph.D..
Speaker 1: That was for the Ph.D..
Speaker 2: That was for the Ph.D..
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  Okay, now I understand.  Okay.  All right, so--all right, and what--any comments about the University of Southern California?
Speaker 2: Um.
Speaker 1: Now, once again, your parents [Eric Conway MacCalla and Johnetta MacCalla] were--they had already been there, too.
Speaker 2: Yes, they'd been there.  I, I met their advisors after I graduated, which is interesting.  USC is a very good school.  It's--it has a bent--I--it--I almost want to say it has a focus on how do you make engineering work.  So it's much more--I would say Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island] is much more theoretical.  USC is much more applied.  It's like, here's the theory, but then, you know, how does this theory really apply to the real world.  And I think it was because USC, their master's program had a lot of working professionals.  You know, we had Lockheed [Martin Corporation] sending students there, TRW [Inc.], Hughes [Aerospace Corporation]--these are some of the older aerospace companies.  They would send their employees to USC.  And so I think because of that the training that you had was much more practical.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, okay, so when you, you got your Ph.D. in 1999.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And you start the new millennium with a Ph.D. (laughter).
Speaker 2: (laughter) Right.
Story_ID: 30804
Speaker 1: And okay, now it says here you are the senior member of IEEE [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers] Robotics and Automation Society.  Now, what, what is that?
Speaker 2: So, I triple E [IEEE, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers] is--in general, I triple E [IEEE] is a international organization now that manages things like engineering policy.  They have advocacy groups.  But it's a professional organization for electrical engineers primarily.  But out of that they have different subdivisions.  So they have one on robotics.  They have an I triple E [IEEE].  And so they have different societies where you now specialize.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, what does it mean to be a senior member of that society?
Speaker 2: So senior member means--so anyone can be a member.  You just pay your dues.  Senior member means that after you've been practicing--you have to be a practicing engineer--for ten years, you can apply to be a senior member.  And applying means you have to get letters of recommendations from other senior members, you have to give them your CV [curriculum vitae], and basically you have to say that you are an expert in this area and that other people recognize that you're an expert.  And so, if they approve you, you then can become a senior member.  So it's basically a stamp that says you're, you have some seniority in this field.  You kind of know what you're doing.
Story_ID: 30805
Speaker 1: Okay, so let me go just that--now, what you prepared yourself to do after achieving a Ph.D. is to actually program a robot, basically.
Speaker 2: At the end of the day, yes.  I, I, I--well let me rephrase that.  I program the robot to be able to learn how to program itself.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now that's--
Speaker 2: That's a better--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --representation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, okay so you, you're still working at JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California] at the same time?  I mean, after you graduate?
Speaker 2: Correct.  So now I'm done with the Ph.D.  In fact, like as soon as I defended [my thesis] in February, reported and started forty hours--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --or forty plus hours.
Speaker 1: So, so what projects did you work on at JPL--
Speaker 2: So, at that point--and at that point I'd been on a bunch of different projects.  But I decided--none of them had been robotics.  All of them had been focus on using artificial intelligence for different things.  I decided that, okay, I'm at JPL--let me finally do something in robotics.  And so I applied to--there was a position that was open at JPL that I applied to in, on a robotics team.  So I started doing actual robotics.  And the project was on how do you design robots to be more intelligence for Mars exploration.  So that's how I started getting into robotics and space.
Story_ID: 30806
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Well, (pause)--well, go on (laughter)--I got--I'm trying to think of a, what a, how to, how do--well, you know, I don't don't want to dis the science, the nuts and bolts of this, but, you know--yeah, maybe you can explain how, how that's done maybe and be useful--
Speaker 2: Oh, the kind of, the approach?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: So at this time--so this was '93 [1993], '99 [1999], and we had just launched a few years before that we had launched Sojourner [1997].  So we had had our first robotic vehicle on the surface of Mars.  And the issue with--and I won't say the issue--one of the things that it did is it wasn't very intelligent.  Pretty much it had a binary decision, if it--it would go forward until it got to a rock and then it was almost like flipping a coin.  If it got to a rock, it flipped--it'd go left, go right.  It turned, go forward until it got to another obstacle--flip a coin, left or right.  And so that was how it navigated.  And so the--at that time the PI [project investigator] of the project wanted to enable the robot to be able to navigate a little bit more intelligently 'cause he had shown that given the distribution of rocks at Mars, based on that strategy, the robot would get stuck.  And so he had a bunch--so when I started working with him, he had done a bunch of simulations.  So it had all been in a simulation world--a bunch of simulations that showed how, look, if this is a scenario, here, the robot gets stuck.  If this is a scenario, here, the robot gets stuck.  And so what he wanted me to do was think about a way so that you can intelligently navigate so you wouldn't have, you wouldn't get stuck on Mars--'cause robot get stuck on Mars, you pretty much have an immobile robot.  And so the way that the project started is he wanted me to take his simulated ideas, which were basically math ques-, math equations, and get it to work.  So that was my first job is to get this theoretical philosophy and concept and actually get it to work with real camera data and a real robot that's moving in--and we have a, a Mars field at JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California]--and get it moving to show that what's in his head and what he showed in theory actually physically works, which was a challenge because I am of the philosophy that theory is doom to failure when you actually apply it because a theory has too many assumptions.  And you have to relax those assumptions for it to work in the real world.  So that was my first robotics experience.  And then from that what happened was I started--so that was his concept.  But then going through that transition, I started to then discover additional problems.  Additional problems came when, for example, on Mars there's things like craters.  Finding and looking and seeing a crater and saying crater's not a rock.  A crater looks differently than a rock.  And we didn't have a method to say, well, this is a crater.  So what would happen is, if you came to a crater, the robot would say, oh, I'm supposed to go forward.  So I started coming up with methods of identifying what was what I called traversable and not traversable.  As people we do it automatically.  You know, we look, and we say, oh, there's a patch of snow and there's no snow.  Obviously, we're gonna take the area with no snow.  And so I worked on ways for the robot to learn what was good and what was bad in terms of what it could traverse.  And so that's where, that's where the interesting thing started to happen.  So at the end of the day it was--came up with methods where the robot could intelligently navigate and learn based on how a person navigates and learns how to drive.
Story_ID: 30807
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, I gu-, lot like any other high-tech thing, there are a lot of different components that make up the robot, I guess.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Did you have--so in robotics, I guess, you have to learn about different kinds of sensors and what they--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --they do.  Is that--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Can you talk a little about it?
Speaker 2: Yes, so like any robot there's really--you can think of it as three components.  It's see, act, and think.  So that's the, the robot's cycle.  So seeing deals with sensing.  So if you think about us as people, we have our senses so we can feel, we can taste, we can hear, we can see.  So when we design a robot, we have to give it the same ability, the same sensing capability.  The dominant form is sight.  So--and they've done statistics:  There's about 60 percent of our cortex, of our sensing part of the cortex is devoted to vision--looking at things, decoding them, understanding that.  And so we started with cameras as the dominant form of sensing on a robotic vehicle.  And so vision is not just seeing something.  So, if you think about taking a camera and taking a picture--there's a picture.  Now you as a person can say, oh, there's my friend, there's a trashcan, there's a chair.  So we can identify that because we know what a chair looks like.  So sensing for a robot involves how do you get the robot to identify what's in its camera image in order to say, you know, what is it that I'm seeing.  So that's the sensing part.  Then you take that sensing and it goes into the thinking module, which is the brain.  So the brain is--it looks at the images, it looks at the sensor data, and says things like, you know, is this traversable, is this not, is it human, is it not, and things like that.  And so that allows you to think through the process, learn through the process.  And then acting is I take all this data and then I do something.  I move forward, I turn left, I go backwards, I yell down to mission control and say, I don't know what to do, I grab science data.  So that's the acting part of it, physically doing something in the environment.  And then you go back to sensing 'cause then you have to see--I did something--what happened?  How did my environment change?  Did I move?  Did the image that I saw, is it the exact same?  Therefore, I know, I thought I moved, but I didn't.  So it's this whole paradigm of sensing, thinking, and acting that a robot goes through over and over and over again.
Speaker 1: If I'm building a robot, can I go to--and I need some visual sensors--can I go to a robot store and buy them or do I have to make them?  What--
Speaker 2: So now what's so nice is you can use a webcam, which is a--so when I was going to grad school, I mean, we had to buy special hardware, you know, and it was fairly low resolution.  We had to have this big thing called a frame grabber board, which is a special card we had to buy and you put it in your computer and it would convert the analog signal to digital.  It was, it was pretty complex.  Now, what would cost us about twelve hundred dollars to do, you can buy in a under a hundred dollar webcam--that whole process of taking an image and importing it into your screen by USB [universal serial bus] cable.  So that's our, that's our camera sensors now.  It's basically webcams and we'll add two webcams so we have two webcams, and we can do some fancy stuff.  Now we're actually--a new sensor that's come out that we're using in the robotics world is the Kinect, which is the Kinect with Xbox 'cause the Kinect is just the camera.  It actually has three camera systems.  So we're using that quite a bit now.
Speaker 1: And it's used on a Xbox, you said?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so this is an Xbox.  And right now, I mean, we have three in my lab.  I mean the robotics community is wild about this sensor because it's the cost of--so the Kinect--if I was to buy a system like the Kinect's prior, it would cost about on the order or four to five K [four thousand to five thousand dollars].  So now, Kinect is 150 bucks [150 dollars].  So we're really excited about--
Speaker 1: But Kinect is a Xbox system.
Speaker 2: The Kinect, yeah, it's the sensor that goes with the Xbox 360.  So it's a new sensor by--Microsoft is putting it out.
Speaker 1: And what does it allow you to do when you--
Speaker 2: It allows you to convert image data to 3D--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --images.  So you get depth information.
Speaker 1: So you get--so the robot gets a 3D (recall?).
Speaker 2: Yes, it's wonderful.  It's just--it's wonderful.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm behind on my Xbox knowledge now--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, it's wonderful.  I, I will say, I will predict that because of the Kinect and it coming out and it being at the price point, in--I won't even say in a year but in less than a year you're gonna see some amazing things where the Kinect is integrated with robotics.  And you're like, oh, I can do this.  I got a Kinect, so I'll download this.  Let me go run by this little robot and, look, my robot can things like follow me to the kitchen so it can carry my coffee 'cause I got too much groceries in my hand.  It's, it's considered--right now we're projecting that it's one of--it's gonna be a major breakthrough for things that we do because vision has been the dominant sensing.  And it hasn't been that exact, and it has a lot of error.  And this sensor provides us the ability to remove a lot of the error that's made it infeasible to work in the real world--our robots to work in the real world.  So, so we're really excited about it.
Story_ID: 30808
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now commercially or--what, what, you know, we all know manufacturing, you know, has like a lot of use for robots.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But the average person--what use of a robot would the average person make other than recreation, just, you know, just to have a novelty walking your house carrying--I mean, or, I don't know, what--you get my question?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so why would I need a robot?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So there's a couple of domains.  So there's the domain where people don't realize it's a robot and then there's a domain where, oh yeah, it's a robot.  So where people realize it's a robot is in, mainly in the medical field--hospitals, nursing homes, environments where you might have an elderly person that you want to keep them in a, in their home, but you can't have mom or daughter staying with them all the time.  And so you need something, someone to monitor progress, do little things for them until you get home.  So that's where you're gonna see a lot of what you consider the robot assistant.  Hospitals--you're gonna see--so doing things like changing the bed sheets, which is actually very, you know, it's kind of intense.  I mean, a robot can do that very easily.  You know, you can go in and pick up the patient, pick the patient up.  You have the nurse pull the sheet out, put it in.  And then you have the robot gently put the patient down.  So that's where you're gonna see a lot of robot use in a nonmilitary aspect.  In the--where you don't think about a robotic system, but it's gonna exist, which it exists now--in your cars.  And actually technology in it has been developed by the robotic community.  As an example, if you have the cars that now--the high-end cars do this--backing up.  And you can, as you're backing up, you can--it monitors and corrects you so you can do the parallel parking, which is still very difficult.  So that comes from and it's derived from some research that was done in robotics a long time ago in terms of navigation.  And so what you're gonna see is a lot of the components that we've been working on are finding their way now in consumer products.  Another example is now you buy a camera and they have this automatic face.  You can do it and it automatically--so that comes from work that was derived from vision folks figuring out, you know, how do you do facial recognition so that I can understand things like mood, personality, gestures, and things like that.  So that's really where you're gonna see a lot of improvements.  And people aren't even gonna realize that that's robotics space technology.
Speaker 1: Okay, we have to pause again.  So, am I asking you good questions?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean, just think, now, you know and I don't, so I'm just trying to...
Story_ID: 30809
Speaker 1: All right, okay, all right.  Well, so you were at JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California] for five--until 2005, right?
Speaker 2: Until 2005.
Speaker 1: Two thousand five [2005].  And what are some of the highlights of what you did at JPL.
Speaker 2: So, a couple things--was coming up with a scheme for evaluating a terrain from a robotic perspective to determine traversability, or grades of traversability.  And a robot is both mobile, so on the ground as well as aerial, so robotic spacecrafts as well.  So that's the, I would say, the biggest claim to fame is coming up with methodologies that were human inspired.  So whole concept is is that if scientists could go to Mars, you know, most of them would be first in line.  And so because they can't right now, the robot should mimic as much as possible how they would operate if they were on Mars.  And so having a robot that's human inspired, which means that it, it seems to do the same stuff that a human would do given the situation it's in, gives the scientist the ability to transplant and have this virtual presence in that realm.  So that's, that's really the claim to fame is coming up with methodologies and approaches that allow that to happen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so at JPL what was your, I guess, most, I guess, important project at JPL?  Or was there such a thing or is, was just a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that, so the project in terms of terrain traversability--that was a good five years, at least, coming up and refining it and then adding and continuing so that it was robust enough that I can put it in any scenario--and in theory I could put it on any planet and it would be able to navigate.  And so that was, in terms of the theoretical contributions, that was the most important.  One of my, I guess, more of my favorite contributions--'cause, you know, as a scientist you work on other little projects.  And while I was there I had received award--was called the Lew Allen Award for Excellence.  And what that allowed me to do is it basically gave you as a condition of the award it gave you a mini grant to do anything that you want.  So it's like--be creative.  Do anything that you want.  And I decided that I wanted to do a educational software package to teach students about intelligence concepts for robotics.  So basically a learning game, which is totally different than anything else that I'd been doing, but I just thought it was important to in terms of a education to basically figure out, you know, all this stuff that I'm doing--how can I make it so that it's understandable to kids so that they can say, oh, now I understand when she talks about, you know, neural networks.  Oh, this is what it really means.  You know, I talk genetic algorithms--oh, this is how it, what it really means.  And so I used my little mini grant--I hired basically two folks to work on it, to program it.  And so it had graphics, and it had a little games.  So it would walk you through a tutorial.  And at the end it would have this little--one was a robot navigation game and the other one was a "Guess My Age," which was a neural network.  So you had to--I gave a little figure and you had to guess the age and then it would take that data and learn different things about you.  And then I had a genetic algorithm that would figure out what is the best path to go from planets in the solar system.  So if you wanted to go from Earth to Mars--Earth, Mars, Saturn--which planet should you visit first in order to minimize fuel.  So that was my, my package, which I was pretty proud of, pretty proud of.
Speaker 1: Okay, what's the name of it?
Speaker 2: It's called the AI Toolkit.
Speaker 1: AI Toolkit.  Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And so now, I mean, since I stopped monitoring, but I know as of--I think the last time I monitored it was like 2007.  At that time I had about six hundred users internationally that had downloaded and, you know, commented on its use.  So now I have no idea.
Story_ID: 30810
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, now, let's see.  In 2002 you received the Best Paper Award at the Ninth International Symposium on Robotics and Applications.
Speaker 2: So the Best Paper Award was--that was some of the work on navigation, so on how do you do navigation--and I call it safe navigation, but navigation using human-inspired thinking, linguistic type of thinking in order to navigate safely in hazardous environments.  So that's what that paper was about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And most of my papers at that time either dealt with vision--how do you do recognition of the terrain or navigation either from a space craft or from a mobile surface-based platform.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you had--2004 you received the Engineer of the Year Award by Los Angeles Council of Engineers and Scientists.  That sounds like a big deal.
Speaker 2: (laughter) It was.  Honestly, it's mostly, again, because of the work and the effect that it could possibly have had and that it was different.  It was something that would enable longer term missions in an autonomous fashion.  So that was also from that work, derived from that work.  And also I think--so some of the awards I--also come from the fact that at that time I'd started to become an advocate for education even though I wasn't an educator.  So I had started a, a lot of different programs.  I had started a academy for at-risk girls in math and science.  So it was a math and science academy for at-risk girls.  Middle school had started a mentoring program where I would pair up women engineers at JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California] with college students to try to keep them and encourage them.  And so it was a number of little programs that I had started.  And I think one of the things about that, I guess one of the side benefits, is that people then start to hear your name.  'Cause they're like, oh, she's a great engineer and, you know, she's trying to educate the next generation with this engineering.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, so there are more awards--Allstate?
Speaker 2: Distinguished, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's an award from Allstate.  There's an award from NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] for fuzzy logic, for the Fuzzy Logic Engine for Space Applications.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And there's, gosh, you were featured in 'Time Magazine' in 2004 in an article, 'Artificial Intelligence:  Forging the Future:  Rise of the Machines.'
Story_ID: 30811
Speaker 1: And so--and then in 2005 you're earning a M.B.A..  Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: So the M.B.A. story is I had started, I don't know maybe around '02 [2002], started to manage engineers, which means that I was starting to get grants funded.  And with grants you get money and so now you need other engineers to also work on your project.  And so I was starting to manage more engineers and trying to do deliverables.  And at one of my annual reviews I sat down with my supervisor, and he told me that I need to be a better manager because I was not delegating responsibilities enough.  I was still doing too much of the work.  And so I was like, well I'm, you know, I'm just learning how to do this.  And so I decided--'cause I'm that type of person--I said, well, if I'm gonna start managing more folks, let me figure out the best way.  And the best way is you go to school.  So I decided to go to school and get my M.B.A. to figure out how to manage people.  So that's the (laughter), that's how that happened.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how long did you go to school?
Speaker 2: It must have been two, two-and-a-half years.  So I was--and so I started in 2002, so three years.  And then I took a semester off to have my son.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for two-and-a-half years.
Story_ID: 30812
Speaker 1: All right, well, this is a--so in 2005 you left JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California]].  And now why did you leave?  What happened?
Speaker 2: Wonderful job.  Love NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], love JPL.  Issue happened is that we had the shuttle accident early on [Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated upon re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, February 1, 2003].  And when the shuttle accident happened, NASA was tasked to reorganize and figure out, you know, what is it that you actually do.  And from there they came, there came up something called the Vision for Space Exploration [2004].  So this was a [George W.] Bush initiative, which was we're going to the moon and then to Mars.  So this was an initiative.  At that point, because NASA had to reorganize, they pretty much took most of the funding and started focusing it on how do we redo Apollo in today's time era, which means that there was very little left to do research.  And research is, you know, forward looking, things that we've never done before.  Instead, we were looking, okay, how do you do new things, but basically recreating.  And so I had to decide--I was starting to see that I was doing more, much more management and much less research.  And so I decided--I had to decide--and it was one of these, you know, epiphanies--do I want to be just a manager or do I still want to do research.  And I realized that if I still wanted to do research, I had to leave NASA.  At that time it was, it was almost impossible to do research at NASA--it was getting to be impossible.  So that's the reason.  I decided that I still loved research.  I still wanted to do it.  I still had a passion for it.  And so working--you do research?  Not too many companies--a lot of companies had closed up their research labs 'cause this was '04 [2004], '05 [2005].  NASA wasn't doing much research.  So pretty much the only place was the academic environment.  So I said, all right, let's go to the academia.
Speaker 1: Now what made Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] particularly attractive?
Speaker 2: Okay, so just like how I chose my undergrad and grad school--it was not for the same reasons that everybody else does.  So I knew going to undergrad that I didn't like the cold.  And so I drew an L through the United States and I said from Washington (chuckle) down California then across--I didn't want to do New Mexico, but California then Texas.  And it had to have a metropolitan area.  So basically there was three places I could do--Washington, California, Texas, or Georgia.  Those were pretty much the only--and there was like maybe Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina], so few more schools in the southern area that had a little bit of a metropolitan.  And so from there I looked at what job openings there were.  I looked at if I knew any faculty that were doing things that were related to robotics and so applied to those places that made sense.  And, believe it or not, I didn't look at rankings.  I didn't--I looked at geographical location and whether the faculty seemed to be doing related stuff.  Yeah, again, not using the same reasons that other people choose, but for some reason the way I've made my decisions has somehow works.
Story_ID: 30813
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So here at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] they were doing robotics and--
Speaker 2: They were doing robotics.  And they had a number of faculty, well-known faculty, that were doing robotics.  In fact, the, one of the--like my advisor at USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles] was one of the fathers of robotics.  There's a guy here named Ron [Ronald] Arkin whose one of the--he's in that generation of--you know, he's been doing robotics for, you know, thirty years.  And so, you know, you say his name and people like, oh yeah, I, I've maybe not met him, but I've read his work and I know his work and that kind of stuff.  And there's not a whole lot of, I would say, actually not even--they're probably grandfathers of robotics now that are, have that reputation.  And so he was one of them.  So, yeah, Georgia Tech definitely was doing robotics.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're still working on artificial intelligence basically here [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] and--
Speaker 2: Yes, I work on learning.  I work a lot more now on having robots interact with people as well.  So that's a little bit expanding my research efforts.  And one of the reasons--one of the things I, I really like about the academic environment is that I can be a lot more creative on the things that I work with and do.  It doesn't have to be--so at JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California] it pretty much had to have a space focus.  And I love space.  I love sci-fi.  But it just meant that when you thought of problems and you thought of solutions, just because you're in that environment, you thought of problems and solutions in the space domain.  So, you know, I--you think of, okay, what is the problem with, you know, going to Mars or going to Europa.  You never thought about any other problems 'cause you--wasn't a need to.  So when I came here, you know, you start sitting back.  And that's when I really started thinking about all the old science fiction and the things that I love.  I said, you know, I now have the freedom to do anything.  I mean, it's basically a blank slate to do anything that you want that's in your head.  So, I like that.  And so I've actually expanded just--I--so most of my robots still learn, not all of them, but most of them learn.  All of them are intelligent.  But now some of them interact with people as well.  So not only do they have to be intelligent and they have to learn but now that have to do it where there's a human person that they have to respond to and get feedback from.  So that's a whole 'nother area.  And in my domain it's called human robot interaction.  But it's a, it's a different domain than the one I was used to primarily at JPL, when I was at JPL.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you were the founder of the, in 2005 here, of the Human Automation Systems Laboratory, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that's an acronym--HumAnS.
Speaker 2: HumAnS.  Yeah, just--again, it's, it's an acronym because doing robots and humans together and so it's just a little spin on the words.
Story_ID: 30814
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I guess from--usually on CNN [Cable News Network] for some reason I've seen the result of Japanese research in robotics and, and they've got this white robot that can do the moonwalk like Michael Jackson.
Speaker 2: (laughter)
Speaker 1: He can do different things.  Have you seen--did you see that?
Speaker 2: Yes, the Asimov robot.
Speaker 1: Yeah, is that's what it's called--the Asimov robot?
Speaker 2: Yes, they have the Asimov.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And there's a couple of other ones, but Asimov's the most famous.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that--is that--but you all see the Japanese attempts to make a robot look like a human being.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And are--you don't see that so much coming from other countries.  It seems like it's a particular interest of the Japanese to--
Speaker 2: So one, it's not to--it's, it's Asia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you also see it in researchers from Korea as well as China.  So I think it's, it's a--something in mostly in Asia.  And there's a reason for that.  It's kind of where health funding in the reason for robotics.  So in Asia the reason why they started investing in robotics is because they have, basically they don't have immigration.  So they are in-house.  So they pretty much have a collective.  And what they saw a while ago was that--and the United States were having it, too--but at some point the number of people who require assistance, i.e. retired, is gonna outweigh the number of people who can provide.  So we're not even talking about workers.  We're talking about, you know, you have a population of a million and seven hundred thousand of them need assistance from three hundred thousand.  So the numbers don't add up.  So the Asian countries actually at the government level started investing in robotics, started investing in assistive robotics to help in this domain.  That's one of the reasons why they look so humanoid is 'cause the concept is is that these would be assistants to the elderly, those who need some assistance, the disabled.  So that was the goal.  And so, if you are in a home, if you're working in these type of environments, you probably need to have the same capability as a human.  So you probably need two arms and the hands and you need to walk.  And so that was really the motivation why they have humanoid.  And the other thing is that the government set aside a large, large amount of money to different companies to fund robotics research, which is different than the U.S.  So our U.S., most of the robotics funding came from NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] and the military.  And so most of our robotics here is highly intelligent but roves because we're looking at those two as our primary funding source.
Speaker 1: We have a--they're more deadly, I guess, in some ways, I guess, and--
Speaker 2: No, even if you take away--really focus on the technology that--so in the military you need robots that can go out in the field.  And so if you're talking about the field, you can't do walkers.  You need things that can rove.  But they have to be intelligent.  So our robots, I will say, are more intelligent than the ones in, say, Japan because ours--a home you can model.  So, you know, you go into your home and it's pretty much the same today as it was yesterday.  When you're out in the field, when you're out on Mars, when you're out anywhere-, Afghanistan, today it's gonna look much different than tomorrow as well as the next day.  And so you have to have the ability to figure out things in real time.  So our robots are much more intelligent but they're typically, you know, on four-wheel--are on four, yeah, four wheels or six wheels or track, that kind of thing.  So it's just, it's--it really at the end of the day it comes with who funded the robotics research.  And that's kind of where we are today.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And, mobility, I think the U.S. is flying a lot of drones now (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes, so we have--so aerial we--so aerial and ground we dominate.  Humanoids--that's Asia.  So that's pretty much the domains that have arisen at least in the robotics research areas.
Story_ID: 30815
Speaker 1: Okay, and I know a couple of years ago it was, or was it last year, that Google had the car, had a robotic, well, a car that could actually steer itself--is it GPS [global positioning system] but it also with--
Speaker 2: Yes, it's automated.
Speaker 1: --driving (unclear)--
Speaker 2: It's automated.
Speaker 1: Yeah, automated to stop at--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --stop signs and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so some of that, just the history about that--so DARPA [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency], again, which is a military agency, a funding agency, sponsored something called the Grand Challenge in Robotics.  And the Grand Challenge in Robotics was basically an open competition to anyone in the United States to build a robotic car that can navigate in city streets and follow the, the rules of the, the law, rules of the road.  So stop sign--you know, you stop.  If, you know, two cars come, the one on the right goes first.  If there is, you know, a car in front of you, you should keep, you know, car length distance based on speed.  And so a number of teams competed.  And the team that won was actually out of Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California] and so Google and Stanford paired up.  And so that's kind of where that technology came from.  So, again, the initial technology came from and funded by, of course, DARPA or the military.
Speaker 1: Do you see that as the future of driving?  I mean, in this country--
Speaker 2: Components, yes--not fully autonomous.  And, and it's only because what they found.  So the very first autonomous car was fully autonomous that drove cross country was--came out of CMU [Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  This was in the late nineties [1990s], early 2000.  So this is, you know, a good ten years ago.
Speaker 1: So who do you know up there--I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Carnegie Mellon University--
Speaker 1: Oh, Carnegie Mellon--
Speaker 2: --with a couple of partners.
Speaker 1: --in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Pittsburgh.  And so they had a car drive autonomously from Pittsburgh to California.  And as soon as was complete, they basically pulled the plug because they realized that there was so many social issues involved with it that couldn't be resolved at that time.
Speaker 1: I just wonder if there were a little issues because a car--
Speaker 2: That's part of it--
Speaker 1: --can't have a driver's license--
Speaker 2: --The social issues are--
Speaker 1: --I mean, a--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, that's it.  So the social issues are the ones that deal with liability, deal with, well, if you have robotic drivers and human drivers, who gets the right of way.  So all of these things that deal with our social, our culture, our society, you know.  It's--if the robot car kills somebody, who's at fault?  Those issues they didn't have answers to and they were so deep that they said, you know, it doesn't make sense to even propose this.  But, some of things that came out of this--that research--and that's what I was saying about the car now that they have the system where it can back up into the space.  That was some of the stuff that derived from some of that research.  And so what you're starting to see are the beeping, you know, the thing where you beep up and if it's as you get closer it goes beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep.  So, what's nice about it is that even though you don't have the autonomous car, a lot of the technology that was developed from that got put into our cars of the future.  Cruise control--so now you have adaptive cruise control.  It's not just, you know, cruise control--I hit it at fifty [50 mph].  It's--I hit it at fifty [50 mph], but, if I'm in traffic, it actually adapts and will slow down.  All of that is derived from that early research.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it's good to work on it.  But, again, you're not gonna see the full renditions of what we do.  You're gonna see components of it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's the high-end car, Mercedes, is that, that senses when there's gonna be impact with another car and--
Speaker 2: Yes, and it's--
Speaker 1: --slows down and breaks before.
Speaker 2: Right.  So those are examples of this, this intelligence in the navigation, robotic navigation world.
Story_ID: 30816
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And your research here [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia], has it been on mobility and intelligence as it relates to that or, well, human interactions (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Right.  So I have two areas of research.  One is because I come from the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] world.  When I first came here it was--that's what I knew.  And so some of my research, about half my research deals with how do you design a robot to go into hazard environments for earth scientists.  So I designed robots that go into glacier fields.  I work with scientists that do modeling of the climate.  They're looking at climate change, and they're looking at how the ice sheets are melting in Antarctica and Greenland.  And so what I'm doing is build robots that can be deployed in these areas to grab the data that the scientist needs to understand what's going on with our environment.  And so that's related to the NASA work.  So I do, you know, autonomous navigation, perception of traversability, terrain, and that project's called SnoMotes.  So that's the SnoMotes project.
Speaker 1: And you have a picture of one here and (laughter)--
Speaker 2: That's the SnoMote.
Speaker 1: And, yes, so, you know, has it been used in the Arctic yet?
Speaker 2: No, but we have gone to the glaciers.  So we've gone to, every year we've gone to a different glacier.  So we've gone to Byron Glacier [Alaska], Mendenhall Glacier [Alaska], Lemon Creek Glacier [Alaska], not in that order, but Mendenhall, Lemon Creek, then Byron Glacier.  And so we, we've grabbed data to determine feasibility.  So some of the next steps that are required--so these, the current versions, aren't long life.  They last a couple of hours.  To really have a fully deployed system, they have to last, you know, months.  So we have to do things like deal with how do you do power management.  Because they're gonna be in these environments for extended periods of time, you can't recharge your battery.  So what kind of power do you have to think about?  We have to look at how do you maintain heat of the electronics and the sensors.  And so these are all the--for us deploying and we've deployed for hours, you know, the cold.  It gets cold, but things don't freeze.  But in these environments they will if you're out there for months.  So these are more of the--I would say we have to look now at the mechanical issues.  We've figured out how to make it autonomous.  We figured out how to make it work.  We figured out how to make more than one of them work 'cause we have multiple units.  So we've figured out the algorithm side.  Now it's a mechanical side, i.e. now that we have it, how do you make it so it's robust and feasible in long term and has long life.  Those aren't as much research problems as engineering kind of manufacturing problems.
Story_ID: 30817
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, so this--is this--would you consider this your major project here at the Georgia Tech so far?
Speaker 2: It was.  Now I'm starting--so I would say that's, that was the bread and butter.  Now my bread and butter has started to transition to do robots for children with disabilities.  So we're working with some therapists that work with children with Down's syndrome, children with cerebral palsy.  And what we're trying to do is basically how do you design a robot as a toy that can assist the therapist in diagnosis and intervention for children.  And so, as an example, when you have a child with cerebral palsy, typically it's the--they say hemiplegic.  It means that half their body's affected.  So they have an involved hand.  And typically what happens is in a, in a session with a therapist, what the therapist will do is they'll use--they'll, they'll force them to use they're involved hand so that they gain strength, they, they gain hand-eye coordination.  But what happens is is when they go home, you know, like most parents, I mean, I suffer from this, too--you know, your child goes, oh, I don't want to use it. It hurts. I don't want to do it anymore.  You're like, okay, just do two.  You don't have to do the full fifteen cycles.  And so what happens is the next time your child goes to his therapist--one of the things about this repetitive therapy is that it needs to be continuously repeated.  And, I mean, healthcare--you can't see the therapist every day.  You just--it's not possible.  So what can we do to provide a therapist solution in the home?  And so, again, our philosophy is, well, robots--we can monitor and we have vision.  But how would you get the child to use this robot as a toy is if you encode certain behaviors in the robot that matches with the objectives.  As an example, if you are trying to get the child to use the involved hand and say they're playing with some blocks, maybe what you have to do, robot do is take a block and have the robot grab the block and go directly to the involved hand and then say, you know, pick me up.  Well, now, if the robot is blocking you, you can't really do--and, again, now you're like, oh, I guess I'm gonna try to grab it here 'cause it's close enough.  And so putting those type of objectives it requires you, the robot to be very intelligent.  It requires the robot to do learning.  It also requires the robot to figure out how do you get certain behaviors out of the child that's necessary to achieve the objectives.  It's the most exciting work I've done.  It's probably the most difficult because there is no example.
Speaker 1: Okay, we have to pause here again.  Yeah, that does sound exciting.
Story_ID: 30818
Speaker 1: Okay, well, so the project you're working on with, to help--
Speaker 2: The children with disabilities.
Speaker 1: --children with disabilities.  That's the most exciting thing you've done so far in a sense.
Speaker 2: Because it's the most challenging.  I think it's the, it's the challenge that excites me.  It's also--I'm learning as much as my students are learning.  I'm learning from therapists.  The therapists are learning from me.  And so we're all trying to figure it out together, which is a nice, it's a nice place to be.  It's kind of frightening, but it's a nice place to be in terms of expanding your mind and your capabilities.
Story_ID: 30819
Speaker 1: Okay, now recently, too, I guess in 2010 you were appointed chair of the robotics Ph.D. program [at Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia]--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --so that means you'll be guiding the careers of people coming into this department.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So we started the program--I guess we've spent three years now.  So I was part of the original committee to get the program approved.  And so what happens is it's an interdisciplinary robotics program.  We have five involved units.  So we have computer science.  We have electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, aerospace, and biomedical engineering.  And so the way that the program works is that when you apply you have a home school, but then your courses, your course curriculum, is all the same, are similar, among all the students.  And so we now have about on the average about thirty students that are in the program--different levels but mainly they're in their, I guess, anywhere from their third to their first year.  And they're all focused on robotics.  And so my, my role in the program and my, my legacy I hope is one, I'll be the chair that graduates the first batch of these Ph.D. professionals.  So with that it comes with--like any new program there's always things that don't quite work the way you thought they should.  So what--a lot of the things that I've been doing in my first year has been coming up with the regulations for all these things that haven't worked in the past and coming up with a program that's sustainable.  Because what we're finding is that there's--when we first wrote the proposal we thought we'd have maybe five Ph.D. students a year.  We thought it was gonna be fairly small.  We're averaging about ten a year, which means that when we're at steady-state, which is about five years, we'll have fifty, and this is for a new program.  So, if you imagine if the projection could be a lot greater.  And so--
Speaker 1: How many programs are in the country?  I mean, you know, I imagine MIT's [Massachusetts Institute of Technology's, Cambridge, Massachusetts] got one and there's probably, I don't know----
Speaker 2: So, specifically in robotics--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --there's only four if you include us, and they're not at the Ph.D. level.  So CMU [Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] has a robotics Ph.D., but it's in computer science.  UPenn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] has a robotics master's, and that is interdisciplinary.  It's at the master's level.  And then there's a program in--oh, I can't remember--I think it's either Colorado or Ohio that's a master's.  It's a certificate, master's certificate, in robotics.  And then us.
Story_ID: 30820
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  With the, well, with all the people in robotics and new Ph.D.s joining the fray here, what are the limits?  I mean, are there any limits to what a robot can do?  We just recently saw a Watson IBM computer defeat all the, I mean, the champions of Jeopardy on television.
Speaker 2: (laughter) Right.
Speaker 1: And you were explaining what that was about.  I mean, it wasn't really about new technology so much as--
Speaker 2: Access.  So, one of the things about, you know, we're saying intelligence--and so intelligence is one of the key concepts that we learn when we teach, you know, what AI [artificial intelligence] is is about--search.  And so the--there's a theory that if you had unlimited computation power and unlimited memory and unlimited space, that you can pretty much solve any problem that exists.  I mean, not world problems, but any physical problem, you know, that requires you to think about, you know, solution.  Of course, we don't have unlimited space and we don't have unlimited computation and we can't access the data.  And so that has limited our capability to have true intelligence.  Because we are intelligent and why we are intelligent is our brain has, you know, instantaneous access to information.  And so what Watson was doing is was taking some technology that's been in existence for a while, but it was able to access the data required to think at a much faster rate, which made it able to be more intelligent than the prior version because it just had more data that it could go through and process and not seem to take forever with it.  And so one of the things is that as our computers get faster and our memory size gets larger, we're gonna be able to do more intelligent things just because the hardware exists.  In fact, some of the technology that we're coming up with on a robotics platform, some of them, some of the theories existed ten years ago, but they just couldn't make it happen.  You know, it's like here's the theory, here's the mathematical equations, but we can't program it because it doesn't work.  But we're now getting to the point where we're starting to be able to convert some of those theories that have existed for a while and making them a reality because now, you know, the hardware exists.  We can compute these, these very difficult mathematical equations, we can compute them in, you know, millisecond time.  So now it becomes feasible.  So just based on the hardware you're gonna see a lot of things come true, come to fruition just because the hardware is now there to do it, the computing hardware and the platforms.
Speaker 1: And the new materials, I guess, too, that--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --are available now and nanotechnology.
Speaker 2: Nano-, exactly.  Yeah, and that's gonna be a whole 'nother era of things that gonna come out as that gets more mature.
Story_ID: 30821
Speaker 1: All right.  Human beings react to artificial intelligence in different ways and fear being the first, (chuckle) the most dominant way I guess that's portrayed in the movies that--and, and we all remember HAL 9000 in '2001:  A Space Odyssey' taking over the computer.  And he's a mainframe, though, (unclear).
Speaker 2: (chuckle) Right.
Speaker 1: He takes over the, the vessel and got people--I was reading, I think, in 'Discover [Magazine]' that the Japanese robots that are life-like, the most--there's a certain point where, if they're not done just right, they just frighten people to death 'cause they're not quite human, but they're not--people don't know what to make of them--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --'cause they don't really react like a human.  So they're really trying to fine-tune them to--
Speaker 2: Right.  So in the robotics world there's something called the "uncanny valley."  And the "uncanny valley"--again, it's a philosophy, but that there's human perception about robotics.  And there are some--as an example, puppeteers, for example.  There are certain puppets that freak people out.  So, some marionette puppets--they're just like, oh, that's creepy, because they're actually in this "uncanny valley."  What happens is when people see certain physical realizations of things, they have certain expectations.  And when those expectations are violated, it makes them feel a little creepy.  As an example, if, if I said--it's like the stuffed animals.  So imagine, you know, your pet, you know, Rudolf, who's your dog, you know, dies and gets stuffed, which happens--people stuff their animals.  And imagine it's stuffed and you know it's dead and I decide to come in and, and put some animatronics in it, which we can definitely do.  There's nothing that says we can't do this.  Now my previously alive dog that's been stuffed is moving around.  This will freak some--we can do this!  But do we?  No, because it's just--that's like, oh, that's just too weird.  That's just--that's like a dead corpse.  So there's this valley called the "uncanny valley."  And in robotics there's no one in the U.S. that works in that, in that arena.  But there are plenty of people overseas, specifically in Asia, that work in that arena.  We have a, a domain in robotics called geminoids.  And geminoids fall in this "uncanny valley."  A geminoid is a robotic replica of someone who is alive.  So basically they've developed, you know, the robotic is an animatronic system, but then they put in a skin, so artificial skin, that looks like someone who exists.  And this actually falls in the "uncanny valley."  And they do studies.  So they've shown studies of how children react, how adults react.
Speaker 1: Would they create a geminoid that looks like someone they know?
Speaker 2: That, yeah--when they create a geminoid that looks someone you know.  And in--they've actually--some of the studies have shown that children are more adaptable to the geminoid concept.  What happens is they've shown that when children first enter the room with a geminoid there is this kind of like, ooh, what's this?  But as the geminoid interacts with them, they start to basically remove their disbelief and start to interact with them, as if this, this was a real person.  It's almost like, oh, this is just a surrogate, oh.  And they start treating the geminoid the same way they treat the person that they knew.  With adults it's different.  Adults actually never get to that stage.  They just always like, uh, that's just freaky and I, I just can't deal with it.  So there's some, there's some studies in terms of psychologically why that is.  Why do children adapt to it versus humans?  But there are people--there's also some research where they're designing robot babies that--again this is in this "uncanny valley" where the robots act like babies.  So--and, you know, they have models of, you know, how do babies engage.  Eyes--how do they do gaze tracking, how do they move.  And so they've taken these models and have put them on a robotic platform.  So you have this robot that looks like a--and it's designed as a huge baby that moves and acts and cries just like a baby.  It freaks people out.  And their goal is, if we want robots to learn like people, well, why don't we start them in the learning process as a baby.  So that's their philosophy.  Therefore, we evolve their brain through the experiences, and now we have a model of a robot brain and now we can use the evolved robot brain for our adult robots.  So that's some of the philosophy there.  Again, it's in this "uncanny valley" of, you know, that's a little creepy.  But there's researchers that work in that domain.
Speaker 1: Okay, have you ever been creeped out by some robotic exper-, model or--
Speaker 2: No, only because this is my area.  And so I know what's behind the curtain--like 'The Wizard of Oz.'  I know what's behind the curtain, so it's--I, I can't suspend disbelief.  I can't just say, you know, take it for face value.  I'm always analyzing and assessing it.  And, you know, I'm the one that's like, oh, let me feel the skin.  Uh, no, that doesn't feel like skin.  So that's the (laughter)--that's me versus, you know, someone else.  So I'm much more--I analyze it because it's my field, and I'm interested in it.  So, yeah, nothing has, yeah, creeped--even in the animatronic world, I haven't been creeped out quite yet.  I've been fascinated, like, oh wow, how did they do that.  And then I'm like, oh, it's fake, or usually it's fake.  So then I've been disappointed.  But, that's about the closest I've been to having a different sensation.
Story_ID: 30822
Speaker 1: Okay, is there, there any--I know in--there's a movie, the movie version, the latest movie version of 'I, Robot' featured Will Smith as a--
Speaker 2: Yes, the emotional robot.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, Will Smith hated robots.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And he, he had this hate, you know.  Is there--you know, Detroit [Michigan] auto workers hate--their former auto workers hated the robots, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, they despised--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But is there any study about how African Americans react to the concept of a robot?
Speaker 2: Um, no.  And it's only--well, let me rephrase that.  There have been studies on how people in general react to robots, depending on what their--assistive robotics, depending on what their capability is.  And how much a--there's been studies on what's called robot trust.  How much do people trust a robot?  And they, and they've shown that at certain levels of behaviors a person will lose trust.  For example, a person who--if a person has to have a robot to, say, stay in their home, they're much more accepting versus if it's optional.  So things like that--that the level of trust actually increases depending on their dependency, on the functionality of the robot.  They haven't done it based on culture.  They typically base it on robot attributes.  You know, like, I have these general class of people, I have these general class of robots that can do certain things, and what is the trust factor or acceptance factor.  None that I know of based on specific cultures, specific genders, even specific age besides the children versus adults.  And I think it's because we're still kind of far away from fully, from a full robotic system.  And human studies are more in the domain of the U.S.--in general, since we don't really have a whole bunch of humanoids, there's not a lot of human studies associated with that as well.
Speaker 1: I know one of the oddest features of that movie with Will Smith was that his aunt has a ro-, his grandmother had a robot in the house doing domestic chores and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember that.
Speaker 1: --it was very similar like, you know, she was the typical, you know, older black woman in her home and this robot--in that case that one went haywire, but that--
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: --yeah, but it was just--
Speaker 2: All of them went haywire, but
Story_ID: 30823
Speaker 1: Now you teach a course on, where you start off with Isaac Asimov's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I teach a graduate robotics course.  And one of the things that I want to teach the future generation of robotics scientists is the fact that robots are going to be integrated in our society.  And so just because we can do it doesn't mean we should.  So this is--we talk about things like the "uncanny valley."  We talk about Isaac Asimov's three rules of robotics and then the expanded and then the modified version of the laws of robotics.
Speaker 1: Well, what are those rules that are, yeah, those are laws--
Speaker 2: So basically in terms of summarizing, you know, thou--the robot should not hurt a human being.  If they--a robot should obey a human being.  If they're given a command by a human that hurts a human being, that's where the conflict comes, but then they shouldn't do it.  So, that's kind of the summary.  And then the modified version add some things about--so we're designing robots for the military.  Concepts you might design robots that are police officers.  Based on Isaac's [Isaac Asimov] laws, you can't do that.  So how do you design these things like military type of robotics and police type of robotics and things like, CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] type of robotics, and still have a, you know, conscious robot engineer do this?  And so there's some modified rules.  For example, there's a professor actually here that's designing--he's trying to figure out how do you take the Kaneva (ph.) [Geneva] Convention or the rules of war and rules of engagement--how do you put them in the framework of [Isaac] Asimov's laws and program your robot.  So these are some of the modifications that say, okay, when Asimov was writing this, he was thinking about robot assistance, specifically in, you know, the home, factory.  But there's a lot more applications for robotics that are being used.  So how do you meld the two and still have a, again, ethically-conscious type of robotic scientist as well as a robotic that you build and design.
Speaker 1: Okay, so ethical and--are--is there--I know it's probably not true in the scientific community, but in the gen-, popular culture community, there are probably people that have ethical problems with even the existence of a robot, even a very intelligent robot, they would probably think would be, I guess, in some way in violation of their religious beliefs or--have you had any of those kinds of discussions with people?
Speaker 2: So the only discussions I've had have been robots and jobs.  So that's, that's the dominant one--is robots--if you design a robot, it's gonna take over a job.  So that's, that's I would say by far is the most dominant one.  And the second one is robots controlling the world--that you're gonna make them so smart that they're gonna say, you know what, I'm smarter than these people that built me.  Why am I not ruling the world?  So those are the two main dominant opinions I've heard.  I haven't heard so much about robots against beliefs or religious beliefs or (unclear).
Speaker 1: Well, the whole idea that you can create something that, you know--you can create a human, something that's human--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I haven't heard--and it might be because people still know it's a robot.  We haven't created, say, Data from 'Star Trek.'  We, we, we haven't gotten to that point yet.  When we get closer, maybe these will be issues.  But, I mean, even if you look at the geminoids--as a adult, you know it's not human.  I mean, even though it's uncanny because it looks sort of human and it does sort of human things, at the end of the day you're like it's not human.  And just it's--the skin is too pasty.  It still moves a little bit too jerky.  There, there's still this I know it's not human.  And we get to the point that it is, you know, then maybe they'll--it's, it's almost like if you go to the wax museum.  They're really good, really good renditions.  And if you kind of look at the side of your eyes, you know, sometimes you're like, oh, that's really Michael Jackson.  But, once you start staring at him, it looks like a wax.  I mean, it looks like a wax figure.  No matter how good the technology is, it still doesn't look a hundred percent human.  And I--so I think that's maybe why I don't hear those arguments just because it's, you know, it's like arguing about cloning before, you know, the lamb issue started.  People didn't argue about cloning until they actually cloned.  And then it was like, oh my gosh, this is, this is serious.  But before that there was never a discussion about cloning 'cause people thought it was impossible.  You know, they didn't realize that you could actually clone.  So I think that, I'm not saying the issue won't come up, it just hasn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now we're discussing robot philosophy.
Speaker 2: Robot philosophy.
Speaker 1: For those who are watching this in the future we are discussing ro-, the philos-, the philosophical aspects--
Speaker 2: Of robotics.
Speaker 1: --of robotics.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Story_ID: 30824
Speaker 1: Okay.  These are things that people think about when they think of robots and their use.  And as, as a expert in robotics and a young person now who's gonna see a lot of changes in the future, what do you think is gonna be the most dramatic change we're gonna see in terms of robotics in the future?
Speaker 2: I truly believe that our kids, and I would say elementary school kids, by the time they're in their forties and fifties, everyone will have a robot.  Now what that robot is--it might be a humanoid, it might just be, you know, a little backpack toting robot that carries their books from class to class with them.  It might be a little crawler that helps them write their homework--not quite sure.  But I think from that generation--and the only reason I say this is because I think--if I think back thirty years, what technology existed thirty years ago and what technology is just accepted, people won't even think about the fact that, you know, you have a cell phone that can connect to the internet that can track where your location is, that you can look at your mom, you know, in Europe, you know.  Thirty years ago, I mean, pagers were just like for, you know, the rich and famous.  And so I, I look at that transition.  Hybrid cars, you know, versus, you know, the standard Ford--I mean, that's not thirty years, but, if you look at the transitions in technology--and so if I project what has happened in the computing industry and the hardware industry in my life and I put that into robotics, I could see the fact that everyone will have their own personal robotic system.
Story_ID: 30825
Speaker 1: Okay.  We always ask this question:  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My biggest concern is--so it's--I would say it's a concern about the African American community because typically we take on the worst of the U.S. types of things.  For example, math and science overall in the U.S. is falling behind, which means that in the African American community, it's really falling behind.  And so I, I think it's like, if we can solve it for the African American community, it helps everyone.  So my biggest fear is that we'll fall behind.  We'll only be users of technology and not developers.  And so--really big example:  So some of the first work in robotics dealt with following people.  So imagine you're a nurse in a hospital and you are trying to deliver some medicine or bed sheets or something like that.  And so you have a robot follow the person.  The way that the researchers, and even now, the way that the researchers identify people is by skin color.  Do you know what skin color they used?  Well, it's not my skin color.  So now, if this is technology that gets deployed, you have a whole class of people who, if they have any type of pigment, that they can't have the robot do anything.  So this is an example of--and, again, as a researcher you don't think anything about it because you're saying, okay, I need to make my robot.  Okay, let me take a picture.  Oh, the dominant color is, you know, non-pigment skin.  So, I mean, that's just a simple example.  And so my fear is that if we don't get sufficient African American students involved in the development process, we're gonna have a whole slew of applications that are out there that will be used of and not very good users because there won't be, it won't cater to the needs of the community directly.  We're far, we'll fall way, way, way behind.  And the problem with math and science, unlike reading--so the social sciences, you can pick up a book and you could say, okay, I, I didn't study history.  I can read a few books and get the gist of, you know, U.S. world history.  Problem with math and science is that you can't at the age of thirty say, you know what, I just want to pick this stuff up.  You have to be trained in it.  It's, it's a thinking process.  It's a building process.  It's an experience.  And the more you do it, the better you are.  And so the issue with math and science is that even if you have a knack for it--so--and a lot of our kids have knacks, you know.  They, they, they're good at it.  So you--it's like, they're good at math.  They're good at science.  Thing is is that if you don't keep using it and improving on it, you, you won't actually be good at it.  You'll know the basics, but you won't be able to stew anything with it.  Unlike reading, you know, you read and, and, you know--I don't read that much, but I'm pretty sure I could pick up a hundred, two hundred, three hundred page novel, and I could probably still read it, even though, you know, now I don't read for leisure.  It's not a skill that you lose and once you learn the basics pretty much that's it, the basics.  So that's my biggest fear is that we're far, we'll fall too far behind.
Speaker 1: The technology's advancing and we're not keeping up.
Speaker 2: We're not keeping up.  And technology is advancing so fast that you have to keep up in order to even be in the running.  It goes with that line I was talking about when I was starting at school is that, you know, my starting line, you know, it was a gap.  Well, with technology is that gap just becomes bigger, not because of your economics or your social or your gender or your race, it becomes bigger based on your knowledge of technology.  The more you know about it, the bigger the gap could be.
Story_ID: 30826
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently now if you could?
Speaker 2: (pause) So, there's nothing I would differently.  I think I would have been a different person if I was born ten years later just because--for example, I probably would have been a biomedical engineer in robotics, but biomedical engineering didn't exist.  I might have been a computer scientist if I'd gone to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] versus Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island] because computer science wasn't that--robotics wasn't in computer science at Brown, but it was at MIT.  So just little things that I might have been a different person if I'd come, you know, ten years later.  But I can't say I would change anything at least in my career or my path.  And most of it's hindsight.  It's like, oh, you know, that experience led to, you know, this opportunity.  And that other experience led to this opportunity.  And so everything is intertwined.  And like I said even my decisions weren't, you know, they were, they were logical from a social-emotional point of view.  They weren't logical from a, you know, I should go to the, you know, you know MIT and Brown.  And, if you think about it, if that was a decision for most people, MIT, world renowned for science and engineering, Brown, saying it's Ivy League but, you know, that's a liberal arts school.  Why would you not take MIT full ride over Brown when you had to--still paying the loans.  Again, but I think Brown made me a better person.  It made me want to do things like the human-robot interaction and work with children with disabilities because I look at the social impli--I don't think I would have been as concerned about the ethical considerations or the social implications of robotics if I hadn't gone to Brown.  If anything, Brown was a very, you know, socialistic--I mean, we had people there that were filthy rich and you would never know it because they were just, you know, hey, I'm here because I believe in, you know, green.  Brown was green before green became popular.  I think that kind of attitude is part of why I am who I am.  So, yeah, I can't think of anything I would actually change.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you look out into the future, what, what's your--what do you ideally want to do?  What's your sense of all of that accomplishment as a scientist?
Speaker 2: Besides the Nobel Peace Prize, what's attainable, which I believe is attainable--so in terms of career I would say accolades would be National Academy of Engineering, National Academy of Science.  Those are, in my domain, those are the, you know, those are the highest things you can get in engineering and science that says, oh, you're an expert in this area.  So that's definitely--and those are attainable.  I see no problem.  It's just a matter of at what age.  But I see those as attainable.  Nobel Peace Prize I actually have to do research that means something, that changes the world.  Attainable or not?  Not quite sure since my research is always revolving.  So that would be--linking to my research, what I want is to actually create and invent something that gets deployed in the real world and makes a difference in, you know, multiple someone's lives.  That's really the ultimate goal of, you know, oh wow, I actually made a difference in that child's life, oh, and that child's life, and that child's life.  And so I think that would be the, the ultimate to say, you know what, I actually did it.  I took what was in my head and made the reality to, to assist someone else.
Speaker 1: So would it be fair to say that when you started doing this research it was doing it for JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California] everything was focused on military and it seems like now sense you have control, more control, your focus is more on children and--
Speaker 2: And people, yeah, I--
Speaker 1: --and people and--
Speaker 2: And people, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 30828
Speaker 1: All right.  Now this is a, seems like a--but it's not that dumb of a question now because you've done so much and you've received so many awards, but what today would you consider to be your legacy today?
Speaker 2: (laughter) So my legacy--I think there's two.  In terms of my research, people know me as a space robotics person.  And so, if you want to know about space and robotics, you call up Dr. Howard.  So I know that that's what people know me for.  They're starting to get to know me for my human-robot interaction work.  And, again, it's because one I've been working in for ten years, the other one for five, so--.  But I'm starting to be called, like, oh, I, you know, I saw your stuff.  I heard you do this work with children.  Oh, you know, that sounds interesting.  So it's not a legacy, but it's starting to become one.  So that's in terms of the research.  In terms of the students I know I'm educating sufficient students.  I know that some of the students I touch are starting to make a difference.  I just don't know how much of a difference.  And it's because I've, I haven't lived long enough to see them become the experts in their field.  You know, I need at least another ten years before the students that I've taught, even when I was at JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California], the students that I've mentored are getting their Ph.D.s and going on and continuing and, and doing these good things, so--.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you, your parents [Eric Conway MacCalla and Johnetta MacCalla], are--they're still alive, aren't they?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Are your parents still alive?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they are.  Both of them are.
Speaker 1: Well, they've, they've had a chance to see their daughter actually replicate what they've done in a lot of ways--go to same schools, get a similar degree, and then going on into new frontiers of science?  Are they--how do they feel?
Speaker 2: Oh, they're tickled pink.  Yeah, they're, they're--my dad's [Eric Conway MacCalla] one that as soon as he finds out something, he tells the whole world, like random people who I don't even know (chuckle).  He's--I know he's proud.  I know he's very proud.  And, you know, no one knows what your--again, you're always--I think one of the things that you're always proud when the people that you touch and the people that you teach (and, of course, my parents were my first teachers) go on and succeed.  It just makes you, it d-, it makes you proud.  It makes you like, oh wow, hey, that's--I, I had a little bit of part in, in that creation.  So, yeah, I know that they're proud.  I know they're happy.  It's international so--example, I'm the first person besides when my grandfather came from or my great grandfather came from Jamaica, none of my family's traveled international--I mean, none of my immediate family, none of my extended family, you know.  So, you know, I'm the one that, you know, I go to China and I've gone to Japan and I've gone to Switzerland.  And so this is something that's totally different.  It's different to me.  And this is one of those experiences I don't have anyone to call and be like so how do you navigate?  You know, it's just like, okay, this is totally alien territory.  And so some of the things they live, they live through me as well 'cause it's like, oh wow, so, yeah.  So, they're, they're, they're pretty happy about it.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now do you have a family?
Speaker 2: I do.  I have one biological son and two step sons and a husband [Jose Torres], so--.
Speaker 1: Okay, so are your--your children must be small, I guess--
Speaker 2: No, so my step son is eleven going on twelve.  Then my son is eight going on nine.  And the youngest is seven going on eight.  I mean, so they're young, but they're not babies.
Speaker 1: Do they have an interest in science or--?
Speaker 2: The oldest two definitely do.  Youngest one I'm not quite sure.  But the oldest one definitely does.  In fact, my--so my two stepsons I--we do the rotation so, what, every other weekends, every other holidays, so I don't get to influence them as much.  But my son, I mean, I take him--like the kids at Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] know him 'cause I bring him to work and I take him to some of the activities I do with my students just because some of--like I'll take my students to the planetarium at Fernbank [Science Center, Atlanta, Georgia].  And so it's at night and it's like, yeah, sure, you know, let's come, 'cause he wants to.  And so he's experiencing--I take him to--we have robotic competitions.  I'll bring him along to the robotic competitions.  So he's being exposed at a very early age.  And he's really good at math.  Like he's good where the teachers are pulling me aside and say he's really g-, not so good at reading, but math, I mean, he's, he blows them away in the math, you know.  They're doing fractions now and the education system, I'm not quite sure, it seems much more accelerated than when I went to--but, no, they're doing fractions, and he's like, oh yeah, six over twelve--that equals one half.  And he just looks at it.  I'm like how did you figure that out?  And he's like I just know it.  So, he, he definitely has a knack for math.  But he wants to be a CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] agent.  That's his goal right now.
Speaker 1: Okay, Matthew [videographer], do we have time to ask the last question?
OFF-CAMERA-VOICE:  (unclear)
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  Well, we'll pause here--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 30830
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any questions that I should have asked and I didn't ask that we, we need to talk about right now before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay, well there's one question before I ask the last question I'll ask and that's about the Mars yard behind you.  And what is that we're looking at here?
Speaker 2: So the Mars yard--this is one of the images from the landing of Mars Exploration Rover so this was in 2004.  And so what you see is you see the Mars background.  And you see the--there's a path where the rover traversed across the land.  So this was after a few weeks, maybe a couple of months in terms of a traverse.  So that's an actual image from Mars.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So with our last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as, well, two things:  Someone who changed the world with her research and innovation and someone who changed the world with her wisdom.
Speaker 1: Those are two good things to be remembered for.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
