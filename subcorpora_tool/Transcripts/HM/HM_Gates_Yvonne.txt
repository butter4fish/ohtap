Story_ID: 666339
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Bobbie Jean Atkinson; and it's B-O-B-B-I-E, J-E-A-N, A-T-K-I-N-S-O-N [Bobbie Davis Atkinson].
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her place of birth was Warren, Arkansas, and she was born on 6/29/1933 [June 29, 1933].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How much do you know about it, and what were they doing, and?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side of the family, she had--her, her mother was Pearl Davis, and my grandfather was George Washington Davis [George Davis], and they're also from Warren, Arkansas.  And my mother had two sisters: Maydelle [Maydelle Davis (ph.)] and also Georgia Leigh [Georgia Davis (ph.)].  And they migrated from Warren, Arkansas, to Las Vegas [Nevada] in the early '50s [1950s]; and my mother was the first to come, and then the other part of the family--her, her mother and sisters migrated from Arkansas to Las Vegas.
Speaker 1: Now, what did they do in Arkansas?  Were they farmers or what (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My grandfather worked in a timber--worked in a timber mill, and my, my grandmother was a homemaker.  She was a homemaker all of her life.  But they migrated from there; and then my father went on to--my grandfather went on to work as a custodian in many of the hotels, and, and, eventually he went to work for Ronzoni [Ronzoni's, Las Vegas, Nevada], which was one of the large department stores, which is now Dillard's. Okay, okay.  It--was there a reason why they chose to come to Las Vegas?  Were there relatives already here or, or did they know somebody here, or?
Speaker 1: No, no.  They didn't know anyone, but that was the migration pattern for Arkansas.  Most people, you know, moved from Arkansas to Las Vegas because of the gaming industry, and you had the dam that was being built, and so forth; and so there were jobs here.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 666340
Speaker 1: So I take it there, there weren't--there was not as much opportunity in Arkansas you know, during those days?
Speaker 2: No.  There wasn't as much opportunity in Arkansas as it was here, so people were moving from, from the South to Las Vegas [Nevada] so that they can start new lives and so forth here in Las Vegas.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Arkansas was in the news in the 1950s because of the integration order at Little Rock high school [Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas], so that was--so some of the racial tension in Arkansas was very public in those days.
Speaker 2: Right.  And you didn't ha- you know, you didn't have it as much in Las Vegas.  Although, Las Vegas was called the Mississippi of the West, and so you had--a lot of the things that happened in the South, you know, pretty much happened in Las Vegas also.  African Americans couldn't stay in hotels if they were performing on the Strip [Las Vegas Strip, Las Vegas, Nevada] and those kinds of things.  They had to stay in the black community.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the opportunities were greater here, but the social relationship was--
Speaker 2: Had not changed (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) much the same.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  It had not changed.  It was pretty much the same.  And I remember as a kid, we used to go to the Moulin Rouge [Moulin Rouge Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada] and, and, and some of those places; and also down on, on Jackson Street, I remember Sammy Davis, Jr., coming in there.  My mom [Bobbie Davis Atkinson] would always take us to this little restaurant, and we would have hot chocolate, and you would see many of the entertainers 'cause that's where they lived.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  The--Las Vegas was a mecca for entertainers.  And you mentioned the Moulin Rouge.  Now, this was a--was this a black casino?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was a black casino and black perform- that's where many of the people performed when they left the Strip.  They would go--also go over there and perform.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Those are the days we had like all the top black entertainers on the Strip, right, performing. A lot, lot of them anyway.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Story_ID: 666341
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Eddie Atkinson, and he was born in--gosh, I'm trying to remember when was he born.  I believe it was in (pause)--
Speaker 1: Was he about the same age as your mom [Bobbie Davis Atkinson]?
Speaker 2: No.  He was, he was actually fourteen years--he was fourteen years older than, than my mom.  He was also born in Warren, Arkansas as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And he left and went into the [U.S.] military, and he stayed in the military for a while; and then he was discharged from--honorably discharged from the military, and he--
Speaker 1: So he's a World War II [WWII]--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's correct.
Speaker 1: --era vet [veteran].  Yeah.
Speaker 2: And he worked--when he left there, he worked in the construction fi- industry.  He built homes and anything that had to do with brick masonry, he was great at it, and that's what he did.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And so, so did he study brick masonry in, in high school in Arkansas, or?
Speaker 2: He must have--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause I, you know, I'm not exactly sure where he learned the skill from, but he was very skilled at doing that, and he had a twin sister, and then he had three other sisters as well.  And his, you know, grandfather--or hi- my grandfather was born in, what, 1847 I believe--or '79 [1979], 1879, and, you know, there were a lot of them.  There were like six kids, but his parents [Isophine Atkinson and Charlie Atkinson], you know, died at a, at a young age from what I'm told, of course.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But they, they all--they, too, moved from Arkansas to Las Vegas [Nevada] and also to California.
Story_ID: 666342
Speaker 1: Did you have any--did your father [Eddie Atkinson] have any stories?  Well, your parents, period--mother [Bobbie Davis Atkinson] and father have any stories about growing up in Arkansas they shared with you?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  They didn't--they never shared any stories about growing up in Arkansas.  Of course, you know, we've gone back and visited that--where they lived and so forth, but no real stories.  I guess all the stories occurred in Nevada because I could recall as a, as a child, you know, following my father around, my mother around and dealing with their siblings and, and so forth, my aunts; and not a lot of stories but just a lot of family activities, and they were very close.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I'm not sure.  They never talked about how they met, but they, they did meet in--my father and my, and my mother met in Las Vegas [Nevada], so they didn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --know each other.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they didn't--
Speaker 2: They didn't know each other.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: So they're from two different places in Arkansas.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  They did not know--they were both from Warren, Arkansas, but they didn't know each other; and they didn't meet until they, they met in Las Vegas.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  All right, all right.
Story_ID: 666343
Speaker 1: Well, when you think about your parents' personalities, their talents, what they look like--who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I would say my father [Eddie Atkinson] and his side of the family.  I look a lot like one of his sisters, and I certainly recall growing up--she lived in California, and I recall I would go and visit her every summer (laughter).  Every summer I would visit my aunt.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she was a big influence on you in?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, a big influence on me.
Speaker 1: Well, what, what was her name, and what did she do?
Speaker 2: Her name was Ruthann [Ruthann Atkinson (ph.)], and she was a homemaker, so she didn't do, you know, she didn't do anything except, you know, take care of the house and cook and so forth, but she was a lively person, let's put it that way.  She was a very lively person, and she was very outspoken.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And was that different from your parents?  I mean--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --or your mother [Bobbie Davis Atkinson]?
Speaker 2: My, my mother, my mother was very active in education, you know, wanting to make sure that, not just her children but other children had an opportunity to get a good education.  So she was very active, extremely active during those times in making sure that young kids in the African American community had good schools and was able to go to school and receive some of the same things that others--and I think that's what inspired me, probably, the most was the activism of my mother being involved and helping out in the--in that respect.
Story_ID: 666344
Speaker 1: So when you were growing up--so, so you have siblings, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, can you name your, your siblings from the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) I guess from the oldest one?
Speaker 2: --I have a brother.  His name was Eddie Atkinson.  He's deceased.  He deceased at thirty-eight [years old].  And then I have a sister by the name of Connie Atkinson, and then Isophine Atkinson, and then Deitra Atkinson; and I was the second oldest child.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, all right.  So, so the household consisted of your, your parents [Bobbie Davis Atkinson and Eddie Atkinson] and the children?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 666345
Speaker 1: Any grandparents live with you, or?
Speaker 2: Nope.  My [maternal] grandparents [Pearl Davis and George Davis]--but, boy, were they there (laughter).  My grandparents--actually when they moved to Las Vegas [Nevada] they purchased a house, and so we would visit and stay and so forth.  And because my father [Eddie Atkinson], because my father was in the construction business, every home that I ever lived in, my father built, and one of the homes that we had, it had apartments in the back, and so my, my grandparents lived there for a while; and then shortly thereafter, they purchased a--their own home.  And, you know, my father, the last--it was the, the last house that he built was in 1971, and prior to that, he had built two other homes that we--that he and my mother [Bobbie Davis Atkinson] lived in, and then we grew up in--in two of the homes.
Speaker 1: Now, you, you rarely hear today that people grow, grow up in a home that their father actually built.
Speaker 2: Yes, we still own it.
Speaker 1: So (unclear).
Speaker 2: We still own one of them.  We sold the other two, but we still own one of them.
Speaker 1: You think you're gonna hang onto it for?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We will definitely hang onto it.  One of my sisters lives in, in the house--the last house that my father built.  And I can honestly say I helped him (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Well, what part did you play?
Speaker 2: I used to carry the bricks for him (laughter).  When I was--I was the only one out of all the kids that was actually involved in the construction of that house with my father.  The other kids were--you know, they were young.
Speaker 1: So, so did he--he got work in the building industries in Las Vegas as--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He worked--I remember he worked for a company, and the owner of the company name was Ray Paglia.  I'll never forget that.  They build homes.  And so my father, he worked in the construction industry; and then at night, he worked for the school district [Clark County School District].  He was a custodian for the school district, so he worked in the school district industry as a custodian at night.
Speaker 1: Okay, two jobs.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He worked two jobs.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 666346
Speaker 1: Las Vegas [Nevada] established in 1905 has been steadily growing especially, you know, with the--I guess the onset of gambling, I guess, in the--was it late '40s [1940s], early '50s [1950s] that they really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --when the casinos started.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So it's been growing by leaps and bounds ever since.  And--but the black community, from what I understand, the Westside has not grown proportionately to the rest of Las Vegas--correct me if I'm wrong, so just kind of--now, you lived on the Westside, right?
Speaker 2: I lived on the Westside--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --all my life until, until I got--became an adult and then I moved, yes.
Speaker 1: Well, well, where did you live?  What was the name of your neighborhood?  And what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, growing up in West Las Vegas was, was not bad at all, at least for me.  One of the places that we used to visit all the time was Doolittle Park and doore- Doolittle recreational facility [Doolittle Community Center, Las Vegas, Nevada], and we would go there and play ball and run track and do all of those things.  And that park still exists today, and it's still called the exact same thing.  It has grown a little bit.  And we didn't have a lot of violence when I was growing up.  At least I didn't see it.  And I remember as a kid, we would play out in the street, you know, kickball and, and basketball and, and those kinds of things; and I grew up, you know, in the same--pretty much the same neighborhood.  We didn't--it wasn't called anything, but--like, like some of the other areas.  But I grew--the house in which my father [Eddie Atkinson] built that I grew up as a kid, a young kid, was less than a mile from where the other house that my father built.  So I grew up in the same neighborhood, went to the same school with the same people all my life.
Story_ID: 666347
Speaker 1: What was the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: The first school that I went to, which was a community school, was Madison Elementary School, and I remem- it's still there.  It's called Wendell P. Williams school [Wendell P. Williams Elementary School, Las Vegas, Nevada] now, but it was Madison when he was growing up.  And my school teachers, they all lived in the same neighborhood pretty much.  My first grade teacher still lives in the same house right across the street from the school.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  How--so, so was there a, was there a black high school and, and elementary school that fed into it in, in Las Vegas [Nevada], or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  We didn't have a black school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, you had busing and that was--my mother [Bobbie Davis Atkinson] was really active and involved in, you know, the busing.  So when I left elementary school I was bused out of the community.  We didn't have a junior high school.  We didn't have a high school.  We only had elementary schools that was in the predominantly black community; and if we went to high school and junior high, we had to be bused.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Before that, though, was there a black high school in, in the--on the Westside?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was the old Westside School [Historic Westside School, Las Vegas, Nevada].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was a West--it's called the Westside School, and they just preserved that two weeks ago, in fact, rebuilt it and so forth--but, yes.  My husband [Lee Gates] went to the old Westside School.  I--by the time I was in, in school, in high school [Ed W. Clark High School, Las Vegas, Nevada] and junior high school, you know, it was no longer in existence as a school.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, so this is in, in the '70s [1970s] when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So--
Speaker 2: In the late, late--in the '60s [1960s]--
Speaker 1: Late '60s [1960s], early--
Speaker 2: --seventies [1970s].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how did you like school?  Did you have a favorite subject?
Speaker 2: I think my favorite subject was more of English.  I loved English, loved reading.  And so I enjoyed, I enjoyed that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was one of my favorite subjects.
Speaker 1: All right.  Did, did you have any mentors in school, or, or special teachers that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I had a lot of special teachers, you know, my--again, my first grade teacher, which wa- her name was Lois Bolden--still alive today.  She was one of my favorite elementary teachers.  And then when I went on to high school, I had a Spanish teacher, Dr. Gordon [ph.], and, you know, he was great as a Spanish teacher; and I had a lot of great teachers gro- a lot of good influences growing up.
Story_ID: 666348
Speaker 1: Was church a big factor in growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.  Had to go to church every Sunday, and so I don't know if you realize it, but Las Vegas [Nevada] has more churches in West Las Vegas than they do anything, so there were a lot of churches around.  At that time, my mother [Bobbie Davis Atkinson] and father [Eddie Atkinson] both was a part of Second Baptist Church [Las Vegas, Nevada], and so we went to Second Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Was it a big church, or?
Speaker 2: It was a big church.  It was a very big church, and my dad was on the deacon--my mother was a usher at the church, and we had to go to church, had to go to bible study.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you play a--like any leadership roles as a youth in the church, or?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.  I--actually, I was a--really sort of shy, and so didn't you know--I stayed in the background pretty much, so.
Story_ID: 666349
Speaker 1: Were you shy at school, too?
Speaker 2: I was to a certain degree.  I loved sports, so I was really active in participating in sports--track and field, and basketball.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's--that was my, my out I guess, or my experience that opened me up.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right.  So, so in high school, you're, you're like bused to, you know, you're bused to--what was the name of the high school?
Speaker 2: The high school was Clark High School.
Speaker 1: Clark.
Speaker 2: I went to Ed W. Clark [Ed W. Clark High School, Las Vegas, Nevada].  Most--my neighborhood was zoned at that time for Las Vegas High [Las Vegas High School, Las Vegas, Nevada], and I wanted to meet new people, and I wanted to get a different experience; and so I asked my mom [Bobbie Davis Atkinson] to get me a zone variance so that I could go to Clark High School, and that's what I did.  I went to Clark.  So I had an opportunity to meet new people and do different things and I did that.  In fact, I was the senior vice president of my senior class in high school over at Clark.  So I got involved in, I guess, local high school politics and was involved in that respect.  I had clubs that I was involved in, African American clubs that we had and history clubs and so forth that we had in high school that I was involved in.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is when black studies was, was becoming popular as a--and this, this is a integrated school, right?  Clark?
Speaker 2: Yes, this is an integrated school, and everyone was bused to that school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: At least the African Americans were.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  So that--the African American students formed a club, and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and focused on their history and culture, and?
Speaker 2: Correct.  And Harvey Munford was the--worked for the school district [Clark County School District] at the time, and he was in charge of the--that particular club; and we did activities, and, and had a couple of sit-ins, and those kinds of things.  I guess I would probably say blossomed a little more when I was in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did the--was, was the old Westside high school [Westside School; Historic Westside School, Las Vegas, Nevada] still in operation then?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't.
Speaker 1: It had closed it by--okay.
Speaker 2: It had closed.
Speaker 1: All right, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We had no high schools in West Las Vegas then, you know, when I was going to school.  Everyone was bused.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So what was the, I guess, the percentage roughly of the black students in the high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.
Speaker 1: Would you guess you were like--
Speaker 2: Let me see.
Speaker 1: --twenty percent, 10 percent? I don't know.
Speaker 2: No.  It was more like 9 or 10 percent.  It was more like 9 or 10 percent because they were bused not to just that school.  They were bused to several depending on where you lived.  You either went to Rancho High School [Las Vegas, Nevada], Western High School [Las Vegas, Nevada], Las Vegas High School or Clark when I was in school.  Those were the four high schools that African Americans were bused to.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If you lived in the black community.  And at that time, the black community was called the Westside [Las Vegas, Nevada].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so you went to those four schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 666350
Speaker 1: So you were an athlete, right in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was an athlete.
Speaker 1: --in high school [Ed W. Clark High School, Las Vegas, Nevada].  What events did you participate in?
Speaker 2: Well, I ran track, and hurdles were my specialty; and I played basketball.
Speaker 1: The hurdles are hard--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know.  So you were, you were good.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: You played basketball.  What position did you play?
Speaker 2: I was a guard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Wasn't very good at it, but I was a guard.
Speaker 1: Well, you were on the team, right, so?
Speaker 2: I was on the team, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did--and did you rec- achieve any honors in sports, or?
Speaker 2: I did, yeah, for--in track and field.  I had a couple of records, and, you know, and was--really loved running track and field more so than anything.
Speaker 1: And those--being involved in a team also means travel, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, travel, competition with other schools and so forth within the community, you know, competing against others.  And then we had, you know, regional track and field and so forth.
Story_ID: 666351
Speaker 1: You would have started high school [Ed W. Clark High School, Las Vegas, Nevada], what, in 19- (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I graduated in '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you started around 1970.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, what about academics?  Were you a good student?
Speaker 2: I was a good student.  I would say that I was a good student.  I went on--after I graduated, I received a scholarship to study journalism, full ride scholarship to UNLV, University of Nevada, Las Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada]; and so I majored--at UNLV, I majored in political science and journalism.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were like the vice president of the class your senior year.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is there anything sig- significant about graduation that, that you remember?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  I mean, I still know many of the kids that I graduated with.  I, you know, know them, still see some of them.  Nothing really significant in, in that sense that--at that time, I was the only African American that was on the, on the senior class.  I do recall--
Speaker 1: As an officer (unclear)?
Speaker 2: As an officer, um-hm.  I do recall when it was homecoming, you know, everyone had an opportunity to come over to my house and build a, build a float that we built for school, so I remember that; and my mom [Bobbie Davis Atkinson], you know, had drinks, you know, the hors d'oeuvres, I guess, so the kids and they would all come--black and white would come over to Westside [Las Vegas, Nevada], and we made the float.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I remember that very vividly.
Speaker 1: All right.  So you had construction materials around your place, right, because of your father [Eddie Atkinson]?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes.  And the way the house was designed, it made it really easy because we had a huge carport--I mean a huge carport; and so you were able--we were able to hang, you know, floats were made out of chicken wire and napkins, and so we were able to hang sections of the float up so that we can, you know, work on it in, in this hu- on this carport, this huge carport.
Story_ID: 666352
Speaker 1: You mentioned earlier, and I didn't ask you what happened, but you said the black organization had demonstrated--
Speaker 2: Yes, we did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) at the school [Ed W. Clark High School, Las Vegas, Nevada].  What was the issue?
Speaker 2: We had a walk out (laughter) because we didn't think that African American kids were being treated fairly; and at the time, Brian Cram was the principal, and I was an officer, and we had a walk out, but he was able to calm everyone down, and, you know, kids came back, back into the school, but we, you know, we really voiced our opinion when we felt that something wasn't right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did, did things change at the school as a result of the walk out in the?
Speaker 2: I would, I would say, yes, because--and, and Dr. Cram, at the time was really--he was more of a people person, so he was able to calm the kids down.  We had meetings and discussions and so forth, and things improved a great deal.  But we had students who were really active and wanted to make sure that the treatment of African Americans was fair and we received the same as other students.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You--do you have any stories about discrimination at the school that--I mean, or a personal story about it?
Speaker 2: No.  Actually, actually, I never really experienced, experienced that so much, but I do recall a conversation with one of my--he was the president of the, of the--of my class.  I remember having a conversation.  We had a conversation one day, and it really struck me as very--it, it touched a nerve.  Let's put it that way.  And he lived in a neighborhood that I later purchased a home as an adult in, and he said to me that the reason that they did not want blacks to live in their neighborhood was because if a black moved--a black person, a black family moved in a white neighborhood, then it would decrease the value of their property because African Americans didn't take care of their homes and their property the way in which they did.  And I--you know, I never forgot that, and later as an adult, I purchased a home in that very same neighborhood, and I remember it vividly.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, did, did they have--did everybody go to the same prom?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We all went to the same prom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was no segregation in that respect; and blacks and white actually got along pretty well at the school when I was growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Never--you know, no tension or anything of that nature.  But there were times, as I said, when, you know, we felt that we weren't being treated fairly and equally, and, and we had the one walk out, sit-in.

Speaker 1: Las Vegas [Nevada] is an interesting dynamic in terms of it being a fairly new city, growing all the time, and you've got the casinos and the whole--you know, the, the entertainment and the vice activity going on, a lot of which is legal.  I mean, what's considered illegal vice in other cities is legal--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --in Las Vegas.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And lots of different kinds of people moving in, which I, I suppose it would make it different from the South, the traditional South.
Speaker 2: It, it was.  I mean, there was a lot of gaming, obviously, lots of jobs in the casino industry--both in the front house, as well as the back house; and when I say that, you had the maids and porters and bellmen and, and kitchen workers, that's considered the back of the house in the casino industry.  And then you had the front of the house, which is in the, the gaming tables, and there were lots of African Americans who were crap dealers and dealers and, and waitresses and so forth in, in that part of the industry.  In fact, my mother [Bobbie Davis Atkinson], she worked for--some period of time, she worked in the, in the industry, in which she was a waitress; and even myself, I worked in the industry after--while I was in high school [Ed W. Clark High School, Las Vegas, Nevada].  My grand- my godfather [Cranford Crawford] knew one of the casino owners and got me a job for the summer working in the--in--I was a cashier, probably one of the youngest cashiers ever.  At the time, I was, what, sixteen, seventeen years old, and I worked as a cashier in--at one of the hotels.  My godfather knew one of the owners.
Story_ID: 666354
Speaker 1: Can you tell us your father's birthday now?  I think we, you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was February the 14th, 1919.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your father's name, full name?
Speaker 2: Eddie Atkinson (background noise).
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Oh, god.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we left off.  You were on your way to University of Nevada, Las Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] with a scholarship, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In journalism.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Had--did you participate in any of the journalism internships or anything during the summer, or?
Speaker 2: No, I did not, actually.  I later--even though I got a scholarship for journalism, my focus sort of switched to political science, and so I was more involved in, in political science than I was journalism.  Although, you know, I still had to take the classes and requirements and, and so forth for--to fulfill my obligations in the journalism area.
Speaker 1: You know, politi- politicians always blame the journalists for problems.  But why did you change sides (laughter)?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I--at one point in time I wanted to go to law school, and everyone says, oh, if you go to law school, you really should major in political science.  Of cour- lo and behold that that really is not the case.  You really should more focus on English than you do in, anything else--English or either history.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Well, at any rate, so--but you, you enter as a journalism major; and, well, how did you--well had you much interaction with UNLV when you were in high school [Ed W. Clark High School, Las Vegas, Nevada]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did you--
Speaker 2: I wasn't.  I knew that, that's where I wanted to go to school.  I wanted to stay at home and go to school, and so I really, you know, wasn't involved in UNLV as much.  Of course, when I later went to UNLV, it was a different story.  I loved it and was involved in, in things, you know, getting involved in sorority [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] and so forth, and loved just the whole atmosphere of higher education.
Story_ID: 666355
Speaker 1: Did you run track at, at UNLV [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada]?
Speaker 2: I did not.  I didn't do any sports in high school [Ed W. Clark High School, Las Vegas, Nevada] except for what was required, you know, P.E.--you had to take physical education in, in college, and so I did that, but, but left all of the track and field and, and athletic abilities behind.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you say you joined the sorority.
Speaker 2: Right.  I was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Which one?
Speaker 2: Actually, I was a founding member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority on U- on the campus of UNLV.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so they weren't--so I take it there weren't enough black students to have a chapter before?
Speaker 2: No, there wasn't.  There wasn't an interest--one of the two.  There wasn't an interest that--or either, you know, there just wasn't enough students there at the time.  But I was one of the founding members of the chapter there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is UNLV--or was it when you were going there, primarily a commuter campus or was it--or did people come from out of the state to stay there, from--did they have dor- a lot--was dorm life the dominant student activity (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  They had dorm- they had dorms at the campus.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: They had dorms at the campus, but for those individuals who lived in the community, it was more of a commuter school, and--but there, there were, there were dorms and there were students who had apartments outside of the dorms that were close to the school.  So it was--it, it--let's put it this way: it is not a school--it was not at the time a school where you had a lot of school activities, you know, like the traditional college experience.  You didn't have that.  Probably because there was--it was more of a commuter school for many of us who lived in the community.  So if I really wanted that college experience, it probably would have been better if I had gone away to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's what I was getting at.  I wondered if it was more of a commuter type situation, or like a, you know, residential campus, so.
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: Yeah, commuter.
Speaker 2: It was.  I mean, when, when you finish class, you went home or did whatever you had to do if you didn't--if you weren't living on the dorm, and, you know, it--at that time, didn't make any sense to live on the dorm.  It was so expensive and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so did the black students organize themselves?
Speaker 2: They had--they, they did have a Black Student Union and activities and things of that nature on campus, yes.  But, again, when you go to school--you know, if you live in the community and you go to school, you know, your- after school is over with, you're gone.  And that was where joining the sorority and starting the sorority sort of changed that a little bit because now you're doing things with, you know, other members in sorority and activities you have on campus and, and so forth.  So that was--that, that changed it a little bit for us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did, did the other black fraternities and sororities start up around the same time as, as AKA?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They, they did.  They did.  You had, you had the, you know, Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] and the Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] and the Omegas [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] and, you know, we had our activities that we did, you know, a- there were--there weren't--there was--I'm trying to think.  I don't think there was any Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] at the time, just AKAs, and it, it--you know, we had our activities and things and parties and that sort of stuff that we--
Speaker 1: The AKAs were--
Speaker 2: --participated in.
Speaker 1: --were in heaven, weren't they (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yes, we--yeah, yeah, it was.  It was fun.  It was fun.  It made it more trad- a more--made it more like a traditional college so to speak, having those kinds of activities.
Story_ID: 666356
Speaker 1: Now this is the time--you--we were talking off camera when I came in.  This was a time when Jerry Tarkanian was the coach of the--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) UNLV basketball team, and they--most people heard about UNLV [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada] from the basketball team's--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --appearances on television, on CBS Sports playing for the national championship, and the, in the tournament games--Reggie Theus, Ricky Sobers, and--I don't know.  There's some other players, but--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  We--yeah, UNLV was--UNLV basketball was big.  In fact, I, I--for one year, I was one of the dancers for the, for the basketball team, just one year (laughter); and so basketball was well known and, you know, college basketball with, with--Reggie was there.  Ricky Sobers was there.  I'm trying to think of some of the others that were there.  Smith, can't think of his first name, but they were, you know, all big time sports and lots of fun because you knew--everyone knew each other.  All--every- you know, there wasn't that many blacks.  Even though these guys were all from--they didn't come from Las Vegas [Nevada], but we all knew each other.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Oh, yeah, the, the--now, the--I must tell you, the name of the, the team--I mean, the team logo and everything is kind of disturbing for me, you know, as a black person.  They're the Runnin' Rebels, right?
Speaker 2: The Runnin' Rebels.
Speaker 1: And then they--the, the paper that you contributed to was called The Rebel Yell.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: That's correct, The Rebel Yell.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so, I mean, what is the dynamic of this rebel business?
Speaker 2: You know, I'm not exactly sure where it originated from, but, you know, at--during, during the time when we were going to school, it didn't really mean anything.  I mean, we were more supportive of the school, the team, and so it didn't have the same kind of connotation that you would think it would have related to the South or anything.  It, it had--we never even thought about it.  No one ever talked about it.  We were just, you know, supportive of our players and the school and, and so forth.
Story_ID: 666357
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any--were there any special professors or, or administrators there?
Speaker 2: Oh, god there were so many.  I had a English professor, and she--white.  She taught black history, black studies.  She was fantastic.  So had a lot of great professors.  Had an African American professor at the time.  He also taught black studies, and--who was fantastic.  A lot of my political science professors were great influences; in fact, two of them were--one of them, Dina Titus, who is now a congresswoman was one of my professors and also on my dissertation committee.  So just a lot of really good professors and, and staff there that was very helpful.  The good thing about the school [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada], especially when you focused on your area, there wasn't a lot of students, so you didn't--it wasn't a large school where you have hundreds of people, so you got to know your professors.  You had time to interact with them and so forth, and so that experience, I think, was really positive for me.
Story_ID: 666358
Speaker 1: Were you involved in any kind of political activities in--in college?  Now when you started as a, is the--around the time of the Watergate hearings on the national level, right?  And president was Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon], and then you know (unclear) transition to Ford [President Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr.], and then by '76 [1976], you know, Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Right.  Wasn't involved in national politics at the time, was more involved in local politics at the time.  You know, my--at--my godfather was an assemblyman, so worked on his campaign, was active in that; worked on other campaigns, more local.  Woodrow Wilson, who was a county commissioner [Clark County Board of Commissioners], worked on his campaign; so I was more involved in the local politics than I was on the national, than the national level.
Speaker 1: Who was your godfather?
Speaker 2: Cranford Crawford, and he was an assemblyman.  And then Woodrow Wilson who was a state senator who left state senate [Nevada Senate] and later became a county commissioner.  He was a friend of the family, and so, you know, worked on his campaigns--and he was a Republican, too, but because he was a friend of the family and lived in the black community, everyone knew him and supported him, and so even though he was a Republican, that didn't matter.
Speaker 1: It didn't have the same kind of divisive stigma that it has today?
Speaker 2: Not--totally, not at all.  Woodrow was more of a community person.  It wasn't so much as the politics as it was as helping the community and doing for the community, so regardless if--to his party affiliation, he was more focused on the community.
Speaker 1: Now, is, is Las Vegas [Nevada]--I mean, is the county more Democratic or Republican as such?
Speaker 2: Well, it's changed over the years.  At one point in time, it was more, you know, Democratic--Las Vegas for sure.  Las Vegas was--and, and it--and I think it still is, Democrats outnumber Republicans in Las Vegas.  But when you put the whole state, it, it changes--the, the dynamics change a lot.  Las Vegas is more liberal than more--I would say, than Reno [Nevada] and some of the other small county--cow counties because you see, you have seventeen counties in Nevada, and Clark County [Nevada] was the more urban county; and Reno to a certain degree, but it was more rural than it was urban.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in Nevada, the area around Las Vegas is strongest urban--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: It's a huge state, so the--
Speaker 2: It's--
Speaker 1: --rest of it is a lot of open space, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  That's right, it is a lot of open space, and, you know, like I said, there's seventeen counties in Nevada, and a lot of them are small, so Las Vegas is the largest, largest metropolitan area, and then there's Henders- I mean, then there's Reno.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So as a political s- well, what aspect of political science fascinated you the most as a student?
Speaker 2: Oh, you know, just the, the political aspect of it, getting involved, and I think that's why--that's--I, I think the mere fact that I was a political science major and had a chance to study politics and so forth in, in college [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada], I think that was probably one of the things that geared me towards being a elected official.  Had--and then having--you know, had great role models growing up, in Woodrow Wilson; my godfather, Cranford Crawford; Bernice Moten [B. Bernice Moten] who was on the school board [Clark County Board of School Trustees].  And just seeing how active and involved they were, it made me want to do pretty much the same thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: To help the community.
Story_ID: 666359
Speaker 1: So when you were on the verge of graduation, now, now did you get married in college, or did you--
Speaker 2: No, it was after (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) was it--much after?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  So when you were on the verge of graduating, were you thinking about going to law school immediately or what?
Speaker 2: I wanted to go to law school.  I wanted to go to law school, and then I got a job with the City of Las Vegas [Nevada].  They had started this new program, so I got involved in local government and went to work for the City of Las Vegas.  And then I'll never forget my boss at the time saying, you know, "If you guys really want to move up the chain in local government, you need to go get your master's [degree]."  So as soon as I got out of high school [sic.], I went and turned around and went, went back to school and got my master's.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I started working professionally before I actually graduated from college [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada] 'cause I had gotten a job with the City of Las Vegas--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in the budget and finance department; and we were doing, you know, John Bramlin [ph.] was his name, who was the department head, and we were doing some new and exciting things with the City of Las Vegas; and there were three of us, three of us that were African Americans who worked for the City of Las Vegas in this new department, in this new program.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who, who was the mayor then of Las Vegas?
Speaker 2: Who was the mayor?  F- at that point in time, I believe the city and the county [Clark County, Nevada] were combined together, and then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  So the county commissioner was the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --(unclear).
Speaker 2: It was, it was combined together.  And I, and I can't remember, but it might have been Paul Christensen.  I can't really remember exactly, but--no, no.  I take that back.  What is his name?  Oh, man.  I can't think of his name.  He--it was a, it was another person that was the mayor at the time when I was there, but I can't think of his name.
Story_ID: 666360
Speaker 1: Now, what were some of the issues in the city in those days?  I know--I--well, one thing, I know water is always an issue in the--but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Growth.
Speaker 1: --but--what?
Speaker 2: Growth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were growing by leaps and bounds, and so, you know, trying to develop the infrastructure to handle that growth was really a, a big task.  Transportation was huge.  Water was huge.  Trying to deal with the various other forms of infrastructure that was needed to sustain and to make sure that the, the entities continued to grow.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now did the, the county [Clark County, Nevada] have, you know, enough revenue to operate?  I mean, I mean, I would guess it would with all the casinos--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --but?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  You know, the county was very wealthy (laughter) when it came down to, to growth because of the various taxes that we had; and, and, you know, we had some--at that time, we had some individuals who was on the county commission [Clark County Board of Commissioners] that really looked at long term in terms of trying to make sure that the community continued to grow.  Everyone wanted the, the growth.  Everyone wanted the growth, but, of course, when you have that growth, then you have a lot of other issues that you have to deal with because you don't have the infrastructure in place to maintain that growth; and so, you know, you were always doing catch up and bond issues and so forth.  The school system [Clark County School District] was growing by leaps and bounds with all the new people that were moving there; and at one point in time, the school system was the tenth largest school system in the whole U.S.
Speaker 1: Well, that's something.  I, I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Hm.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  The time that I was on the school board [Clark County Board of School Trustees], we were the tenth largest, and we passed some of the largest bond issues to build schools to accommodate all the growth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, yeah, so this--a lot of young people in the city then.
Speaker 2: That had children.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.  So it was a, a really a young city in a lot of ways (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was.  It was a young city.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 666361
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your period of time with the city.
Speaker 2: I worked for the city, like I said, in the office of budget and management and loved it and went on to get my master's degree as a result of that in political scien- no, in, in public administration, got my master's degree in public administration [from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada], and, you know, at that point, changed my focus from being a lawyer to working in local government; and I worked for the City of Las Vegas [Nevada] for about three or four years, and then I left there and went on to, to the county--went to work for the county and ended my career over at the, over at the county.  And I was an employee at the county before I became a county commissioner [Clark County Board of Commissioners].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did, did you work in the office of budget and management in the?
Speaker 2: I worked, I worked in a number of departments.  I worked in the planning department handling all of their finances and the budgets and so forth for the planning department.  Then I went on to the airport [McCarran International Airport, Paradise, Nevada].  I worked at the airport for a while working in human resources; and then I left there and went to work for family services--or social services.  And there I was a manager there, handling the budget and finance for the department, working with legislative issues and so forth, and preparing testimony for the commissioners and, and responding to questions when, when we had to go to the legislature [Nevada Legislature].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So I ended my career at social services, but I had worked in, in local government between the City of Las Vegas and Clark County [Nevada].
Story_ID: 666362
Speaker 1: Were you involved in Democratic Party politics in those days?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't.  Not as a, not as a young up and coming professional, no, I wasn't.  I didn't really got involved--I worked in politics as a high school student [at Ed W. Clark High School, Las Vegas, Nevada] working on campaigns for my godfather [Cranford Crawford] and then for Woodrow [Woodrow Wilson] when he ran for the state legislature [Nevada Legislature] and also when he ran for county commissioner [Clark County Board of Commissioners], but I wasn't really involved in, in Democratic Party stuff.  It was more local government.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Working for people who I knew and, and, you know, were friends of our family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I have a note here that the Democratic National Committee formed a black caucus in 1982.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so that was about ten years after the Congressional Black Caucus was formed, I guess, or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --something, thereabouts.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I used to be the chairman.  I was the chairman of the--I was on the DNC.  I was a member of the Democratic National Committee; and then later became the chairman of the Democratic National Committee Black Caucus (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah I--I know.  We're not gonna get--I don't want to talk about it yet 'til we get to it.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But we got you now.  You're working, you're working on a master's degree, and you're working--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --for the county [Clark County, Nevada], the early days.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I got my master's in, I think, in 1982, in '82 [1982].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I graduated from college [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada] in '79 [1979], and then got my master's--or in '78 [1978] and got my master's in, in '82 [1982].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're still single at this point?
Speaker 2: Still single.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, now, in '85 [1985]--now tell me if I've skipped over anything.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But in '85 [1985], you become a member of the Clark County School District Board of Trustees [Clark County Board of School Trustees].
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, at that time, I, I was engaged to be married [to Lee Gates] and then got married in '86 [1986].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was the dynamic of that; how did you become a, a member of the--?
Speaker 2: I was actually recruited.  I was recruited.  Friends who knew me asked me to run for the school board, and I was running in--out of the West Las Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada], which was a black community, and I needed the support because the board was predominantly Republican, and it was one of my Republican friends who asked me to run for the seat, and he actually helped me get appointed, because I had to be appointed first, and he went to his Republican friends on the board to get them to support me; and that's how I got on the board, and it was, it was sort of funny because it was the Republicans who supported me--even though I was a Democrat, it was the Republicans who supported me, and the Democrat did not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is that because they were both minorities in the, in the, on the commission, or?
Speaker 2: No.  I was the only--I was only the--I was the only minority on the board.  There was only one.
Speaker 1: But I, I--what I'm getting at is--were the Republicans minorities, too?
Speaker 2: No, no.  The Republicans were the predominant, and the minorities on the board at the time were, were--
Speaker 1: That is strange.
Speaker 2: --Democrat.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  But, well, it, it was because there was such friction that was--occurred on the board that the Democrats didn't support the Republicans.  So if you had a Republican supporting a Democrat, there was the notion that this Democrat was going to be beholden to the Republicans.  Of course, lo and behold, that was not the case, and, you know, they found that out that I was my own person; and even though the Republicans supported me, I didn't always support their position.
Story_ID: 666363
Speaker 1: And how was the Clark County School District board [Clark County Board of School Trustees] in relationship to the black community's interests, what were they doing then, what (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, we--you know, that, that was a--you had a--still had some tension because African American community didn't feel as though they were receiving the same type of education that the majority population and communities in Las Vegas [Nevada] was receiving.  You just, you, you know, we--you still had busing that was going on.  You had a huge bond issue that African American communities and African Americans who did live in the community were supporting, but, yet, we didn't receive the same level of funding and support that--even though we were paying the taxes.  You know, you didn't--you still had schools that were old and outdated, and--but you had these huge bond issues where you're building brand new schools, and none were slated for the African American community.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So since the close of the Westside high school [Westside School; Historic Westside School, Las Vegas, Nevada], they didn't build a new one over there or?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  No, no.  The closest thing that you had that was later built as a result of bond issue was a school that focused on like a magnet school, but it really wasn't a magnet school because it was actually--well, yeah.  I guess it was.  It was a magnet school that focused on, on training students who had a focus and interest in law, and that was the only school at the time that was built.  And then I think later on there were some other schools.  By that time, I was off the--I was off the school board, but there were other schools that were upgraded and, and built over there like the West Middle School [Las Vegas, Nevada], so they had a middle school that was later built over there.  That was a middle school, not a high school, though.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is--when, when you join the Clark County School District board, you're twenty-nine years old.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so you were--were you the youngest member?
Speaker 2: I probably was, yeah.  I, I was the youngest member.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  And you were on until you were thirty-six.  So what, what kinds of--I mean, what did you try to, you know, push when you were on the--?
Speaker 2: It--you know, growing up in West Las Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] and having the opportunity to travel, you saw where there was a lot of disparity that exists between the African American community and other communities; and my goal and my interest was to make sure that our kids had the same level of education as white students, and so I had to fight for that.  You know, I had to fight and make sure that we had administrators that looked like me.  And so those are the types of things that I always wanted to do, and it was because of the fight that I saw my mother [Bobbie Davis Atkinson] and some of her friends involved in when I was going to school and wanting to make sure that we had the same level of education as whites had.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so that was my goal, was to make sure that we--I mean, here you have these huge bond issues that we were paying taxes for, but, yet, we didn't reap the benefits of it, and I wanted to make sure that we did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there any one incident that stands out during this period of time that you--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or, or issue that?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I recall we had--I recall, you know, wanting to make sure that we had African Americans in key positions, and--assistant superintendents and superintendents, and I remember, you know, fighting for that.  I remember very vividly when we had school board meetings, and, you know, packing the board meetings to make sure that African Americans were there to speak out and fight for getting a part--a piece of, of the pie, the dollars; making sure that we had, had those kinds of things.  So those were the things that I remember so vividly, you know, just fighting to make sure our community had the same level of representation and also dollars and so forth that other communities had.  That was--that--you know, and it's so ironic because that was always my fight.

Speaker 1: You were on the school commission [Clark County Board of School Trustees] until 19- (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen ninety-two [1992].
Speaker 1: Ninety-two [1992]?
Speaker 2: I resigned.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: To '92 [1992].  All right.
Speaker 2: I resigned in '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I resigned in '92 [1992] so that I could run for county commission [Clark County Board of Commissioners].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So that's where the real--you were explaining the dynamics of Las Vegas [Nevada] before we started, and explain some of that 'cause I--most people don't know the difference between the City of Las Vegas and the county and--?
Speaker 2: Well, most people think that when they--when you, when you hear the name Las Vegas, you automatically think of the Strip [Las Vegas Strip, Las Vegas, Nevada], and you think that the Strip is actually located in Las Vegas.  It really isn't.  The city council [Las Vegas City Council] and the mayor have no responsibility or jurisdiction over the Strip.  It is the county commission that controls and approves anything that has to go on--go--that, that goes on with the Strip.  It's approved by the county commission.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The City of Las Vegas is not a water purveyor.  They actually get their water from the Las Vegas Valley Water District.  The water district is controlled by the county commission, and so most people don't realize that.
Speaker 1: And so the power, the economic power, is in the county.
Speaker 2: Is in the county.
Speaker 1: I mean in--primarily--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --the economic power, right?  And, and, you know, that's where all the revenue from the Strip goes, I guess, right?  To--
Speaker 2: That's--that's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The, the majority of the revenue--even, even in Laughlin [Nevada].  Laughlin is controlled by Clark County [Nevada]; you know, the gaming down there in Laughlin is all controlled by Clark County.
Story_ID: 666365
Speaker 1: In 1992--I was reading an article in The New York Times where they quote you.  They were saying that 11 percent of the three hundred thousand residents of the City of Las Vegas [Nevada] were African American.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And but there's a steady influx of African Americans who were dissatisfied increasingly because they couldn't get the county jobs that they used to get in Las Vegas; the service jobs that--there wasn't, you know, there wasn't the opportunity that it used to be.  They also said that the county had about seven hundred thousand residents.
Speaker 2: Residents.
Speaker 1: And the black population was 9.5--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --percent.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Which is--it was almost the same as the--you know, almost the same proportion.  It's a little less.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But some of the same issues.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so, so--now this is--'92 [1992] is also the time of Las Vegas riot.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And this is what, you know, the article in The New York Times was documenting the state of the city and county and the riot.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: So what happened?  You, you were here, and how could (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was running for office.  I was run- at the time, I was running for office.  I was running for county commission [Clark County Board of Commissioners], and I was working for Clark County [Nevada]; and then I took a leave of absence.  I took a leave of absence from my job so that I can focus primarily on running for office; and the reason that I was running for office is because there was such a huge disparity between African Americans in the county system, African Americans in terms of the community in which I represented just did not receive--it was pretty much the same as, as what I experienced when I was on the school board [Clark County Board of School Trustees].  You have all this revenue that we're contributing to as African Americans, but, yet, we didn't reap the benefits of that, and so that was the reason why I decided to run for county commission.  And then, you know, working in the system, I also saw the disparities that existed.  You know, you didn't really have African Americans who were department heads.  You--they weren't in key positions and, and so forth, and so that, that was the reason.  I mean, I remember that when I worked for Clark County.  I had a college degree, had a master's degree [from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada], and one of my counterparts who didn't even have a college degree was able to be promoted and--to get higher jobs, and I--that I couldn't even receive even though I had a master's degree, and I had the background.  I didn't--we just weren't treated the same, and that frustrated me a lot and prompted me to, to run for office.
Story_ID: 666366
Speaker 1: It's kind of strange to read that the 1992 riots in Las Vegas [Nevada] were the result of the Rodney King decision to, I guess, to exonerate these cops in Simi Valley [California].
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: That was the first trial when they let them go--this is in '92 [1992].  So other than the fact that there were, there were a lot of Los, Los Angeles [California] residents moving to Las Vegas--that's what I read.  And what were some of the other, you know, underlying causes of this riot?
Speaker 2: I think it was the mere fact that you, you know, you didn't have the jobs.  You didn't have the infrastructure.  You didn't have all of the things that you saw in other communities--they did not exist in West Las Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada].  You know, you had one park, you know, Doolittle Park [Las Vegas, Nevada].  You didn't have anything else.  And so here you are paying your hard earned taxes, but, yet, you did not reap any of the benefits.  You know, you--you couldn't get promoted.  You know, you were doing menial service jobs, and I think it was just really frustrating at--during that time; and that riot really opened up and changed West Las Vegas and the City of Las Vegas and Clark County [Nevada] in terms of trying to improve that part of the community.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I heard that--well, I read it in The Times article that though the--they didn't have--the same housing restrictions didn't exist in '92 [1992] as existed in, say, '72 [1972].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Or '62 [1962], but you still had the majority of black people living in--
Speaker 2: Living in--
Speaker 1: --West Las Vegas--
Speaker 2: --West Las Vegas.
Speaker 1: --concentrated in that traditional enclave that they were basically kept in by--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, real estate practices and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's correct.  That's correct.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: There's also police bru- brutality that's in the news as we speak all the time, was also a factor in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We had, I believe, during that same time, we had a black man [Charles Bush] that was, you know, beat up, and I, I can't remember if he was killed.
Speaker 1: He was.  According--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --to The New York Times, he was choked to death--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --by--.
Speaker 2: And my husband [Lee Gates], who was a lawyer at the time, really spoke out against that and protested on the steps of the courthouse during, during that time, and, you know, called for the cops that actually did it to, you know, go to trial and, and so forth.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He was a black casino owner.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This wasn't just anybody.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So which meant he, he was a prominent businessman to own a casino, and he was choked to death by two white cops.
Speaker 2: Two white cops.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so.
Story_ID: 666367
Speaker 1: You mentioned your husband.  Now, when did you get married?  This is?
Speaker 2: In '86 [1986].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you married Lee Gates.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--who became a judge.
Speaker 2: Who later became a judge (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Governor Bob Miller appointed him as a judge, and he, he retired two years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was an activist--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --lawyer, and--?
Speaker 2: Very much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a big activist.  In fact, he worked at East Texas Legal Services, you know, fighting for the justice and rights of African Americans down in Texas.
Story_ID: 666368
Speaker 1: So '92 [1992], did--so, so did you win the election in '92 [1992]?
Speaker 2: I won the election.  Um-hm.  And it--you know it was really pretty sad because I ran against a family friend who I had helped get elected previously, but I just didn't think that--and we're--I'm still friends with the family, but I just didn't think that he was doing what I felt needed to be done for the plight of African Americans in the community.
Speaker 1: Now, this is William "Doc" Pearson.
Speaker 2: Pearson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.  Later on, I named--had a facility built after him [Dr. William U. Pearson Community Center, Las Vegas, Nevada] in his honor.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so you win in '92 [1992], and you're the Clark County commissioner for District D [Clark County Board of Commissioners].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what is that--what does District D include?
Speaker 2: District D included the, the black community, a small portion of the white community and the Hispanic community.  And at that time I think the population--my--that I represented was like two or three hundred thousand people that lived in, in that portion of the community.
Speaker 1: That's a lot of people.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There are some cities that have city commissions, and they're only 150,000--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --people in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the city, so that's a lot of people to be responsible for.
Speaker 2: That was--right.  I represented the City of Las Vegas [Nevada] and North Las Vegas [Nevada], and then some unincorporated Clark County [Nevada].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I had two cities that I covered their area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I have a note here.  There are seven members of the county commission.  They represent seven districts.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: A through G.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, and it's a group.  The commissioners sit on various boards, right?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And what, what are some of those boards, and which boards did you sit on?
Speaker 2: Oh, god.  I sat on so--we all sat on the same boards.  We all sat on the--pretty much the same boards, but the difference was that some of us was the--chairmans or vice chair or just members of the board.  We sat on the Las Vegas Valley Water District, so we controlled, you know, the water.  We had the sanitation district.  We had the LVCVA, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority that, you know, bring in conventions and so forth to the community.  We had Regional Transportation Commission [Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada].  We had liquor and gaming.  We had the hospital board because we were the only--we ran the public hospital in, in Las Vegas [University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada].  And then you had the county commission.  You had the sanitation district.  You had the Big Bend Water District.  So there were just a number of boards that we sat on that we controlled.  We set policy for, for those various entities.
Story_ID: 666369
Speaker 1: It says here as a county commissioner, you were responsible for approving permits and licenses for all major hotels, casinos, and resorts in Las Vegas [Nevada].
Speaker 2: That's correct.  And I was the chairman of that board for a number of years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's a--are there any interesting stories about--
Speaker 2: Oh, man.
Speaker 1: --that period of time?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.  A lot, lots of interesting stories, lots of interesting stories.  But, yeah, you know when Steve Wynn wanted to build his casinos.
Speaker 1: That's W-Y-N-N, right?
Speaker 2: Yes. Then, you know, it was the county commission that was involved in the zone--not, not just the licensing but the zoning, making sure that the zoning and that he had his liquor license and that he had his gaming license and his zoning to build his facility.  All of that was approved by the board of county commissioners [Clark County Board of Commissioners].
Speaker 1: Hm, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: All of the hotels on the Strip [Las Vegas Strip, Las Vegas, Nevada], every hotel on the Strip had to have zoning, liquor, gaming; and the county commission was one aspect, one crucial, important aspect of them being able to accomplish what they wanted to accomplish.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I would imagine in such a position, ethics are a big issue.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Because I can imagine that a lot of the rich Trumps and the Wynns and other people would like to persuade politicians to play ball with whatever they want to do, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That--that's true.  That's true.  But, you know, you didn't have--it wasn't like what happened, you know, back in the early '50s [1950s] where you had the mob.  By that time, things had changed a great deal, so most of those company--were public traded companies, and so you didn't have that aspect of it as much as you had back in the early '50s [1950s] when you had, you know, the mob involved and so forth.  Everything had been cleaned up by that time.
Speaker 1: So you didn't have to face that kind of--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --somebody trying to slip you--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --something or?
Speaker 2: No.  You, you really didn't.  I mean, you still had, you know, people who, you know, wanted to try to influence you, and, and they wanted to get the maximum use of their property and so forth.  So you had a lot of lobbying and, and lobbyists coming to visit you and the owners themselves and so forth, but it wasn't, it wasn't, like the--like I said, it, it--everything was more corporate.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so it had changed a lot.
Speaker 1: But I can imagine, even in a corporate context somebody might want way more than they could ever get, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. You had that.
Speaker 1: Are they, are they--can you give us a story?  You don't have the name the, the business, but?
Speaker 2: Oh, you had--that happened a lot.  You know, where they wanted to build something that was so large that it was going to have an impact on your infrastructure and your traffic pattern or, or it was not going to meet the requirements for your setback, and you just had to work through those things.  You had to work through them.  You had to work with their, their people, and we work with our staff to try to accommodate them, but not to create problems for us in the long run.  Making sure that tourists were safe, making sure that you had the right, right of way or whatever, and that you had the adequate space for people to walk and not have congestion--you had to work through all of those things.  You know, they come in--most, most, most come in with the big, grand, you know, ideas, and it had to be scaled down.  Sometime it had to be scaled down some.
Story_ID: 666370
Speaker 1: Okay.  'Cause, you know, one wonders if they look at--well, when they visit the Strip [Las Vegas Strip, Las Vegas, Nevada], about all the power it takes to run all those lights and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and these huge places.
Speaker 2: Water.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, yeah the water has to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, for all the toilets, and--.
Speaker 2: And that was--that was huge.  That was--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --well, the water features, the water features.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: The Bellagios [Bellagio Resort and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada] and--(laughter).
Speaker 2: Correct.  But, see, most people don't realize that some of those water features, they had their own water.  They had a well.  They had their own water.  But the perception was, was that, that, you know, you're wasting all of this water, so you had to work through a lot of things.
Speaker 1: So you had a lot, lot of environmental activists confront the city about--I mean, the, the Strip about the use of--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --water and electricity and--
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Water was probably the biggest.  Water was one of the largest issues that you had to deal with because of the perception, you know.  You're building this mega resort, and you have this grand lake, and you have the water fountains and all of that.  But, a lot--like I said, a lot of people didn't realize that many of those properties had their own water.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So this is a, this is a position that requires a lot of information about details and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You had to do your homework.
Speaker 1: --about infrastructure and, and access to utilities and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: You had to do your homework.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You couldn't function in that environment and not have knowledge.  I reme- I remember, it was really funny.  We were dealing with--I can't remember the specifics of the, of the issue, and we, we had a lobbyist that was sitting in the front seat of a commission meeting [Clark County Board of Commissioners], and they were talking about a real technical issue at the time, and I saw that lobbyist lean over and says, you know, "This topic is too difficult.  They're not going to understand," speaking of the commissioners, "they're not going to understand, understand this topic at all."  And I read his mouth, and when, when they finished doing the presentation, I did a summation of what was said, and I looked at the, at the lobbyist to say, hm, we understand.  But, you know, a lot of people thought that the issues were so technical that they would not--that we would not understand the magnitude of what was being discussed or what was being said, and that certainly was not the case.
Story_ID: 666371
Speaker 1: The government has like major bases and operations around Las Vegas [Nevada], the, the county, too, right?
Speaker 2: You mean--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --military bases?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That was--really--we do, and we had a member [of the Clark County Board of Commissioners] that sat on, on the military base [Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada] so that we knew what was going on, but that was more federal than it was local.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you didn't need to be bothered with that.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: That was more federal than it was local.
Speaker 1: So the interaction with the federal government is not that, you know, crucial in the--?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was because we received a lot of funding from the federal government, and so, you know, we, we still had to deal with the federal government on a lot of issues.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we had, you know, great relationships with who our senators or congress people were.  We, we knew them very well.  We had meetings with them.  Many times, I mean, I had to go to Washington [D.C.] many times to lobby for issues or to speak on an issue or whatever to give testimony on issues and so forth, so that was--that wasn't uncommon.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Who, who was in [U.S.] Congress from the area then?
Speaker 2: Well, we had a number of people that were--Shelley Berkley, Jim Bilbray [James Bilbray], and Senator Harry Reid was our senator.  You know, he had been the senator for a very long time; so, you know, you knew--we knew, we knew all of those people, all of those elected officials and worked with them on a regular basis.
Story_ID: 666372
Speaker 1: You were reelected in, in '96 [1996].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, and, (pause) yeah, in '96 [1996], that same year, the, the Clark County school board [Clark County Board of School Trustees] named an early childhood education center after you [Yvonne Atkinson Gates Center, Las Vegas, Nevada].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So tell us about that story.  What happened?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was on the school board, I-- like I said, African Americans just didn't receive the kinds of education that I felt that we needed, and I fought like--I fought, fought to have early childhood development centers built from the school board.  I wanted them to build them, and I couldn't get the support of my colleagues on the board to build early childhood development centers.  And when I got on the county commission [Clark County Board of Commissioners], by that time, I was seasoned and learned a lot, and was able to get my fellow commissioners to build early childhood development centers.
Speaker 1: Now--yeah.  This is a--for educators, this is a critical issue.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Arne Duncan has made numerous speeches about it.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, as we speak, I think this last week, he was talking about the importance of Head Start and early childhood education.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: This is, this is back in '96 [1996], the same kind of battle--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that was going on.  So this is a big deal.
Speaker 2: This was a huge deal.  It was huge.  I had gone to [U.S.] Congress to speak for early childhood development centers for Head Start, and I could not get my board, school board members to understand the significance of how important early education was.  And we had so many African Americans and Latinos who lived in the community.  They couldn't afford to send their kids to preschool, and so when they started school, they were behind, and so my passion was to get the county commission to support--and we ended up building three or four--four, I believe it was.  Bef- by the time I left, we had built four, four or five early childhood development centers throughout my district [District D] in the community.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I did it through using federal funds.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And Harry Reid (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And one of them, and one of them was named after me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They named it after me.  I didn't, but the school board--'cause what I did was, I developed a relationship with the, with the Clark County School District, and so I built the facility, and then I turned it over to them so that they could run it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Was, was Harry Reid of--
Speaker 2: He was--
Speaker 1: --any use in that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  He--Harry was very, very helpful in many, many things in terms of making sure that we had the adequate funding for certain projects and so forth in, in the black community.
Story_ID: 666373
Speaker 1: This is '96 [1996], Clinton's the president [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton].  You got--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Democratic administration then.  Now, were you a member of the democration--the, the Democratic National Committee at this point?
Speaker 2: I wasn't.  It was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --it was a little after that that I became--but I was really involved in President Clinton--in Clinton's election.
Speaker 1: In '92 [1992]?
Speaker 2: In '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Had you been involved at all in the Jesse Jackson campaign [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson]--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --earlier in--
Speaker 2: That was--
Speaker 1: --in '84 [1984] or (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Just watching it from afar, not involved, but, boy, I wish I had.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So I know one of the stars of the Democratic Party was Ron Brown then, right?  As a--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as the head of the Democratic National, yeah, Committee.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I remember Ron--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --very well.  Have photos with him somewhere in the--in my boxes somewhere when he was--when he came to Las Vegas [Nevada] when he was active in, in the Democratic Party.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, he, I guess, a lot of people say he's the architect of the Clinton victory, you know, that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  He was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He was.  Yeah, he really was.
Story_ID: 666374
Speaker 1: In 1997, there's something that--there's some kind of scandal around Fat Tuesdays or something?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: What is that about?
Speaker 2: At the time, I was--I, I wasn't--I was a--start- well, I was working with a friend of mine to open a business, and we were talking about Fat Tuesdays.  Hadn't been opened at that time, and we were just right in the process of doing it, but we weren't, we weren't open.  We weren't--hadn't created the company, or we were doing our due diligence, and, you know, a few people didn't want me to have any connection to the business, and so I just stepped to the side and let my friends go ahead, and they actually got the business open.  I wasn't a part of it.  I abstained because they were friends of mine because they had to come to the county commission [Clark County Board of Commissioners] to get approved, and that was the extent of it.
Speaker 1: There's a couple questions on this.  Now to what extent does being on the county commission handcuff you from being involved in--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --regular business?
Speaker 2: --you can be involved in business.  You can be involved in business, and many of my commissioners were.  You know, Paul Christensen owned Christensen Jewelers [M.J. Christensen Jewelers; M.J. Christensen Diamonds, Las Vegas, Nevada].  He was on the county commission, but there was different standards for African Americans than there were for whites.  I--they, you know, just didn't want me to be involved, and especially when some of the locations were in casinos and so forth.  I could have abstained but never had the opportunity to do that because it never came before us.  I divested myself and wasn't involved, and--but I still abstained.  So you can do that, and long as you abstain, there is no ethical conflict.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I--of course I never got that far, didn't get that far.
Story_ID: 666375
Speaker 1: In '98 [1998], was this the--a new governor that Colorado got a Democratic governor, or was it a--
Speaker 2: In Colorado?  You know, I don't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I don't--I'm--
Speaker 1: They say a Joe Neal here, I'm looking at--
Speaker 2: Oh, Joe Neal.
Speaker 1: --he ran unsuccessfully for governor, but then they--the next line here, it says that a Roy Romer was the governor.  So I don't know what--?
Speaker 2: Well, Joe Neal was from Las Vegas [Nevada].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he ran--he did run for governor.  He was also--he ran against me my last year, the last--my last time that I ran [for the Clark County Board of Commissioners], and Joe Neal was a state senator in Las Vegas, and, you know, wanted to--and Joe was a really good guy because he, you know, like myself, wanted to improve the plight of African Americans in the community, and so that's when he ran for governor because he was on the state senate [Nevada Senate] and didn't--I guess, he probably didn't see as much happening from the state side to improve and help African Americans, and so he ran for governor.  And at that same time, Roy Romer was the governor or ran for governor, I believe, in, in the State of Colorado.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And was elected.
Story_ID: 666376
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-eight [1998], you make a presentation before the Democratic National Committee at the convention [sic.] in Los Angeles [California], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how, how were you selected for that, and what happened?
Speaker 2: You know, I was really active and involved.  I was really active and involved in politics, and I use--I mean, I was real--very helpful, and I just contacted a lot of my friends from back in Washington [D.C.] and said I wanted to speak at the convention, and you needed to have someone from Las Vegas [Nevada] who was doing things, and, and so I got on the list.  I was recommended and got on the list, and spoke at the convention.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So this is--so you spoke about education basically, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yep, yep.  And that was, that was a real proud moment, I think, for me and my family 'cause my family was--my sister lived in L.A., and so, you know, she was able to come, and my other sister came, and my--some of my staff came, and my husband [Lee Gates] and daughter and all of them were there to see that moment.
Story_ID: 666377
Speaker 1: In the meantime, here's another--some kind of a ethics commission hearing on a--on the airport contract (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, this is--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --it's like a--is this a standard thing that happens, you (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, for me, it was.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Because I was so outspoken.  You know, when you go against the grain, that's, that's what happens.  And it was a--it was so funny because what I was able to do on the county commission [Clark County Board of Commissioners], we had businesses out at the airport [McCarran International Airport, Paradise, Nevada], and you har- didn't have any African Americans that really owned those businesses.  There was one company out there that owned a company, Jackie Robinson, who he was also a basketball player with Reggie Theus.  He and his group were the only African Americans out at the airport, and I was able to--with the support of my fellow commissioners, even though some did fight, you know, they really fought against me doing this--but I was able to increase the minority participation for ownership out at the airport.  So we went from 1 percent to 10 percent, and I negotiated that deal with Marriott [Marriott International, Inc.] at the time; and so, you know, once you did that, then you had to find the minorities that had the financial wherewithal to, to own a business that could start and put up the infrastructure and build the places.  And so I was able to gather up some of those people.  Some of those people were friends of mine, and because they were friends of mine, that's where the controversy came in, is because I supported--and it was a practice that the commission would tell the staff who they supported and who they wanted until it was up to me--until, until my turn, okay, so to speak.  They did not want me to give my list, my support, and so because of that, then they just came after me, and I supported people who I knew, which was no different than what they did.  But it was a different standard for me than it was for them.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  This is something that I--you hear a lot of the black politicians say that there's a different standard for--
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: --their behavior.  I know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was a different standard.  My fellow commissioners, it was--they all had their list of who they supported, who they wanted, but when I submitted my list or, you know, my support, then it was wrong.
Speaker 2: Now, was--is the commission still at this point primarily Democratic?
Speaker 1: Yes.  It's actually all--every last one of the members on the county commission right now is Democrat.
Speaker 2: And a viewer might ask, how can there be conflict on such a--they're all Democrats.  But like in Chicago [Illinois] where everybody is a Democrat, it can, you can be very content- contentious.
Speaker 1: Well, I was, I was pretty outspoken.  I, I was very outspoken, and I went against the grain; and when you go against the grain, sometime you have to pay the price, and that was one of the prices that I had to pay.  But if I had the chance to do it all over again, I would do the exact same thing.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, in 2000, you were reelected, Clark County commission (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And that's another thing, too, by the way.  Even though, even though I had issues and people fought me and, you know, went up against me, I still had the support of my community.
Story_ID: 666378
Speaker 1: So you were reelected [to the Clark County Board of Commissioners] once again in 2000.  Now 2000 is the year that George W. Bush [George Walker Bush] supposedly beats Al Gore--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in the election.  And was--what was, what was your--now, you were involved in the Democratic National Committee now--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --on a high level, right?
Speaker 2: That's correct.  I was very involved in that; and, you know, [HistoryMaker] Donna Brazile, who is a very good friend of mine even today, you know, when she ran Al Gore's campaign--and not only, you know, with me, it wasn't just me giving my support.  I gave my financial support because as a county commission- as a county commissioner, you were able to raise a lot of money, and so you took that money, and you used it for a good cause, and in my case, I used it to help get Democrats elected including the presidency--Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton].  I was, you know, highly involved in his campaign, both the first one and the second one, and I gave money where I would pay for walkers or coordinated the--coordinated campaign to get out the vote and that kind of thing.  I ran--a lot of that stuff was ran out of my, my political office, and so Al Gore was no different.
Speaker 1: How did you feel about that election?  I know the, the image in my mind that I have is that the black women in [U.S.] Congress were the last holdouts for Al Gore as he hoisted up the white flag.  They were the ones saying, "No.  We need to take this decision to the Supreme Co- ," you know, they were really--
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah, because he won, you know.  He--he actually won, and I was--Sonia Sotomayor was here in Colorado about a month ago, and she talked about that election, and she talked about how important just one vote makes a difference; and she was absolutely correct because in that situation, had we had the support on the [U.S.] Supreme Court and so forth, Al Gore would probably--would have been president.  And--but that--the mere fact that you had the African American women in Congress that said we needed to fight, that tells you about women in general, how we are fighters; and that was a proud moment for me when they did that and just, you know, fighting to make sure that we have our voices heard and representation.
Story_ID: 666379
Speaker 1: Tell me if I'm going too fast, but in 2002, you became the chair of the DNC Black Caucus [Democratic National Committee Black Caucus].
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us about how that took place.  And then was this something you expected?
Speaker 2: You know I had a lot of support.  I had a lot of support.  I--like I said--I--because of--because I was so active in politics in a local level but translated that to a national level, people knew me: [HistoryMaker] Donna Brazile, [HistoryMaker] Minyon Moore, Regena Thomas; they were--it was--it was them that got me as the black chair and as the chair of the Black Caucus, but, more importantly, it was those women who got me on the DNC.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because we didn't have--out west, you didn't have as many women.  It was mostly whites that was on the DNC from Nevada; and with me being active, I was the chairman of the county commission [Clark County Board of Commissioners], and I was a- very active in national politics, and then they went to Harry Reid, who was a senator at the time, to help me get elected as--on the DNC; and then they later helped me become the chairman of the DNC--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Black Caucus.
Speaker 1: Now, you succeeded Terry McAuliffe, is that?
Speaker 2: Terry McAuliffe was--oh, he was, he was--Terry McAuliffe, he was the chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he was, he was--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --the chairman, and I was the chairman of the Black Caucus--DNC Black Caucus.
Speaker 1: At the same time?
Speaker 2: At the same time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Terry was very supportive of me, very helpful, and it was--it was a great--it was a great time.
Speaker 1: All right.  Are there any stories from that time that you want?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, lots of stories (laughter).
Speaker 1: That you can tell us?
Speaker 2: We were, we were--you know--we were really active in trying to maybe sure that African Americans got elected, and, you know, obviously also making sure that, that we won the White House, and so we were very active in politics; and there were a group of women.  We later went on to, to create Future PAC [The Future PAC, Women Building for the Future Political Action Committee], and it was the first African American PAC that was created to help women of color get elected in--on local level, as well as on a national level.  And we did a lot of--we did a lot of things.  We were very active.  [HistoryMaker] Maxine Waters was, was a big supporter, and, and--
Speaker 1: Is this the first super PAC that was formed--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --by black members of the (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) By black women.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was called Future PAC.  And it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was from--women from all over.  We were from all over, and we were the founding members and started that organization to get women, African American women elected, and we raised funds.  We raised money.  So we gave money.  We were trying to be like EMILY's List and so forth, but we were African American women.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  That, that's, that's something.  Now would you consider that, I guess, the major accomplishment of that period of time, or would you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I would say so, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I would say so, yep.
Story_ID: 666380
Speaker 1: This is 2002, and did--let's see.  So many things are going on.  You got the 9/11 [September 11, 2001], and you got like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on a national level, George Bush [President George Walker Bush] is campaigning for this war in Iraq [Iraq War], and the--what was going on here?  I, I know on the Chicago [Illinois] end, I kept hearing about people moving to Las Vegas [Nevada] steadily, you know--
Speaker 2: Moving to Las Vegas.
Speaker 1: --as Cabrini Green [Cabrini Green Homes, Chicago, Illinois] closed up, and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --other housing projects, Henry Horner [Henry Horner Homes, Chicago, Illinois] and other--people get on buses, come to Las Vegas.  Did you, did you have any sense of that?
Speaker 2: You know, I didn't--well, let me, let me back up.  We heard a lot of individuals moving to Las Vegas from California because they drove the prices of our homes up sky high during that time, so there were a lot of influx of individuals moving from different places and communities to Las Vegas because there were, you know, jobs and opportunities; housing market was low, so you were able to afford to buy a house, and many people in Las Vegas--I mean, in, in Los Angeles [California] were selling their houses and homes and then moving to Las Vegas, buying two and three homes at a time because it was so reasonable and so affordable.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's why you had a lot of individuals, you know, moving over to, to Las Vegas because the housing market was--you know was great.  You had opportunities and jobs and so forth.
Speaker 1: These are movements--what I'm describing in Chicago, from what I, what I heard at the table every week in Chicagoland, what you're describing from L.A.--these are movements of people who are--really need opportunity, and so--
Speaker 2: They moved to Vegas.
Speaker 1: --it's been suggested in something I read that a lot of gang activity from--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it did.
Speaker 1: --Los Angeles and Chicago ends up--
Speaker 2: It did.
Speaker 1: --coming too?
Speaker 2: It did.  It created--we had some, we had some issues with gang violence and, and those kinds of things that were happening in Las Vegas, but, you know, being the state that we were and the police department [Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department] that we had, it wasn't tolerated.  It was not tolerated.
Speaker 1: You know, this is--I mean, if you think--I mean, just, just sitting here, if you think about this now, I mean, Las Vegas seems like the ideal place to come if you're a drug dealer.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was, but I don't think it is as much now as it was then because they--the police department just didn't tolerate that kind of thing, and so there was a lot of pushback on their part to make sure that we, you know, didn't have those kinds of activities.  And one of the things when I was on the county commission [Clark County Board of Commissioners], we didn't have a police department in the black community, but I was able--
Speaker 1: Oh, you mean a station?
Speaker 2: A station.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was one of the things that I built while I was there was a police station in, in the black community.
Speaker 1: And you said that the police department just wouldn't tolerate it.  Was there--what kind of methods did the police department use?  Were they heavy handed, or were they into community policing or what did they (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was commun- more community policing and also, you know, they--they--we had the gang taskforce, and we had--the, the police department really reached out to elected officials and to people in the community to create that.  They had a relationship.  We had a cil- a civilian review board.  If there was anything that was ever questionable where, you know, we had a civilian board [Citizen Review Board] that looked at the, the type of activities and things that they did, heavy handedness, I would say, that was very vocal and very active; and so you had a lot of individuals at that time who were very active in local things, and the police department was one of the things that they were involved and active on.
Story_ID: 666381
Speaker 1: Two thousand two [2002] was also a year that four of the seven members of the Clark County commission [Clark County Board of Commissioners] are sentenced to federal prison.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now this is--
Speaker 2: Huge.
Speaker 1: I don't remember this in national news.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But this is a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was huge.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  This is--makes your eyes pop out.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Four.
Speaker 2: Four of them.  Well, it was actually three that were on the commission, and one that had retired--not retired but had left the commission, but was--but, nevertheless, was still a member of--still a former member of the county commission.  Yeah, there were three of us at the time that--Bruce Woodbury [Bruce L. Woodbury], Myrna Williams and myself that wasn't involved in that, and it all stemmed from a ordinance that I sponsored.
Speaker 1: What was it?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Lap dancing.
Speaker 1: Really?  That's why they went to federal--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Lap dancing, so, well--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --explain the dynamics of it.  What, what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, I was the chair of the liquor and gaming board, and we controlled all aspects of everything; and the Metropolitan Police Department [Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department] and the--our department head for liquor--for the liquor department, business license department came to me and asked me if I would sponsor an ordinance to try to regulate lap dancing; and--
Speaker 1: So how do you regulate lap dancing (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, you could--you set standards.  They can't do this.  They can't do that.  And, and, you know, so forth.  But it was Metro.  It was the police department and our department head who asked me to sponsor the ordinance because I was the chairman, and being the chairman, I said, okay, if this guys--what you guys want to do, fine.  I'll do it.  And so I had, you know, three colleagues at the time who opposed me, which I didn't know that they opposed me until later on, and so they were trying to defeat me getting this ordinance passed.  And so as a result of that, you know, there was money exchanged and kickbacks to--I'll do this if you do that and that kind of thing.  And they got caught.
Speaker 1: Wow, so- yeah, that's, that's really a story.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 666382
Speaker 1: Now, in 2003, now, you introduced Nancy Pelosi at the Democratic National Committee's winter meeting.  What, what was the significance of that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't even remember.  I can't even remember.  Gosh, you know, I, I don't--I can't--I just probably introduced her, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just, just doing my, doing my due diligence and my job as the, as the Black Caucus chair [Democratic National Committee Black Caucus] probably, most likely.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So in 2004, you're, you're reelected again, and George W. Bush [President George Walker Bush] is reelected.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes.
Speaker 1: This is--this time he beats John Kerry.  Or does he?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know.  Or does he?  You know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --this is a--you got the Ken Blackwell's of Ohio poll issues now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is that right?  Is that--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I was in--I was active and involved in that campaign also, the John Kerry campaign and the Howard Dean campaign; I was involved in all of that trying to, you know, make sure that we win the White House and elect a president that, you know, was more in tune to the issues of our community.
Speaker 1: Hm, okay.  So this is a time period when the political PACs [political action committee] and--are really--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --getting big.
Speaker 2: He won Nevada.
Speaker 1: Did he?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He won Nevada.
Speaker 1: John Kerry?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he won Nevada.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but did you--once again, did--was there a--how close were the Democrats in calling for some kind of investigation into the election?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't real- I don't really recall if they were, if they did or not.  You know, the biggest thing was when Gore [Al Gore]--that was the biggest issue was, was in Gore [Bush v. Gore, 2000], but--
Speaker 1: There was an outcry about polls being shut down early in--remember that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, there--that's right.  There sure was.  You're absolutely right.
Speaker 1: And Ken Blackwell of Ohio--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --was one of the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --he was a black Republican who made sure the polls--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in Columbus [Ohio] and Cinci- and Cleveland [Ohio] especially.
Speaker 2: Right.  They shut down and didn't allow--people were still in line and they did- they shut them down, and they did- you know, didn't allow them to go and, and vote and so forth, and there was a huge outcry about, about that.  We didn't experience that kind of stuff in Las Vegas [Nevada] because our policy at the time--and I was on the county commission [Clark County Board of Commissioners], and the county commission was the one that's in charge of the election.  We do the elections as well.  That's another aspect.  We do the elections and have the election department.  That wasn't our policy.  Our policy: if you were in line at a certain time, you still get to go in and vote.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now one of the, the major aspects of this campaign of John Kerry was that his--a speech that Senator Barack Obama of Illinois [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] made at the--
Speaker 2: At the--
Speaker 1: --and, and I think he was still a state senator then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a state senator.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in Illinois, made at the Democratic National--
Speaker 2: Convention, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Convention [2004 Democratic National Convention, Boston, Massachusetts], right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Man--that was exciting times.  I was there.  That was exciting times.
Speaker 1: How did you feel at the time?
Speaker 2: You know, I really wanted Kerry to win, and I was, you know, one of those diehard Democrats and was an active Democrat, and, you know, played my role and did my part in trying to support Democrats at the time.  I mean, again, I, I don't know when it was, but, you know, years ago, I realized the significance of not just doing local elections, but you really had to support on the national level, too, because it was that national level.  If we had a president in the White House then it's more--that were Democrat, it's more likely that we're going to have issues that affected my people that would be able to be resolved and, and supported and helped, and so that's why it was important to, you know, to help and support Democrats for elected office.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, how did you feel about Barack Obama's speech?  Did you see him as a future star, or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.  Oh, absolutely.  Although, I was a diehard Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] fan when--when they ran in 2008.
Speaker 1: But at the time there was no contention.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I'm just asking you what you think about him at that point?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was up and coming, lord, know- I don't think anyone ever thought he would ever become president, but he was a very articulate, promising person.  Never thought--again, never in my wildest dreams ever thought that he would ever become president.
Story_ID: 666383
Speaker 1: There's a Republican governor elected in Nevada in 2007, right?  Again, if I'm going too fast--if, I'm skip- I don't want to skip anything.
Speaker 2: No, no.  I'm just trying to think who was--oh--
Speaker 1: Gibbons [Jim Gibbons].
Speaker 2: --Gibbons, yes.  It was a disaster.  And that was the year that I, I resigned.  I left the commission [Clark County Board of Commissioners] in 2007.  I left the commission.  I was going to open up my own--well, I did open up my own business, but I was finishing up my Ph.D. [at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada] and, and opened up my own construction company [ECO Construction, LLC, Las Vegas, Nevada].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right.  So construction work, so you're going into--your father's [Eddie Atkinson]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --footsteps.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and one thing that people did not realize is during that two thousand and--during that time period, I was approached by one of the gaming companies, and they interviewed me to be on the gaming board, one of the, one of the casino boards; and so I felt that it was a--it would have been a, a conflict for me to be on that board, on that gaming board and be a county commissioner, and so that, too, was also a factor as to why I resigned.  I was being considered for--to be a member of a gaming board.
Story_ID: 666384
Speaker 1: Now, you're finishing up your Ph.D. dissertation at this time, too, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I--well, I was, I was working on my dissertation [at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: I was working on my dissertation.
Speaker 1: Your dissertation concerned public corruption.
Speaker 2: Right.  And that was prompted because I had four of my colleagues that went to federal prison for public corruption.
Speaker 1: What did you learn about public corruption, or what was your thesis about it when you were writing your dissertation?
Speaker 2: I wanted to find out what made people do what they do to get involved in corruption, and I wanted to know what kind of factors that prompted them.  Was it money?  Was it their background?  Was it their education?  Was it their level of poverty or successfulness?  And so I looked at a number of issues to determine what factors prompted them to, to do what they do.  And one thing that I will say that I--in looking at all the various case- cases that individuals who got elected--when--I mean, who, who were convicted of corruption.  There is--if you do something wrong, it's going to come to the light.  It will come to the light.  That you cannot take a dollar or a cent or anything from indivi- from anyone and it not become public.
Speaker 1: So, so are you saying you can't just take a little bit and people forget about it?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  Cannot do it because, generally, in the case of public corruption, there's two people who are involved: there is you, and there is me.  So now you've widened that, so it's not just me who knew it.  It's you that know it.  And I can't control you.  And so if you, if you take anything from anyone, somebody else knows about it, so it's no secret.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, you know, what--what they always say in Chicago [Illinois], well, white people do it.  So why can't we get away with it?
Speaker 2: Can't do the same thing.  We don't have the--you can't do--you should know that by now.  You cannot do what they do.  There's two different standards: one for them and one for us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Some of them do get caught, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they do.
Speaker 1: --but aren't there some that don't--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that skate that nev-
Speaker 2: There probably is, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That skate through it.  But why take the risk?  Why take the risk?
Speaker 1: The risk seems--I mean, seems like it's linked to the amount of--
Speaker 2: It's nothing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's nothing considered--I mean, when you think about the little pennies that you're going to get compared to a lifetime in prison, or, you know, years in prison and ruining a career and those kinds of things, it's not worth it.
Speaker 1: And there was some--were there some int- some interesting case studies around corruption?  I mean, a place like Las Vegas [Nevada], you would think there would be like a lot of interesting case studies and, and people being tempted to--?
Speaker 2: You know, and that's funny you say that because when I was working on my dissertation, and all I could think of is my experience as a county commissioner.  And here you are, you know, here you are, a person of--let's take me as an example.  I come from--my family wasn't wealthy.  I come from, you know, middle class family; and here I am making decisions for people who were going to make millions, and just one push of the button will determine how wealthy or how poor you would be, okay.  And then here you are, you're socializing with all these very wealthy people, and so the temptation, you know, and that's what happened to--that's what happens to a lot of them.  They're, you know, helping and supporting individuals, and they're socializing and traveling and doing all sorts of things and getting invited to parties and, and events and, and so here you are, rubbing shoulders with some of the most wealthiest individuals, and you say to yourself, well, why can't I have that?  And then, you know, you start to forget that you have an obligation to yourself and to your family and to your community, and the temptation becomes so great that I want to have the same thing that they have, and that's what happens.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There's something called Agnew's [Robert Agnew] general strain theory.  Was that part of your dissertation?
Speaker 2: Yep, yep.  I had to look at, at, I had to look at various theories and figure out why people do what they do.  And--you know, and today, you know, I look at individuals who I knew very well, both black and white that are either in prison, have gone to prison because of the temptation to take bribes.  And when, when I was a county commissioner, I was investigated many times by the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation].  My col- my other colleagues who were on the commission [Clark County Board of Commissioners] were--we all were investigated by the FBI, and it's not a, it's not a pleasant, it's not a pleasant feeling.  It's a very stressful time, but, you know, when you know that you live your life right and you do the right things, you don't have to worry about, about that.

Speaker 1: Two thousand eight [2008] was also a time when you were appointed a superdelegate?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, explain what a superdelegate is and, and do you philosophically agree that such a delegate should exist?
Speaker 2: I do.  I actually do.  I mean, it had--became a big issue.  It became a big issue in this election with Bernie Sanders where they didn't support superdelegates, and I was a superdelegate.  I was actually (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well what is it, first of all, what it is?
Speaker 2: A, a superdelegate, they're mostly, mostly elected officials, but you become a member of the DNC, so you have, you have your party.  You have the individuals who represent the party, the local party, either--and then you have the individuals who are the national committeeman or the national committeewoman for that particular community.  And then you have--there's a group of us who become--because when, when you--you are elected by the party.  You're elected by the party when you are a national committeeperson or you're a representative, but a superdelegate is not elected.  A superdelegate is appointed.  And in my case, I was appointed by Harry Reid, you know, to be a superdelegate, and so that's how, you know, I got involved.  And it wasn't in '98 [sic.] it--in 2008; it was actually before then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was a superdelegate for Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] during the 2008 campaign between she and Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], so when I first got on the, on the DNC, Democratic National Committee, I was a superdelegate.  And Harry Reid, [HistoryMaker] Minyon Moore, Tina Flournoy, [HistoryMaker] Donna Brazile, Regena Thomas--they all worked to get me appointed by, through Harry Reid as a, as a superdelegate.
Story_ID: 666386
Speaker 1: Two thousand eight [2008] election, so you were a superdelegate for Hillary--
Speaker 2: For Hillary.
Speaker 1: --Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton].  What--and I know you probably received a lot of criticism--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --for that.
Speaker 2: Well (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Because of the, you know, the, the meteoric rise--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in popularity of the idea of Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] becoming--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --the first black president.
Speaker 2: Correct.  That's correct.
Speaker 1: So you were running against not just Barack Obama, but the idea of him becoming the first--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --black president.
Speaker 2: Right.  And I--in the end, I supported him.  I was on the committee that made the decision between who would become the presidential nomination; and so I switched my support for Hillary and went to Barack Obama and supported Barack Obama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have to face a lot of flak for that, or?
Speaker 2: I--with some, you know, with some of my friends, but, you know, you got to let bygones be bygones.  At that time, there were some people who were upset with me that I switched and supported Barack Obama for, for the presidency on the, on the rules committee.  But, you know, you, you got to do what you have to do, and, and at that time, there was, you know, strong evidence as to why I did what I did.
Speaker 1: Yeah how do you--when you look back on it--how do you--do you have an analysis of how Barack Obama was able to win, you know, in 2008?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was, he, he was strong in terms of his, his get out the vote effort and his community organizing.  He was strong in that.  I mean, they mastered it.  They mastered it.  And then there was the, the mere fact that you had an African American that could become president.  I think that had a lot to do with it because people really wanted to have an African American to be the president of the United States.  And he was so dynamic.  He was very dynamic, and that really played a huge part in, in it as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, the Democratic National Convention [2008 Democratic National Convention] was held in Denver [Colorado]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that year, and Barack Obama makes this iconic speech--
Speaker 2: Oh, my gosh.
Speaker 1: --in Mile High Stadium [Sports Authority Field at Mile High, Denver, Colorado], so describe that experience.
Speaker 2: That was probably the highlight of being a Democrat, was to listen to him make that beautiful speech that was so uplifting; and he was great.  I mean, you could not take it--he had that charisma that I think we needed at the time.  He was very charismatic, and it was, it was, it was a great--it was, it was fantastic.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there anything that Barack Obama said that night that, that you remember that you--?
Speaker 2: I, I think the whole speech was--I mean, I still have it.  I still have his speech.  Just what he said and what he wanted to do and, and, you know, he was just--he was fan- fantastic; and then to, you know, have Michelle [Michelle Obama] on his arm, and, and, you know, with his two young daughters [Sasha Obama and Malia Obama].  He was just ideal.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you surprised by the reaction to his candidacy--that his candidacy stirred in the white right?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was, I was probably devastated and shocked.  And even seeing it today, you know, that we still have so much racism here in this community.  Even though, when you look at the community and how we're such a melting pot, and then to see so much racism that still even exists today, it's disturbing.  It's like when do, when do we ever get past that?  When will it ever stop?  When will people realize that we are all humans?  That we are all made of the same thing.  When?  Why is there always such a disparity between black and white?  When, when will we ever, you know, when will that ever be eliminated?
Story_ID: 666387
Speaker 1: After you retired, I mean, did you retire from party politics, too, or did you--?
Speaker 2: I retired from everything (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I--yeah, when I retired, I, I--my focus, I move- we moved here to Colorado, but my focus was trying to finish my Ph.D.  And so for three years, I, I didn't even leave the house.  I just focused on trying to get my Ph.D. finished, and, you know, now that I'm finished, now I'm, you know, more involved in politics than anything now.  Again, again.
Speaker 1: So you got, you got the Ph.D. from UNLV [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --as well?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And have you taught any since?
Speaker 2: No, I haven't.  I've been so busy, I--what I, I did was, after I got--finished my Ph.D., my focus was to--to raise my daughter [Kamina Gates] because for years, you know, with my other kids, I worked all the time.  I was a career woman, so I worked all the time.  And I wanted to make sure that I spent time with my daughter who was in high school, and giving her what she needed; and I think that was probably the best thing that I did, is I actually spent time, you know, raising my daughter.
Story_ID: 666388
Speaker 1: Were you active in party politics at all when Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] ran in 2012?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I, I helped out on his campaign here in Colorado.  You know, when you are involved in politics for as long as I was involved, you pick up a few skills, and so I, I did.  In 2008 and in 2012, I worked on, on his campaign here in Colorado.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And how, how is Colorado--how is Colorado disposed towards Barack Obama?
Speaker 2: They were supportive.  They were really supportive.  I mean, where I live, you know, in Boulder [Colorado], you don't have that many blacks.  There aren't that many blacks, and so I work with a lot of whites, and, shoots, they were more liberal than I am (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm, I'm tempted to ask you in what ways, but I, I don't know--what?
Speaker 2: They were--let's put it this way.  They're just a lot liberal-er than I, than I am.  I'm more of a fiscal conservative so to speak, and there are issues that they support that I don't support.  Like I don't support marijuana, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, legalization?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, I didn't support that at all.
Speaker 1: All right.  How is it working out here?
Speaker 2: Pretty good from what I understand.  You know, they have it regulated very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So things haven't gotten worse because of--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --marijuana.
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were afraid they were before?
Speaker 2: I, yeah, I--I think, I think it just has a real negative stigma on the community, and--but it has generated a lot of revenue, and they manage it very well from what I understand.  You don't see a lot of crime or, or that, that's associated with the mari- marijuana industry.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so many--there, there have been studies about the number of black males that are behind prison walls now because of marijuana possession.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That, you know, in the past.
Speaker 2: In the past.
Speaker 1: All over the country.
Speaker 2: Right.  But now it's becoming--it's recreational, legalized, so it's not just Colorado where it's legal now.  It's other states, so I wonder if those policies and laws are going to change.
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, those--they did, but, but, you know, so fewer black males are going to jail because of that, you know.
Speaker 2: Because of that now.
Speaker 1: They have to find another way, but that, that's one reason it's gone.  So, yeah, okay.  So what do you think--there's also been a criticism of--and I don't know what you think about this that--minorities are, are shut out of the business of marijuana or find it hard to get involved in it since it's legal.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I, you know, I don't know.  I know in Las Vegas [Nevada], in Las Vegas, they have the medical marijuana, and I know that there are individuals who are African Americans who's involved in it.  You know, Frank Hawkins, as an example, a former L.A. Raider [Los Angeles Raiders; Oakland Raiders], former city councilman, for- in Las Vegas.  He's--he has a dispensary, a marijuana dispensary and a marijuana license, and that there are other African Americans that I know of that are involved in mar- in the medi- marijuana industry in Las Vegas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 666389
Speaker 1: Is your daughter [Kamina Gates] out of school now, and?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She just graduated from college this year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're starting to get back into politics more?
Speaker 2: I'm, now I'm getting back.  I'm getting--not just in politics but just getting, you know, getting back involved in a lot of things.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Are you, are you still a member of--well, do you still function in the DNC [Democratic National Committee] at all or?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  I'm not--I'm not (background noise)--what happened, because I moved to Colorado--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Oh, I was asking you about the DNC.  I know the rules committee voted to adopt a superdelegate reform package?  Do you, do you think that's wise?
Speaker 1: I don't think so.  I think it should stay just as it is.  That's my personal opinion because su- there's a, there's a purpose for superdelegates, and, you know, there's a purpose for them, and I, I, you know, I don't, I don't know what the rule, rules are, but it's worth looking at.  But, you know, I beco- when I moved to Colorado, Harry Reid, you know, took me off as a superdelegate because I no longer lived in Las Vegas [Nevada], so in 2008, was--which was my last year, I've--I'm--so I'm not involved in the DNC from a national--being on the committee, but I still have friends that are actively involved in DNC politics and so forth.
Story_ID: 666390
Speaker 1: As we sit here today, tomorrow night I think is the first presidential c- debate between Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] and Donald Trump [Donald John Trump]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What are your thoughts about the two- the 2016 election, and, and what it means for the black community?
Speaker 2: Oh, it--this is huge, not just for the black community, for--but for all minority communities.  If Donald run- Donald Trump is elected to--as the presidency, it is going to be devastating.  He has a history of, of how he feels about minorities and so forth; and I'm, you know, I'm big supporter of Hillary, and I believe she's going to win the election.  That's my personal opinion.  I think she's going to win the election because I think people are, you know, after this debate, they will see the difference between someone who is knowledgeable and someone who just talks a lot.
Speaker 1: So are you excited about the as- the prospect of having the first woman for president?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I mean, and Hillary is a, is a perfect--I think she is the perfect person to be a president because of her background: first lady, a senator, and the secretary of state.  She has all the credentials to fill that role, so she knows what it's like to be up against adversity.  She understands the importance of making key decisions.  She's very thoughtful in the way she thinks.  She just doesn't make a decision on a whim.  She studies and does her homework, and I think she will be an excellent president.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What--there seems to be--and it's inexplicable to me on some level.  I don't know how to really--I mean, today is the day, you know, a lot of Sunday talk shows.  Even as we were leaving this morning--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --people were trying to explain that Hillary has given up on Ohio because the white voters--and that's how they frame it.  They said the--and these were white people framing this.  They said the white voters in Ohio have already basically decided to back Donald Trump in Ohio.  Where--a state where the governor [John Kasich] even, a Republican, you know, has, has distanced himself from, from Donald Trump.  They said also the same is going on in Wisconsin.  She's not going to--you know, spend a lot--waste a lot of time going to Wisconsin or Ohio because white people there have decided they would rather see Donald Trump as president; even though they hate him, there's something about her that's, that seems more odious to them than Donald Trump.
Speaker 2: You know, and I do not understand that.  I don't understand.  I mean, but I think it is the perpetuation of rumors and statements that are made.  And just last week, we were, we were out and about.  My friend, a friend of mine who lived in London [England] for twenty-seven years, and now she's back here in the United States, and we were talking to this woman, and, you know, she--we said, well, are you going to sup- we know you're gonna support Hillary.  Oh, my gosh.  Well, "Hillary is such a liar, and she does this."  And I'm like, where do you get this from?  And what--where they get it from is people make assumptions and make statements and it's not supported.  It's not facts.  And they just believe it.  They just believe it.  And I think that's where we have--why we have such a large population of people who don't trust her.  Give me one example as to why you don't trust her.  Is it the email?  Which is nonsense.  That's not even a legitimate reason.  It's nothing even to be--to, to say why you don't support someone because of over this email controversy?  But they're just looking for a reason not to support a woman in many cases; and I do not understand it because a lot of the claims that they're making, they're not even legitimate claims.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It's baffling.
Speaker 2: It's baffling.  It's, it's--I, I do not understand it.  It's like the rumor mill.  You say something, and then, you know, next thing you know, it goes on and on and on and on and people begin to believe it.
Story_ID: 666391
Speaker 1: At any rate, as we--it's 2016, I--what are your future plans now?
Speaker 2: Well, I want Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] to become the next woman, female president, and, hopefully, I'll have a opportunity to work in her administration before I finally wind down my career.  I--it would, it would be such an honor to work for her, and that's what I, that's what I want to do.
Speaker 1: Well, is there any particular area in her administration that you would--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --like to serve in?
Speaker 2: No.  I, you know, I'm pretty versatile, and I think with my background in management, working in the job, dealing with the--being a county commissioner, which was one of the toughest things that I've ever done in my entire life was being on the county commission [Clark County Board of Commissioners], and I think I could--I would, I, I would want to do something where I help the community.  That's always my goal.  I want to do something to improve the plight of African American and focus on education of African American young people.  That's--that's my goal.  And that's one reason why I went, you know, and got the Ph.D. [from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada] was to teach, but haven't done that yet.
Story_ID: 666392
Speaker 1: This is a question we always ask: what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My hopes is that we can eventually live in a community where people don't look at our color but look at us as human beings and our skills and abilities, so that's my hope.  And I would say the plight of African Americans, just if we can get beyond the discrimination and prejudice that exists that people will view us for who we are and not what we are.
Story_ID: 666393
Speaker 1: Tell us about your family now.  We--you were married back in '92 [1992] was it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In, in '86 [1986].
Speaker 1: Eighty-six [1986].  Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Been married for thirty years.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And your husband [Lee Gates] is now a judge, right?
Speaker 2: My husband is a retired judge, and, you know, we live a very simple life now here in Boulder, Colorado where we love it.  We have, between both of us, four children.  Our youngest [Kamina Gates] just graduated from college, getting ready to go back to college.  She's gonna go get her--she's going to follow in her mother's footsteps as opposed to her father, and she wants to become a professor; and so she's going back to school next year.  And we, you know, both of us, we just--we love living here in Colorado.  And, you know, we're, we're very lucky.  Let's put it that way.  We are very, very lucky and very blessed.
Speaker 1: You, you don't miss Las Vegas [Nevada]?
Speaker 2: No.  It's so funny because when my daughter graduated, my husband, he was still a judge at the time, and he said--'cause we moved here for her so that she can get a good education.  We felt that she would get a better education here in Colorado than she would in Las Vegas, so that's why we moved here.  And after she graduated from high school, my husband said to me, "Well, do you want to move back to Las Vegas?"  And I said, "Absolutely not."  By that time, you know, we had been here eight years, and I love it here.  I live in Boulder, which is a very liberal--I don't have the stereotypes that I had in Las Vegas.  I don't have that.  People are very, very friendly.  And I'm the only African American that lives in this community, and I know everyone (laughter) up here, and I love it here.
Speaker 1: Do you still have ties in West Las Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Are you kidding?  There is nothing that goes--that doesn't go on in Las Vegas that I don't get a telephone call about.  People still call me today--I mean, all the time.  Even when they need help.  I have older women that call me today and say, "Yvonne [HistoryMaker Yvonne Atkinson Gates], I need you to help me to this.  Can you do this for me?"  So I still have my close ties to Las Vegas; and helped a lot of people there.  In fact, one of my assistants, one of my old assistants, she's running the Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] campaign in Las Vegas right now, and so I still have ties, a lot of strong ties there.
Story_ID: 666394
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I haven't asked you about we need to talk about before I ask my last couple of questions?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, the only thing that we sort of missed is the fact that I was the chairman of the county commission [Clark County Board of Commissioners] for, for four years.
Speaker 1: Now, this is, yeah, it's very important too, because this is like--
Speaker 2: I was the first--
Speaker 1: --the chairman of the--
Speaker 2: --I was the first African American woman.  I have been the only African American to ever chair that commission.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And that's the chief executive of, of Clark County [Nevada].
Speaker 2: Of Clark County.
Speaker 1: Which is the place where all the--
Speaker 2: Gaming and everything.
Speaker 1: --the money is.  That's where the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And that's--
Speaker 1: --all the revenue is, and--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --that area.
Speaker 2: And that is really, really, significant.  Being the chairman of the county commission is, is prestigious, I would say, because of what we did and what our responsibilities were, and I, I'm, I'm--I was the first African American female to ever be elected to the board, and then to chair the board was even more significant.
Speaker 1: And as--when--as four ex-commissioners went to jail can testify, it's a dangerous position if you are not--
Speaker 2: It--
Speaker 1: --ethically right.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely.
Story_ID: 666395
Speaker 1: Last two questions are si- very similar.  Ma'am, what do you see today as your legacy; and how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a person who cared about the community in which she grew up in [Westside, Las Vegas, Nevada], and that I did everything that I could to improve the plight for African American, but most importantly for African American children.  And I view my legacy as supporting issues to improve the educational level for young minority individuals through my early childhood development centers, through my community resource centers, through the things that I did to improve the community in which I grew up in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very important for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: All right.  Thank you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
