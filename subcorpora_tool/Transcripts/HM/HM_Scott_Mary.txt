Speaker 1: The first part of this interview is going to be used for a documentary about leadership of the AKA Sorority.  So I'm going to start with those questions, okay?
Speaker 2: Good.
Speaker 1: What influenced you or your decision to seek the position of supreme basileus?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, I never thought I would ever be supreme basileus of Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], but some years ago, as I was teaching in my classroom at M. Agnes Jones School [M. Agnes Jones Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia], Dr. Bowen [Margaret Davis Bowen] who was the past national president of Alpha Kappa Alpha sent for me.  All of us in Atlanta [Georgia] admired her to the point that my principal stopped me from teaching ballet and sent me to her home, and she said to me, "You are going to be supreme basileus of Alpha Kappa Alpha."  Now, of course, I was very surprised, said to myself, never.  But at that moment, I did take a look at seriously thinking about, could I ever be the national president?  From that point on, I did take a good look at what it meant to be Alpha Kappa Alpha's national president, what you had to do in terms of working on national committees and there it began.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, how would you describe your ascension to the supreme basileus position?
Speaker 2: Well, it was an excellent story as we talk about it this morning.  I was a very active member of my chapter, Kappa Omega.  As such, I was able to go to national conventions all over the country as we moved around and I saw firsthand the work of our organization.  Consequently then, later on, I ran for regional director, before that though, I became president of Kappa Omega Chapter which gave me a firsthand look at what the leadership of this organization required.  I became regional director, from there I became first supreme anti-basileus and national basileus, which we call supreme basileus.
Speaker 1: Basileus, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, those were some of the things that propelled your candidacy?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What else propelled your candidacy to supreme basileus?
Speaker 2: Admiration for those ladies whom I met that I really enjoyed working with, many of them, my seniors, but they were so fine in what they wanted to pull out of our documents.  They knew what to say, they knew what we needed, and so it inspired me to take a look at what it is I needed to consider if I was going to become one of those ladies.  And so I did.  I worked very hard on national committees.  I worked very hard as a member of the national program committee, which gave me a real look into, so to speak, what it took to be a leader in this sorority.
Story_ID: 618622
Speaker 1: As you were taking a look, what was your vision for Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Well I, am an ardent African Methodist Episcopal church member, so I was aware of the needs of our people as we moved around from city to city, as we moved around from state, to state and I had a chance working in the Civil Rights Movement to know some of the basic needs of our people.  So, as I looked at Alpha Kappa Alpha, my first charge in my mind was to see what we could do as African American women to serve the needs of our people.  And that really sold me, because Alpha Kappa Alpha was already in place serving in communities across the world, so to speak.  And I think that is where my real interest became fired up, was a chance to serve people everywhere, all people, but particularly my people.
Speaker 1: What or who influenced your vision for Alpha Kappa Alpha?
Speaker 2: As I said, Dr. Margaret Davis Bowen, who was one of our early national presidents, when she came to Atlanta [Georgia] because her husband [John W.E. Bowen, Jr.] was a bishop in the United Methodist Church [Methodist Episcopal Church; United Methodist Church], she was assigned to a school where I was a beginning teacher.  And so, of course I admired her.  At that point I had become an Alpha Kappa Alpha woman for about six months and of course, she took me right under her wing.  She was so fiery and of course, at that point I was playing the piano.  I really was playing and singing then and so she took me as her person to the next national meeting.  I became a fixture with her, and I have to give her credit, because every time we had a boule, she had to come in from abroad and that was something, you know, that was very new to us, a person who had gone to Africa to visit, a person who had gone across the world and she would come back and tell her story and have me play the piano.  It was an excellent experience and I give her a lot of credit for what happened to me later.
Speaker 1: Tell me, in what ways was your vision designed to ensure Alpha Kappa Alpha's survival?
Speaker 2: Well, I really felt that by the time I was eligible, in my mind, to become national president, we had gone through many of the civil rights issues and we really felt that we had made it to some extent.  I saw the need, however, because I was reared in Atlanta and because I saw the up spiraling of what we were getting here, but felt the need to go forward which what I saw happening and it is really happening yet.  We were losing some of the fire that we had in the beginning.  So I felt that as national president of Alpha Kappa Alpha, I could inspire younger sorors to move upward and those who were older to help me to grow and see if we could not together push forward for our people.  And that's what I did.  I chose a program that would allow us to work in several areas and the sorors followed.  I was at that time when we needed to pull Alpha Kappa Alpha's history from repositories around Chicago [Illinois].  And so, we put a, a new addition to our building, we built--I was right in time to get that pleasure of looking at doing our new Ivy headquarters [Ivy Center, Chicago, Illinois], and it was a blessing, because it did so much for us as people.
Speaker 1: Expand a little bit more on how your vision communicated and carried out through the sorority's programs during your administration?
Speaker 2: I need to show you an insignia of my administration, and I'm going to get that for you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we'll talk about it, 'cause it wraps up the question that you're asking me, what it is we had in place through our program that helped.  Can you give me a minute to get that?
Story_ID: 618623
Speaker 1: That's your program?
Speaker 2: There it is.
Speaker 1: Okay we'll take pictures of that afterward.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So tell (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But see now, you're ready to ask me to tell you about it?
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 2: And this program was put together in 1990, so, (laughter), somebody's gonna have to hold this so I can tell it, left right.  You understand what I'm saying to you?
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well let me hold it.
Speaker 2: Okay, very good.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Can you see it?
Speaker 1: Can you see it?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  All right, we're ready.
Speaker 2: All right.  My program title was cre--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I'm sorry, I, I wasn't quite ready yet--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Go ahead and start.
Speaker 2: My program theme was Creative Strategies for Action: Addressing the Crisis of the 1990s, and I chose those issues which I felt Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] needed at that point to address across the world.  And so, we addressed health issues; we addressed economic issues; we addressed family issues, we took a look at art around the world; and we looked at education around the world.  We looked at the family very, very carefully, because at that point, I felt we needed to talk again about the needs of the black family and the need to get together as parents, as grandparents, as sisters, brothers, and children to put together a family unit that would really be valuable, and I feel--I felt that we needed to get together with that.  I do look back now and feel that it worked, because so much of our world now is looking at all of these issues, Alpha Kappa Alpha was right there with them as we moved forward.
Speaker 1: What kinds of things did you specifically do to successfully communicate your vision as we effectively institutionalized it as a guiding principle?
Speaker 2: First of all, I worked with the directorate, that's our board of directors of Alpha Kappa Alpha to plan and strategize, for getting the message of those program entities out to every chapter where we found ourselves with the president in place and we had one in every chapter across the world.  By the time I became president, we had chapters in Africa; we did a chapter in England; we have a chapter now, and of course, it had begun to begin in Korea, so we were--and, and we had several chapters over in the islands.  So we were able to communicate and, and get together as a group.  The message of our program, we had representatives on our board of directors from all of these areas, so it was no problem once we put this program together to get the message out to each chapter and get feedback from each chapter, so that we knew what we were doing as a group, and the quilt came together very, very well.
Story_ID: 618624
Speaker 1: As far as your leaders- leadership style, what leadership style did you use to bring your vision to fruition?
Speaker 2: First of all, I worked very, very, very carefully to let every soror I know that love was gonna be the theme of my administration.  I sent every message out with love, and they felt it.  I touched sorors:  sorors who were in wheelchairs, sorors who were taller than me, sorors who were smaller than me.  But they felt the love that I was offering them, and so we were able then to get together and work together and know together that we were on a mission and that was to serve the world through Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.].  And I think that was the thing that helped because sorors still write me now and sign their letters, love.
Speaker 1: As the individual with the ultimate responsibility for making decisions which would shape Alpha Kappa Alpha, what was the fundamental test you applied?
Speaker 2: Well, the fundamen- fundamental test was to see after a suggestion was made, after it was carried from the board table into each chapter, I would go into regional conferences, I would visit chapters across the world, I would speak to chapters and I couldn't get a feel.  Once I'm in that chapter, or once I'm in the aggregation of the people they got together, I could get a feel of what was out there as a result of what I had put out there with my directorate.  And it was excellent because you could feel the response, you could feel the love.  You could also feel the seriousness of the program entities.  Families were coming to worship with us.  As I spoke over in Nassau [Bahamas], the ladies who were in charge of getting us in the island were right on top of us, you know, showing that they cared about what we were bringing into their island.  When we went to England to do the chapters there, and set up the charters for those chapters, many, many, ladies who were non Alpha Kappa Alpha women knew about Alpha Kappa Alpha and came to help us and support us.  That was my real test of what we were doing and making a decision, is it working?
Story_ID: 618625
Speaker 1: Which former supreme leadership style, if any, did you parallel most?
Speaker 2: Well, all of us have been extremely loveable; we've been extremely creative; we've been extremely cooperative; we've been extremely giving to all of those ladies who are serving Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], whether they are the undergraduates, or the older sorors who are working with us.  So, I don't know that I could choose anyone because all of us together seem to show the same admiration and willingness to work with our sorority.  The only one that I keep calling forth though is Dr. Margaret Davis Bowen, and that was because as she came to Atlanta [Georgia], she helped me, she spotted me out, you know, and there's always something good about that older soror or that older person, that older mother figure who will pull you together and say what you need to do.  And if you listen pretty well, you have a feeling you'll succeed, she was the one that--and I didn't emulate her leadership style, because I was not an Alpha Kappa Alpha when she was supreme basileus, but she came to Atlanta and I admired her as a lady who was giving to the world, and of course, she touched me and I blossomed.
Story_ID: 618626
Speaker 1: So what did you learn about leadership while serving as supreme basileus?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that I had learned about all I was going to be able to learn as an Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] lady before I became supreme basileus.  And I learned it as a member of the African Methodist Episcopal church, because it was there from the age of ten on, I was given tasks which required me to strategize as a leader.  You know, a Sunday school teacher, a departmental leader, an organist, a Sunday school teacher, a president of the church board.  So I had gotten that basic training before I became an Alpha Kappa Alpha lady, and it was just a matter of growing as I became leader of Alpha Kappa Alpha.
Speaker 1: What lessons did, where learned?  What was most instructive for you?
Speaker 2: From that experience?
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I think the one thing that helped me to really grow was to know that in order to serve you must be able to follow.  And in order to follow, you must give a good listening ear to those people who are working with you and learn from what you hear.  You just cannot listen and dump it; you must listen and grow from it.  And so, the one thing that I think I would say that I really learned as I moved along early in life, and that was to hear and strategize and see if it works.  You experiment a lot, you know, and you, you learn as you experiment that sometimes it doesn't work, so what do you do to put in its place?  And because of that, you build bricks that help you to move along.
Story_ID: 618627
Speaker 1: What was your greatest challenge or controversy that faced you, and how did you respond it?
Speaker 2: As supreme basileus [of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.]?
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's a big one (laughter).  As I moved into the headquarters in Chicago [Illinois], we needed more space.  We had programs, we had things that were happening, and Dr. Barbara K. Phillips [Barbara Kinard Phillips] had already started getting us to the place in Chicago where we had the right property, but we needed the new building.  And so, my challenge was to get in there and see that we got the new facility that we needed and I did and the sorors supported me.  Every soror paid to put that new building in place, we brought from across Chicago all of our papers that were deposited in places of storage, we built a part there, for our own storage, and we became one operating facility and I felt good about that, but that was my challenge, to put in place the new Ivy Center [Chicago, Illinois], and with the help of every active soror, we did it.
Speaker 1: So you relied on counsel and guidance from other sourc- sorors to face that challenge?
Speaker 2: Sure.  I had a board--
Speaker 1: Was there any, was there anyone else?
Speaker 2: --I had a board of directors that's where it started.  Our board of directors which we termed, directorate, got together and we decided we could face the challenge, then we had supporters now, other past supremes supported us, we didn't do it by ourselves, you know, we had Mattelia Grays [HistoryMaker Mattelia B. Grays] who helped us get the money, she went with me around the country and held her little handkerchief high and say, sorors let's do it and it happened.  We had several past supremes who jumped right in there with me to help us get this done.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other ones?
Speaker 2: Faye Bryant [HistoryMaker Faye Beverly Bryant], [HistoryMaker] Eva Evans, Barbara Phillips, all of 'em (laughter).
Story_ID: 618628
Speaker 1: Tell me about, or describe an irritation that spurred you into action as a supreme basileus [of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I can't say there was any irritation.  I'm, I'm not easy to irritate.  However, if it does happen I think I shared with you a very personal story a minute ago, that as we started the Civil Rights Movement here in Atlanta [Georgia]. I was at the right place to be involved in several, several episodes and the one thing my father [Robert Shy, Sr.] told to me was, "Don't ever get on the front line."  And I told you I had the sense to obey him because if I do get irritated, I'll fight back and I did not want to undo the movement (laughter).
Story_ID: 618629
Speaker 1: Describe for me any--or maybe an irritation that spurred you into action.
Speaker 2: An irritation while I was supreme basileus?  I cannot recall one because it's, I said to you a little story a minute ago, I'm not easily irritated because I work hard when I see a problem, however, I did share with you a minute ago that as we moved into the Civil Rights Movement here in Atlanta [Georgia], my directive from my father [Robert Shy, Sr.] was never stand on the front line and I was wise enough to obey him because when I do get irritated I fight back and I would have undone the whole movement.  But I look back now and thank God that he did tell me to stand over on the sideline and if, if that had happened while I was supreme basileus, I probably would have done some little things that I would regret now but everybody was so kind to me, everybody was so cooperative with me. I got hugs and love from every part of Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], so I was never irritated.  Had to think a lot, had to plan a lot, but I was never irritated.
Story_ID: 618630
Speaker 1: By what standards would you measure the success of your administration [as supreme basileus]?
Speaker 2: First of all, I would look at: was there followship?  Did the ladies follow me?  My answer is yes.  Number two: was there buildership?  Was I able to get new members from all corners of the earth so to speak?  I was, because we had sorors who were working in foreign countries where there was no Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], but they would come to the boules with me when I was in places like Nassau [Bahamas], they would come from where they were because they could get there easier than getting into the states, so, followship was extremely carefully done and I, I succeeded there.  Also, how did we fare economically as a group?  Did we, were we able to pay our bills?  And I'd say yes, because we were able to pay our bills, we were able to build a new facility [Ivy Center, Chicago, Illinois] and pay cash for it before it was time for me to go out of office, we burned the mortgage in 1994, at my final boule.  So, those are things, can you, can you live with sorors?  Do they help you?  Do they love you?  Number one, yes, do they follow you, number two?  Number three: do they support financially what you're trying to do?  Yes.  Lastly, do they really love you enough to remember you after you are gone?  Yes, yes.
Story_ID: 618631
Speaker 1: What one thing would you have liked to done, have done that you were unable to accomplish, if anything?
Speaker 2: I can't think of a thing.  Because once we burned the mortgage for our new facility [Ivy Center, Chicago, Illinois], I felt I had moved where I wanted to move with Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.].  We were now able to have all of our belongings in one place, we had a library in our one building, we were all there together, we had our Educational Advancement Foundation housed in our building and so I can't think of another thing I would have liked to have done.
Speaker 1: Well, it's said that we do not remember days, we remember moments.  As supreme basileus, what was your greatest moment?
Speaker 2: Greatest moment was burning the mortgage, way before the fifteen year limit we had to pay it (laughter).  We paid it so fast, until it was no way in the world that I could feel unhappy 'cause the sorors gave me the money.  They brought it out of their pockets and paid for that building and they also left in place plans to keep that building moving.  We yet pay as sorors when we come in, a little stipend to help us get that building in place.  We didn't want to leave a building that would in five or six years be run down and be an eyesore to the community.  So we have built that building and we have taken care of it.  We have done what we needed to do to keep the snow out of it.  We still have a committee, a building and properties committee that looks into every need of that building.
Story_ID: 618632
Speaker 1: Your greatest moment, we were talking about your greatest moment and you were telling me about the mortgage [for the Ivy Center, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And how fast you were able to rid yourselves of the mortgage.  How long did it take to get rid of the mortgage?
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: You had a fifteen year mortgage?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).  What was your proudest moment?
Speaker 2: I'm going to keep giving you the same answer (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for several entities here this morning because as I said to you before, the big piece with me was to be able to put that building in place and pay for it.  We did so by coming to the boule in 1992, and getting the promise of every soror there that we could do it, we got the mortgage and we paid it off in two years, one of my treasurers in the national office said that when she took the check to the bank, the bank manager said, "I've never seen anything like this," (laughter).  Because we had done it.  The sorors put their little money together as a group and it showed that African American women knew how to deal economically with what we needed to do.  I think that was the greatest pride that I had, was to show that here is a group of ladies who know what to do as they moved together to get it done financially and we paid for it, we burned that mortgage in two years and that was some 4 or 5 million dollar mortgage, can't beat that.
Speaker 1: So that made you proud as well?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is that also the happiest moment?
Speaker 2: I think so.  I think so, because it was the one thing that helped me to realize that I was leaving something behind as I went out of office that would live for years with Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.].  We had put it there, we had paid for it, but we also left a legacy there that would help that building to stand tall in that education community.  We didn't want to leave a building that the university [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] across the street could look at ten years from my time and say, "We gotta get that eyesore out of here," so my proudest moment was to know that we were leaving something there that would stand and it's standing even now.  That was 1994 when I went out of office [as supreme basileus].  We are now at 2008, and it's a beautiful building.
Story_ID: 618633
Speaker 1: Speaking about legacies, would you compare the Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] you inherited from your pre- predecessor [Janet Jones Ballard] to the one that you left to your successor [HistoryMaker Eva Evans]?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that the only difference is that we were serving more people.  As you look at our history--let's take Atlanta's Kappa Omega Chapter. For years, we were the only chapter in Atlanta [Georgia], where we had sixty-five members, we'd done well.  Now we have chapters all over the Atlanta area and this is apropos to all over the country and every one of our chapters has from one hundred to two hundred to three hundred members.  So the difference is that there are growth spots throughout our history and we can see that, the way that we have told the people that from eight to twelve women who started us, to sixteen women, that we are now over thousands of women, that's the only comparison, our legacy is there and we've inherited a beautiful sorority.  Our challenge yet, however is to see that it stays worldwide, respected and carefully guarded by those of us who hold membership in its ranks.  I have a little legacy that I'd like to share with you, it feels good to have a daughter [Alfredene Scott Benton] who's an Alpha Kappa Alpha woman and to have three granddaughters who are Alpha Kappa Alpha women, it's a good feeling to know that personal legacy moves through our group.  And so, you have a sense that it's gonna keep moving so these two little, I have one little great-granddaughter that we're gonna dress in pink and green as long as we can to be sure that that legacy moves on down, but that's the thought that we have in Alpha Kappa Alpha when we look at legacy, we look at our soror, [HistoryMaker] Norma White, whom you are going to interview shortly.  Her mother [Ruth Cummings Solomon] I knew as a youngster, and her mother was an excellent Alpha Kappa Alpha lady and look at where she is now.  She's handling our one hundredth celebration.  That's the personal legacy that our sorority gives to our members.
Story_ID: 618634
Speaker 1: Is there a contribution besides the building [Ivy Center, Chicago, Illinois] that had the most impact on you?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, that's a difficult question because when you tell me that I've got to build a new building, and I've got no money, you understand.  You didn't tell me, "We gotta have this building but as, but we're gonna give you 5 million to get started."  There's nothing else that I can say that I, I really wanna give credit to, and that's the fact that I went into that office with that challenge and the sorors helped me to do it.  Now, of course, I take pride in the fact that I've gone across the world and met with our sorors. I've helped sorors in various chapters to look at their buildings and build Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] buildings in their communities to serve their communities, we have several of those, we have one in Atlanta [Georgia], my chapter has a Kappa Omega foundation building [Kappa Omega Chapter] where we serve the community, we have numbers of those throughout the, the world as we move around.  And so, that is a part of Alpha Kappa Alpha that I have participated in but I can't take the credit for that because we had sorors who were building community chapter houses before I became supreme basileus.
Speaker 1: Well what accomplishments of your administration do you wanna be remembered for?
Speaker 2: I think that the greatest thing I'd like to be remembered for is the love I shared with my sorors. That's more permanent even than a building and I think that as I look at where we are headed now, and where I am physically, it's the love that my sorors shared with me and that we still share.  They know that I love every soror, good or bad, so to speak and they love me irritated or not, that is my thing that I'm going to remember as long as I have breath.  And that is that, within our ranks there's a deep love for each other, that's more important than anything.  The building might crumble at any time but that love that we share with each other, when we see each other, we hug and it's a genuine hug, you know.  When a soror writes me and says, "I want to, you to know I'm concerned about your illness now.  How're you doing?  Know that I love you, know that I'm praying for you," that's important.
Story_ID: 618635
Speaker 1: You spoke about the future and going forward from here.  What key elements of the sorority's legacy have been powerful enough to keep AKA vibrant through the test of time?
Speaker 2: I think it's our ability to live in the time that we find ourselves trying to serve.  Whatever is going on around the country, around the world, Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] at each juncture can decide what she's going to do.  Each president goes in and takes a look at what is needed program wise and of course, we, we jump on it, we get on it.  We plan for it, we have a national program committee that puts together what we feel the needs of that time are and we get work, we get to work.  So, permanently we're going to survive, I'd say another 100 years because we're gonna continue to look at the needs of each generation, of each city, of each group of women and we're gonna work at it.
Speaker 1: So you would say that, that one thing that is essential to ensure that we walk rather than back into the next hundred years is, is what?
Speaker 2: Looking forward.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Seeing what the needs are.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And working at it.  You can't look backward and say, "Oh well, we built the building [Ivy Center, Chicago, Illinois] in 1994, we're done."  No.  We have to look forward to what is needed in 2008, plan for it, work at it.  In 2010, what are gonna be the needs of our people?  What do your chapters need to do to serve?  And that's where we're gonna find our legacy.  Working is where we can put our strengths at each moment in time, and each moment in time gives us a new challenge.  We have to live up to it.
Story_ID: 618636
Speaker 1: With that, has the sisterhood dimension taken a backseat to our pledge to be of service to all mankind?
Speaker 2: Ask that question again.
Speaker 1: Has the sisterhood dimension taken a backseat to our pledge to be of service to all mankind?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I think our service to all mankind comes first and when you get ready to say, "I want to be an Alpha Kappa Alpha woman," one must be ready to share in the serve component or we really don't need that person in there.  We don't need persons coming in who just want to wear the pin.  We don't need people asking to join us who want to wear the pink and green.  We want people to join us who really want to serve the world, who want to get out and get the votes, who want to look at communities of children and see what we can do.  And we have that family component each time a supreme basileus comes in, we find some way to continue to serve the black family.  But we also have diversity in our ranks, we have to learn and continue how, to plan how we're gonna serve everybody.  So, it's just not an African American thing, but we want to start with our people, service however is important.
Speaker 1: Excuse me.  What do you perceive as the greatest threat to the survival of the sorority?
Speaker 2: I think the greatest threat is that many times people don't understand what the sorority is about, and I find myself defending all of our sororities and fraternities to many people who really don't understand.  They think it's a card playing, whist playing group, those are my group and of course, the rap group, you know?  But, that's a challenge to us, we have to always defend the fact that we are serious about life; that's our threat.  But, that we're just are not eight groups out here or nine groups wearing colors and stepping.  We are really giving some service to the world.  And I think that message goes out over and over again now, because we work together.  It's no longer a, a Sigma Gamma Rho [Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc.] over here, AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] over here, Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.] over here, we work together now and that's gonna be proven when we get to chica--to Washington [D.C.] this summer.  All of us as Greek groups are gonna walk together and give the message that we are working together to serve the world.
Speaker 1: That is a change that has occurred.
Story_ID: 618637
Speaker 1: What elements of the sorority must be maintained or changed even more to ensure the perfect sisterhood?
Speaker 2: Well, I think right now we are, we're pretty much on, on cue.  There aren't a number of things that we need to do now.  What we are doing now is defending what we've put in place and showing some growth with what we've put in place.  And having people understand why we are where we are and why we are doing what we are doing and we're getting some excellent responses.  People all over the world know Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] now, but I've just had my Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.] sister tell me the other day, we're together so we are not challenged to the point now where we are separated, we're together and we are speaking together as African American women.  We're doing some good.
Speaker 1: So what is your vision of a perfect sisterhood?
Speaker 2: My vision for a perfect sisterhood is the fact that none of us are perfect.  So, when you ask me to say a perfect sisterhood, I wouldn't touch it because none of us are perfect and so you have to keep working at goodness, you have to keep working at service that's of value and not deal with being perfect.  I don't like that word for human beings, 'cause we aren't there yet.  Only the master is perfect in my head.  Does that make sense?  (Laughter) Okay.

Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food?  Yes, apples--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --are my favorite food.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Black.  I love black, it does something for raising my spirits.  However, my baby's--my daughter's [Alfredene Scott Benton] godmother told me years ago, that I needed to brighten myself up and I'm glad she did because, before that, I had black dresses for everything 'cause I loved it and I still feel that it gives you a feeling of business, you're about the business of something, when you put that black dress on.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Not particularly, I just love to travel.
Speaker 1: And what about a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: A favorite phrase would be, love thy neighbor as thyself.  I like that one because it gives me the opportunity to love even those, to try to love even those darlings that I feel trying to trip me up a little bit, you know, and so I keep that in mind and I sit tall and I smile and offer them a hand of love and most times it works, even when they get quiet with me, they give me a smile because they get the message that I'm trying to say to them that I love you, and we need to work together.  That goes for people in the community, in my church, those friends of mine who have nothing to do with the Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.].
Story_ID: 618639
Speaker 1: Now, we're gonna talk about your life and about your family.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I'd like to begin with your mother.  Can you tell me your mother's name and spell it for me please?
Speaker 2: All right.  My mother was Flora Spearman Shy, F-L-O-R-A, Spearman, S-P-E-A-R-M-A-N, Shy, S-H-Y.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in, in, down in Georgia.  Newnan, Georgia, was my father [Robert Shy, Sr.] and Shady Dale, Georgia, was my mother, Shady Dale, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Do you know what year she was born?
Speaker 2: No, I don't right now.  I'd have to look that up in our Bible for you.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your mother.  Did she share stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did, she shared many stories and I was the oldest granddaughter of her group, so I got a lot of stories (laughter).  I got a number of things that the younger generation that my little cousins didn't get because my mother was the oldest daughter of eight children and she was the oldest child of eight children but she was a daughter, and of course, you know, daughters help as the younger children come in, so she had stories that she could tell about all of them and of course, my being that, my brother [Robert Shy, Jr.] was the first grandchild, I was the second and being a girl, nosy as girls are, I was able to get a number of little pieces as we grew up.
Speaker 1: Okay well tel- share some of those stories that your mother--talk about her growing up.
Speaker 2: Okay, first of all she would tell me the nicest jokes and tease me later that I didn't listen because she would always tell me that she was cooking when she was seven, standing on a little can, cooking because the other babies were coming.  Well, I never learned how to cook (laughter), so she held me responsible quite some time for not learning how to cook.  But she was a person who revered education and so she was a school teacher in a day when it was not easy to become educated enough to become a school teacher and she revered that with in her life, and of course, imparted it to me and my sister [Doris Shy Frazier (ph.)].  I have one sister and one brother, and of course my sister and I were in education.
Speaker 1: What did she tell you about where she lived?  Did they live on a farm?
Speaker 2: They lived on a farm, her mother was a little Cherokee Indian [Native American] who fell in love with Henry Buck Spearman [Henry Spearman], who was the son of the plantation owner and so you had a mixture there, it showed in her family as they were born, you know, many of them looked like him and many of them looked like she and her, you know, and her mother.  So it was a beautiful group and I became a part of that group as I told as the oldest granddaughter, I was able to meet with most of her family very, very early in life because they were very, very close knit.  And down in Shady Dale, there was a church where every year they had what was homecoming and that is something you don't hear much about now.  But in my childhood time, every year, their cars left Atlanta [Georgia] and went to homecoming, the people who were fortunate enough to go to New York [New York], got on the train and came back to homecoming, those who were fortunate enough to get those nice big jobs, big in Washington [D.C.], would get on the train and come back to homecoming.  So we had a real sense of family and what it meant to get together and celebrate through the church.
Speaker 1: Now, your mother, her mother, tell me her mother's name.
Speaker 2: Let me think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We can come back to that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, come back to that.
Speaker 1: And, so your grandmother, you were very close to her?
Speaker 2: Yeah, very close.  I'm named for her, my mother's mother was Mary Spearman.
Speaker 1: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So I'm Mary [HistoryMaker Mary Shy Scott], named after her.
Speaker 1: So Mary Spearman was the Indian?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It took--
Speaker 1: --tell you what, what Indian tribe?
Speaker 2: Cherokee.
Speaker 1: Cherokee.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 618640
Speaker 1: And tell me, did she share any stories?  Your [maternal] grandmother, Mary [Mary Spearman], about where she came from and where, how she grew up?
Speaker 2: Well, I tell you what, she ne- she was not a talkative little person, but I was very close to her because I sat at her feet because I was her Mary, you know.  And so, many, many times she was talking about what her relationship was with me, but she didn't have a lot to say.  The only story that I have been able to continue to remember is that she was down in Shady Dale [Georgia], with her group of people who were on their way to some settlement that the Cherokees were going to be living on for that time and she met my [maternal] grandfather [Henry Spearman] as they went down the road, 'cause it was not paved at that time.  Now don't ask me why they fell in love because he was tall, she was a little tiny something, but they did and consequently got married and then became parents of these eight children.  There was a ninth one, but I think he was stillborn.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about some of the times that spent with your grandmother, what did you two share?
Speaker 2: Well she shared with me the fact that I was to be a good girl that was the major theme of parents of that day and grandparents.  So what did it take to be a good girl?  You know, we talked about church, we talked about the fact that I loved music and at five I had been piano struck and was taking lessons, so of course, she had me to tell her about my piano lessons, we talked about the fact that I was playing at the church where I went [Allen Temple A.M.E. Church, Atlanta, Georgia], and of course those were the fun things with us, you know, but she was serious about it.  She also told to me about how important family is as we, as I grew up, you know, and of course, when I married, she was still telling me have some children.  Of course, I was from the new breed of African American, I was educated and I was getting married but wasn't gonna have a lot of children you see?  She had eight that lived and, of course, my husband's mother had had fifteen I think it was and so I was gonna have none and right away she pointed her little finger and said you have some children.  I did have a daughter [Alfredene Scott Benton], then she pointed her finger at me and said, "It's been six years, you need another child," (laughter) that was my connection with her, I listened to what she had to say and I profited from it.
Speaker 1: Where did they live?
Speaker 2: In Shady Dale.
Speaker 1: Sha- but did they also live on a farm?
Speaker 2: Yes, she lived on a farm, they lived on the farm that was at the far end of where her, her father in law and his white family lived okay?  But they live--he took care of my granddaddy and he had four other boys, he took care of all of the Spearman boys, they took his name, part of the plantation is still there now, the cotton mill that was there is still standing and we have a little cousin who has kept the house that some of them lived in at that point.
Speaker 1: Was there a name of the plantation, do you know?
Speaker 2: I don't.  It was just a Spearman.
Speaker 1: What about your grandfather?  Did you have a relationship with him?
Speaker 2: I did until I was eleven, he passed when I was eleven.  We would go down, as I told you, to the homecomings and of course he would tickle our little toes and we just thought he was so fabulous you know?  But, he died of heart trouble when I was eleven.
Speaker 1: Now, can you go back any further?  Was there any talk of, did your Grandmother Mary, talk about her mother?
Speaker 2: Not much.  It was her and her close knit family of kids, I had four uncles that were big, strapping gentlemen and of course she was this tall and when she said move, they moved, (laughter) even when they were very, very elderly, they moved and I admired that about her.
Speaker 1: Who were your uncles?  Do you remember, or what are their names?
Speaker 2: Martin Luther Spearman [Luther Spearman], Samuel Spearman, Alston Spearman.  Those were the main running and Henry Spearman, they were, Sam Spearman he named, he was Henry Samuel Spearman and he took the Samuel.  But all four of those men came to Atlanta [Georgia] and that's what brought that part of the family here to Atlanta.
Story_ID: 618641
Speaker 1: Back to your mother [Flora Spearman Shy], tell me about your relationship with your mother as you were growing up.
Speaker 2: Very close.  Again, very close, again I was the oldest girl, you know?  So, she was always following me around, working with the teachers in the schools, I went to E.P. Johnson Elementary School [Edwin P. Johnson Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia].  At the time I was in elementary school we had only about three schools in Atlanta [Georgia] that we went to, one on each side of town, so in my side of town which was Summerhill [Atlanta, Georgia], I, I know you've heard of Summerhill, okay that was E.P. Johnson Elementary School and all of us went there and my mother was a very good parent worker in that school, she could really cook and so she cooked a lot for the teachers and the children.  If it was time for a Christmas party, "Mary [HistoryMaker Mary Shy Scott], ask your mother if she'll bring some fried chicken," (laughter).
Story_ID: 618642
Speaker 1: Now you told me that your mother [Flora Spearman Shy] was also an educator?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about her education.
Speaker 2: Okay, in Shady Dale [Georgia], they had the opportunity to go to school through the twelfth grade.  Then, they were able to leave there and come to Atlanta [Georgia], or go to Augusta [Georgia], places like that where they had teacher training institutes, and that's what she took part in.  She taught school in Shady Dale, and then got married to my father [Robert Shy, Sr.], came to Atlanta, made it their home and of course had her children.  Now in the day when my mother had children, you didn't teach--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and, and, and have children.  So, that's what stopped her the fact that my brother [Robert Shy, Jr.] was born right after they married and of course I came right along behind that, my sister [Doris Shy Frazier (ph.)] about three years later and so she gave that up, but that was where she started, she really never got over the fact that she couldn't teach.  Now, I understood it later because even as late as 1950, you know, you still had to let them know when you were expecting and you didn't teach.  We had to sue to get that privilege.  So, she came to Atlanta and gave that part up because, you know, she had had her children.
Speaker 1: Tell me--you, you said that she went to Augusta to go to school, or did she go to Atlanta?
Speaker 2: She came, she went to Augusta and took the teacher training courses (background noise) that were offered.
Story_ID: 618643
Speaker 1: We were talking about the, the teacher training (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Teacher training institutes, that's what they called them and several of them were given through the churches in our cities at that time, I understand, several of them where I had a cousin who taught here in Atlanta [Georgia] who started out that same way but then went to college later.
Speaker 1: Tell me where Shady Dale [Georgia] is in comparison to Augusta [Georgia]--
Speaker 2: --to Atlanta?
Speaker 1: --or Atlanta.
Speaker 2: Shady Dale is about an hour and a half from here.  I go down I-20 [Interstate 20], so I can't tell you much about it because I don't go there much now.
Speaker 1: But is I-20, it's going east?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 618644
Speaker 1: Tell me your father's name?
Speaker 2: Robert Shy [Robert Shy, Sr.].
Speaker 1: And tell me about your father.
Speaker 2: My father was devoted to my mother [Flora Spearman Shy].
Speaker 1: Well, tell, tell me a little bit about him before he met your mother--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --if he shared any stories about his (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, he didn't.
Speaker 1: --growing up.
Speaker 2: He was just not talkative; he was a business like person, interested in what she wanted him to do and did it.  She did all of the talking so he was one of those husbands who would go to work and he would come back home, give her the check and let her rear the children (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well tell me, where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Newnan, Georgia.  Now that's diagonally across from Shady Dale [Georgia]. Newnan, Georgia is about the same distance from here down I-20 [Interstate 20], but you go into a smaller section than you get into with, to Shady Dale and I really can't tell you much about those cities because I don't go there often, you know.  When I was young we went to Newnan and my grandfather lived there with, after we married, I would go down to see him so, I know how to get there but not give you any distance and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Do you know what year he was born?  And what about his parents, you talked about his grand- your grandfather, what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: My grandfather was Willie Shy [William Shy], and my grandmother, Mattie Shy, she was one of the first graduates of Paine College [Augusta, Georgia] and of course, some of our family yet finished that school, and of course, we have some materials at Paine College.
Speaker 1: What did Willie Shy do?
Speaker 2: He was a farmer.
Speaker 1: Did he--?
Speaker 2: A farmer, he was a, an organist, he played the organ and he taught rote singing.  He was very active, very, very active in music, maybe that's where I got some of mine from.
Speaker 1: You say he was a farmer. Did they own the land that they lived on?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And it was down, still in Shady--in--
Speaker 1: Newnan?
Speaker 2: Newnan.
Story_ID: 618645
Speaker 1: You said you spent time when, when you went down there [Newnan, Georgia], with your [paternal] grandparents.  Do you remember?  Can you share a story of being down on their farm?
Speaker 2: Well yeah.  My grandfather [William Shy] was the kind of person who really liked to hunt and so very early in life I steered away and stayed in the house because I was afraid of the rabbits that he would bring in, he brought squirrels in, he brought the possums in, and of course, when I was a youngster I would start yelling and screaming because the possums they would cook and put the fruits around them and of course I thought he looked so much like a dog, and they couldn't convince me that he was edible and was safe.  So, my grandfather really taught me a lot about what his generation felt about hunting and, and feeding their family and storing food for the winter so that in the summer, they would have it.  He knew how to do the preserves and the jellies, I would see him take out a watermelon rind jelly and they ate it.  I didn't, my mother [Flora Spearman Shy] used to tease me, she said, "Now when you go there and your grandfather takes it out just eat a little."  But I've never been one to pretend so I didn't eat it (laughter).  But I admired the fact that he knew how to feed the family from the earth and as I grew older and really knew what he was giving to it, I admired him for that.
Speaker 1: And tell me about your grandmother, describe your, your Grandmother Mattie [Mattie Shy].
Speaker 2: Oh, Mattie was a doll, they say I look just like her.  She was tall and very creative but she passed when I was about twelve. She would come to Atlanta [Georgia] to visit and would always teach me how to write, you know and be very proud when I was a youngster about what I could do, showing her that I remembered what she has taught me when she came before, but she passed when I was about twelve.
Speaker 1: Where did she teach?
Speaker 2: She did not teach.
Speaker 1: Oh she never did (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  My grandfather and she married and of course she had lots of children and that was one of the things my dad [Robert Shy, Sr.], while I was very young said to me, you know, "I want you to go to college, and don't marry and have a house full of children," (laughter).  "I want you have some but not a house full." I said, "All right," (laughter).
Speaker 1: How?  Did you ever find out how she was afforded the opportunity to go to college?
Speaker 2: Well her mother, her mother which I did not know, you know, was interested in education also and so she saw that she got to Paine College [Augusta, Georgia] through the C.M.E. [Colored Methodist Episcopal; Christian Methodist Episcopal] church, that's the C.M.E. church and she and Peter Shy [Peter Randolph Shy] who later became bishop of the C.M.E. connection, both went to Paine College.  She then came back down there and married my grandfather and they both had a church choir, those kinds of things, that's the kinds of things she did as she had her children.  But like I say, she traveled, she would drive to Atlanta when I was a youngster, that's how I knew her, but she passed when I was about twelve.
Story_ID: 618646
Speaker 1: Tell me, what is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Of what now?
Speaker 1: Your earliest childhood memory, just in your mind, how far can you go back and think of something that you remember as a child?
Speaker 2: I think my earliest childhood memory would be when I was about five.  Now I've been told some things I did before that, but when I was five, I went to a relative's piano and started playing the piano.  And of course my mother [Flora Spearman Shy] was elated, my dad [Robert Shy, Sr.] was elated so they decided that maybe I could play the piano and they took me to a person in the neighborhood who taught piano individually to children and of course, I became her first, one of her students.  That's the earliest part I can remember because at that point I really started playing the piano. They bought me a piano and I started playing and actually singing, you know, and it just grown up with me.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what you played at first?  What was your first--
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  I have no idea what I played but I think a lot of it gave them courage because I was playing tunes, I didn't know I was playing tunes, but it was.  And I think part of it I picked up because I had listened to my [paternal] grandfather, Willie Shy [William Shy], sing and they would do what they called the note singing, you probably haven't heard about that right?  But there was note singing and those groups, and I would be sitting down when we went down to, to Newnan, Georgia, in the church and they would get those books, acapella, and begin to sing the notes and I think what I started playing is what I had heard them sing.  Now my mother's father [Henry Spearman] played the organ, but he was a quiet person, so I think what I heard myself trying to play I would suggest, and now she would be able to tell you better, was what I had heard them singing and it was pretty.  They, they really sang some beautiful tunes.  I didn't know what I was listening to until much later.
Story_ID: 618647
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother [Flora Spearman Shy] and father [Robert Shy, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: No, they never told me that.  (Laughter) They never told me, let me think a minute.  Did they ever say how they met?  No.
Speaker 1: Once they got married, did they move to Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: No, they went to Chattanooga [Tennessee] first to live with an aunt of my father's who was there in Chattanooga and of course the aunt that was here in Atlanta said to them that they need to come to Atlanta because Atlanta was, even then, at that time I understand a growing place for African Americans, you see.  So, they came to Atlanta and they just did get here before my brother [Robert Shy, Jr.] was born about--he was about eighteen months older than I am, so we were both right together, you know.
Speaker 1: So this was during the beginning of the Depression [Great Depression]?
Speaker 2: I'm sure.
Speaker 1: Then they come to Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And where did they live in Atlanta?
Speaker 2: They lived first on what is now (Unclear) Street, that's over in the Fifth Ward [Atlanta, Georgia], again it was at a time when you only had about four places that African Americans lived, Summerhill [Atlanta, Georgia] over by Auburn Avenue, which at that time was called the Fifth Ward, I think, I'm not quite sure and they had, that we had African Americans over on this side of town up by Mozley Park [Atlanta, Georgia], just before you got there, there were African Americans living on what was then called Hunter Street [Martin Luther King Jr. Drive], you see?  So, they lived on (Unclear) and eventually went to Summerhill because they started building homes over there that African Americans could buy, they went to Summerhill and that's where most of us were.
Speaker 1: You were born in Summerhill?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And Summerhill is what area now?
Speaker 2: It's over by Capitol Avenue, Georgia Avenue, it's still there.  I-20 [Interstate 20] came through and took a large portion of it 'cause that was where our house was, where I-20 goes through now, that's where our church was, I-20 took that.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the church?
Speaker 2: Allen Temple A.M.E. Church [Atlanta, Georgia].  We relocated to where we are now.
Speaker 1: And where is that?
Speaker 2: On West Lake [Avenue], West Lake and Simpson [Simpson Road; Joseph E. Boone Boulevard].
Story_ID: 618648
Speaker 1: So your parents [Flora Spearman Shy and Robert Shy, Sr.] moved to Atlanta [Georgia], and tell me what does your father do for a living?
Speaker 2: My father did what many African Americans did at that time.  He was quietly in business without letting anybody--you know?  But he worked for the city and he had a gentleman--mister, I can't think of his name right now, but he gave him jobs that he was able to do with the City of Atlanta, even back there.  He finally ended up becoming one of the first African Americans to drive a city truck, that kind of thing and block some roads and much, much later in his career.
Speaker 1: Well what type of work did he do?  You said working for the city, but what, what did he do?
Speaker 2: Whatever the, mister, I can't think of the man's name but he drove, that was the main thing, he drove around for the City of Atlanta.  Many times, it looked like he was the second person on the truck, 'cause another person was doing the driving.  That was to keep him from being questioned, "What are you doing with the city truck, you understand?"
Speaker 1: And your mother, was she a stay at home mom?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He wouldn't allow her to work.  So she stayed at home and took care of the three children [Shy Scott, Robert Shy, Jr. and Doris Shy Frazier], and she saw that all of us got to school, and as I said cooked her little hands raw almost for the school system, so that that they would know that she was a parent who was interested in her children.
Story_ID: 618649
Speaker 1: Tell me about the neighborhood in which you lived?  If you can give me a, or a description, or take a tour of, say a, a square block of where you lived?  Do you remember the address where you lived?
Speaker 2: In, in Summerhill [Atlanta, Georgia] we were at 416 Connally Street, the house is no longer there you know, 'cause as I told you I-20 [Interstate 20] came along, but it was right at Memorial Drive, if you can think of where Memorial is.  Now, we moved from there when I was thirteen. We were one of the first families to move into the Grady Homes projects [Atlanta, Georgia]. You mentioned the fellow, Allan Judge [ph.], who was reared over there a minute ago, I mean when we were talking in there.  But, at that time, those homes were fabulous, you know?  And they were able to take in families like my mo- father [Robert Shy, Sr.] and mother [Flora Spearman Shy] and the Rhymes [ph.] and, and it was just beautiful.  You know, they had the refrigerators and all that good stuff.  And we stayed there until I married and then my dad bought another house and moved over on this area, by that time, you know, Atlanta had grown and it was much easier to get property of your own.
Speaker 1: Now, say when you are around five or six years old, and getting ready to go to elementary school and you're, you're living in Summerhill, describe for me the neighbor that you're living there in Summerhill (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Excellent neighborhood, right near our church at that time, so we went from the neighborhood to the church [Allen Temple A.M.E. Church, Atlanta, Georgia], from the neighborhood to the school, all of the parents were parents of all of us.  My mother would make what she called potato pudding, it was a grated pudding.  All of the children came to the house to eat it.  Some other ladies made excellent biscuits, we'd go there to eat those, that was the kind of neighborhood it was, all of the parents shared with the children and we grew up very, very connected.  Those of us who are still alive now are still connected, wherever we are, we are very close.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other people who lived in the neighborhood?  What were there professions or, or jobs?
Speaker 2: At that time?
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 2: Okay, I'm not quite sure what most of them did 'cause they were my parents, you see?  And I was not at that early age, interested in what their professions were, but I know several of them were in the public school system, several were--a number of the men worked on the railroad because at that time that was a good job.  It was later that many of them because part of the postal system [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service], but that was not until I was about fifteen in the projects and things began to open up, so many of them became a part of the postal system.
Speaker 1: Were most of the families two parent households?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Two parent households they were.
Story_ID: 618650
Speaker 1: Tell me some of the, the extracurricular activities that you might have participated in as a young child?
Speaker 2: Okay, as a young child I was a Girl Scout.  As a young child I was a member of the church choir [at Allen Temple A.M.E. Church, Atlanta, Georgia]. As a young child I was very, very early with the performing groups, either I played the piano or I danced, or I sang.  And, those were the things that I took part in, but I was an excellent Girl Scout (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was the troop in your--?
Speaker 2: Church, in my church.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what troop number it was?
Speaker 2: No I don't but I remember the leader Linnie Fry [ph.], Linnie Fry was one of the first scout leaders that I knew and of course she was dedicated to us.  We sang and we walked around Atlanta [Georgia] when we thought we were--and we would come to Simpson Road [Joseph E. Boone Boulevard], which where, at this point I can point out to you the cemetery is now?  That was not a cemetery that was a clubhouse for African Americans, but you had to come through all of the other areas, the white areas to get there and we had, when we walked out there as Girl Scouts.  We had done something, (laughter) and we were in the country so to speak, you know because we had come over to the west side, that's what we called Hunter Street [Martin Luther King Jr. Drive] at that time, where Washington High [Booker T. Washington High School, Atlanta, Georgia] is now, that was the end of where African Americans lived and so when we would get off the trolley there, then we would walk from there to the Simpson Road area, and that was our little scout trip.

Speaker 1: Tell me about elementary school.  What elementary school did you attend?
Speaker 2: E.P. Johnson, Edwin P. Johnson Elementary School [Atlanta, Georgia]. It's no longer there; it's been gone.
Speaker 1: Do you know who E.P. Johnson was?
Speaker 2: I don't know who Edwin P. Johnson was (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I left there and by the time we moved to the projects [Grady Homes, Atlanta, Georgia] I was on my way to David T. Howard [David T. Howard Elementary School; David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia], I know that person and that history much, much better than I know Edwin.
Speaker 1: What grades did you attend at Johnson?
Speaker 2: One through sixth.
Speaker 1: Do you have--do you remember any of the teachers that might have influenced you then?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  The one that I really remember and wish, you know, that I could have lived much closer to her was Eva Thomas [ph.].  She had a brother that had been in the [U.S.] Army and so she would keep us sitting quietly telling us about him and we found so much interest in what she would tell us about what he was doing, until when we left her class, we were really ready to roll, you know?  We, we knew we were somebody, that we could be somebody.  I remember her so well because she was that kind of person, had excellent teachers though.
Speaker 1: Tell me about them.  Why were they excellent teachers?
Speaker 2: Because they cared so much.  They were teachers who, I cannot, I was, I was young so I can't tell you how much curriculum they actually imparted to us, but I can tell you that they cared.  There was a Miss, Miss Calhoun [ph.]. I'll always remember her last name, I was too young to remember her first name but she was always giving us lectures and giving us the parties that we felt young children should have when we were on the playground, she was always there giving us some guidance.  We just didn't roam, you know.  Eva Thomas, Miss Thomas, Calhoun, those are the two that I remember most, and the principal at that time was a Miss Brown.  I think her name was Rachel Brown [ph.]; she was excellent.  But I remember those people because they cared so much about us as students.  They worked with our parents.  You didn't have any such thing as a parent saying, "I can't handle her or him."  You know, those were the days when, if they told my mother [Flora Spearman Shy] that I had acted up, I was in for it (laughter).  Those were the kinds of parents you had then, you know.
Story_ID: 618652
Speaker 1: And your brothers or sisters, you all are close in age so you all went to the same school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your siblings.  Tell me their names in order--
Speaker 2: My brother is Robert Shy, Jr., and he lives in New York, he went to college there and stayed.  My sister is Doris Frazier [Doris Shy Frazier (ph.)].  She stayed here.  She has retired now from the Atlanta public school system [Atlanta Public Schools] as a librarian, but she and I both stayed in Atlanta [Georgia].
Story_ID: 618653
Speaker 1: Tell me more about your elementary school days in school.  What about the books, and was there anything that you can look back on and say could've or should have been better?
Speaker 2: Sure.  First of all, if you ask me about my elementary school days, I was too young and too inexperienced to know that the books we were using were passed down to us.  When I got to David T. Howard [David T. Howard Elementary School; David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia], I was yet so busy, I knew I had a textbook, I'm not sure that I knew and I, I think I can say I didn't know that we didn't have all the textbooks we needed because there again, the teachers created enough for us to get what we were supposed to get and feel that we were getting it.  It was only when I started teaching right out of college that I realized that every book that came through my desk was from one of the white schools and every elementary majorette suit I got came from another white school and they passed them down to us.  Now that was when my fight started with the system.  I didn't want the children to put those dirty suits on and didn't let 'em put it on.  I talked to the parents and very early in my young teaching career, I found parents in the community who could make majorette suits and I really was upset about the books, but we were at that point--in 1950, when I started teaching, they were still handing us books from Sylvan High [Sylvan Hills High School, Atlanta, Georgia] and from the other schools.
Story_ID: 618654
Speaker 1: We're gonna, we're going back to your elementary school days.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you go to Howard through the sixth grade and, no--
Speaker 2: I went to Johnson [Edwin P. Johnson Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: So you went to Johnson?
Speaker 2: Through--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Through the sixth grade.
Speaker 1: And then you moved, and this, is this where you moved too, the Grady Homes [Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you go to David T. Howard Elementary School [David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Right. Now that was what we now call the middle school.  But at that time it was called elementary junior high because it went from the lower grades through the seventh grade and once we graduated we went across town, we got on the trolley and came across town to Washington High [Booker T. Washington High School, Atlanta, Georgia] at ninth grade.  Let's go back, it went to the eighth grade because when I went to Washington High I went to the ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Now we're in, you're at how--sorry, at Johnson and you leave there around what year?  What year are we in?
Speaker 2: I'd have to get my pencil and give you--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and look at that 'cause I didn't, I don't have that in my head right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 618655
Speaker 1: Tell me about the change from moving from Summerhill [Atlanta, Georgia] to Grady Homes [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You alluded to it was very nice?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the neighborhood and how it's different from Summerhill?
Speaker 2: Well, not much difference when it came to parents. Parents were yet parents, they were parents who moved from Summerhill many of them to Grady Homes, young married couples at that time, like the Rhymes [ph.] and I keep calling their name because I'm, I was very close to Robert Lee Rhymes [ph.] whose mother was my godmother and they moved in as we moved in they had just gotten married, so you had several young married African American couples who moved in to those apartments.  And then people like my father [Robert Shy, Sr.] who was making enough to get the kind of rent we needed to move in there.  Now my dad decided that he had three of us that he was gonna send to college.  So in lieu of staying in the house at 424 Connally Street which we was about to buy, he was buying I think he told me but he knew that the Capitol Homes [Atlanta, Georgia], which was a white community was coming through and they were gonna lose all of their property 'cause those projects were gonna be built, so he opted to stop that mortgage and move into the projects and he did.  It was excellent though like I said, we had no idea that now they would have called it ghetto. At that time it was an excellent housing and all of us were growing up, they had the kind of people over there who were interested in us as children, we all walked from the projects up to David T. Howard [David T. Howard Elementary School; David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia].  So things were just fabulous, you know?  We had Martin Luther King's father's church there [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia], we had Wheat Street Church [Wheat Street Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia], so those of us whose churches were still in Summerhill, got church service, we had--I was able to play at all those churches, you know, my little piano and, and play for little choirs. I had friends in those churches so it was an excellent bonding between those of us in those neighborhoods at that time.
Story_ID: 618656
Speaker 1: As you go to the junior high school [David T. Howard Elementary School; David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia], your music is still a very--part of your life?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Are you taking music lessons at all at, at your school?
Speaker 2: Not at my school, private music lessons.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your music teacher?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Bessie Maddox [ph.], Bessie Maddox was an excellent music teacher for African American kids all over Atlanta [Georgia], we all went to her she really taught us well.  And then at age eleven, she taught me the pipe organ, because she lived across from my church.  At that time Allen Temple [Allen Temple A.M.E. Church, Atlanta, Georgia] was right there, I told you in Summerhill [Atlanta, Georgia], on Fraser Street, she lived across on Clark [ph.], so she would come over and train me on the organ.  It paid off because at twelve our pastor formed what was called the male chorus and a gentleman came to play for them but he got sick and they had me to play for 'em.  So they asked my dad [Robert Shy, Sr.] if I could play.  Now I could play the organ by this time, I could really play the gospel music, but I was young and they promised my father that if he allowed me to play the organ and train them, they would pick me up and get me back home and they did.  So I played for their chorus, the male--Allen Temple Male Chorus for at least twenty years (laughter).
Speaker 1: What other activities are going on in, in school or in your neighbor?
Speaker 2: Other than the Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America], the church choirs, those were basically what we all did, you know, you didn't have the other clubs that you have now, you didn't have any boys club [Boys Clubs of America; Boys and Girls Clubs of America], you had the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association], over on Butler, in, in Butler Street, which is now still there but we couldn't get over there, you know?  We were too far away for our parents to let us go and when we finally grew up to the point where it was around tenth or eleventh grade and schools were having their little proms, we couldn't go downtown, so they chose to have their little proms at the YMCA [Butler Street YMCA, Atlanta, Georgia], and that's when we all got a chance to move across the city.
Story_ID: 618657
Speaker 1: When you go to Howard [David T. Howard Elementary School; David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia], we're somewhere around 1942, I would say.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: The climate of the country I'm, we're talking about wartime?  Was there anything that you can remember that your parents might have talked about or anything that was going on in your community?
Speaker 2: Well, we had men going to war [World War II, WWII], my [maternal] uncle [J.C. Spearman] went.  The one uncle that I'd told you that helped me to get to New York [New York], to get the things that I needed was one of the early people who went, men who went to, African American men who went to the [U.S.] Army, my dad [Robert Shy, Sr.] went to the Army.  So we were aware that they were, you know?  By the time my dad went, my little brother [Robert Shy, Jr.] was eighteen, of course he was drafted because there was a draft then, so we ended up at home with my mother [Flora Spearman Shy], my sister [Doris Shy Frazier (ph.)] and me.  Dad and brother are gone to war because the draft took them both, she was not--we really didn't think, the family did and I was too young to even care, but they thought my father would not go because the limit for taking men at that point was thirty-eight I think. It was thirty something, and, for drafting.  And they drafted him anyway, and they drafted him so fast and sent him to Japan 'til we were--everybody in the Bell Street projects [Grady Homes, Atlanta, Georgia] and in Allen Temple Church [Allen Temple A.M.E. Church, Atlanta, Georgia] was shocked.  But he did get back safely. He was there and my brother was across there somewhere, he finally got home and--
Speaker 1: Where there any--
Speaker 2: --got ready for college--
Speaker 1: --stories that they shared about that?  About their time in the Army and how they were treated?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  They were very quiet, both of them, about it, you know?  My brother was like me very militant, so my mother was worried that he didn't get his feathers ruffled too much to get back and he didn't he kept a low profile.
Speaker 1: Since your mother was in, a stay at home mom, how--was your father still from his Army salary able to take care of the family?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, very much so.
Story_ID: 618658
Speaker 1: So now you go to the ninth grade and you go to Washington School (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington High School, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: And tell me about that experience.
Speaker 2: Excellent experience it was a big school, many of the young men who had gone to the [U.S.] Army were returning to finish their school careers and education while I was there so I met a lot of the experienced guys, you know?  And I think Washington High really survived because of that, because those gentlemen brought a lot of experiences into that school that helped the school to mature continue to ma- 'cause it was the only high school.  It was only when my sister [Doris Shy Frazier (ph.)] became a senior they made David T. Howard a senior high school [David T. Howard Elementary School; David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia], so they took a large number of those children, all of those who lived over on our side of town, back to Howard until it closed.  Now my husband [Alfred Scott, Sr.] started teaching at Howard, so it lasted quite a long time.  He started teaching there in '50 [1950], and I don't think it closed until '60 [1960], something.
Speaker 1: So what you're saying is that there were young men, once they turned eighteen, they were drafted--
Speaker 2: Oh they were drafted.
Speaker 1: --while in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I don't care where they were, they had to register and were drafted wherever they were they had to go.  That's why you hear so much dissension when someone in [U.S.] Congress now says we need the draft because it's volunteer army, it's wearing out and you hear people say, "No, no more draft," because it was really a challenge, really a challenge.
Speaker 1: Now as you you're going through high school and you know it's a given that you're going to college?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Because my bro- father [Robert Shy, Sr.] had said I was going to Paine [Paine College, Augusta, Georgia]. That's where our family went.
Speaker 1: And you, you knew that you were musically inclined?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What were your thoughts?  What did you think about or dream about, what were your aspirations about going away to school?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't have time to give much thought to that because by the time I was eleventh grade my father sat me down and discussed Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] with me because he had met so many women from Spelman that he just thought it was an excellent school.  Now he still left the choice to me, but I got a scholarship to Spelman and of course that helped me to decide this is where I'll go--
Speaker 1: Did--
Speaker 2: --and I went.
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers that might have given you some other options?
Speaker 2: Not particularly.
Story_ID: 618659
Speaker 1: Let me step back just a little bit and, and ask you about the neighborhood or the time in your life.  If you could remember a sound, a smell or a sight that takes you back to that time, what would you say?
Speaker 2: A sound, smell or what?
Speaker 1: A sight.
Speaker 2: I think the one thing that I would pull out of that is the sight of the policemen coming through our neighborhood.  Every now and then I li- I think about a lady who owned property across from the 424 [424 Connally Street, Atlanta, Georgia]--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Hold on.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Say something.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, begin.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: --Very vividly and it comes through to me every now and then so I think this is the one sight I can quote here in answer to your question.  I was a youngster at 424, just before we moved to the project [Grady Homes, Atlanta, Georgia] and before the people had bought all of the property across from us to build the Capitol Homes [Atlanta, Georgia], there was an African American lady who owned a home across the street from us and had re- renters, room, boarders and whatever had happened, I was standing in our front door looking through the screen at the cops that she called and the man was talking trying t- to--whatever he was saying must not have been the truth and she got ready to defend herself and this white cop said, "I told you to shut your mouth," and he slapped her.  Now that was the one thing that has carried me through my whole life, because when we started the Civil Rights Movement, I remember thinking to myself, wait a minute, that didn't have to happen.  And I wish I had known her better, by the time we are in the Civil Rights Movement, because that's the one thing that stuck with me.  I didn't get angry with policemen because I knew they were protecting us as we grew up, but I just felt that that was the one thing that shouldn't have happened.  And as I have spoken throughout the coun- world, I have done speeches everywhere that's the one thing I mention so often, that we need protection but it has to be protection with guided responses to the persons that they are respecting.  Now when we got to college, we got the first African American policeman here in Atlanta [Georgia], but they could not arrest anybody, so they came out of the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] with nice little uniforms on, but they couldn't arrest anybody and it took some finagling to get that out of place, you know.
Speaker 1: What a, what about a sound?
Speaker 2: No, I don't have any specif- 'cause I was an in house person. I, I would get up at four in the morning and practice the piano.  When it was time to eat breakfast I would eat in a hurry and rush up to the trolley stop to get to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: What about smells? No, nothing (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very beautiful, very beautiful clean people, there's not any smell I can think of.
Story_ID: 618660
Speaker 1: I just wanna also step back when you were telling the story about the woman who lived across the street in Summerhill [Atlanta, Georgia], where they were gonna build the Capitol Homes [Atlanta, Georgia], you alluded to the fact that Capitol Homes was built for white projects?
Speaker 2: Yes. 	Oh yes, oh yes.
Speaker 1: So it was a division?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --tell me what you know about it?
Speaker 2: Well they were built at the same time just prior to the Grady Homes [Atlanta, Georgia], see they sta- they built them first though, and they were, they encompassed the space from the Capitol, that's why they were called Capitol Homes, all the way down to where we lived on Connally.  So that lady's home was gone before we were able to move over to Grady Homes, but our Grady Homes, but our Grady Homes were finished, I think right after that, if I can recall the time right now, so, we moved in a hurry also.  And the Capitol Homes didn't come across the street where our house was, it would, our house was torn down for a school that they would--the Capitol something school, and I think it's still sitting there.  And at that time it was a white school.
Story_ID: 618661
Speaker 1: And one more thing, you said that you knew who David T. Howard was?
Speaker 2: Well I, I've been told stories about him yes, that he was a man who was interested in education, gave a lot to the black community at that time and so they named the school for him.  I never read his history because by the time I was interested enough in our black history I was in college, you know.
Speaker 1: So you were given a scholarship to go to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so that's why you made that decision to--
Speaker 2: No I made decision, my father [Robert Shy, Sr.] was gonna send me anyway and I applied to Spelman, had beautiful teachers who decided okay, so you're going to Spelman?  We're gonna get you some kind of scholarships, they got me a part scholarship and that's what, but my father paid for the rest.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers at Washington [Booker T. Washington High School, Atlanta, Georgia] that might have influenced you?
Speaker 2: Dr. X.L. Neal, who is now deceased but was so good at seeing that I got what I needed and he was the one, he taught over at Spelman at that time see?  So, with my being in his homeroom, and he, his working with me, he was determined I was gonna get a scholarship of some kind.  Now I didn't get the real huge scholarships, and maybe I should not say this, but I'll say it anyway, I wasn't the right complexion to get the big scholarship but he fought, he was determined that I was going to get a scholarship and I did, I got a semester scholarship and dad took it over from there.
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about your senior prom?  You said that the prom was at the Y?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at the Y.
Speaker 1: So tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Well, at that time I was really not doing much courting you see, because of these strict parents I had and the little fellow who was to take me to the prom had a little attitude so my daddy said, "I will take her," (laughter).  So, my dad took me to the prom at the YMCA [Butler Street YMCA, Atlanta, Georgia] and I had a good time.
Story_ID: 618662
Speaker 1: The summer before you go away to, well you actually don't go away to, to college, because Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] is here.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But did you ever have a, a job?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I played the piano and the organ at church and I got paid fifteen dollars a month (laughter).  And that was my little job and my dad [Robert Shy, Sr.] was the kind of person who really wanted to be sure that we were independent so he had a little place that he had a credit line for getting clothes, it was called Mutual Clothing Company, on what was then Whitehall Street, now its Peachtree [Street] now, downtown.  And he had them to give me an account which meant that I could purchase some little clothes and pay my little bill and that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Had--and that's interesting that you would have credit to buy, buy clothing because everything was segregated.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Talk about shopping other places like at Rich's [Rich's Department Store, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Well we could shop, oh they would, they took our money, you know, it's just that we couldn't go up and eat in the restaurant part.  African Americans ate downstairs at a little bar that was right at the bathroom 'cause that's where we had to go for the bathroom.  Now of course when you read Martin's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] history, you realize that one of the places he was stuck in the shoulder was trying to get into the restaurant in, in Rich's downtown.  Some of us were standing over on the side and watched the white lady stick the hairpin, hat pin in his shoulder, so that's how we finally got upstairs to what we realized later was nothing much better, much better than what we had downstairs, it was just that we couldn't go in there to eat.
Speaker 1: Did you ever experience just overt racism towards you?
Speaker 2: Oh Lord, yes.
Speaker 1: I'm talking about at this time bef- right before you go to college, you're in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Well I felt it very early in life, one of the stories that I'm telling often as I speak and one day when I finish trying to write this book, I'm gonna write.  When I was ten, right at the corner of what is now Peachtree, was a dime store, it was Woolworths [F.W. Woolworth Company] and my mother [Flora Spearman Shy] went in to buy hair clips for me, I was always the kind of kid that was out spoken.  So the little lady behind the counter owed her ninety cents change, she gave her eighty cents, but I watched her as she, you know, kind of--and I said, "She owes you another dime."  Scared my mother to death, she said, "That's all right.  Let's go."  "She owes you another dime."  (Laughter) So my mother grabbed me and pulled me own out of the dime store, but I kept saying as I grew up and started speaking that wherever that lady is, "She still owes my mother a dime," (laughter).  But it affected me to, to the point that I was very much aware by the time I started reading the newspaper, and seeing what we were getting as African Americans, how unfair it was, I could tune right into it.  I asked a question around that same time, I must have been about eleven or twelve.  We were in that same store, and we went down in the basement to come out to the street and I saw the water fountains, colored, white.  Asked this same mother of mine, "Colored water coming out of there?"  "Come on out of this store," (laughter) she said, had to pull me out because I had to turn the water on to be sure it was color--what color it was, you know?  So yes, I felt it very, very early, very early, very, very early.
Story_ID: 618663
Speaker 1: Tell me what year did you graduate from high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Thirty--forty--I was ten--I was seventeen when I finished--
Speaker 1: So 1947?
Speaker 2: Forty-six [1946], 'cause I was gonna be seventeen in July I think it was.
Speaker 1: Excuse me.  Now you talk about your music and playing of the piano and organ, but you also sang and you also danced?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me when did that develop for you?  Was it, was your dancing a part along, or was that something that you developed later on?
Speaker 2: Well it was something that I loved to do and my father [Robert Shy, Sr.] listened when I said I really wanted to take ballet.  He had the, that same aunt that had them move to Atlanta [Georgia] worked at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] at the time but she was one of the housekeepers there, she said to one of the professors that she had a little niece who really was good in dancing and she wanted to take dance lessons.  And of course they loved her, so he said, "I'll see if my wife will work with--," 'cause his wife taught ballet out in Brooklyn [New York].  Well she was thrilled, she talked my daddy into letting me sign up.  This is a story I tell quite often, we went to the house on Saturday morning to get the lesson but we had to go around to the back and up backstairs, he did not let me go.  He took me back to Bell Street in the projects [Grady Homes, Atlanta, Georgia] but he made such a noise out of it, that uncle of mine I was telling you was just getting out of the [U.S.] Army in New York [New York] and he started saying to him, "If you will let her come visit me and Mary [ph.]," that was his wife, "We'll see that she gets dance."  That's--
Speaker 1: What was your uncle's name?
Speaker 2: J.C. Spearman.
Speaker 1: Spearman.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  J.C. Spearman.  And that's how I got to the Brooklyn School of Dance [ph.] and I stayed there until I went to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], I think I was fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, and then I went to Spelman.
Speaker 1: So you went to Brooklyn School of Dance?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I--
Speaker 1: --was for--
Speaker 2: --thought I--
Speaker 1: --the summer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, every summer.  I got on the train and went to him.
Speaker 1: Was that the first time that you traveled on a train?  Did you travel alone?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I traveled alone.
Speaker 1: Was that the first time?  Going to New York?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And tell me about that experience.
Speaker 2: Well I was always a brave soul, you know, it didn't bother me at all.  I jumped on the train, he was there to greet me and I, I did that without any problem.  As a matter of fact I was so ingrained in New York, I really thought I as gonna teach there and when I finished Spelman, I taught there one summer and was offered a job to stay but I had been hired in Atlanta and I came back to Atlanta and taught.
Speaker 1: Well traveling during those years of segregation, on the trains, that's really what I, I was alluding to, as far as your, your travel from the South to the North.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Were there any experiences that you want to share (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, 'cause I think I've just been blessed, you know, people never bothered me.
Story_ID: 618664
Speaker 1: So you go to New York [New York], this is the first time that you're taking dance lessons, is that right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well tell me about the experience of being there and what you find about yourself and, and your talent as far as dance.
Speaker 2: Well I tell you what.  I was so happy to get dance 'cause I had been really depressed as a youngster that the experience I had, out in Brooklyn [New York] almost turned me around to the fact that maybe I don't need to take dance, you know?  And so, when my [maternal] uncle stepped up, who was really a parent like to me anyway, he always would see that I got what I needed with my father [Robert Shy, Sr.] and when he stepped up to the plate, I don't even think I evaluated where I found myself.  I was just so happy to get there.  The teachers accepted me because he was in New York and in their head, I was from New York, you see?  There was no separation for a little girl from Georgia. I was J.C. Spearman's little girl, and so they accepted me and I really enjoyed the lessons that I got, but I also learned a whole lot of things, a large number of things.  First of all, I discovered while taking dance there that African Americans even there were depressed about some of the things they were getting; that number two, I was on my way eventually to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] when many of them were griping about the fact that they didn't get scholarships to the big NYU [New York University, New York, New York], they were going to the fo- community schools, okay?  And so, I learned a whole lot.  He would take me to 5th Avenue after dance class to eat and would show me by actual experience that we would sit in a restaurant and nobody waited on us, and of course, I learned to take notes very early because of that.  So it did a lot for helping me to know what was going on here, but I was less depressed because I realized that it was going on all over with people who looked like me.  Consequently then, when I got to Auburn Avenue in the summer program at the churches at Wheat Street and I was gonna play, and Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and, and that bunch came around, I was ready (laughter).  I, I mean they had a fighter right on hand because I had seen that in New York and I realized that--
Story_ID: 618665
Speaker 1: And I had gone to Washington [D.C.] to see a cousin during that time, this [maternal] uncle of mine told me about a cousin who was working in the government there.  That was a big piece in my family, you know, that she had this government job.  So, he carried me from my dad [Robert Shy, Sr.] to the--to Washington because he was going to visit her.
Speaker 2: What was her name?
Speaker 1: I can't think of her name, 'cause (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was where she was--
Speaker 1: --back then, she was--
Speaker 2: --(unclear)--
Speaker 1: She was my, she was my mother's cousin and of course very close to my mother [Flora Spearman Shy] and Uncle J.C. [J.C. Spearman], you know.  And, I can't think of her name now, I'll think of it later when we have--
Speaker 2: What type of job did she have?
Speaker 1: She worked with the government in doing something, I don't know what it was, but she had a govern- an actual government job. But I got up there and realized that the folk in Washington didn't go to all the schools who looked like me.  So I learned a lot from those experiences and that was one of the things that quick, equipped me to move around the world as I moved, you know, and to, to look at Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and decide, yeah, I'm gonna work with him, you know.  And, [HistoryMaker] John Lewis was saying, I gave him an award when I was supreme basileus [of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] one summer and of course he came up to get it at my 1992 boule and he was saying to the people that, "Wherever we have had a fight, this lady was there," and I was.  But I didn't do a lot of talking, you know, I just served wherever I needed to serve, but I had seen a lot in New York [New York] in Washington while I was young enough to evaluate what I was seeing, that equipped me to work with the places I had to work and also to understand much, much later in life, and we'll talk about that later, don't it--when, when we come later, remind me to tell you about the experience I had when I was supreme basileus and I'll tell you--I can't think of it right now, but remind me to pull that out of my head, that let me know, even across the water, we're still prejudiced.
Story_ID: 618666
Speaker 1: So, let's go back to Brooklyn [New York] and back to the dance class [at the Brooklyn School of Dance (ph.)].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the teacher and the other student--
Speaker 2: Well I had several teachers you know, it was--when you went to class, you didn't know which teacher was gonna take that group that day so it was a matter of going in, getting my leotards on and getting my shoes out and moving to where I was instructed to go and I had the lesson of the day, you know.  But they were very beautiful folks, they knew how--now I, I got a chance to even meet Alvin Ailey because of that, because as I went up as an adult, one of the teachers who taught me then knew my [maternal] uncle [J.C. Spearman] and she said, "I want you to let her meet Alvin Ailey."  I had no idea at the time that that man would be as famous as he actually got to be but those were some of the residuals from taking that dance school, they were excellent teachers.
Speaker 1: Who was it at the, the school--what was the makeup of the other students in the class?
Speaker 2: We were mixed, and really now that we are talking, we didn't have many African Americans in there.  When I went to NYU [New York University, New York, New York] later to get my master's in music, we didn't have but one or two African Americans. We always came from Georgia and Virginia, and it became a joke, you know.  "Where are you from?"  "I'm from Virginia."  "Where are you from?"  "Georgia," (laughter) you know, but it, it was not completely filled African American classes as it is now, it was diverse.
Speaker 1: So, this was ballet that you were taking?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Well I took tap, didn't do well at it, didn't like it, you know (laughter), but he saw that I got most of it and I took--and as a--they didn't have a modern dance class there then, so it was strictly for me ballet, but they had a tap class and they had one other something that I never even looked at, you know, 'cause I was interested in getting the ballet and that's what I taught for thirty years in Atlanta public school system [Atlanta Public Schools].
Speaker 1: What about the, the community in which you lived for that summer?  Tell me about the New York [New York] scene in--well did you like in Brooklyn, or did you live in Manhattan [New York]?
Speaker 2: No.  My uncle lived first in Manhattan, and then he moved out to Long Island [New York] and that's where I would go each summer, of course when my brother [Robert Shy, Jr.] married, he moved to Long Island so, that's where I actually we--stayed.
Speaker 1: Did you meet any friends that you still are in contact with today?
Speaker 2: From the school?
Speaker 1: What about any of the teachers, besides that one that just, was it just that one teacher that introduced you too--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Alvin Ailey?
Speaker 2: But she knew my uncle, she was his friend.  And she really admired him and my aunt, you know, so she would always I understand ask, "How's that little girl of yours" (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Did you have an opportunity to do any other things in New York, museums or--?
Speaker 2: Oh Lord yes.  Metropolitan Museum [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York] became my second home and I stayed there much more than I did the other museums because there was so much to learn and at the time I was there as a youngster, I mean that was a whole new world with no such thing here, you know.  And the museum we had downtown, we couldn't go to, so I was really engrossed in the Metropolitan Museum.
Story_ID: 618667
Speaker 1: You come home after the summer to begin Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that experience, your first year--
Speaker 2: At Spelman (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) your freshman at Spelman.
Speaker 2: Just beautiful.  There again, I had a diverse staff.  See my president was President Read [Florence M. Read], so it just moved right on into that diverse world.  I only had two black teachers, all the rest of them, Miss (Unclear), the president--all of them were white at Spelman then.
Speaker 1: So is this the first time you're gonna be taught by white professors or teachers?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, 'cause we didn't have 'em in Atlanta Public Schools, when I went to Washington High [Booker T. Washington High School, Atlanta, Georgia], it was all black, elementary, all black, David T. Howard [David T. Howard Elementary School; David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia], all black.
Speaker 1: So tell me, what that experience was like for you to experience a, a white--
Speaker 2: Well it really wasn't an, an experience because, I mean it wasn't different because I'd been to New York [New York] so much, you know, which is like, I'm in college now and I already played the organ so the music teacher saw that I became assistant organist, you know, I joined the glee club right away and Mr. James [Willis Laurence James] who was the director of the glee club, he was African American, had me writing music for him, copying his music on the sheet so it was just another task, nothing different.
Speaker 1: Well that's something we didn't talk about is your vocal skills.  Tell me about that.  What, what do you sing, soprano?
Speaker 2: Yeah, soprano.  And over in the Grady Homes [Atlanta, Georgia], Bell Street homes, I was always singing because many places that we went as Girl Scouts, they didn't have pianos, you see?  A lot of African Americans didn't just have a piano sitting in the house like mama [Flora Spearman Shy] did, you know, and so we sang and of course about three of my little friends sang, so we gave three part harmony (laughter) and then when we were in very early high school, we had a USO [United Service Organizations] center right next to Washington High where you see the field now, the playing field, that was a USO center, it was gorgeous.  So those of us who were in the arts in Washington High they would take us over there to perform for the soldiers, did a lot of singing there, a lot of singing.
Speaker 1: So when you get to Spelman do you know what it is exactly that you're going to major in?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What is that?
Speaker 2: I decided before I got there, after all of the experiences that I had, that I needed a double major. I first of all needed music.  Secondly I needed English, because I had gone to New York long enough to know that you needed to know how to speak and when I was up there at, at that latter top part, the Puerto Ricans were coming in and of course we were challenged because, you know, they were doing a whole lot of things that we now talk about even now with the Hispanics.  And so, I realized that, "Are you gonna improve your English or are you gonna do Spanish?"  I took a course in Spanish but I said, no way, so I would, I took a double major, I did music and English at Spelman, minor with history and education.
Speaker 1: So tell me about your, your classes and your, your teaching style, excuse me, in, in--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Ma'am you're covering your microphone.
Speaker 1: Tell me more about your, your music classes at Spelman.
Speaker 2: Excellent.  I went to Mr. James who was director of the chorus and miss, and Kemper Harreld who was at that time in charge of all of the music at Spelman.  I took music classes from both of them and as I said, I helped to play the organ, they let me play the organ for our assemblies when they were not there, I directed the chorus once or twice for Mr. James and of course, as I said, I transposed all of his music from his sketchings onto the pro- program itself on, and it was just an excellent experience.  I sang in the glee club, you know.  We didn't have dance as such but we had gym and in many of the gym programs I had a chance to dance.
Story_ID: 618668
Speaker 1: Who were some of your friends that attended Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] while you were there?
Speaker 2: Evelyn Willis [Evelyn Willis Chisolm], she's now teaching at Spelman.  She's about the only one who's yet teaching there, but we were--she was a grade ahead of me.  She was one year ahead of me.  She's now Dr. Evelyn Chisholm, we were very, very close and she's still there, that's the one buddy that I had.  I had lots of friends, you know, little classmates, but she was the one that was, what I was co- she and Virginia Hawkins [Virginia Hawkins Stephens] were my class buddies.
Speaker 1: So tell me about social life at Spelman, or even at the Atlanta University Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Well, it was excellent, we paired ourselves with Morehouse men, you know, Spelman.  I didn't do anything right they said, I did not marry a Spelman, I, I mean a Morehouse guy, I married a Clark guy [Alfred Scott, Sr.].  So while they were over on Morehouse's campus [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], I was over on Clark's campus [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] (laughter).  And so, and I, I, I did get him, we've been married fifty-seven years this year (laughter), so I must have done something right, right?  But the social life was just excellent but it was so far different from what it is now, you know, you had to be in the dormitory at six o'clock, you only had one time a week that you could have your boyfriends come over and that was Sunday for one hour in the dormitory, you know?  And you went from the dormitory over to the library, AU library [Robert W. Woodruff Library, Atlanta, Georgia], to get your work.  So we could go to the library from seven to nine at night, we had to sign out of our dorm with our house mothers, you know, and of course, a lot of us signed out and went to the library and of course we had little friends who came through the library also (laughter), and we studied together.  But it was an excellent time, you know.  We think about it now because some of us are yet living and we laugh about the time when on that Sunday afternoon, that one hour you could have that company, you had to have it in the, the house mother's place and it was just three or four seats in there and so we would rush to be on the seat first, you know, just beautiful, fun stuff.
Story_ID: 618669
Speaker 1: So is this where you pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] did not have sororities then and it was when I graduated, my teachers who all were AKAs and of course they just waited for me to walk out of Spelman and one came to me and said, I want you to--this was like, I graduated in June, she came the next week and said I want you to come to my house.  I thought it was something that she wanted to say to me about the job that I had been offered, because she was already at that school, what she wanted to tell me was that I had been accepted as an Alpha Kappa Alpha woman.  So right away I went in, the graduate chapter.  Now I was instrumental later in getting the undergrads chapter there, but it took me until '78 [1978], I believe it was to get that chapter.
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from Spelman?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty, [1950], I graduated 1950.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, June of 1950.
Speaker 1: Now who--now you talk about some of the teachers there and one of them invited you to be a part of the AKA.  Who were some of the other professors?
Speaker 2: Now, now that one didn't go to Spelman, that was my--
Speaker 1: She?
Speaker 2: She had taught me in elementary school.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And she was a very firm AKA, entrenched in it and of course they had watched me grow up, you see, so I was one of those that they were determined to, to get into AKA.  Now my dad's best buddy was a Sigma Gamma Rho [Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc.] person and of course she anticipated that I would be Sigma Gamma Rho, but these ladies who had taught me knew that they needed to hurry and they did.  I didn't have a chance to even evaluated 'em 'cause my daddy [Robert Shy, Sr.] didn't care as long as I was happy, you know, but she did not teach me at Spelman.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 618670
Speaker 1: So, you're getting ready to graduate in 1950 from Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What do you begin to think about life?  What are you gonna do after you graduate?
Speaker 2: Teach, applied for the--well really didn't have to apply, at that time there's a Bazoline Usher [Bazoline E. Usher], for whom the Usher School [Usher Collier Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia] is named around here had been my principal at David T. Howard [David T. Howard Elementary School; David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia] and so she was the, she--at that time was a superintendent, a black superintendent of the Atlanta Public Schools.  So she saw that I'd took the test and got hired before I marched, so I was ready to be assigned to a school and she assigned to me, to a school right away, so, I was ready to go right into teaching in August.
Speaker 1: So you didn't have to have a teaching certificate?
Speaker 2: Yes, I took the test.
Speaker 1: Oh you had to take--
Speaker 2: You had to--
Speaker 1: --a test?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah you, as you do now, you know, you had to take the test and they gave you the certificate when you took it.  And of course, I took that at the end of my senior year, she had it all fixed, I have to give her credit, stuck with me all the way through until she passed rec- not long ago, you know?  That was one of mentors from the elem- from the school system.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Talking about the Atlanta public school system, was there white superintendents and black superintendents from Atlanta Public School?
Speaker 1: There were white superintendents.
Speaker 2: Only?
Speaker 1: Now, she was what they called, I can't think what they called 'em but it was, it was--
Speaker 2: What it a junior supervisor?
Speaker 1: No, that was what they had out in the county, but whatever her title was, it meant that she handled the hiring and that sort of thing in the black schools because at the time it was all black school, you know, you knew when you went to M. Agnes Jones [M. Agnes Jones Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia] it was an all-black school.  And so you had to fill it up with black teachers and that was her task.
Speaker 2: So teaching you knew it would be what you would--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --do in life?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So tell me about your first day as a teacher.
Speaker 1: As a teacher?  I'll tell you the truth, I was so busy getting ready, I can't even--I mean that day doesn't stand out in my mind as such, you know, I was just assigned to the school.
Speaker 2: And tell me again, what school?
Speaker 1: It's now called Bethune Elementary, but at that time, it was Davis Street School [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: And what grade did you teach?
Speaker 1: I taught music, seventh grade and music.
Speaker 2: And what neighborhood was that in?
Speaker 1: It's--
Speaker 2: The school.
Speaker 1: It's still right across from, what's that, what's our big thing downtown, where we assemble all of the games?
Speaker 2: The Dome [Georgia Dome, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 1: The Dome.  Its right across from there it's still sitting there on the corner, but now it's Mary McLeod Bethune Elementary School [Atlanta, Georgia], at that time it was Davis Street in a black community, right there at Simpson Street [sic. Simpson Road; Joseph E. Boone Boulevard].  They had blacks living in that area.  That's where the children came from.
Story_ID: 618671
Speaker 1: Now your family had moved from, from the projects--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --to a home.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And where wa- where did your--
Speaker 2: He moved Sandy Creek, that's over here, they had opened up Sandy Creek Drive, which is across Fairburn [Road].  They had that little community there and they built those homes and that's where my parents [Flora Spearman Shy and Robert Shy, Sr.] bought.
Speaker 1: Now living in this area, it, it didn't take you very long to get to, to school.  Tell me how you traveled, what mode?
Speaker 2: You see I had married when they moved over here, I married from the Grady Homes [Atlanta, Georgia], and right after I married, my brother [Robert Shy, Jr.] had gone, so it only left one child at home, my sister [Doris Shy Frazier].  She was grown and getting ready to get married so that's how they got themselves moved over here because they didn't have any more children to rear (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, tell me how you met your husband [Alfred Scott, Sr.]?  You, well you told me that you met him at Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: What?
Speaker 2: --I didn't really meet him at Clark.
Speaker 1: Okay, well tell me--
Speaker 2: He came to Allen Temple [Allen Temple A.M.E. Church, Atlanta, Georgia], he, he came to--I think I was a senior, I had just finished, yeah, I had just finished and was getting ready to go to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], he came to visit an aunt, who lived across from the pastor of my church, Allen Temple.  He and my pastor's son were buddies.  They came to visit the church and there I was teaching a choir and he said when he saw me, he tells this to everybody, he said, "There's my wife."  Well, I had another little friend, you know, and so he said, "Well, can I go to church with you tomorrow?"  After he, he, we were introduced, and I said, yes, went on to church and wasn't thinking about it and I looked over at him and I felt guilty, you know, because I had said, "Yes, you can go to church with me," and I knew his aunt was a member across the street, so I felt real guilty.  And we laugh about this now, and I said, "Well if you forgive me, call me," and I put my telephone number on there and that's when we've been together ever since (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, and, at that time was he already going to Clark--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --'cause you--
Speaker 2: He had just come from the [U.S.] Army. He had been drafted at eighteen and at that time they didn't have to stay in there, you know, but a year, eighteen months or something like that.  So he had come through here to visit his aunt and decided he was gonna come back here to college and he came back and went to Clark.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Then, and he stayed right here, the rest of the time (laughter).
Speaker 1: So what year did you marry?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-one, [1951]. We finished school June of 1950, we married February of '51 [1951], but we were engaged three and a half years.  See, in those days you didn't marry and go to Spelman, so we took the ring and my mother put it in her chest.
Speaker 1: I see.  I see.  I see.
Speaker 2: Um-hm (laughter).
Story_ID: 618672
Speaker 1: So tell me what happens next.  You're teaching at Davis Street School [Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And how long do you teach there?
Speaker 2: I taught there, was--I got married, you know, right away.  And I taught there un- about a year, and my daughter [Alfredene Scott Benton] came, 'cause she, she came before we were married a year, and then they assigned me, because this same principal, that was my dad's buddy had been moved out to Edgewood [Atlanta, Georgia], and that's when she asked for me.  So I went out there at the Wesley Avenue School [Atlanta, Georgia], and I taught there six years because I was not gonna have any more children, I told you (laughter), except my [maternal] grandmother [Mary Spearman] stopped that, so I stayed out there six years, almost seven, then I came back to Davis Street because the principal there wanted me back and I just started moving, you know.
Speaker 1: So now, at this time you're active with Alpha Kappa--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So tell me about your first experience after the teacher asked you to come to her home to talk to you about being a part of the sorority.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me what happened?  How do you feel about being a part of this sorority?
Speaker 2: You know, it really did not touch me as a youngster, I was real young, you know, and I was very happy that they wanted me, but I think at that time I was still embroiled in church [Allen Temple A.M.E. Church, Atlanta, Georgia] and I was traveling with the church choir, we traveled all over Georgia singing and I was playing and directing.  And of course, Alfred [Alfred Scott, Sr.] sang, my husband, a soloist so, that's where my attention really was but my teachers were very smart, they started sending me to conventions as a delegate, then my other side perked in.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the first convention that you attended?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  It was in Chicago [Illinois]. Cab Calloway was the guest, and boy was I excited (laughter).
