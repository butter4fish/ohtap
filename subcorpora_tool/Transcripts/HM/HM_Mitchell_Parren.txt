Speaker 1: Okay, let me ask you about your family history, just briefly because, as I said before, your nephew and your, well both of your nephews have gone over this, well all three of them have gone over your family history, but I'm going to ask you anyway.  Can you give us your mother's name and spell it for us?

Speaker 1: Okay, and where was she born, do you know?
Speaker 2: She was born in Baltimore.
Speaker 1: All right, and your father?
Speaker 2: Same, Baltimore, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 120097
Speaker 1: Now, can you tell us something about your mother [Elsie Mitchell]?  Did she tell you about how she grew up and, and can you tell us something about her personality?
Speaker 2: No, I really can't.  I knew, I knew my mother but I didn't, I was never that close, you know, while I was with her.  I, I, this woman that you said you were coming to talk to me, I thought maybe you wanted to talk about my early experience with civil and in Baltimore [Maryland] there wasn't any.  Baltimore was just a complete, segregated city and I never had any contact with white people when I was young because I, there was no place I could go where I would meet them.  The only way, all these growing up years that I had, I never had any white friends or white places that I'd call my own hangout.  It was interesting.  It was not until I enrolled in Morgan State College [now Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] that I got my first real tough duty and that was picketing Ford's Theatre [Washington, D.C.].  Ford's was the only legitimate theatre and they had, we could be, we could be served but only on the third balcony but it was ridiculous.  We had to go to the third balcony if we wanted to see a legitimate theatre.  And I remember the old mayor, governor came down, "Ah, this is ridiculous, hurting poor old folks and why don't you stop and (unclear)." And we said, "Hell, no" (laughter), and kept right on picketing and finally, finally we ended, they ended that practice but that was my first real encounter with confronting white people where they stood.
Speaker 1: Now, who--
Speaker 2: And why they stood.
Speaker 1: Okay, well who organized that?  Were you part of--
Speaker 2: No, that was the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] movement and I was one of the examples at Morgan and somebody came up and said, why don't you guys go over there and help us picket, and that was it.  It's just this simple.
Story_ID: 120098
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was your first experience.  Now you, well just go on and tell me more then about, about Morgan State [College, now Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Well, we were, I was quite active at Morgan because I, we had a student body that was not doing anything and got them all involved in things.  One time we said we were going to close the school down until the, the faculty showed more interest in the Civil Rights Movement.  They didn't, so we closed the school down.  We, we blocked all the entrances and the entrances to the classrooms.  We had all the chairs there and blocked the entrance.  It was, it was quite interesting to see us suddenly get involved.
Speaker 1: About what year is that would you say?
Speaker 2: Oh my God.  I guess it was probably around nineteen, early, early '40s [1940s], '44 [1944], '45 [1945].
Speaker 1: So, so you were doing a, you were involved in a student boycott in 1945?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  The president [Dwight O.W. Holmes] came out and saw all the buildings were closed and he said, I can't stop you, segregation is wrong and I'm not going to try to stop you.  So fine, we went right ahead.
Story_ID: 120099
Speaker 1: Okay, so, are there any other stories from Morgan State [College, now Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] that you, that you can tell us about?
Speaker 2: No, no, I finished Morgan and I guess my first job was with the State Human Relations Commission and I, when I was interviewed for the job, I told them I wouldn't take it because I thought that that was just another one of those namby-pamby things to keep black folks cool and I said I don't want a job like that and the people who sponsored me said, "Look, this was under the governor."  He said, "Look, you go ahead and be what you want if, if the governor doesn't like it, we'll back you up."  So I said, okay, I'll do it.  And I had, I had a good time with that job.  We, we spotted restaurants and learned sales.  It was just every place we went and the governor never really interfered.  But Baltimore [Maryland] was like a, a really racist city because there was no daily interplay between blacks and whites.  Oh, there were a few whites who showed some interest in working with us but not that many.
Story_ID: 120100
Speaker 1: I've heard that North Baltimore [Maryland] is all white and there are black people in West, South and East Baltimore.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's pretty--
Speaker 2: That's true. It is, it is strictly divided, white, black and I'm from West Baltimore.  South Baltimore was generally black but it was, it was just a racially divided city.
Story_ID: 120101
Speaker 1: Okay, now who were some of your teachers at Morgan State [College, now Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland]?  Did you have any mentors there?  Anybody support the students at Morgan State?
Speaker 2: Well, there was quite an interesting faculty.  Most of the members of the faculty were learning to listening development in the black community and were sympathetic towards it.  So, I know one teacher who was just marvelous.  Her name was Irene Diggs and--
Speaker 1: I've heard of her.  She, she wrote a book on black inventors.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Dr. Irene Diggs, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and she was, she was quite an excellent teacher who, who just inculcated in us with the whole desire to be black people, black representatives and I, I often think of her because she was just such a good teacher.
Speaker 1: Now I've heard, I've read her pamphlet, her pamphlet on black inventors, you know, she wrote, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Dr. Irene Diggs, right.  Anybody else?  Did--
Speaker 2: Oh, I had a whole host of good teachers.  All of our teachers were black, as I recall it, and all of them had caught the new spirit of Pan American--Pan African movement and it was, and it relates something new as planned.
Speaker 1: Now did you, do you remember a Benjamin Quarles?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Or--
Speaker 2: I didn't ever take any classes under him but I knew him well.  He was a, he was a legend in his own time.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's see.  Was Sandy John McIntyre there when you were there?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Sandy John McIntyre?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, I think he came after you.  You probably left, but, Benjamin Quarles.  What about Roland McConnell, did you have any classes?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was there.  Yeah, all of them, the faculty members were pretty good in terms of being aware of the viciousness of this racism in America.
Story_ID: 120102
Speaker 1: Now you had a background, basically, where, I know your, your grandmother was, no your, not your mother [Elsie Davis Mitchell] but your, Lillie [Carroll] Jackson--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was, was real involved in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was head of the NAACP and quite active along with her daughter, Juanita Mitchell.  I, I did not work with the NAACP too much.  I was caught up with the whole other, I thought more militant groups that were doing a good job in getting us started.
Speaker 1: What were some of those groups?  The name of some of those groups.
Speaker 2: Oh, we had a chapter of CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] and a chapter of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC].  I can't remember all the names but there were dozens of small groups that in each and every way pulled against racism.
Speaker 1: Okay, but I was talking about the early days at Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland] primarily.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have a chapter of CORE then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Back in '45 [1945]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, well they might have used another name but that was a small group and all of these were just small groups.  They weren't real big organized groups but they hung in there, they got started and it got good results.
Story_ID: 120103
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, you were, you sued the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland], right, when you went to graduate school, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So tell us about that.  That's 1950, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that was really a joke.  They always set up another school for me at the high school where I would be the only graduate student there and I told them, no, and it was, it was a little struggle but the most interesting thing was the judge who heard the case and he was known as a very conservative judge, Judge Shaun Tucker, and I told my counsel when, when I saw he was our judge, I said, "Now look, we aren't going to have a ghost of a chance with this man", and surprisingly enough, on the very same day he heard the case, he ruled in our favor.  He said, "You can't deny this man his right to go to any school that is state-owned." And he said, "I hereby order you to admit him immediately." And I was, and all of us were amazed because we certainly did not expect that from Judge Shaun Tucker, but that's the way it ended up.
Speaker 1: Was there any explanation as to why he made the decision he made that you know of?
Speaker 2: I, I don't know why he made that decision, it was certainly out of character for him but he, he made it and I was satisfied.
Story_ID: 120104
Speaker 1: Okay, so what happened next?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to, I went to College Park campus [at the University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland].  Oh, I remember one day.  I didn't have a car so I used to take the bus to College Park and then walk up from College Park up to the campus and one day I went into the campus area and it was a huge building with all the food in the back of the building, and you had to walk the whole length of the building to get to it.  I started walking back there and every, every table I passed just went quiet, just absolute silence but I just kept on, I got something to eat and came back.  But College Park was a funny experience.  Nobody really bent over backwards to make me feel welcome.
Speaker 1: So there was not one person that really reached out to you at all there?
Speaker 2: No, one of the, one of the faculty members did.  He was a real great guy who taught anthropology.  He, they invited me to their home for dinner and I never will forget it because we were at the table and their little son, oh, I guess was about eight years old, came to the top of the stairway and exposed himself (laughter) and we got to laughing.  He was a child who didn't mean anything but that was one of the funniest part of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you remember the professor's name?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Hutchinson, Dr. Hutchinson.
Story_ID: 120105
Speaker 1: Okay, did, are there any teachers there at University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] that you remember that, that were of any use to you when you, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Peter, Peter Legance [ph.], who was the, I think he was German, he was a good teacher and was fair.  That's been so long ago, it's hard for me to remember.
Story_ID: 120106
Speaker 1: Okay, so, but you got your master's degree [at University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland] in social work?  Was it social work or--
Speaker 2: In sociology.
Speaker 1: Sociology, all right.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was, 1952?  Or--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So what did you do after that?
Speaker 2: I guess then I started on my first of jobs, all of which were interesting throughout.  I had developed a kind of reputation, I guess, in the, in the black community and whenever anybody wanted me to, wanted someone name to oppose (unclear) my name was always mentioned.  So the first one I took was with the governor's office, the State Human Relations Commission and I told, I told all my friends we were gonna turn that into a nasty, mean, outfit, which I tried to do, and I took the job and we had quite a day. Just every place that there was segregation we challenged it.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you remember some of the cases that you challenged?  Or some of the situations?
Speaker 2: No, no, whenever, whenever anybody came in the office and said, look, there's this place that's segregated, that's how we, that's how we got the name.
Story_ID: 120107
Speaker 1: Okay, did you, I suppose you worked with some of the community leaders around town, right, like--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I was, this city [Baltimore, Maryland] has been totally responsive to me.  There wasn't a time when I asked them to go out and picket or to refuse to go to some places, that they refused me.  It was an overwhelming experience.  Sometimes I just got started on something without consulting anybody, but when I consulted with community leaders they said, you want it, you got it.  And that's the way it was.
Speaker 1: Now who were some of the, I've heard of the United Front, I believe it was.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: With Rev. Vernon Dobson and others--
Speaker 2: Yeah, [HM] Rev. Vernon Dobson was a, a bulwark.  He and a number of ministers were really allied forces when needed.  Whenever I said I was, go after a state organization for practicing segregation, all I had to do was call them and they, they showed up tremendously well, the hardcore did, and Rev. Dobson was the leader of that group.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other members of the group that you remember?
Speaker 2: Yeah, let's see, there was Rev. Frank Williams and, oh my gosh, (pause) I can't think of another name but there were about twenty-some ministers who were just absolutely faithful.  Whenever we needed people, would show, they did it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now I know there are a couple of ladies too that I've read about that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it was primarily the ministers who just backed me to the hill.
Story_ID: 120108
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so you were in charge, in charge of the Department of Human Relations for how many years?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, how long did you do that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess a couple of years and then, then I followed that up with by being a probation officer and that was just what I wanted, a whole bunch of young guys, ready to be schooled.  And I enjoyed that work and then I went on to another job, all of them were kind of safe jobs but I used every one of them to turn the direction of the organization.  Most of those organizations were put there to keep black people quiet but I asked every one of them before I took the job, will I have the right to be what I want to be, and that's the way it worked.
Story_ID: 120109
Speaker 1: Okay, do you think the state really wanted to integrate?
Speaker 2: No, Maryland had no desire to integrate and they didn't want any kind of trouble so then they give some little token thing, like a state agency that never hired a black person would hire one.  That was their kind of tokenism.  That was just disgusting but fortunately most of the agencies gave in and we managed to get a lot done.
Story_ID: 120110
Speaker 1: Now did you work in cooperation with your brother, Clarence?
Speaker 2: No, now my brother Clarence [Clarence Mitchell, Jr.] was in St. Paul [Minnesota].  He was with the Urban League.  Now his son and his nephews were here and I worked with them.  They were all active with one way or another.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But theirs was a formal relationship.  We never signed the documents saying we would, parent will be available at 6:15, no, we just called and said look, can we do this and if we agreed, we did it, and this was well worthwhile.
Story_ID: 120111
Speaker 1: Okay, during this period of time, between the time that you finished school-- that you worked these state jobs and between that time and the time that you ran for [U.S.] Congress, what was the most important thing that you did?
Speaker 2: I guess it was the matter of organizing the black community and we barely had the community well organized but I'll tell you by way of illustration, if I met with some, some white folks and told them you aren't doing right and we're going to picket, nobody doubted that we will 'cause whenever we said that, they had at least fifty pickets there and the longer we stayed, the more pickets we got.  And the organizations finally agreed that, I guess, that they wouldn't fight us because whenever I'd go to them and just say look, here's what I want, they gave in.
Story_ID: 120112
Speaker 1: Okay, now your nephew, Clarence [HM Clarence Mitchell, III], got involved with SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] back in 1961.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He was one of the founders, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And when he came back to Baltimore [Maryland], he was determined to get elected, you know, to the state legislature, and he was the first one of you all to be elected, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Of the Mitchells?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And did you help him with his, I mean, how did you help him with his campaign?  Do you remember that campaign?
Speaker 2: Oh, the whole family did.  We were like a little army (laughter).  He was elected to the City Council and it worked very well.
Speaker 1: So you had a standing army of community people, basically, that--
Speaker 2: That's--
Speaker 1: --that you had--
Speaker 2: --that's right.  Now it was almost like a political organization.  Well Clarence, my nephew, headed his political organization.  I never had one and it's amusing.  I said I would never run for office because I felt politics was seen too dirty and people would say, oh, he run for this.  I said, no, I'm not going to run for it and I just never tried to run for office until, until the Congressional thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was an interesting experience.  I was working for another organization where I had to meet with people and once I got a call, the organization said they wanted to meet with me.
Story_ID: 120113
Speaker 1: Sir, before we talk about the congressional election, tell us about your World War II [WWII] experiences with General [George S.] Patton and the Purple Heart.
Speaker 2: I felt sure I was going to be court martialed because I broke every rule in the book.  I just, I, my introduction to the military was bad.  We were on the train and there's some German white prisoners and they took those prisoners all and put them on the dining car to eat and for us they had sandwiches in the bag and I told the guys I said, look, take those sandwiches and throw them off and we did.  And the guy who was in charge of the, of the train said we're going to court martial you.  I said, I'm not going to eat these darn sandwiches either.  Nothing happened, nothing happened.  So we made out all right and I just kept on, I had a little devil in me.  Once I get a victory, I just take, I ran with it.  And I just, from that point on, I just made sure that any vestige of segregation was wrong.
Speaker 1: Well what else did you challenge in the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: Well, I was an officer and I remember two other guys and I walked over to the officer's mess to eat and they told me we couldn't eat in there and man, you talkin 'bout raising some hell.  We sat right there and got what we wanted and the Major came and said, okay you can eat in there, go ahead.  And I said, I know, I know I can eat in there 'cause I'm doing it.  When they had segregated, segregated movie pictures, just no, no we wouldn't do that.  The whole face of segregation in the military we challenged.
Story_ID: 120114
Speaker 1: What unit were you in, in the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: Oh, Lord.  I know it was Company E, 370th Battalion, 92nd Infantry.  We were in the Buffalo Division.
Speaker 1: Buffalo soldiers?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Buffalo soldiers, you said?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how did you get a Purple Heart?  How did that happen?  And where were you stationed?
Speaker 2: Italy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, we were doing the follow up, moving up to close to Italy and I was just walked up to the wrong place and the fighting started and I got, I was no, first of all, artillery or shells came in and chopped my back and my hip and I was, I had a little gun that I used, that I liked to use, and I was waving that thing around and finally we got, we won that fight and the next thing I know I was in the hospital, laying up there.  There was a guy there who was from Baltimore [Maryland] who was with the medics and he was, he was so glad to see me and I told him, (unclear), his name was Briscoll [ph.], I said, no, Bris, I'm not going to die yet, just patch me up, fix me up, which they did and I was back up on the front line, two months later.
Speaker 1: Now did you ever meet [General George S.] Patton?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: No, I was, at that time, I was just a Second Lieutenant and we didn't mingle with the top brass.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was your job, primarily?
Speaker 2: I was a, an infantry officer with the, and the regular company commander and that was quite an experience to command that company and some of those guys were just wild and I'm sorry, I guess, I was too wild also.  I remember one night we finally got a chance to have showers and somehow or another they got these, these white guys--these four white guys take a shower and my guys came and told me that's what they had done.  And the next thing I know, there was the Major.  He said, you guys will repair that shower 'cause you all broke it down and tore it up. I said look, I said, oh Lord.  So we went down there and I told the guys, I said, we can't take a shower 'cause he's broken the place up, fix it up, fix it up so we can get a shower and they did.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Any other stories about the War you want to tell us?  World War II?
Speaker 2: Any other stories?  I don't know.  I'll probably think of something.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 120115
Speaker 1: Well you, let's talk about the congressional race.  This is 1969, I guess, when you started this.  And how did you get, you said that people had asked you to run for office before but how did this one take place?  How did--
Speaker 2: I'll tell you exactly how it took place.  There was this group, they sent for me to come see to them and I went and asked, "What's your problem?"  They said, "You are.  We want you in Congress."  I said, there's no way in the world I was going to enter politics.  So they said, it won't cost you anything, we'll give--we'll print everything.  I said, no, I'm not going to do it.  And six weeks later they were, they brought a larger group.  This was about 100 people asking me and I told them the same thing.  And they said, "You're going to run."  They said, "We don't care what you say, you're gonna run."  So I said, okay.
Speaker 1: Who were they?  Who were these people, I mean, do you remember the names of some of these people that were asking you?
Speaker 2: No, these were all of our community groups.
Speaker 1: Was [HM] Rev. [Vernon Nathaniel] Dobson in the group or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Rev. Dobson was there and a whole bunch of people, across, across the board.  But I ran and I knew I was late.  I ran a campaign for about 13 weeks and lost.  I said, I just didn't have enough time and I was up against this Congressman who'd been there eighteen years.  I said, well if we've come that close, we've got enough time to try it again.  I did and I won.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you won the seat in 1970, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had a slogan.  I never carried a regular rifle, I carried my own pistol and I remember I had a little poem, it went, here comes Mitchell with his, here comes Mitchell with his P38, and I won and it was amazing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We spent, I think it was something like $1300 to run a congressional campaign.  We, we made our own bumper stickers, we made our own window signs, we just silk screened them and put them in the windows and that's how our, I managed to spend so little money.
Speaker 1: Did, now I heard that you won by sixty-seven votes, once?
Speaker 2: It wasn't that much.  It was smaller than that but I was amazed that we did it.
Speaker 1: And your opponent asked for a recount?  Was that what happened?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  These were little old guys who had been there for years and sure he can have a recount.
Speaker 1: Now what was your platform?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What was your platform?  What did you promise people to do?
Speaker 2: Trust me, just trust me.  You know, I don't think black folks can run a typical campaign--"I'm going to save social security," I don't think you can do that.  It's just that I'm out here, I'm running.  I think that they've been dirty towards us and I don't, I'm gonna kick tail when I get in there.  I never had any platform.  Of course, it developed as I was trying to--but mine was, trust me.
Story_ID: 120116
Speaker 1: What were, well, could you tell us, can you remember what the big issues were in the black community then?  As if they're not--they're probably the same as they are now, but what are--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were.  It was that unspoken slogan to keep blacks in their place, that's what it was, therefore, I automatically, I had to go after, after segregation 'cause that was the, that was the root problem that we had to confront.
Speaker 1: Okay, was it the segregation in public accommodations or education or what was it in?
Speaker 2: Education and everything.  Baltimore [Maryland] was a segregated city and therefore our, our only choice was to go after segregated relations.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is 1970 and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --had things changed much since you first started a--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I remember I was asked to speak to the Baltimore Bar Association the first time, and I went down there and boy you saw a cold audience.  One woman just was sitting there beating her hands and not putting them together, was just making the symbol and I said, I'll never forget the lady's eyes but I'm not going to change, and I won.
Story_ID: 120117
Speaker 1: Now in 1970, there were a number of other black people elected to [U.S.] Congress--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --around the same time and I know the number one man in, black man in Congress in 1970, was Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. in New York.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was not from Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 1: Right, he's from New York City [New York], right.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Now, and your family was fairly familiar with Adam Clayton Powell, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, and did you have a, did he give you, did he advise you when you, when you started?
Speaker 2: No, he sent his office to support me and he was one of the three lawyers who worked with me but actually I didn't--I'd been confronting what's wrong for so long I really didn't need any advice so they just told me you consult with me.  I said, no, I don't need to consult with you and that's, that's what I did.

Speaker 1: Okay, now you were in on the ground floor of the Congressional Black Caucus, being formed, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us how that was formed and what role you played?
Speaker 2: That was mostly, it was a small group, only a handful of members.  I think, six or eight and I immediately wanted it really bad and Congressman [Charles] Diggs was heading it.  So I got into it and got busy with everything that they did and now the caucus is a respected body.  I remember when we first got started, some of the white men would say, "You can't have a black thing in here."  "Sure we can.  We're black."  So we headed our Congressional Black Caucus and it was no different from any other groups, the only difference was the other group did not announce what they were. But there was a Jewish congress, and was an Italian congress.  So the only thing was we were open with ours.
Speaker 1: Okay, now I heard, I've heard from an interview with Congressman [John] Conyers that Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. did not initially want a Congressional Black Caucus.  He thought it was unnecessary.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well there was some opposition to it.  There were so few numbers, they said how were we gonna fight this mass. We just said we'll fight 'em. And we did all right.  We won most of the fights that we got into.
Speaker 1: So, it was you, Congressman Diggs, Congressman Conyers, I think it was Gus Hawkins, right?
Speaker 2: Gus, yeah.
Speaker 1: William Clay?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Shirley Chisholm, I believe, you know.  Is that it?
Speaker 2: That's about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: So what are the, what issue did you all take on in the beginning?  Did you--
Speaker 2: What issue, what issue do (unclear)  guess?
Speaker 1: Segregation.
Speaker 2: Yes, right.  That was the only thing that was out there that it covered everything so we had no choice.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're basically fighting for equal rights for black people?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Equal rights for black people?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Was there a specific aspect of that that you tackled first?
Speaker 2: No, but we always started out to go across the board.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If we, if we singled out anything, we knew it was there.  So we didn't have to (unclear) singling out.  The aces were laid out for us.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have any stories from that period of time you want to share with us that you can--anything that, that happened that we wouldn't know anything about, you know, being at home reading the papers?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's so long ago, I can't remember.  It's too long ago and every day there was a new thing and it's hard for me to single out any one thing.

Speaker 1: What would you like to tell us about being in [U.S.] Congress?
Speaker 2: It was an awesome job and I liked it up until just before I left and that's when I realized that there really wasn't any difference between the Democrats and the Republicans.  They were cut from the same cloth and that was a, that was a bit of an experience because the whole country, country moved towards the right and it was just difficult.  I could see it in Congress and I did have many, many successes when I was in Congress but I saw the handwriting on the wall what the whole country is.  I had, I had to set aside money that was appropriated by the Congress, and I had to set aside for minority business, $7 [sic, 4] billion, $7 billion, and people didn't believe me until the president, who was going to run that year, said he liked the program 'cause he wanted the black votes and he came up and supported the Mitchell amendment.  So we had $7 billion at will.
Speaker 1: You were responsible for something called the Surface Transportation Bill, is that the one you're talking about?
Speaker 2: No, there was the Surface Transportation Bill and I amended it to have a part of the appropriation and pull transportation set aside for minority business and it worked.  We got them (unclear) and that's still the law.

Speaker 1: Okay, sir, what would you see as your legacy at this point?
Speaker 2: Oh, man, I don't know.  I, I guess it's a matter of my getting a set aside on certain bills that was really a legacy that had never been tried before.  But then I look at all that's still wrong, my God, I haven't even scratched the surface.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well I'm, I'm not as hopeful as I was because I think there's been steady progress made but I see signs of antagonisms.  "Why, why are we doing this for them?" And I see the, I think generally America has moved rightly but I see there's trouble still on the surface.
Speaker 1: By troublemakers you mean those who are fighting for freedom rather than causing trouble?
Speaker 2: No, no I meant, I meant the troublemakers on the other side.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  Who were some of the major troublemakers on the other side that you see today?
Speaker 2: Well, the guys in the caucus that are representative of the Southern states.
