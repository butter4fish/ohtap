Story_ID: 544495
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five, lightweight, People magazine-ish type questions that management compels me to ask of everyone.  And they only require a short answer.  The first question is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is it?
Speaker 2: Mixed greens (laughter), with ham hocks (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: The rainbow.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: No.  You know, every season, you know, being in--living in Chicago [Illinois], and you have the luxury of experiencing all four seasons year around, it's pretty cool.
Speaker 1: Even during the same season, sometimes.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, you got that right, it's Chicago.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I travel so much.  No, no, I wouldn't say I do because every place I go, it becomes a favorite.  And, you know, it's so difficult, I guess when you have my personality, to have just one thing, it's--that's why I have so many clothes.  I've got choices of how I feel.  I dress the way I feel.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay, now, the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, what is it?
Speaker 2: My wife goes to the health club; I go to the nightclub (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I'm gonna ask about your--
Speaker 2: Let me--don't put that on.  My wife'll [Regina Daniels] kill me.  I wanna change that because you're gonna edit anyway, right?
Speaker 1: Well, give us the alternative one.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the alternative one would be: if I only knew then what I know now.
Story_ID: 544496
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [George Daniels, Sr.] side--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but we'll start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Elvina, E-L-V-I-N-A, Guillory, G-U-I-L-L-O-R-Y [Elvina Guillory Daniels].
Speaker 1: All right, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: January 10th, 1915.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was she born?
Speaker 2: In Opelousas, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that or is it--yeah, or should we just go for it (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, just go for that one.  Get a dictionary (laughter).
Speaker 1: I think I, I think I know how to spell it, but I--
Speaker 2: I think it's O-P-P-A--
Speaker 1: Oh, O-P-P?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ope- oh, maybe it's not.  Opelousas.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so we got two alternative spellings for it.  Louisiana.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, now, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  Do you--how far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: I, I can go back quite far on my mother's side.  It's gonna be difficult with my dad because I never knew his parents.  They died when he was a child.  But on my mother's side, the Guillory family was traced back to my ninth generation grandfather.  His name was--he was a Frenchman.  He was a Guillory.  I, I don't recall the first name, but being French, that would be (pronunciation) Guillory, you know, with the pronunciation of a Frenchman.  And he left Orleans, France in 1632, and went to Canada.  And his profession, he was a fur trader.  And he did the trapping as well as a--from what the family stories have been said.  And he, he traveled down the Mississippi [Mississippi River], going south and landed in Louisiana.  Again, I have some printed material.  Hopefully, we'll have it before the interview is over.  And maybe you can just add it too where I can give you a little more exact information.  But, and he married a black woman, a fair-skinned person, I would imagine in those days.  But in any event, she was smart enough to not allow the relationship to go too far without first getting a, almost like a contract from him saying that any offspring we would have would not be slaves and which led to, further on in my life, how my uncles down in Texas or what have you, would confront white people.  And in those days, you got lynched, but this was that piece of paper that was given to my ninth generation grandmother that her children would not be slaves.  So they never did have a mentality of slavery.
Speaker 1: So was she a slave when they met?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  She was a slave.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But the offspring weren't.
Speaker 1: But he--she actually, he actually married her.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right, so that created a whole different situation.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  So then we follow that all the way down--I can't, of course, name all of the names in the tree.
Story_ID: 544497
Speaker 1: That led to me, of course, knowing my grandmother and grandfather.  My grandfather's name was Raymond Guillory [Raymond Guillory, Sr.].  And he married Alice Harmon [Alice Harmon Guillory], Louisiana as well, Creole.  And out of that marriage, they had ten children, five boys, five girls.  And my mother was the oldest of the girls.  Her name was Elvina [Elvina Guillory Daniels], and I had my Aunt Bell [Isabell Guillory], Aunt Theresa [Theresa Guillory], Aunt Yolan [Yolan Guillory], and Aunt Edith [ph.], in age.  That's the five.  Actually, my Aunt Theresa is not only my aunt, but she's my godmother as well.  She's still, she's still alive in Houston [Texas].  My uncles, the oldest was Uncle Freddie [Freddie Guillory], Uncle Raymond [Raymond Guillory, Jr.], Uncle Russell [Russell Guillory], Uncle Xavier [ph.] and Uncle Clarence [Clarence Guillory].  He was the youngest.  And those were the--my uncles were actually--and all five of my uncles went to World War II [WWII] and came back alive, obviously, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: So, did they all grow up in Louisiana?
Speaker 1: Well, it was between Houston actually, but now, you know, because my grandfather--we called him Papa Guillory, short man of stature, but, oh, my, he was a rough, rough dude to raise five boys.  And he didn't take no mess.  And they all wound up bigger than him, but he'd still do what they did back in those days, as far as disciplines.  And my grandfather, he worked on the waterfront in Houston.  And, of course, there were many times there were a lot disturbances there, and he came up with a system that if I'm not mistaken, may still be in existence, but probably not because it's, it's not as labor intense as it used to be when it came to unloading those ships in the Port of Houston [Houston, Texas].  And so there was a lot of conflicts between white and black workers.  And so my grandfather created this thing where they split the ship in half, and it was a black walking foreman and a white walking foreman.  And each of them had their respective crews to offload these ships, which made him a very powerful person in, at that time, 'cause he was a leader.  He can get you jobs and what have you and all my uncles eventually wound up working there, and my Uncle Clarence, the youngest who had left Texas and wound up in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] years later, but when he would come down for the summer or whatever vacation, I don't care if he was there for three or four or five days, he went to work at the waterfront with Papa.  You know, he had his own family.  He had his job in Philly (laughter), but you came to Houston, Papa had you working.  And so, and then my grandmother, Alice Guillory, she had a, a cafe in Houston as far as I can, I remember because I lived there at one time.  And it was called Mama Alice's Cafe [ph.].  And I guess, further down, we'll, we'll be discussing that, my time in Houston.  It was a short time as far as living there, but I visited often.
Story_ID: 544498
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, did your mother [Elvina Guillory Daniels] have any stories of growing up?  Did she grow up in Houston [Texas] or Louisiana?
Speaker 2: Well, they grew up between, somewhere in Washington.  It might have been Seattle [Washington].  I don't know--and they traveled.  How they traveled from Texas to Seattle is amazing, but I heard stories of those trips that they had.
Speaker 1: So she grew up mostly in Seattle?
Speaker 2: My mom?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, between the two (unclear), because mostly, I would say in Texas.  But our relationship to Washington, the State of Washington, is real foggy to me because it's, you know, of course, before my time.  But I remember my, my oldest brother [Max Newsome, Jr.] talking about, because before my mother met and married my dad [George Daniels, Sr.], she was married to a gentleman that lived in Washington.  So it could be that type of relationship.  His name was Newsome [Max Newsome, Sr.].  And so that was my mother's first marriage.  This is before I was born.  And--but I never met him, but it's so, so odd and ironic and how loving families were in those days.  I didn't realize 'til I was about fourteen or fifteen years old that my brother and my two sisters, they had different last names, never paid any attention, never knew.  Unique, talking about a blended family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But that's--I think that's fairly common though.  You know, you--a lot of people just don't--unless somebody tells them.  They really don't know.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Well, there were, there were things, I tell you that, you just took for granted.  You just didn't do in days of me growing up versus what you hear today.  You know, me being in the music business, it kind of lends me an opportunity more than most people my age would have as far as being around so many young people.  So, you know, I'm able to bridge these different generations, and, wow, what a view I have, of course, being my age to be able to have such close contact because well, most people our age, all we do is hang around people our age and tell old war stories, and bore the hell outta each other 'cause you heard it twenty-five times over.  So, frankly, I don't hang with people my age (laughter).  They bore me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'd rather be a hundred and then bore somebody that's my age though.  Now (laughter).
Story_ID: 544499
Speaker 1: Was your mother [Elvina Guillory Daniels]--now, did--was she able to finish high school and--
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.  Actually, all of my aunts and uncles, they, they were--they did finish high school.  And the unique thing, out of all of the offspring, many became, you know, teachers and what have you.  My brother [Max Newsome, Jr.] at that time, 1962, he was the only person from our family to, at that time, to graduate, to graduate college.  And I mean we have thousands of cousins.  And then for him to become a dentist also at that time, and graduating.  So he was part of the class of close to three thousand physicians here in Chicago [Illinois] at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Chicago College of Dentistry], graduated at the original McCormick Place [Chicago, Illinois], the one that was built of concrete and out of the three thousand, there were six African American physicians in that class.  And my brother was one of them, and so I was--you can imagine as a kid how proud, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 544500
Speaker 1: Now what did your mother [Elvina Guillory Daniels] do for a living?
Speaker 2: Mother was a housewife, entrepreneur and mother and laborer.  Again, the stories I was told.  During World War II [WWII]--well, first, I guess I can say my, how my mom and dad met and that, you know, because then this--I can give you the history of what I know what she did.
Speaker 1: Well, I wanted to ask you about your father's side of the family first.  Then I was gonna have them meet.  But that's, that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But that, that will be really short, honestly, because I--actually, I knew few other Daniels.  I have a few stories.  I recall a cousin.
Speaker 1: Well, let's go to your father's side.  And then we'll have them meet.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, my father was born in northern Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Leesville [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Born in Leesville.  What's his full name?
Speaker 2: George Daniels [George Daniels, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay, same as yours.  So--
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm junior, actually.  I should have said that before.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So he was born in Leesville--
Speaker 2: Yes, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Louisiana--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and what's his date of birth?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: April 20th, 1915.
Speaker 1: Okay, same year?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right, now, now, what do you know about the ancestors on his side?
Speaker 2: I, I knew my dad was--he told me that he was born on the banks of a river or something in, in Leesville.  His, both his parents died when he was like nine--eight years old.  So I never had a, a Daniels experience.  So other than name, I'm--I guess life's experiences would make me a Guillory more than a Daniels.  And so I guess I'm kind of creating the, whatever the legacy left off at, wherever when my dad passed because he didn't talk very much.  I remember an Uncle Vernon [ph.] vaguely.
Story_ID: 544501
Speaker 1: When my mom [Elvina Guillory Daniels] and dad [George Daniels, Sr.] met, which was in Houston [Texas], she was still married to my brother and my sisters' dad.  And, but they were on the verge of splitting and so forth.  And they eventually broke up and it's one of those kind of love stories and my father actually--you know, my skin pigmentation comes from my, my dad because my mother could, and she did pass for white a few times when they had to take those trains back in the day.  And the, the car for the black folks was full.  She told stories of that.  That was funny.  But in any event, they met, and they liked one another, but they were both great dancers.  They loved to dance, and from what I was told, they would see each other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So they met--did they meet out at a club or something or did they meet--
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know where they met, but this was Texas.  This was, you know, you talking about, but, now, I guess you'd say literally 95 or 10 percent of black people if not more had jobs.  Well, you know, we owned, we didn't own that much.  If we did, we owned farmland maybe, and if those entrepreneurial spirit had it, but in most part, people had jobs.  I remember my father telling me how he used to work in the oil fields, wrapping the pipes, you know, before technology up to date.  But they used to wrap it with whatever materials.  But that's what he called it.  And what my mother was doing, other than being a mother and a housewife, I don't recall her talking about any types of jobs she had there in Texas.  What year they left Louisiana, I don't know.  But it was Houston because my brother [Max Newsome, Jr.] and my two sisters were born in Third Ward Houston in the Cuney Homes.  And so that attachment to Texas is relative to them having been born there.  And, of course, the relationship of Louisiana, of course, where they're border states.  So the whole connection.  And the Cuney Homes are like literally across the street from Texas Southern [Texas Southern University] in Houston.  So, Third Ward.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's across from Texas Southern, okay.  Now, what did your father do for a living?
Speaker 1: Well, he used to work in the oil fields originally, you know, before I was born.  That's what--the stories I've been told.  He, he was a very aggressive young person, always liked to dress well, dress, from what I was told.  And, of course, I found later, but in his younger years, you know, the ladies liked him.  He was sharp, good looking, would dance and so on and so forth.  And I think that's what caught my mother's eyes.  See, in those days, the dances were at the church.  My family was Catholic.  And so that's, I guess how they courted, if you will, or created that environment, a healthy, so called environment, you know, for young people to socialize.  And I think it was at one of the church dances, and the parents, of course, Louisiana Creole.  And there's the music Zydeco type of music.  It's not Cajun because the Cajun was more relative to Caucasian, but the Zydeco, your Clifton Chenier and Beau Jocque.  It's a solid music that's strictly attached to, how should I say, people of color from Louisiana.  And what's the term?  Not Cajun--
Speaker 2: Creole.
Speaker 1: Creole, excuse me.  I just lost it for a moment there.
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the Creole blood.  It was ironic because one time I wound up going down there again, down the road, the term Geechee boy, they used to call me Geechee.  I didn't know what it was.  I started fighting in a minute.  I thought it was a dirty word, but it's relative to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Geechee's more South Carolina, but I guess it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But it, yeah, it found me in Houston (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: So, but these were kids calling you that, you know, so.  And, and so they met I'm sure at some kind of parties like that because--and my mother was extremely beautiful, natural redhead and light skinned and freckles and very beautiful, very--it was a, we had a, they had a great looking family.  It's no doubt about it.  And they got, they attracted to one another, dating to the disapproval of my grandmother [Alice Harmon Guillory], again, from what I was told that they did not particularly care for my father because of his dark skin because you have to remember those times.  And, but quote, I guess love prevailed because my mother challenged it.  She was the oldest, and she was under, I guess my father must have encouraged her to have that type of backbone because you didn't stand up in those days to your mother and your father.  No way.  But she did.  And so her first husband Newsome [Max Newsome, Sr.], he--they divorced.  Dad and Mom, of course, hooked up.
Story_ID: 544502
Speaker 1: And they tell me the story of when they left Houston [Texas], my father [George Daniels, Sr.] left first.  And he was saying, he told her, he said, "Look," you know, "I'm gonna go up north, get a good job, and I'm a send for you."  They tell this--mother [Elvina Guillory Daniels] told me how the rest of the family, her brothers and sisters said, "He's not gonna send for you," so and so and so and so.  "Look, you're a woman.  You got three kids.  Why would a man do this?"  And they went to the train station and kissed.  He got on the train, waved goodbye and stuff and said, wow, what a story.  He got to New York [New York], found a job at the, the shipyards 'cause this was like during World War II [WWII].  And he was a welder.  Again, he obviously learned it, probably in the oil fields in those days.  And after a while, he got a place and sent for my mom.  And she came to New York, she became a welder, right along with him because neither went to the [U.S.] military.  But--and the jobs were there because after all who was in World War II fighting and how they emptied the workforce.  And so that's why females and black men got a lot of the jobs back in those days.  So they did quite well because all--most of white America was in the, in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 2: Now, is there a reason why he wasn't drafted 'cause he would have been of age?
Speaker 1: Well, there wasn't no draft [sic.].  No, there wasn't no draft back there.
Speaker 2: World War II?
Speaker 1: World War--no, wasn't no draft.  It may have been, but most people just volunteered.  After they bombed Pearl Harbor [Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii], man, people ran to enlist.  So if there was a draft, it wasn't really--it wasn't needed.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, so, how he had to deal with the military thing, you know, again, you have, talking about from down south.  Everybody didn't feel that they're patriotic, you know, to go fight for a country.  When you turn around, and, you know, your cousin is hanging off a tree some damn where, you know.  And after all, he's a Louisiana black, dark-skinned black man.  So there would be a difference.  But in any event, he, he served his country by being a welder because they were welding military ships.  And their first business was a candy store and shoeshine parlor.  And when they left their jobs, they, they had this candy store and shoeshine parlor.  And my mother shined shoes along with my dad.
Speaker 2: Now, now, so, okay, so, this is during the war (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We talking about, we talking about--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1941--
Speaker 1: About '43 [1943], '44 [1944], I would think.
Speaker 2: Forty-three [1943], '44 [1944], okay.
Speaker 1: Forty-five [1945], possibly in there, yeah.
Story_ID: 544503
Speaker 1: So, well, describe your parents' personalities, and tell me who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My father [George Daniels, Sr.].  It's no doubt.  I have a lot of my mother [Elvina Guillory Daniels] in me, but, you know, it's a different--I have a lot, you know, my mother didn't participate much in raising me.  I would say my oldest sister, Maxine [Maxine Newsome Boyd], who really was my mother.  Most folks used to think she, she was my--I was her son, more than--because as time goes on, as you will find out how--there wasn't time for me as a child from my mom or dad.  But all the material things, there was no problem as far as that was concerned.  But they were both hard workers, loved to have a good time, and I, I definitely inherited that, and always dressed impeccably, both.
Story_ID: 544504
Speaker 1: Again, that came from--after the shoeshine--well, I guess when, when they opened up their first restaurant, it had to be maybe 1945, I would think because the timescale, my mother [Elvina Guillory Daniels] worked up until the last half an hour before I was born in the first restaurant my mom and dad [George Daniels, Sr.] had.  That was Daniels Restaurant on Prospect Avenue in the Bronx [New York], Prospect and 169th Street.  And, and she was rushed to Lincoln Hospital [Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center; NYC Health + Hospitals/Lincoln, Bronx, New York].  That's where I was born, December 12th, 12:01 AM, 1946--December 18th, I think I said, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, well, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it leads to remembering right down the street from my mom's and dad's restaurant, that was their first one, and at Prospect and Home Street, like a block away, my [maternal] grandmother [Alice Harmon Guillory] had a candy store.  And so I remember the family, chase after me, you know, because I'd always be flying down to grandmamma's place.  And they had the, the freezer outside with the slices of watermelon and, you know, had a soda fountain inside.  And so that, that was cool. (Background noise) I remember wanting to help my dad.  I guess I must have been three, four years old because in those days, you know, it was really labor intense.  You know, you went to the market--when you got fish, they were live fish.  And, you know, you bring them back, and the restaurant was--and, see, these weren't snack shops.  In those days, there wasn't even a term called fast food, you know, and you, you sat down and you ate.  You know, you got food.  And I recall the time that dad came, and I wanted to help so bad.  And he--and you had to--like I said, labor intense.  The fish would come, and you had to scale them, get all of the scale off of the fish before you even cut them and stuff.  And I wanted to help, and a fish jumped out and jumped some way.  My daddy put a apron on me.  And I remember running.  I was scared to death.  That was my first and last experience with fish (laughter) until I went fishing.  But my work ethic, still today, is a reflection of my parents, the initial exposure to knowing what it means to, to have to work, and then to know what it means for ownership.  After all, I was almost born and my grandmother had it, and then by the time I was like five, six years old, my parents had ten restaurants, five in the Bronx and five in Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: So I had a pretty cool childhood.
Story_ID: 544505
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: I had half brothers.  I have two half brothers, Rodney [ph.] and Andre Daniels [ph.].  But I was the only child born to my mother [Elvina Guillory Daniels] and dad [George Daniels, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's just the three of you?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The other two half brothers were not from my mother.  They were from two other women.  See, so it's not a family, you know what I'm saying?
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were the only one at home--
Speaker 2: That was my father--I was the only one born to my mom and dad.  My mother had three kids already in the Newsome family.  My brother, Max [Max Newsome, Jr.], my sister, Maxine [Maxine Newsome Boyd], and my sister, Geraldine [ph.].  Now, my brother and my youngest sister still live--my--lives, my, my sister, Maxine, who really was like my mother, if you will, she died in 1986 in New York [New York].
Story_ID: 544506
Speaker 1: Now we always ask this question.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was always good home cooking because, again, my parents [Elvina Guillory Daniels and George Daniels, Sr.] had--these are full fledged restaurants.  So you name the African American cuisine, and I can tell you a little bit about it.  I've eaten it all.  I lived in like the Bronx [New York] in my first years.  When I got school age, dad moved us to Queens, Flushing [Queens, New York].  We lived in a place called Parsons Garden [ph.].  It was one of the first developments--I found out years later that was really designated for literally, a middle-income black community.  My first school, P.S. 154 in Queens was a integrated school, not that we even discussed that in those days.  It's just like me and my, my white friends and classmates, we'd walk home together, but I never even paid attention to the fact that they crossed Parsons Boulevard a little bit further, and then they had their homes.  But we used to meet in the swamp.  See, in those days, a lot of the stuff that was being build-- LaGuardia Airport [New York, New York] was out there, and it was a lot of homes but apartments.  I remember the Pomonok apartments [Pomonok Houses, Queens, New York] that are still there.  But they were under construction when I was a kid.  I remember in the Bronx where my cousins lived with my aunt and uncle, and they lived in what they called the Quonset huts.  So, you know, which are right off the expressway on Brooklyn Boulevard [ph.] in the Bronx, and they were there, you know, the World War II [WWII] veterans, and they were waiting for the Soundview projects to be built in the Bronx.  So those experiences of smelling the Bronx, having the smells of Harlem [New York, New York] and it's like in Chicago [Illinois], if you're able to--as you progress in life, you can leave the West Side, and when you really made it, you wind up with a house on the South Side.  That's the way it usually ran.  And so for us to be able to leave the Bronx in those days and move as far out as Queens, it was, I guess, in just like open housing, if you will, before it was signed.
Speaker 1: Right, so, in Queens (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because it was--
Speaker 1: --you had like a yard and a--
Speaker 2: No, well, it was an apartment complex.
Speaker 1: Apartment, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, as a matter of fact, I used to--remember, everybody used to always make a fuss, but now, the major fuss, everybody knew this lady who lived across the hall.  And come to find out years later--I never knew.  I used to always speak to her, Miss Holiday, you know, that was Billie Holiday (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so she lived across the hall from you?
Speaker 2: She lived across the hall from us, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, again, you must remember, to keep it in context because in those days, everything you did was to make a living.  So if you sang, you sang to make a living.  You know, it's, it's a thing of the values of that era versus this era.  You know, artists in those days didn't need bodyguards and so on and so forth.  They didn't have huge entourages and so, you know.  It's a difference in the quality of life and the quality of individuals that had no idea years later, it'd be something called technology.  They were part of the, I guess the automation era and the industrial change of America.  But when you, when you mention, you know, my parents eventually having ten restaurants, where would the employees come from?  Where would the management come from?  Believe me.  People worked in those days.  You have to remember welfare, I don't think was even in existence at that time.  There were subsidies, if you will, but, so where were you gonna get money from?  You had to work.  There wasn't--there was very little crime because they was respectful with one another.  And so this is how it was in those days.  So it's, it's so much different today, of course, than yesterday.  So they were able to run those restaurants quite successfully.  But time moved on.
Story_ID: 544507
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now did they name--did they--were they all named the same name?
Speaker 2: Daniels Restaurants.
Speaker 1: Daniels Restaurants?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my brother [Max Newsome, Jr.], he was in the [U.S.] Army.  As a matter of fact, he was stationed in South Korea at that time, early '50s [1950s].  So my mom [Elvina Guillory Daniels] and dad [George Daniels, Sr.], they split, got a divorce.
Speaker 1: About what year did they--was this in the early '50s [1950s], you say?
Speaker 2: The divorce had to come, it must have been, maybe '56 [1956], '57 [1957], I think, something within that, vein there.  I can't recall because, again, you know, children were not exposed to it like they are today, you know, to that type of attention that they bring to a divorce situation.  So, but in any event, my mother wound up with four of the restaurants.  My dad had the other six.  I--my two sisters by this time had married and moved out.  And so it just left me and my mother.  We moved from Queens [New York] to Jackson Heights [Queens, New York].  Jackson Heights, I went to P.S. 143 [Louis Armstrong School, Queens, New York].  I was starting sixth grade. Was it sixth grade?  Yeah, because you graduate from sixth in New York [New York].
Story_ID: 544508
Speaker 1: Many--most times I'd be home alone for, you know, three, four, five days.  'Cause Mother [Elvina Guillory Daniels] was running her four restaurants.  They were twenty-four hour operations.  And so the rest of the family, they were really upset, some said, you know, "You can't leave him home alone like that."  My nickname was Little Danny.  That's what all the family called--even today, to today, I'm known as Little Danny to my family, you know.  School, it was always George, and [HistoryMaker] George Daniels, but, and so, my mother came home one day and she said, "Hey, you wanna go to Texas and live with your grandmother" 'cause by this time, Mama Alice [Alice Harmon Guillory] had moved from Bronx [New York] back down where most of her family was in Houston [Texas].  And she opened up Mama Alice's Cafe [ph.].
Speaker 2: Now, how old were you when you made this move?  You were--
Speaker 1: I had to be--
Speaker 2: You just came out of the sixth (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) eleven or twelve years old.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you came out of sixth grade, you said, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was about eleven or twelve years old.
Speaker 2: Okay, about twelve, okay, eleven or twelve.
Speaker 1: Because once I graduated sixth grade at P.S. 143 [Louis Armstrong School, Queens, New York], I was to start, and I did September of 1958, it had to be, yeah, 'cause I got here somewhere in the vicinity of 1958, whether it was the beginning of the year or whatever.  But I remember when I graduated sixth grade in P.S. 143, that September I started junior high school at P.S. 16 [P.S. 16 the Nancy DeBenedittis School, Queens, New York].  This is when--I had, no, I don't think I had even been into that school near a month, two months--not, well, it hadn't been that long.  I remember that school, you know, vaguely.  You know, I'm, I'm one of those products of being shifted so much the timelines are foggy because, you know, your parents and whatever they do, you got to move with the flow.  And so I'm, you know, I'm--things that were really short, seemed long periods of time.  And so Mother came home, and she said, "Hey, you wanna go to Texas and live with your grandma?"  I said, "Sure."  Go down there, lo and behold she lives in Fifth Ward in Houston on a street by the corner of Gregg [Street] and Orleans [New Orleans Street], across the street from E.O. Smith Junior High School [Houston, Texas].  On the other side of the house was the fire department.  I recall Gregg Street, mostly a gravel--well, on the side, Orleans was gravel, but it was like blacktop, but they had the ditches for water runoff, and so unique for me coming from New York [New York] to be in that environment.  My Aunt Yolan [Yolan Guillory] had a beauty salon down the street, maybe two, three blocks, right by the railroad track, across the street from the washeteria, as they called it in those days, the laundromat.
Story_ID: 544509
Speaker 1: The house we lived in was right on the corner of Gregg [Street] and Orleans [New Orleans Street].  And it was connected to my [maternal] grandmother's [Alice Harmon Guillory] restaurant, Mama Alice's Cafe [ph.].  And she had a candy counter in there and stuff, so I used to have to get up like five [o'clock] in the morning and get ready to open up the store at six [o'clock].  And I waited on my classmates.  The bell would ring about 8:00, 8:30, and I'd grab my books and go across the street to the school.  I remember the experiences of corporal punishment.  And this school was, you know, years later was known for it because I didn't realize it, but I--well, maybe it might have come after I left, but it was the same school that George Foreman attended when he was a youngster in Fifth Ward [Houston, Texas].
Speaker 2: And that's E.O. Smith [E.O. Smith Junior High School, Houston, Texas]?
Speaker 1: E.O. Smith, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so the corporal punishment thing, I used to get spanked--they had paddles.  All the teachers had paddles.  And I used to get paddled every day because, you know, coming from New York [New York], it was "Yeah," and "No."  Going down there, I had to get used to saying, "Yes, ma'am," and "No, ma'am."  It was incredible.  And so eventually, my grandmother had to come up to school and, and beg them to quit, you know, beating on me until I can get adjusted to that environment of the southern way of speaking to your instructors or your elders.  Wasn't no, "Yeah" and "Naw," yeah, it was "Yes, ma'am" and "No, ma'am."  So that was a trying experience.
Story_ID: 544510
Speaker 1: The other big experience for being in Texas, my grandmom [Daniels' maternal grandmother, Alice Harmon Guillory], she got ill.  As a matter of fact, just another anecdote, the music of that time, because grandmother had--it was the candy store and the restaurant [Mama Alice's Cafe (ph.)].  So my uncles who would come for lunch from the Port of Houston [Houston, Texas] would eat with us.  And so I learned a lot about cooking, you know, mixing cake batter with my grandmother.  It was a small--it wasn't a fancy place, but it was, it was a cafe.  And with the fire department next door, I knew all of the firemen, and they would eat.  I remember grandmother would fix them pots of food, and I would just take it right to the fire department.  And I remember them letting me slide down the pole.  The fire department was all white.  There wasn't no black folks on the fire department in those days.  And we lived in those wood framed houses that sat on the bricks, you know.  So it was a, it was a southern experience for me, which, you know, as time moved forward, as time went on, I would, I would challenge people that say that, you know, coming from a broken family creates problems.  It could.  Everybody has problems and baggage, but because of my mom [Elmina Guillory Daniels] and dad's [George Daniels, Sr.] split, I had a chance to experience so many different families, but within my family 'cause when grandmom got sick, I had to go live with one of my aunts, my Aunt Elizabeth [Elizabeth Guillory] who is married to my Uncle Ray--Uncle Russell [Russell Guillory].  And we lived in Pleasantville [Houston, Texas].  It's like suburb--
Speaker 2: Of--
Speaker 1: --of Houston [Texas].
Speaker 2: Of Houston, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and my Aunt Elizabeth bought me my first B.B. gun, my Daisy Pump B.B. gun.  I have that.  But then, not far, in the same housing area--these were all homes, all black folks lived in these homes with driveways and lawns and stuff, you know.  It was really unique because like Fifth Ward [Houston, Texas] was not like that.  You know, there's a difference between, you know, like Chatham [Chicago, Illinois] and Lawndale [North Lawndale], if you will, here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, Fifth Ward is supposed to be the--one of the roughest places in the country actually (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's like, it'd be like Harlem [New York, New York].  It'd be like Magnolia Projects [C.J. Peete Projects] in New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 2: People--
Speaker 1: It'd be like Brooklyn [New York], Bed-Stuy, you know--Bedford Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah, the kids that get angry now, they say they're going, "Fifth Ward," right? And that's a direct reference to Houston.
Speaker 1: Well, there're certain slangs, but they, you know, they're just slangs that don't last long.  But the Fifth Ward has been known, but, you know, there's a major record label out of Houston's Fifth Ward, called Rap-A-Lot Records, J. Prince [James Prince], a friend of mine.  But under any event--
Speaker 2: I know the Geto Boys are from Houston too (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, there's Scarface--
Speaker 2: --from the Fifth Ward.
Speaker 1: --all of them.  That's where Scarface come from, yeah. 5th Ward Boyz, yeah, M.C. Choice [Choice], the first female rapper (unclear).  It's, yeah, it was a heck of an environment.  But I remember, you know, people would come in the restaurant.  I'd wait tables and so on and so forth.  And they'd always, "Here, go play the jukebox."  And for some odd reason, I loved--they'd always turn to me.  I loved Dinah Washington, 'September in the Rain,' and I'd play that.  Here, I'm a kid, and they look, "Why is this kid playing this?"  You know, but under the event, I, I still remember that like it was yesterday.  My grandmother's jukebox.  And so, grandmom, she got ill, and so I had to move to Pleasantville, stayed with my Aunt Elizabeth, and her only child was Mary Catherine [Mary Catherine McDonald].  Mary Catherine basically used to take care of me.  She was like around the age of my oldest sister [Maxine Newsome Boyd].  And so Mary Catherine taught me how to drive and so on.  But now, in order to go to school because even the kids from Pleasantville went to E.O. Smith [E.O. Smith Junior High School, Houston, Texas].  So I used to have to take the school bus from Pleasantville to E.O. Smith.  And what an experience because it was an all-black situation on the bus, but we had the right to--ride through the white neighborhoods.  And I never could understand why they used to throw stuff at us because, again, I'm from New York [New York].  The, the kids that were down there, it was normal.  I was not used to that.  I was ready to get off, you know, and do what we do in New York, you know, you don't take that.  But you didn't do it down there, and went along with the program.
Story_ID: 544511
Speaker 1: And what really stuck out was one day my cousin Mary Catherine [Mary Catherine McDonald] drove me to the swimming pool, you know, where the black kids, all black families go swim, and dropped me off, and told me, said, look, you know, "Go swimming.  I'll be back to pick you up at such and such a time."  So I'm swimming, you know, me and the kids having a good time in the pool.  Time's over, I get out, and so I'm sitting around waiting and waiting.  And me--and I'm still that way today.  I, I'm--it's hard for me to sit still.  And so, I know which way she drove us.  I'm gonna start walking.  So I'm walking down, you know, not really realizing white people coming out on the porch just pointing at me and what have you.  I'm waving, I don't know, you know, and, and never really sensed because you walked like in the road.  It wasn't no sidewalks.  And these homes sat back, and I couldn't tell.  You know, traffic going by that I was getting ready to have something happen to me, didn't know it.  All of a sudden a car pulled up, and it was my cousin.  She snatched me in the car so quick and sped off.  She said, "Boy, you know where, what you doing?"  I said, "Yeah, I was walking home."  She said, "No, you can't--I told you to wait."  They would a killed me had she not got there at that time.  That's the race relations in those days.  I remember Mary Catherine taking me to the movies downtown, Houston [Texas], where we used to call it going to town, not down.  It was to town, which is very close to Fifth Ward [Houston, Texas], and still today.  You know, it's being gentrified, Fifth Ward is, but just to show you what it was in those days.  When they built the first expressways, they bypassed Fifth Ward, didn't even give them the exit or entrance onto the expressway.  And if you look at the way they--they've modified it now.  But, but we used to go to the movies, but I remember we had to go into the balcony.  I remember the white and colored water fountains, something that I didn't know anything about in New York [New York].  So there were different, you know, exposures than I--and influences that I came in contact with in the southern environment, coming from a northern environment--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) as a black person.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because that's true, I mean was the whole situation more profound to you, you think, 'cause you got the Civil Rights Movement on TV now.  It's starting to--
Speaker 1: Yeah, but see, but no, not yet, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) crank up, and here you are in a situation where you're seeing stuff you never saw.
Speaker 1: But this is not yet.  See, this is '58 [1958]--
Speaker 2: Not in Houston, well--
Speaker 1: --this is '58 [1958].  See, that Civil Rights Movement didn't start 'til the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Nah, bus boycott, Montgomery Bus Boycott, '56 [1956]--
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: --fifty-six [1956], 1956.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the Civil Rights Movement, that was there.
Speaker 2: Okay--
Speaker 1: I mean--
Speaker 2: --in Houston.
Speaker 1: --all we had in New York was the Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News].  You think the white folks is gonna write up about that, even up north?  Who owned the newspapers?  Who owned communication?  You know, but, you know, it really hit when, you know, Connor, Bull Connor, I remember that name, with the dogs, when they attacked and start really hitting the news.
Speaker 2: That's in '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: This is when Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] start coming along.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's '63 [1963], right.
Speaker 1: But, see, see, so the bus boycott, that had nothing to do with riots.  If you remember, that was all peaceful.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: There were no police beating up folks for not getting on the buses, right.
Speaker 2: I don't know about that, I can't say there weren't any.
Speaker 1: Well, well, it was quiet.  I mean it was, it was the idea that, you know, hey, black folks you sit in the back of the bus.  That was it.  So Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] got his attention by--with a nonviolent protest by not riding on the buses.  See, so, the water hoses and all the violence came later.  And see, so it was a unique time for me with riding the buses to school [E.O. Smith Junior High School, Houston, Texas], going to those theaters.
Story_ID: 544512
Speaker 1: So again, as time went on, you know, Mary Catherine [Mary Catherine McDonald] had--she was getting married, so I wound up going to live with my Uncle Clarence [Clarence Guillory] and my Aunt Theresa [Theresa Guillory], which was--still lived in the same housing area called Pleasantville [Houston, Texas].  They lived on Guinevere Street, and, see, kids from New York [New York] used to love to go to these houses because, you know, we didn't have grass in New York.  And my cousins would love for me to come over because I'd wanna cut the grass.  That was one of their chores, and they'd get their cousin, Danny [HistoryMaker George Daniels], from New York.  He'll cut every damn thing.  And so I was a pretty popular cousin 'cause I'd always wanna do that, country boy stuff that we didn't get a chance to do in New York, learned how to fish and hunt.  My Uncle Clarence, he was a great guy all the while.  And not knowing how much of a burden I was, I was just another mouth to feed.  Years later, I, I realized it, you know, because I guess they--well, there were other issues going on back in New York between my mom [Elvina Guillory Daniels] and dad [George Daniels, Sr.], and their businesses and so on and so forth.  So, so eventually, I wound up, you know, from what I could tell, that I was kind of being handed off to whoever could afford to take care of me 'cause my mom and dad weren't doing what they were supposed to do.  And--
Speaker 2: Now, did you ever live with your dad at all during this period?
Speaker 1: After high school [Hirsch High School; Emil G. Hirsch Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --for, for maybe a year--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you know, here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay, so, well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So I wound up in--my Uncle Clarence, and my grandmother [Alice Harmon Guillory] was gonna be moved back to New York to stay with one of her daughters.  And the best medical care was there.  And I remember them packing up the cars and stuff and then me, they packed me up 'cause my Uncle Clarence lived in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  So my grandmother was, they were gonna send her on the train.  And so I was to go to Philly.  My mom was still in New York.  But it wasn't like, well, he can come live with me.  She, you know, she didn't kind of have time for me, I guess, you say, and so I went to Philly to live with my Uncle Clarence who I was so scared of.  He was a brutal guy.  He was the youngest of the, my uncles.  And he was a pretty scary guy, but anyway--
Speaker 2: How old were you?  I'm sorry.  Well, how old were you when you moved to Philadelphia?
Speaker 1: That had to be between ten and eleven because, again, these, these short spans that I did so many things, seemed longer than they really were.
Speaker 2: Now, see.  Okay, wait a minute now.  You were in, you were eleven or twelve when you all moved to--okay, wait a minute.  I thought you, okay, when you moved to Texas, I thought, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, see, that's what I'm saying--
Speaker 2: That was at the sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but--
Speaker 2: So you were there like a year or something.
Speaker 1: Just about a year.  That's what I'm saying.
Speaker 2: About a year, okay.
Speaker 1: I was shifted around so often, so the times--it was very close.
Speaker 2: Okay, so about twelve or so you moved to Philadelphia?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was--and that was like maybe even a week, but the story lends to the fact that I'm in Philly.  I guess the grownups, they don't know.  Well, you know, what are we gonna do with him?  He's--his mother doesn't have a place big enough for him to stay with her.  And so my Uncle Clarence is gonna have me stay there with him, and oh, god, how scared I was.
Story_ID: 544513
Speaker 1: And then one day, the phone rings.  They hand it to me.  It was my brother, Max Newsome [Max Newsome, Jr.], here in Chicago [Illinois].  He was married, was going to University of Illinois to dental school [University of Illinois at Chicago School of Dentistry, Chicago, Illinois].  He had one child.  And he sent for his baby brother.  And I showed up in Chicago, I guess, late August of 1959 and to live with my brother at 1906 Ogden Avenue.  Matter of fact, I remember flying into Midway Airport [Chicago Midway International Airport, Chicago, Illinois] and there was a--the World Series was going on, and it was the White Sox [Chicago White Sox].  And I didn't know what a White Sox was.  Yeah, I'm a Brooklyn Dodgers [Los Angeles Dodgers] fan.  I still watched--I follow the Dodgers even though they're in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  You know, but again, it's historical attachment of black folks and the Brooklyn Dodgers, as we know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was what they call the Go-Go White Sox in '59 [1959], yeah.
Speaker 1: I guess.  I--look, I didn't care about a White Sox.  I'm the kid, and my brother picked me up, and that started my history in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Okay, 1959, now, you're about--
Speaker 1: Eighth grade.
Speaker 2: Eighth grade, thirteen. Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm ready to, ready to start eighth grade.
Story_ID: 544514
Speaker 1: Well, tell us a little bit about school.  Now, did you like school for the most part or did all the switching up kind of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I didn't.  I didn't have the disciplines necessary because of shifting around.  Still today, I see folks my age, even younger folks who have their lifelong friends, and I have none, you know.  I missed that.  But, like you say, how can you miss what you never had, but I see it in relationships of people that I know.  But because of that type of shifting around, it was never long enough to really bond.  And the greatest bond that I have, and I remember, the bond that I had in Flushing in Queens [New York].  You know, we all had like our gang, our little friends in--it was Larry [ph.], Georgie [ph.], Rayfield [ph.] and one girl whose name was Judy [ph.].  And it was me, and the five of us, I mean we were just, did the things kids did, but we did, always did it together, you know, whether it was playing games called loadies, marbles, street games that, you know, kids made up.  And they had them painted in the parks, handball, you know, and baseball was big.  Actually in New York [New York], we played stickball.  And so that memory of my childhood is very, very vivid.  Coming out of that, that era there is really shady because I was moving around so much.  And then the time in Texas [Houston, Texas], the things like I mentioned, the school, stands out.  My uncles stand out, going fishing and hunting 'cause of my Uncle Clarence [Clarence Guillory], the open space, the fields and cutting the grass, my B.B. gun, playing like a hunter, walking through the swamps and stuff.  And so that era was very strong.  After that it gets foggy, and then coming to Chicago [Illinois] and living with my brother [Max Newsome, Jr.].  He's a medical student, married and working.  My sister-in-law [Charlotte Newsome] had a job, and before he even graduated medical school, he had two more kids.  And he still was able to take care of me and see me through eighth grade and all the way through high school.
Story_ID: 544515
Speaker 1: Where did you go to eighth grade here?
Speaker 2: I went to a small Catholic school on the corner of Taylor [Street] and Wolcott [Avenue], which is still there, Holy Trinity [Holy Trinity School, Chicago, Illinois].  I graduated from Holy Trinity, 19--let's see, 1960, 1960, yeah.
Speaker 1: And where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went two years to Farragut [Farragut High School; Farragut Career Academy, Chicago, Illinois], and then that was '60 [1960] to '61 [1961].  And then I did--I graduated from Hirsch [Hirsch High School; Emil G. Hirsch Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois] from '62 [1962] to '64 [1964].  That happened because my brother [Max Newsome, Jr.] graduated medical school [University of Illinois at Chicago School of Dentistry, Chicago, Illinois] in 1962.
Story_ID: 544516
Speaker 1: And I came home--I went to New York [New York] for the summer to spend with my mom [Elvina Guillory Daniels].  And when I left, we lived--we were living at 1906 Ogden Avenue, which is right across from Cook County Hospital [John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois].  And living there, I remember one of my first jobs, I worked downstairs at Lee's Italian Restaurant [ph.].  I was a dishwasher.  I remember playing in a little park right across the street from Cook County Hospital 'cause there were very few kids around there.  We used to (unclear)--we lived in university owned housing, but they were like tenements.  I remember the furnace not working at times.  It was so cold and what have you.  And then one of his fellow, one of his fellow tenants who was a Jamaican guy came up with the idea, well, we have fire places, and burned coal.  So we used to go to the basement and get the coal, and literally burn it in the fireplaces to keep the apartment warm.  I remember the hard work my brother [Max Newsome, Jr.] was doing.  He had the little back room was like his laboratory.  He'd do his homework, doing dentures and so on and so forth.  And I remember--what was the name of the grocery store, Pentero, Pentaro's [ph.], right across the Eisenhower [Eisenhower Expressway]--I have to--used to walk all the way over to Damen [Avenue], cross over the Eisenhower and come back, actually, literally where Malcolm X [Theodore Herzl Junior College; Malcolm X College, Chicago, Illinois] is where Pat- Pontario's [ph.] was back in those days, right off the expressway.  And I remember walking through county hospital, especially Monday mornings, 'cause I had free run.  Everyone kind of knew me.  I was literally the only kid in the neighborhood, and everything is the neighborhood.  And Monday mornings, and you would see the people that, you know, got injured over the weekend, people still on gurneys and so on and so forth, you know, blood and guts type of stuff, any kid would love to see, you know, when you're that young.  And I'd, you know, I'd walk through there, especially when it was cold, and I had like free run.  It wasn't as much security, again, as they have nowadays.  And so that exposure--and then that was my first experience at a Catholic school, which was an unusual experience.  And then, again, coming to Chicago [Illinois],  eventually, I realized how it, at that time--and some people still would agree that, it's one of the most--it's the most segregated northern city in America.
Story_ID: 544517
Speaker 1: Where did you go to--was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not, not really.  You know, I had to go to church (background noise), you know, because Catholic school, you better have your, you know, there for Mass. But it was never forced upon me to have to go.  I did get involved because when we wound up on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], after going to Farragut [Farragut High School; Farragut Career Academy, Chicago, Illinois] because when I was, when I was living on 1906 Ogden [Avenue], I actually was supposed to go to Crane High School [Crane Technical High School; Richard T. Crane Medical Prep High School, Chicago, Illinois].  Crane was really rough in those days, so my brother [Max Newsome, Jr.] used his in-laws' address on St. Louis [Avenue] in order for me to enroll in Farragut.  So I used to catch the Ogden Avenue bus, get off at Kedzie [Avenue], and wait for the Kedzie bus and go south to 24th Street and walk over to Farragut.  Those experiences of seeing the neighborhoods change and how Chicago [Illinois] is so segregated.  And then, like I said, in 1962 when I get back from the vacation or before, my brother calls me in New York [New York].  He said, "Look, Danny [HistoryMaker George Daniels]," he said, "when you get off the plane--," this was like 1961, '62 [1962] actually, going into September, I guess you would say of '61 [1961].  And--'cause we graduated in the summer of '62 [1962], so it had to be right there.  I was starting my junior year.  And so he called, he said, "Look, when you get off the plane, take the Continental bus," you know, that's what--the air transport vans you have now, kind of, they used to be like a regular bus.  And it cost you three dollars to go downtown.  And they let me off at Jack- he said, "Get off at the Palmer House Hotel [Palmer House Hilton, Chicago, Illinois], and then go to the Jackson Park "L" [elevated train]," the subway.  He said, "Get on there, get off a 63rd [Street] and Cottage Grove [Avenue], catch the Cottage Grove bus to 85th Street, and we'll be at the bus stop to meet you."
Speaker 1: That's a lot of--
Speaker 2: And, so, yeah, and here I am at this age, but I was cool.  Got there, and they--we walked down the street to the new house that he rented 8534 Drexel [Avenue].  And we had a house.  And my room was in the basement, a makeshift room I had there.  And then I was to start high school.  But now my transcript from Farragut, they had me down for Bogan High School [William J. Bogan High School; Bogan Computer Technical High School, Chicago, Illinois], which is on the Southwest side, out in the 90s.  Is it Bowen or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --or Bogan?
Speaker 1: Was it Bowen?
Speaker 2: Bowen, you know, further southeast of CVS [Chicago Vocational High School; Chicago Vocational Career Academy, Chicago, Illinois]].
Speaker 1: Oh, southeast, that's--
Speaker 2: That's Bowen [James H. Bowen High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: That's Bowen, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, Bowen.
Speaker 1: Bowen with a W, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so I get ready, you know, to start, you know, to go to school.  I had my transfer papers (background noise), took the 87th Street bus over to South Chicago [Avenue], took the South Chicago bus to 90th--something around there.
Speaker 1: 91st [Street], something like that.
Speaker 2: Get off the bus.  I'm walking, a big campus, big beautiful school, and people stopped and it reminded me of Texas [Houston, Texas] when I was coming from that swimming pool.  I went over there and all these white kids there.  I didn't see nobody black.  And before I got inside, the principal or someone came to the door and said, "May I help you?"  I said, "Yeah, I'm transferring here."  He said, "No, you must have the wrong school.  Where do you live?"  And I told them.  They said, "No, no, no, you supposed to be at Hirsch [Hirsch High School; Emil G. Hirsch Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois].  You go home and have your parents get it straight" (laughter).  I was not supposed to be there because, again, the segregation.  So I wound up at Hirsch which was the, the black school, that years before was an all-white school because of the migration.  And so I spent two years at Hirsch, graduated in '64 [1964], and that night, coming off the stage, 'cause we used Calumet High School's [Chicago, Illinois] auditorium for the graduation because Hirsch's was too small.  And I'm on the steps happy, and then a bombshell hit me.  My brother [Max Newsome, Jr.] said, "Okay, now, you can go live with your dad [George Daniels, Sr.]."  Wow.  He had since moved to Chicago [Illinois], married one of his kids' mother, and he lived at 5218 Michigan [Avenue].  So that's where I had to, (background noise) to go to live after--
Story_ID: 544518
Speaker 1: But, you know, during the, (background noise) the two years at, at Hirsch [Hirsch High School; Emil G. Hirsch Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois], I had a couple of jobs.  I was always--had, had, worked a job.  I always knew how to keep a few bucks [dollars] in my pocket.  In that 8500 block on Drexel [Avenue], I literally--all of the older folks, people that didn't have kids to cut the lawn or wash the car and do yard work, that was my job, you know, shovel the snow for those that didn't have anybody to shovel.  So I always had a hustle.  And my first real job there on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], I worked at Acme Bicycle Shop [ph.].  I learned how to repair bikes.  It was a white lady that owned it. Another job I had was Chatham's menswear in the 8200 block on Cottage [Cottage Grove Avenue].  So, again, there was always a way for me to work.  My brother [Max Newsome, Jr.], being a physician, and, you know, he was--he's done very well.  He still practices as well.  So, again, I had some great positive images.
Story_ID: 544519
Speaker 1: Now, was--were there any special teachers or mentors along the way in any of these schools?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I remember a few names.  Again, I was never anywhere even long enough to get attached to a teacher to find out who would be a favorite.  You know, like I said, coming up from the Bronx [New York], I mean I'm moving to the Bronx [sic. Queens, New York] starting P.S. 154, didn't graduate from there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and go to P.S. 143 [Louis Armstrong School, Queens, New York].  I only spent one year.  How can I meet new friends--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and graduated.  Then I went to P.S. 16 [P.S. 16 the Nancy DeBenedittis School, Queens, New York], was there, what, a few months.  And then next thing you know, I'm at E.O. Smith [E.O. Smith Junior High School] in Houston [Texas] for a year.  And so and so, leave out of Houston into Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and then here I wind up in Chicago [Illinois], eighth grade in a Catholic school [Holy Trinity School].  So there was no time for me to bond anywhere.  I start high school.  Now, if I had gone to Crane [Crane Technical High School; Richard T. Crane Medical Prep High School, Chicago, Illinois], I might have known more kids from the neighborhood there, but I still wouldn't have known enough.  And so then, where do I wind up?  At Farragut [Farragut High School; Farragut Career Academy, Chicago, Illinois] where nobody went to no school, even in the area that I lived in.  So two years I had to spend there.  How long does it take to bond?  Before bonding started, I'm out of there.  So now, I wind up a stranger in 1963 year at Hirsch [Hirsch High School; Emil G. Hirsch Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois].  So (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, did you have a favorite subject at school at all with all that movement?
Speaker 2: Gym (laughter).  No, there was no favorite subject whatsoever.
Story_ID: 544520
Speaker 1: Now, this is crucial to what you do now, did you like music in those days?  What kind of music did you like?  And was that a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that wasn't why I started a music store [George's Music Room, Chicago, Illinois].  I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I'm just--
Speaker 2: It was a job.  But music, that was, you know, what entertainment did you have?  And, see, kids, we played outside.  See, the grownups pay attention to the music.  I mean, you know, if you were influenced by music, it's what you heard and your parents play and what have you.  We, man, we, you know, when it was warm or whatever, we--you were in the streets.  They had, I mean if you were in the Bronx [New York] or what have you, like in Queens [New York], we had playgrounds, I mean big playgrounds with fields.  We'd play stickball, baseball.  You had Little Leagues.  You had a lot of things to keep us, you know, involved.  Music was not a big, important part (background noise) of, like the kids of today is, because of all the other things that drive them.  No, we--it was always groups of guys.  You figured out something to do.  You made up your games and what have you.  You rode bicycles like, man, you know, you went into the swamps.
Story_ID: 544521
Speaker 1: It was a--it, it reminded, again, of a time--on my hand here, I have these three stitch marks, when I've told you the story of going to P.S. 143 [Louis Armstrong School, Queens, New York] and the white kids went the other way.  But we used to meet in the middle in the swamps and go catch tadpoles together.  And one day, I must have been maybe seven (background noise).  I fell and cut my finger, and we were closer to my friend's house.  So we're holding my hand, and I'm bleeding like a banshee.  We ran into his back door (background noise).  See, we lived in apartment buildings.  They had homes, right, attached homes.  And he screamed, "Ma, mama, come here, come here."  She runs downstairs.  "Get that nigger outta here."  And I turned around and jumped, 'cause I thought we let something in the house.  I didn't know what a nigger was.  Just to show you how in the black families, we didn't use that word.  But she did.  And I, I thought she was mad because we let a nigger in.  And so my, my friend knew.  So he said, "Well, Danny [HistoryMaker George Daniels], you have to run home."  I still--and, you know something?  It didn't strike me until I was maybe sixteen, seventeen years old, that, wow, because I had forgotten this, 'cause I remember my sister [Maxine Newsome Boyd] taking me to Jamaica Hospital [Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, Queens, New York] to get my hand stitched up.  But, so, that was the first time, unknowingly, I experienced being discriminated against because of my color.  And I was seven years old, but never realizing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually, worse than that, you're insulted and everything.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, you know, because, you know, what could a seven year old kid think of it. But again, so experiences, I just wanted, you know, wanted to give that to you, how the social environment dictated where you went.  What you heard was, you know, it wasn't like today, get a good education and get a good job.  You know, you got--you get your education so you can make a living.
Story_ID: 544522
Speaker 1: When you were at Hirsch [Hirsch High School; Emil G. Hirsch Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois], now, you were at Hirsch for two years, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Did you participate in, in--
Speaker 2: I was in the band.  I played trumpet.
Speaker 1: Oh, you played trumpet, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I played that, and that happened 'cause the original Regal [Regal Theater, Chicago, Illinois] on 47th [Street] and King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive] which was South Parkway in those days, my father [George Daniels, Sr.] lived in a, like a rooming house in, on 45th [Street] and King Drive 'cause I used to, 'cause I was still living with my brother [Max Newsome, Jr.] when my father eventually moved to Chicago [Illinois].  And I used to go to the South Side from over on Ogden Avenue to see him on the weekends and what have you--Saturday, spend the day with him and what have you, do chores for him, go to laundry for him and so on and so forth.  And then one day he says, "You--I wanna send you over to the Regal."  He sent me to see Maynard Ferguson and Miles Davis on the same show.  I had to be twelve, thirteen.  Had I started--yeah, I had started high school, yeah, had to be twelve, thirteen, maybe fourteen 'cause I was going to Farragut [Farragut High School; Farragut Career Academy, Chicago, Illinois] then.
Speaker 1: Now, was that your first time at the Regal?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we lived right down the street from it 'cause time you got older, then you went to the stage shows and stuff, but I go in there, and I come out of that place, I wanted to play trumpet in the worst damn way.  But my father wanted to influence you with the music, and what does he buy me, two saxophones.  He had a alto and a tenor.  I didn't wanna have nothing to do with a saxophone.  He wanted me to play it because he knew my mother [Elvina Guillory Daniels] liked saxophone music.  And so even over the years, but they divorced and stuff, he used to always loved to--but under any event, I wound up playing the trumpet.  And I used to take--see, when you were in the band at Farragut High School--I guess Mr. Ackermann [Marcel Ackermann], he--not the greatest influence, he was the one I remembered the most because we had more interaction with him because being the band instructor and you had to take private lessons.  So my family had to be able to afford, I think maybe three or five dollars a week.  I had to go downtown to the Chicago School of Music [Chicago, Illinois].  It was in the Fine Arts Building which is still there on, on Michigan Avenue right next to the Fine Arts Theater [Chicago, Illinois].  That's where I used to take trumpet lessons.  And I remember the band room because Farragut High School never lost a state competition.  They had won--Mr. Ackermann's plaques circled the whole room.  And so in order to really be, you had to get to that concert band.  You know, you had your beginning band, beginner's and so and so.  So that was things that created incentives in me as far as taking on a challenge.  Once I left Farragut, of course, and wound up at Hirsch because of the disciplines in the different schools that--at Hirsch you didn't have to take private lessons so right away, soon as I walked in there, I became the first trumpet in the concert band at Hirsch.  So, it was pretty cool.  And 'cause I never would have made (laughter) first trumpet at Farragut (laughter).  The standards were too high with Mr. Ackermann.  So, but that was my encounter with music, as far as playing it.
Story_ID: 544523
Speaker 1: Did your counselors advise you on what occupation you ought to pursue or did you have an idea of what you wanted to be after you graduated?
Speaker 2: No, no, we didn't have no--if you had counselors, I don't recall them being that encouraging (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, was Hirsch all black when you were over there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: 'Cause that'd been like--okay, yeah, Hirsch High School [Emil G. Hirsch Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, did you--did you have any idea what you wanted to do when you graduated?
Speaker 2: No, but what I wanted to do, because when I graduated, this was literally at the beginning of the Vietnam War.  I knew I didn't wanna go there, you know.  So in order to keep from getting drafted, you had to enroll in college.  So I enrolled in Loop Junior College--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which is now Harold Washington [Harold Washington College, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Now, what did you take at Loop?
Speaker 2: Business, like everybody else did (laughter).  You know, nobody really knew what they wanted.  I mean I had influences of my brother [Max Newsome, Jr.], but the difficult thing for me, again, I had no one image of one style thing to bond with, let alone like talk about the friends.  So you have to stay some place long enough so you--you know, with me, you'd wind up being the jack of all trades, the master of none because you stuck your hands in so many different things, but you were able to make a living at whatever it was.
Story_ID: 544524
Speaker 1: And, again, I owe that to my father because other little jobs that he saw that I'd have, and it usually was in the restaurant field.  I'm surprised I don't have a restaurant now.  But I was, I was a dishwasher and busboy.  I used to be a busboy at a restaurant called the Apple Basket [ph.] downtown at Jackson [Boulevard] and Wells [Street].  I was twelve, Dad had them thinking I was fourteen.  And then I used to go--in those days, it was--I didn't realize it, but my father demanded and expected me to go to work in a suit, shirt and tie.  He always made sure that I was always dressed well.   And I'll leave the house--unh-uh, you never walk out the door unless you're presentable, period.  That's still to today.
Speaker 2: So did you go to school like--you didn't go to school like that, did you?
Speaker 1: No, but I went to work like that.
Speaker 2: But when you went to work, okay.
Speaker 1: I had to go there and because I didn't realize, but the wisdom of my dad: who is gonna mess with a kid in a suit and shirt and tie waiting for a CTA [Chicago Transit Authority] bus, 5400 West on Division [Street] in those days?  You know, we wasn't nowhere near that far west.  But I used to work at the White Autumn Restaurant [White Autumn Restaurant and Lounge, Chicago, Illinois].  My father was the executive chef there.  And he got me a job there.  Then he wound up working at a restaurant called Charlotte's, which is at Parkside [Avenue] and Chicago [Avenue]--the building is still there.  It's become a hardware store, and so over the years, but that was Charlotte's Restaurant [Chicago, Illinois].  And that's one of the stories my dad, he taught me a lesson--well, it taught him a lesson, and he told me the story of how dependent they were on my dad.  And--'cause my father worked some crazy hours, but he was a hell of a chef 'cause these were fine dining establishments.  And so they, they came--the owners came in and said, "Look, Mr. Daniels, let's--," or George [George Daniels, Sr.], as they would call him, "you know, you're working so hard and what have you, but we gotta have somebody re- you know, in case you get ill or you gotta go somewhere, so we need you to train somebody."  So they brought in a white chef (laughter), a white guy.  My father trained him very well, and a whole lot of things.  Maybe in two or three months, they didn't need my dad no more. (Background noise) The lesson is, don't teach nobody your shit (laughter), excuse my French, but, yeah, don't teach them.  So the other experiences, there was a time that some people tried to do it again at another restaurant that he worked at.  And he trained this guy.  He trained him to screw up.  And so they--sure enough, they tried to pull the same thing on my dad.  "Well, look, why don't you just take some time off, you know, you been working so hard.  So and So can cover for you."  My dad said, "Okay."
Speaker 2: Okay, now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) My dad went home, sat by the phone.  The phone rang (laughter).  He was right back there (laughter) 'cause this dude messed up the kitchen.  Anyway, yeah.
Story_ID: 544525
Speaker 1: Now when did you like start working for Chess Records?  You were like a janitor at Chess, right, at some point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I used to clean up the studios and stuff.  I started there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How old were you then when you--or how long after high school [Hirsch High School; Emil G. Hirsch Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I was about seventeen.  It was not that long after high school.  My first job out of high school, I worked at Montgomery Ward.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That last--actually, that was a seasonal thing.  So that was like, I would say the fall of '64 [1964] through Christmas.  I remember I tried, I, I really applied at U.S. Steel [United States Steel Corporation], the South Works [Chicago, Illinois], and I went there.  And I went through the physical and what have you because all of the--a lot of my friends were going, they paid the most money, you know.  And I, I didn't weigh enough.  So they couldn't hire me.  I was so disappointed.  And so, as you know, I go to Montgomery Ward.  I went to, you know, the employment things, and got a job at Montgomery Ward working on the conveyor belt.  When I pass that building now, I remember where my window was, used to look at the Chicago River.  And then, you know, we'd go through--and I was good worker, and my supervisor, he was gonna try to keep me on, you know, because when they lay off after Christmas, but I didn't make the cut.  So I had to go 'cause I was a working fool.  I'll tell you, I really always trained to do it and do it well.  And so then, I went home and try to figure out what to do, living with my dad [George Daniels, Sr.] over on Michigan Avenue.  And then this--I said, hell, I'm a try to, I'm a try the steel mill again.  I hadn't gotten any bigger.  Hell, it hadn't even been a year.  And so I'm getting ready to get up.  I'm a go to bed and that night we had one of the worst snowstorms.  I forget what year.  That had to be '64 [1964], '65 [1965] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was that the--
Speaker 2: --not the '67 [1967] one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it had to be '65 [1965], yeah, at the beginning of sixty--January, it had to be January '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a hell of a storm, but I was so determined that I made it, because you had to go on--we lived on Michigan.  I used to take the "L" [elevated train] to 63rd Street and get off at--'cause you used to have to catch the South Chicago [Avenue] bus at 63rd and King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive], which was South Parkway then.  And it would take you--'cause it was like a turnaround there next to that theater that used to be there.  What was the name of that theater [Tivoli Theater, Chicago, Illinois]?  Actually, that's--I forget the name of that.  No, was it--yeah, there was a theater there at 63rd and Cottage [Cottage Grove Avenue].  But under any event, it was a turnaround area, and the buses come turn, and you take it right there, and it'll take you right to 91st [Street] and Commercial [Avenue].  Then we have to walk to the gate, and so I'm so determined, I get up, and I make it.  And this is the worst storm, oh, god, it was a straight blizzard.  And I get to the employment office because normally, the employment offices have a line that runs--walked in there.  The work--people there, I was the only person that showed up.  The people looked at me like I was crazy.  And so they gave me the application.  I filled it out.  And I went through the physical again, and I was still underweight.  So I came back to the guy that first interviewed me.  He said, "I'm gonna, I'm gonna ask, I'm a ask--." He said, "You really want to work, man."  He said, "You must--to come out in this weather."  He said, "You want a job."  I said, "Yes."  He said, "Well, I'm a hire you."  And it's because of that storm, I got that job 'cause I was the only one that showed up in the employment office that day.  And I was making good money then.  And then living at home with dad and so on and so forth.
Story_ID: 544526
Speaker 1: Then I met a young lady at a party.  Actually, my friend had met her once before or something, and he--we were supposed to meet her at this party, and then he didn't show up.  And we started talking and she needed a date--she had a little group of girls, and they were having a party, and she asked me would I be her date to go to the party?  And I said, sure, I did it.  And so me and her started being boyfriend and girlfriend, and so on.  She had--she was still at Hyde Park High School [Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  And she had like one more year to go.  She was coming out in '65 [1965].  I'm working at the steel mill [South Works, Chicago, Illinois] and so on and so forth, and didn't have a car or everything, had to take the bus.  And she would get out of school on my days off from the steel mill, I'd meet her.  And we would take the "L" [elevated train] to Chess Records.  She was a receptionist, and she sang background at Chess, and she sang with a girls group called The Gems, G-E-M-S.  They had one minor success with a 45 [45 rpm record], never did do an album.  And I'd hang out in there so much, I wound up getting fired by the steel mill, missing work, standing around in there, and then Minnie's [Minnie Riperton] manager who managed on everybody down there, and he owned Chevis Publishing [Chevis Publishing Corporation].  He was one of the few black folks that knew what publishing was, which I found out later, because I wouldn't have known what it was as a kid, I'm like all of seventeen years old.
Speaker 2: Now, what's his name again?
Speaker 1: Billy Davis.
Speaker 2: Billy Davis, okay.
Speaker 1: Billy Roquel Davis.  Billy, he died about two years ago up in New York [New York], but he was one of my idols.  Oh, did I, did I wanna be like Billy.  And so one day I was sitting around the studio, and then he, he came down, and he said, "Why aren't you working?" I said, "I don't have a job."  So he went and he said, he gave me the broom.  He said, "Okay, start cleaning the studios.  You not gonna be around here and not working."  And so me and this young lady became quite close, so on and so forth.  And we wound up living together, and one evening we got home--we was actually--Billy had to sign for us to get this apartment because the young lady she eventually graduated high school in '65 [1965].  That year we wound up living together, and she was living like a Cinderella life at home.
Story_ID: 544527
Speaker 1: And so we wound up living together. And one evening we were at home and the phone rang, and it was Billy [Billy Davis].  Now, mind you, I used to see Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, John Lee Hooker, Etta James, The Dells, [HistoryMaker] Ramsey Lewis, all of them record.  I was just a little kid, but never knowing that I would be, at that time, part of such history, that the Chess brothers [Leonard Chess and Phil Chess], they also owned WVON [WVON Radio, Chicago, Illinois].  They also owned the first radio station to hire all female disc jockeys, WXFM [WXFM Radio, Mount Zion, Illinois], smack dab in the middle, W--yeah, WXFM, smack dab in the middle.  And there was only one male on there, and it was Yvonne Daniels and Sid McCoy.  They would do a show together.  I think it was at midnight.  But under any event, it was owned by the Chess brothers, and then, you know, under the employment at WVON, the list goes on from [HistoryMaker] Herb Kent to [HistoryMaker] Lucky Cordell and E. Rodney Jones, [HistoryMaker] Pervis Spann, Isabel Joseph Johnson, Bernadine C. Washington, Ed Cooke [Edward B. Cook], [HistoryMaker] Wesley South, Joe Cobb, Butterball--Bill "Butterball" Crane.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Trying to remember them all, but, yeah, those were my influences.
Speaker 2: They, but they were--they had been on the radio for a while, hadn't they?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, well, it was WVON.  I mean--
Speaker 2: VON was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) because the only--see, you had, WLS [WLS Radio, Chicago, Illinois], the white folks listened to, to hear their pop music.  WVON is what black folks listened to.  It was a AM, one thousand watts, but one of the most powerful radio stations in America.  And that was the Voice of the Negro.  That's what WVON stood for, the call letters, but it was truly that, the voice of the black community.  Those are our friends.  We got up to get dressed in the morning to go to school listening to, to them in the mornings, you know, their gospel, when you got up early.  So you heard all of our music on a single station, like, that does not exist today, and it's a shame.  That's one of the biggest things that I--when I leave here that I'll be disappointed in if I can't bring a change about, with that in some small way.  But it has really done damage to us as a people, not being able to experience our cultural music all day long so our children will have understanding and recognize there're more choices than rap and hip hop.
Story_ID: 544528
Speaker 1: People have discussed--you mentioned that before, but today with the proliferation of cable TV and so many (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Has nothing to do with it. Has nothing to do with it.
Speaker 1: --choices.
Speaker 2: Where's the blues?  Where's gospel?  Where is the true jazz, not this smooth jazz crap?  Where's, where's Jimmy Smith asked for (unclear)?  When the last time you turned the station and heard Jack McDuff, Charles Earland--
Speaker 1: And you don't get it on a radio station, but--
Speaker 2: But we used to.  This is what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so our kids, if they don't have cable, if they're not--if all they hear, you know, on one station, if you--GCI [WGCI Radio, Chicago, Illinois] is your number one station, you know, God bless the station.  You know, they're doing what they're supposed to do.  But they're supposed to be serving a particular community.  But now, it's become corporate radio so now it's all homogenized.  But that's not what the purpose of it was in the first place.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so what we have now is marketed, manufactured music.  We don't hear talent (background noise) anymore.  There's no talent out here.  You know, what you hear is beats.  You hear catchy lyrics and a good hook.  But where's the story?  Music, you know, musicians were the minstrels.  They're the--that's--of our time.  I mean we've gone through 9/11 [September 11, 2001] and all these other things.  Where is the music?  Where are the young people with the stories?  You know, where is the 'Ball of Confusion' at?  Where's 'What's Going On' at?  You know, I mean, but if you took the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] music right now and just snatched it up and moved it all the way into 2007, it'll fit like a glove.  Remember the Civil Rights Movement, voting rights--well, you know, America's apartheid, and we had the Vietnam War.  Now, today, we have this Iraqi war [Iraq War] and all the threats that are going on around the world, and we have the immigration.  Same difference, but where's the music?
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, I agree with you.  I just was saying with all the--for instance when I grew up, we had three TV stations in Dayton [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: If the Republican--if the convention was on or the Democratic convention, if you were gonna watch TV, you gonna to have to see it.
Speaker 2: You gonna watch that.  Yeah, what you're saying (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) If 'CBS Reports' was on--
Speaker 2: --is that, you're just saying a lot of choices.  I agree with you.
Speaker 1: When the news came on, the whole family were watching news.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, you can--it's so many choices--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --kids watch cartoons twenty-four hours a day if they want to--
Speaker 2: Well, again--
Speaker 1: --you know, unless somebody change the station.
Speaker 2: --who, who causes that to happen.  It's the greed.  I mean--
Speaker 1: It's the market, the greed and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's just the market, it's--
Speaker 1: It's also FCC [Federal Communications Commission]--
Speaker 2: --it's Corporate America at its best.
Speaker 1: Yeah, regulations.  They deregulated all that stuff so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, then--and you know who did that?
Speaker 1: They don't have to serve everybody.
Speaker 2: Well, you know who did that though, don't you?
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Michael Powell (laughter).
Speaker 2: Him and when his, his dad said look--Colin [HistoryMaker General Colin L. Powell] would say, "Look, I'm getting outta here."  He called his son, and said, "Look, pack your bags, we getting out of D.C. [Washington, D.C.]  This fool done made me look like a idiot.  I gave the speech and I helped created this damn war."  And then when you trace back and see what Colin's son did, Michael, in allowing this crap to happen, he destroyed radio.  There's no choices because of corporate radio.  There was a time you can get in your car, and you'd ride from New York to Texas, and you would hear from country western, every--I mean all genres of music.  Before Clear Channel [Clear Channel Communications, Inc.], the label Malaco [Malaco Records], Johnnie Taylor, Denise LaSalle, all of those--Z.Z. Hill, and all of those different musicians were on the record charts.  They don't play that music anymore.  But it still exists.  We go to a blues concert.  Who's in the audience?  Yeah, I blame it on the system that has programmed our children--if you know--recently, they showed a thing on--a little special.  It was a news special, a little five sound byte on this new thing, this new program on the Internet for kids, three to five years old, where they have to, they play this game, and they win points.  And when they get enough points, they can trade the points in for this doll that their parents have to take them to this store to get, when they pick out whichever doll, there's a tag on there with a code for them to enter into, on, on that--
Story_ID: 544529
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were just talking about the difference between now and the day--in terms of the media, and, but you like hit upon some things that we hadn't discussed before about your father's [George Daniels, Sr.] relationship to a lot of the big name stars.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the restaurant--my dad's most popular restaurant back in New York [New York] was Daniels Restaurant.  This one, well, all of them were Daniels, but this one was at, on 7th Avenue, which is Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard] now, between 123rd [Street] and 124th Street.  Now, it's an apartment complex there now.  But next door, Sugar Ray Robinson had the Sugar--Sugar Ray's playboy lounge.  Then he had the Playboy Barber Shop [sic. Golden Gloves Barber Shop, New York, New York] in the same block.  And that restaurant that my dad had there was one of his most popular of the, the group of stores they had.  And he had like live birds and tropical plants.  It was a jazzy place.  And the likes of Miles Davis, Oscar Peterson, all them New York musicians, they would eat there.  They'd bring their five, ten dollar royalty checks or either dad would give them credit because they played at, you know, the Club Baron [New York, New York] or Lenox Lounge [New York, New York], oh, I can't remember the name of it 'cause I remember dad talking about these places and the type of music that my father listened to was jazz.  So I remember that when it comes to my musical influences, but these were the places that the musicians got their exposure, learned how to entertain.  And it was part of the culture of who we were, knowing you were--again, making comparisons to today, (makes sound).
Story_ID: 544530
Speaker 1: Okay so in those days, you're talking about live--well, the disc jockeys all were people that lived in the community.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: They had shows, and they would--now, they would--would they hold, they would hold like record hops and things too, right, in those days, wouldn't they?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: When you came out, it was '64 [1964]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], where [HistoryMaker] Herb Kent used to deejay.  We used to go to the Packinghouse [United Packinghouse Workers Union] on 48th [Street] and Wabash [Street].  And I remember [HistoryMaker] Richard Pegue used to carry his albums.  That was Herb's--used to mentor Richard, Herb Kent did.  And so, you know, you have parties like that.  Back in the day, you'd go downtown to the Sherman House [Chicago, Illinois] and different hotels.  They had a lot of hotel party, usually a lot of fights at these parties, but I mean just fights.  It wasn't no gunplay, but, you know, but that's--we used to experience downtown Chicago [Illinois].  And if you know as far as the entertainment side, eventually, well, what had happened, you know, we fast forward all the way to, say '68 [1968], for a minute, when the riots hit and it destroyed the inner city America and here in Chicago, a lot of the commercial--like the theaters on the South Side and so on and so forth, all kind of closed down.  The neighborhoods had burnt down, so the only places really to shop was downtown.  The only place to go for entertainment was downtown.  We had no more movies.  If they were weren't affected by the riots, they just shut them down.  And so, in downtown Chicago, you have the Chicago Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] which is still there, basically the only one.  Across the street, where ABC-TV, that used to be the State Lake Theater.  Then you go around the corner, the Oriental [Oriental Theatre, Chicago, Illinois] was there, but it used to be Oriental Theatre.  Then you had the United Artists [United Artists Theatre, Chicago, Illinois] on the corner of Dearborn [Street]--no Clark [Street], not Clark--no, that's Dearborn, on the corner of Dearborn and Randolph [Street].  That was on the southeast corner, and then on the northwest corner was the Woods Theatre [Chicago, Illinois].  That used to be the Bismarck [Bismarck Theatre], I think, yeah, where the Cadillac Theatre [Cadillac Palace Theatre, Chicago, Illinois] is now.  And then, you know, you have the, where they do the plays, the Goodman [Goodman Theatre, Chicago, Illinois].  I remember that was always there.  And you had the McVickers [McVickers Theater, Chicago, Illinois] which was, I think, maybe on Adams [Street], something like that, right off of State Street.  But those were the theaters downtown.  Then you had the penny arcades, you know, where, right at, where the Harold Washington [Harold Washington Library, Chicago, Illinois] is.  There used to be burlesque, there was a burlesque house there.  I remember that as a kid, but so we would come downtown to go to the movies.  At the same time, there's a timeframe in there where they were building these shopping plazas and malls and putting the multiscreen theaters in, but there was such a dry period in between.  And downtown Chicago became a dangerous place, you know, because a lot of people were out of work, underprivileged and the whole--some of them, but the entertainment was downtown.  It wasn't no more, you know, 47th Street wasn't popular like back in the day and 63rd Street.  All that burned.  See, the entertainment districts started disappearing in the black community.  And so we were downtown, the teenagers and everybody else would be, hang downtown.  And so the balance in the movies, and then you had the blaxploitation movies that came out.  And they were coming out downtown, you know, 'Super Fly' and so on and so forth and Pam Grier.  And so we'd come downtown to see these movies in droves.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so they had to figure out, no, you know, the tourist because North Michigan Avenue wasn't happening, and the Magnificent Mile wasn't even thought of during that time.  And so the finer hotels were on State Street, the Palmer House [Palmer House Hotel; Palmer House Hilton, Chicago, Illinois] and so on and so forth.  You had the Conrad Hilton [Conrad Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] on Michigan Avenue there.
Story_ID: 544531
Speaker 1: The Congress [Congress Plaza Hotel, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, do you remember these as they became integrated 'cause there was a time, I guess--I don't know if you're old--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, no, no.  I remember--when what became integrated?
Speaker 2: Old enough to--the hotels and things down there.
Speaker 1: Well, I re- you could go to those hotels then, but, you know, we talking about--I'm talking about the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Yeah, '60s [1960s], but--
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, oh, yeah, I went (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, you weren't here until like '63 [1963], '64 [1964]?
Speaker 1: I came to Chicago [Illinois] in '59 [1959].
Speaker 2: Fifty-nine [1959]?
Speaker 1: But, when I was a kid, so--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I knew about segregation and all that stuff.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And how, you know, black folks were separated here in Chicago.  But that whole era there, you know, because you can go back to the Pullman days as far as that's concerned, you know, when, when all the Pullman [Pullman porters]--that's why, you know, with my name being George [HistoryMaker George Daniels], that's what they would call all Pullman guys 'cause they didn't, they didn't care to remember the name of the individuals.  But under any event, yeah.  But, so, anyway, that's where the entertainment district was for black kids in those days, was downtown.  We used to go to Tad's steakhouse [sic. Tad's Steaks] and get a $1.99 steak and stuff, and you--
Speaker 2: Now, this is after '68 [1968].  You're talking about '69 [1969] and so forth, just about the time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm talking in that same era.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: I'm talking in '68 [1968], yeah, I'm talking the same time--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --because I was going to Loop Junior College [Harold Washington College, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: Right, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)See, so you come up through the time and the riots hit in '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But before the, you know, you're talking in between '68 [1968], '69 [1969], you know.  There was that window in there where the only place for young people to get entertainment was downtown.  And then they slowly start closing the theaters for no apparent reason.
Speaker 2: Well, let's talk about the riots for a second.  Now, the riot occurred after the, after Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, it was in, April, April 4th or something.
Speaker 2: That's right, April 4th.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-eight [1968].
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-eight [1968].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Do you remember where you were?
Speaker 1: No.  I really don't.  I remember, I guess, being at home watching it on television.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, you were living on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] then, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Actually, I, yeah, I wonder if it's (unclear) South Shore [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --'cause at one point when me and this young lady, we broke up, I wound up getting a one room joint at 4935 on Michigan [Avenue].  And I was working in the restaurant because, you know, another little period of time, my dad [George Daniels, Sr.] opened up a restaurant on 47th Street.  So I eventually wound working there with him.
Speaker 2: Okay, most of the destruction, I mean the big part of the destruction was on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] of the riots, if I recall, right--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --correctly, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the majority of damage done by (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There were blocks in Lawndale [North Lawndale, Chicago, Illinois] burned up.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, well, right here, yeah, the area that we're in.  Many of these vacant lots are still products of that.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  So--
Speaker 1: Because it went on for a couple of more years, you know, the anniversary, you know, with the tanks coming onto the street because the armory [Madison Street Armory] used to be on Madison Street.
Story_ID: 544532
Speaker 1: So I remember that because at one point, once I wound up getting involved in the music business, I wound up running a store at 2935 on Madison [Street].  It was called One Stop Records [Ernie's One Stop Records, Chicago, Illinois].  It was a wholesale place.
Speaker 2: Let's go through all that.  Now, you--you told us about your beginning at Chess Records.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And you, you were given a janitorial job.  You were going with one of the secretaries and she was a singer.  And, so, but, now, tell us about Ernie Lanier.
Speaker 1: Ernie Leaner.
Speaker 2: Leaner, okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, Ernie was a mentor of mine.  I used to--one of the jobs I had for a short stint, I worked for a little, small company called Marlow Machine Center [ph.].  I used to, I used to fix--I was taught how to fix, you know, calculators and typewriters and, you know, clean and maintain them and the electronic stencil maker.  In those days, it was called a Gestetner and mimeograph machines and all that stuff.  And so United Records who--which Ernie Leaner owned, Ernie and his brother, George [George Leaner], you know, owned, was at, about 1835 on Michigan Avenue.  And I used to go down there and service the machines and got to know them.  And then his son became a real good friend of mine, his younger son.  So we used to pal around.  And Ernie Leaner with United Records, they, they were part of that whole strip on Michigan Avenue called Record Row from 12th Street to 26th Street.  He had--
Speaker 2: And that's like Chess (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Chess Records, Decca Records--
Speaker 2: Alligator [Alligator Records], Decca, okay.
Speaker 1: Scepter Records--Alligator was never down there.
Speaker 2: Never there, okay.
Speaker 1: Unh-uh, that's--Alligator came years later.
Speaker 2: So, Decca--
Speaker 1: Decca, Scepter--
Speaker 2: Scepter.
Speaker 1: It was One-derful! Records, a bunch of independent labels.  Atlantic [Atlantic Records] had a office down there.  Brunswick Records was down there.  I mean there was an assortment of studios all up and down the street.
Speaker 2: Now, this is on Michigan Avenue, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, between 12th Street and 26th Street.  It was all kinds of music related industry, if you will, recorded music related industry, all up and down there because, you know, even before that, that used to be known as automobile row [Motor Row] back in the '20s [1920s] or so, but, again, that's, that's how important that street was.  And so Ernie was there, and that's how I first wound up being involved with Ernie.  Once I left that, that place, with all the machines (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What did you learn from Ernie?
Speaker 1: Oh, well, Ernie exposed me to the big picture of the music industry.  Ernie belonged to white trade organizations, like, which I belong to now, an organization called NARM, National Association of Recording Merchandisers [Music Business Association].  This is, still exists today.  As a matter of fact, their convention will be starting this Sunday, the first time in Chicago [Illinois], since they first started in 1959. And so, but Ernie was taking me there, see, 'cause when I started my store [George's Music Room, Chicago, Illinois]--we're talking 1969, 1970, and, you know--
Story_ID: 544533
Speaker 1: I wanna get you before--to the stage where you lead up to where you actually start a store [George's Music Room, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Oh, then--
Speaker 1: I don't wanna jump too (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Then, well, I, see, I knew Ernie [Ernie Leaner] before the store.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, that's what I'm talking, yeah--
Speaker 2: That's how I knew him, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right--
Speaker 2: --then I was working for--once I left that machine center place, I wound up, you know, working for my dad [George Daniels, Sr.] for just a short while in the restaurant.  And we kind of fell out.  And so I was riding down Michigan Avenue one day, and I stopped at one of the record wholesale places 'cause the guy that used to own Marlow Machine Center [ph.], now worked for One Stop Records [Ernie's One Stop Records, Chicago, Illinois], which is a wholesale music distributor.  And it was like on a Saturday.  He was working.  I saw his car, went in there and talked to him a few minutes.  And his name was Lorenzo Marvel, and Mr. Marvel, he said, "Look, you get here Monday."  I said, "For what?"  He said, "To go to work, you gotta work."  And that's how I wound up being involved in the recorded side of the music industry.
Speaker 1: Okay, Lorenzo Marvel.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: M-A-R-V-E-L?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did you do at One Stop (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, they taught me how to pull orders, take orders over the phone because you're talking about 45s [45 rpm record], albums and eight tracks.  That's what music came on in those days.
Story_ID: 544534
Speaker 1: And there were record stores everywhere.  Now, you had TV repair and record stores.  You had a cleaners with fifty nails with records on it.  You know, you had--as they called, the mom and pop stores, but they was mostly variety stores with records.  There were a few full fledge, like Met Music [Met Music Shop, Chicago, Illinois] that used to be on 59th Street, down in the basement, I think it was.  That was, you know, full fledged music stores and that's all they devoted to there.  You had Ralph's Records [ph.] on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] here.  You had Barney's One Stop [Barney's One Stop and Record Shop, Chicago, Illinois] down the street from here.  You have Fletcher's One Stop on 75th Street [Chicago, Illinois] which is still there.  But there, Eddie Carter [Edward Carter], he had started Metro Music back in the day.  So you have, what, what I'm telling you all of this is that, the music industry was so vital here in Chicago [Illinois], but it was vital everywhere because of the--recorded music literally got 90 percent of the entertainment dollar 'cause other than that, you go to the movies, you go to a lounge, you have a house party.  In order to have a house party, you have to have music.  See, so it wasn't all the different things like you have today.  So music played such a role in the black community, and the fact that you could not go--Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] had a music department in those days.  Goldblatts had a record department.  Woolworths [F.W. Woolworth Company], the five and ten cents stores had a record department.  But they had Pat Boone and 'Mickey Mouse' and all that other stuff there.  And they had their music there.  Now, black music was sold in black stores.  And, see, that leads up to a whole 'nother story on how, you know, who stole the soul.
Speaker 2: Now, let me just run this by you.  I--you know, I think traditionally, correct me if I'm wrong, that before VON [WVON Radio, Chicago, Illinois], if black folks wanted to know what the latest record was, they'd go to a record store and listen to it, right?
Speaker 1: That's it.  They, they had booths.  We used to go--and this is before they shrink wrapped vinyl.  And you used to go in the booth and listen to the music, yeah.  That's right.
Speaker 2: And if somebody found (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was pre-sampled.  That's, you wasn't sampling.  And you had a chance to listen to the whole darn thing.
Speaker 2: So if you got a good record, how would the other people find out about it?
Speaker 1: Word of mouth at a party.  I mean, you know, radio played a particular role, but more music that--you know, you created a relationship with, you know, your--the record store owner.  You know, you walk in there and say, "Hey, Bob, man, I, look I got this thing that came in the other day."  This is why I still have the tradition of keeping music playing in the store [George's Music Room, Chicago, Illinois] all time because of the need to sell music because with the limited airplay that our music gets today, how does new music get discovered.  You know, there's only twenty records.  When I started my store, the average playlist from a radio station was forty-five to sixty-five records in the run of a day.  So--and then you heard all genres of music.  And, again, this gives people choices and options and young people, you know, that they don't get today.  You know, everybody's stuck in one mode, one genre of music on a mass scale, and it's really disheartening, the way the music industry has changed, the way, you know, where are the Aretha Franklins, where are the Marvin Gayes, where are The Temptations?  Not saying to go back in those times, but I said that to say that when we had the 45s [45 rpm record], if the record went halfway around, you knew it was a Marvin Gaye.  I don't care how many songs he made.  You knew it was [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson, you knew Billy Stewart, you know Etta James.  Everybody had a signature sound, and then the industry respected one another because you didn't try to put a record out that sounded like Marvin Gaye.  You didn't do that.  Radio wouldn't play it in the first place.  Now, where is the variety?  Where is the signature sound?  Who has it?  They don't, they don't. It's the producers have a unique sound, and then when he does a record today, whether it's Usher or Omarion or Marques Houston or Mario, they all sound alike, Chris Brown.  Great for their careers, if you will, but for entertainment, no.  But they were marketed, they were manufactured.  There's--you know, where's the soul?
Story_ID: 544535
Speaker 1: Well, let me go back a minute and ask a question.  Now, this is a--this may seem like it's a dumb question, but was One Stop [Ernie's One Stop Records, Chicago, Illinois] like a franchise or something--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --that you could get--
Speaker 2: One, One Stop is the--
Speaker 1: Why were all the stores named One Stop? Fletcher's [Fletcher's One Stop, Chicago, Illinois], Barney's [Barney's One Stop and Record Shop, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Because they were wholesalers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then they were wholesale and retail.  In other words, in other words, you could--if I needed some music, I'd go to Barney's, and I'd buy from him wholesale.
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fletcher's and Gardner's [Gardner's One Stop Records and TV, Chicago, Illinois] and Joe's [Joe's Records, Chicago, Illinois], they were, they were wholesalers as well as retailers.
Speaker 1: So one stop is just a--
Speaker 2: That's, well, the term, well, the term one stop, see before the one stop, you used to have to go down on Michigan Avenue and you'd have to go to Capitol Records, you'd have to go to Warner Brothers [Warner Bros. Records, Inc.] or Atlantic [Atlantic Records] and, you know, and buy directly from each of them in order to put records in your store.  So if I'm not mistaken, and I think history will prove I'm right, but it was Barney [Willie J. Barney] that literally created the first one stop.  In 1950-something at Kedzie [Avenue] and Roosevelt [Road], Barney's father, that's Willie Barney, he, his father had a barbershop.  And in the barbershop, Willie started a little record counter, a little section in there where he sold 45s [45 rpm record].  And Mr. Barney, he used to cut the hair of a lot of the merchants, the black merchants, the few that were on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], and the people that had the cleaners and so on and so forth.  And so they'd be, they'd be in there getting their hair cut.  And these--this is the story that I was told that some of the guys said, "Hey, Little Barney, you know, where'd you get, you know, get the music from?"  And he'd tell them, "I have to go down to Michigan Avenue and go to these different places to pick up--," and they said, "Well, look, I can sell some of that stuff in my store.  Look, we'll give you--pick us up some and, you know, just add some, add a markup, a percentage on there for your, for your, you know, your time and effort and pick us some of how you do yours."  That's how he created the one stop--
Speaker 1: So it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because, in other words, it's a place that you can go and all the labels are there.  You can go to one place, make one stop, and I can get Motown Records, I can get Stax Records, I can get Atlantic Records, you see what I'm saying?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's the one stop.
Speaker 1: So they're not linked financially in any way.  It's just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, no.  You got them in--
Speaker 1: --a concept, it's just a concept.
Speaker 2: I buy from a one stop that's in North Carolina, South Carolina right.  And they're all over the country, but they're mostly white.  Now, Barney--I mean Fletcher is the last black owned one stop in America.  There is no other black one stop, but, you know, historically, there was one black one stop in Los Angeles [California], called John's One Stop.  There was one in St. Louis [Missouri], Ted Hudson [Ted Hudson, Sr.], Hudson Embassy [Hudson's Embassy Records, Tapes and Videos], and Ted Hudson who's recently passed, he's responsible, him, myself and a number of other music and radio and record people that got Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] to designate June as Black Music Month [African American Music Appreciation Month].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, and then you had a Simpson's Hotel [sic. Simpson's Record Shop] in Detroit [Michigan], and those were the only black one stops in America.  There were none on the East Coast, and in Chicago [Illinois], we had ten, black one stops and maybe three white one stops.

Speaker 1: Tell me about Dr. Max Newsome [Max Newsome, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's, that's my hero.  That's not only my brother, but I could say he was my father too.  He, he was my guardian.  When I came to Chicago [Illinois], he sent for me.  And as, as--like I said earlier, he was a student at University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Chicago School of Dentistry, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Oh, so this is your uncle, this is your--
Speaker 2: That's my brother.
Speaker 1: Your brother, you're right, okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, my brother by my mother [Elvina Guillory Daniels].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In her first marriage, who I was telling you about earlier.
Speaker 1: All right, so we--
Speaker 2: 'Cause it was Max, Maxine [Maxine Newsome Boyd] and Geraldine [ph.], my three siblings.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The way I had this note down here, it was like it was somebody else, but that's exactly, okay, now I got it.
Speaker 2: My brother who still practices dentistry today at 79th [Street] and Carpenter [Street].  And he practices a few days a week.  He doesn't--he refuses to retire, and he's been practicing since 1962.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He originally started his first practice over Walgreens [Walgreens Company] on 63rd [Street] and Cottage Grove [Cottage Grove Avenue], across the street from the Keys [ph.] and the Tivoli Theater [Chicago, Illinois] and back in those days.  So when 63rd Street was the entertainment district.
Story_ID: 544537
Speaker 1: By 1969, you're ready to start your own store?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And how did you--now, what made you take the leap?
Speaker 2: Well, working for the one stop, I got a chance to experience pulling orders, delivering orders, and I'd be in these stores.  And, you know, Fridays and Saturdays, record stores are packed.  And it would just usually be a husband and wife that operated it.  It was no major staff.  The, the stores that were largest were the TV repair shops that had repairmen in them and stuff, but there was a record section.  And usually the child or something of the owner would have the record department.  And it was just a section on the wall, and, you know, 45s [45 rpm record], a few albums because people bought more 45s than anything.  And so I got to understand the, the mechanics of how to run a record store, not the academics, but the mechanics (laughter).  And, and working for that one stop, like I said, he bought out a retail store that's down the street from where we are, and that was at 3937 on Roosevelt [Road].  I wound up running that store, not even quite a year, '68 [1968], '69 [1969], something like that because (background noise) in--he closed it down and I went and talked to him and convinced him to let me have the, to have this, could I have the store.  And I went to the landlord and convinced the landlord to give me three months' credit on the rent.  This was like in 1969, December--well, it was before December, but that--the day that I opened was December 12th.
Speaker 1: You said it had been owned, it was run by--
Speaker 2: It was bought out by the guy that I used to work for, the one stop records.
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: One stop records.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, but who was it?  Which one was it?  Not Barney [Willie J. Barney], right.  It was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was one called One Stop Records Incorporated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was on, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he didn't, see, 'cause you had Barney's [Barney's One Stop and Record Shop, Chicago, Illinois], you had Joe's [Joe's Records, Chicago, Illinois], you had Fletcher's [Fletcher's One Stop, Chicago, Illinois], you had Color Rights [ph.] so on and so forth.  And his was just One Stop Records.  He had, he had five one stops under the same name, and he had a twenty store chain called Moodsville Records.  His name was Jimmy Minnette.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, so, so what about a hundred dollars started--
Speaker 2: Yep, I went to Gardner's One Stop [Gardner's One Stop Records and TV, Chicago, Illinois] and bought six albums and a hundred 45s.  I talked the landlord into giving me ninety days credit on the rent, and I brought my record player from home.  That was--people said, "Well, what was your business plan?"  I planned to open a store.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a cash register in there and everything or--
Speaker 2: I had a shoebox to start off with.  But eventually, I was able to get a cash register and stuff.  It was a whole history of how I, I did it basically on cash flow.  You know, it's a thing where--of didn't have no credit.  Everything was COD [cash on delivery].  But it was just long hours, hard work.  I was the only employee the first three years, so.  When I look, it wasn't hard (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How long would you work?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: How long would you work?
Speaker 2: Sixteen, eighteen hours a day.  I mean I had nothing else to do.  You know, the one thing that I teach, not teach, but I let young people know, you know, youth, there's different ways you can use it.  And the advantages I had is the fact that I had no children.  I was young, you know, just turning twenty-one, twenty-two.  And I didn't have much money so I didn't have to worry about getting anybody pregnant 'cause you wasn't getting nothing if you didn't have no money (laughter).  You got to be able to date a girl or something.  But Richard Pryor said they wasn't getting no parts, you know, in them days.  And, so, you know, my baby was George's Music Room [Chicago, Illinois].  So I just stuck to it, and created a following, you know, 'cause there were record stores everywhere, but, you know, what was your service that, you know, that no one else did.  And I could kind of say I was probably one of the first record stores to use two turntables to keep the music going.  A matter of fact, I didn't even have a mixer.  I just plugged them directly into my old tube, Pioneer amp that I brought from home.  And I'd go back and forth, back and forth, and multiple sales.  I gotta do that with music.
Story_ID: 544538
Speaker 1: And it, it, it's a thing I learned and from the restaurant with my dad because we used to have to get the steam table ready by eleven o'clock.  We'd open the restaurants at five [o'clock] in the morning, breakfast, and, you know, and preparing the steam table.  And, you know, you had a variety of fried chicken, smothered chicken liver and, you know, the greens, the ham hocks and neck bones, it depend on what was today's menu.  And then smothered steak.  Well, see, smothered steak, when you prepare it, you don't cook it all the way because you leave it on the steam table in gravy, the heat will continuously cook it.  So, you know, when it--by, by the time it sits on that steam table, three, four or five hours, I mean it's almost ready to be beef stew, if you will.  And so dad would always be smart.  He had all kinds of ways to get customers into the restaurant on 47th Street [Chicago, Illinois] 'cause it was all counter service there.  And so he'd take a side--people would come and look at the menu, "Mr. D, I don't know what I wanna eat today," and George [George Daniels, Sr.]--my father said, "Ah, wait a minute.  Here, come here, taste this."  He would go get a side dish.  They called them monkey dishes in those days, but it's a little--the side dish.  He put some gravy in the dish, and he said, "Come on, taste this."  "Oh, yeah, give me that."  Just hit the taste buds.  And so, when I started my record store [George's Music Room, Chicago, Illinois], and when I was--would play the music, here's a little bit of, "Yeah, give me that."  And then I'd have Johnnie Taylor, waiting over here.  "Oh, give me that and so and so and so and so."  And then they'd say, stop.  And so I always called that tasting the gravy 'cause you give them a little taste of the music on each.  And so I used that as a style that I got from my dad to clear the steam table of them smothered steaks (laughter) before they get chopped up.  And so, you know, and I was able to convert so much of that I learned from him into, you know, starting my own business.
Story_ID: 544539
Speaker 1: Then, you know, it hasn't always been the uphill.  I went bankrupt once.  I got evicted twice, you know, in the same block.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you've been up and down Roosevelt Road and--
Speaker 1: No, no, no, in the same block--
Speaker 2: Yeah, same block, okay.
Speaker 1: --same block, 3900 block.  December 18th--December 12th this year, it'll be thirty-eight years that I've been in the same block, yeah.
Speaker 2: So in the same block, you've been in about five different stores, right?
Speaker 1: 3937, 3923, 3921, 3915, (unclear).
Speaker 2: Four, four.
Speaker 1: But then, you know, back in the 1980s, it's something that, it often slips my mind.  And a lot of folks didn't know about it, but this was about 1980 or '79 [1979], '80 [1980], I opened up a store up on the North Side [Chicago, Illinois].  The white folk, 'cause they gonna freak out if they see this and to realize that was my record store in Lincoln Square plaza, up there with all the Germans up there.  And it was called Ears Records [Chicago, Illinois].  I remember my, the manager had a big sign painted on the side of one of the buildings up there right off of, what was that Western [Avenue] and Lawrence [Avenue].  And, but I had a really big, beautiful store up there.  And, of course, I couldn't work in there.  The people didn't know it was mine, and I had one of my employees, his name was Bob Mendez [ph.].  He was Puerto Rican, but he looked white.  And so I put him up there in that store (laughter).  That lasted about three years.  He wound up ripping me off (laughter).  I had to close it.  I couldn't do nothing with it.  I couldn't go up in that place.  The only time they saw me, I'd go in there, and my employees didn't even know it was mine.  I just act like I'm just looking.
Story_ID: 544540
Speaker 1: So how long did it take you really, to really get where you thought you were really on your feet with it--
Speaker 2: Well, you--
Speaker 1: --or does it ever get like that where you know you're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) no, you never get on your feet.  I mean, you know, I'm still a neighborhood merchant.  I'm a small business man, you know.  It's, it's a thing, you know, I, I kind of chose that after the fact, you know, because there's so much you can do by yourself.  And then I, I can appreciate why people insisted on a higher education.  Had I had the academics to go along with massive success, if you will, or achievements, I missed it because of my lack of the academics.  When I went to junior college [Loop Junior College; Harold Washington College, Chicago, Illinois], that, that was really a camouflage from, to keep from getting drafted.  I didn't wanna go in the [U.S.] Army.  I wasn't going.  And I always had a job, and I used to pay dudes to take my finals.  And so that's, so I kept my, my status as far as the [U.S.] military is concerned.  And so, but I, I see that, that cost me over the years.  There were things that, you know, places I could have gone and achieved businesswise, much greater, but not that I discount what I've accomplished over the years, but I'm sure, I learned a lot of things--well, so many things that I can teach it, if you will.  Things that I've learned like in--most often hear that black businesses usually fail because lack of finance, you know, they never have enough money.  And I disagree with that from the standpoint of, they never have enough money for what?  They never have enough money, to answer that, it's to pay for the mistakes.  So the fewer mistakes you make, the less money you need to solve them.  And so with me being able to start my business with such limited funds, that's because I had made the mistakes already at the expense of the people I worked for.  So the only thing I didn't have was the money.  See, I knew how to do everything else, and I knew what not to do.
Story_ID: 544541
Speaker 1: Has your business been affected by the, the big retail outlets like Best Buy [Best Buy Co., Inc.] and Walmart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.] or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and the greatest affect now is the digital delivery of music, the Internet.  Oh, that's really, I mean stores like mine have basically disappeared.  It was--back in the '90s [1990s], I organized independent coalitions all across the country of black store owners.  At one point, I was the spokesperson for over ten thousand record stores, black owned, in this country.  And they're basically wiped out now.
Speaker 1: Is that the National Urban Independent--
Speaker 2: That's the National United Independent Retailers.
Speaker 1: --Retailers.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, but there're many couldn't withstand the pressures of it.  Many were renting, renting stores--same thing with Tower Records being lost, like it had to go.  You know, people have to pay the rent.  I have the advantage of I own the property, so that's my biggest advantage.  If I had a monthly rental fee here, there'd be no way I could make it.
Story_ID: 544542
Speaker 1: But now, for the last seven years, I've also operated at Midway Airport [Chicago Midway International Airport, Chicago, Illinois].  I have a music store at Midway.
Speaker 2: Yeah, now, how did that come about?
Speaker 1: Well, it was just--what was the old saying I'd always say, it's better to be prepared and no opportunity than an opportunity comes and you're not prepared.  And in 1999 I was celebrating, you know, thirty years--not celebrating, but it was my thirtieth year anniversary.  And my alderman, Alderman Chandler [Michael Chandler], he came to me, he said, "George [HistoryMaker George Daniels]--." It was some time, I guess, in August, October, you know.  He said, "Look, the mayor is doing one of the marches against violence on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], and he wants to end the march at your store on Roosevelt [Road], and he'd like to do a news conference here, and so on, you know, would that be okay?"  I said, "Sure, fine."  So that, that particular morning, the city, the mayor's people came with his podium, and they put the risers down, and they had chairs to create like a little, small audience area in the front.  And so sure enough, the parade is coming down or the marchers coming, and they marched and ended right in front of the store.  And all of the dignitaries, and the Ed Smiths, the aldermen, and Danny Davis [HistoryMaker Danny K. Davis] and a number of political heavyweights locally and, of course, your aldermen.  So the mayor does his talk about the West Side and so on and so forth, and, and then he, he calls me up, him and Chandler called me.  They said, "Come here, George."  And so they awarded me the adopt the block thing for Roosevelt Road, the way that I maintained for thirty years and so on and so forth.  And I said, "Whoa."  It surprised me, and I did a little small talk with the media that day.  And then so the mayor said, "Okay.  That's it," and he said, "Come on, George, let me see your store."  Right here, we walk in, and he looks around and he, he looks at me, he said, "You know I got an idea I know you might like."  And he turned to his people (audio disturbance) and said, "Look, I wanna--you know, have George come down and see us after this meeting for something."  So, (unclear) they wrote it down, and Jackie Heard [Jacquelyn Heard] was with him, his press secretary.  And so I didn't think nothing of it.  I'm thinking it's a little bit of hot air.  Well, about two weeks later, it was on a Monday, we got a phone call here, and it was the mayor's office, and he wanted me to come down.  And I said, "When?"  And they said, "Tomorrow."  And I said, "What time?"  They said, "One o'clock."  I said, "I'll be there."  I was geeked.  I didn't know what he was talking about, and so I got downtown about ten [o'clock] AM, man, and I was not gonna be late.  And so I go to the office about ten [o'clock] to one [o'clock].  And they said, "Mr. Daniels, have a seat.  Somebody'll be out to get you."  One o'clock hits, who walks out the back, Mayor Daley [Richard M. Daley].  Say, "Hey, George, come on back."  So I'm thinking it's a meeting and a group of folks.  It was just him and I for about four hours.  And so we did small talk and what have you.  And he said, "Look, I know you're probably wondering what I wanted you down here for."  He said, "I'll tell you what I want, but you tell me what you want first."  I said, "Well, you know, I hadn't thought about asking for anything.  I came--," I said, but--I said, "well, there's some property that's city owned that's adjacent to my property.  I'd like to, I'd like to get it if I can."  He said, "(Unclear), that shouldn't be a problem.  It's city owned."  He said, "Your (unclear) go along."  I said, "Sure."  He say, "Okay."  He said, "What else?"  I said, "That's all."  He looks, he said, "Wow," he said, "that's probably why I liked you."  He said, "Because most people would a come down here with a laundry list, and this is all you wanted."  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "Well, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what I wanted you here for."  He said, "You know, there're no music stores in our airports," and my stomach hit the floor.  I said, I know he's not talking about George's [George's Music Room, Chicago, Illinois] at the airport.  I said, "Well, Your Honor," I said, "maybe not at Midway, but at O'Hare [Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois], they have this chain called Altitude [ph.]."  He said, "I don't care about chains."  He said, "You have been here thirty-some odd years.  You're part of the diversity of our city, and if you qualify, I would like for you to be in our airport."  He said, "Would you wanna do it?"  I said, "For sure."  And said, "Will your banks back you on it?"  I said, "I'm pretty sure Community Bank of Lawndale and my supplier."  They did.  And so, but now, I had to wait--it wasn't like he held my hand and walked me into this.  It was an expensive deal to do, but I was qualified, and what was so funny, my attorney, he told me, he said, "You know, George, it took two weeks for them to call you back because it took them two weeks to check out your background."  If I had been a deadbeat dad or had parking tickets or taxes over--you know, any of those things, I would not have qualified.  But everything was prepared.  And that's why I always say, it's better to be prepared and no opportunity than opportunity comes and you're not prepared.  That opportunity came.  I was prepared, and I did what was necessary.  I got the proper support system to walk me through the red tape of dealing with city hall.  There were no special favors.  You know, it was obvious that the opportunity when the mayor came here, and, you know, he found a minority that's a reflection of the city.  And when you look at the merchants at Midway, who's there?  Chicago [Illinois] is there, is represented.  And so I'm one of the fortunate ones that have been in business thirty-some odd years, and he recognized--he fits like a glove.  If he can do it without having a chain operation.  Now, mind you, it's a difficult situation where a single store merchant like myself, to have a store in an airport.  That's unheard of because the overhead is no joke.  But we, we do pretty good.
Story_ID: 544543
Speaker 1: We do pretty good.  We're holding our own.  It's, it's so unique, and within the music industry to retail and, you know, I stand out like a sore thumb because many of my associates are the ones that own the chains.  I know all of them, so.  And they're quite amazed that we've been able to maintain.  And but it was a blessing from the mayor [Richard M. Daley] and the fact of the matter is, I know what I'm doing.  I made all the mistakes earlier.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, tell us--now, one thing that you're good at, and people talk about is promoting, you know, bringing some of the stars into the store and some of your displays, I mean just walking through today and looking at the displays and how your store is laid out.  We'll start with the stars.  Now, who are some of the stars that have come in, come here to--
Speaker 1: Oh, god, you name it from Mary J. Blige to LL Cool J, Al Green's been here, Johnnie Cochran's been here, I mean the list goes on and on and on.  I mean R. Kelly, Puffy's [Sean Combs; P. Diddy], Alicia Keys, [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson, Randy Crawford, Temptations [The Temptations].  God, it's so funny, you know, when you see all of the people, I have a box that I've collected and I kept.  I've been going through my memorabilia and I always get the window size, you know, come meet such and such with the date and the artist and all these different paper signs that I've kept.  And I have a box of maybe two or three hundred paper signs of all of the artists that have been here.  I mean just talking about Kool and the Gang, all of the rap artists from the rap side, you know, the Scarface and Bushwick Bill, the 5th Ward Boyz, Ill and Al Skratch [Ill Al Skratch].  I've been in a number videos too over the years as well, which was pretty cool, the Isley Brothers been here.  A matter of fact, Destiny's Child, when they first--they performed in my yard here for an in store once.  And so, just, you know, we've done some cool stuff.  We've shut Roosevelt Road down for big events in conjunction with WGCI [WGCI Radio, Chicago, Illinois].  And then we bring in the city services (background noise).  Every year for the last ten years, myself and Alderman Chandler [Michael Chandler], we've done our back to school fest in Douglas Park [Chicago, Illinois].  We had to move it there because they had really gotten to, to an extreme size.  But it shrunk over the years because the record industry has really changed its direction as far as the, the marketing support that they used to give because it wasn't like I solicited those acts to come, but because the store had become so popular, it was a place to stop by if you were an artist in America.  If you came to Chicago [Illinois], you had to come to George's [George's Music Room].  For one thing, the media would always turn out, and we'd have the bodies here, and that's what, that's what, what marketing is all about.  You do a promotion, you want people there.  And I, on average, we have one of the larger physically, physical stores, if you will, than most black stores in the country, very few black owned stores have this much square footage as well as access to the outside and a good relationship with your alderman, your political representative as well the commanders of the police in your district because you need all of that cooperation in order to keep order.  And over the years, and I've had thousands of in stores, and never one incident.  No one ever's, gotten arrested.  No one has ever been disappointed, and now, so this is what we do and how we do it.
Story_ID: 544544
Speaker 1: Some of the displays, I saw a photo of Sir Mix-a-Lot's visit--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, on the roof, the big, 'Baby Got Back' on the roof, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes. Right. So on your roof is a, really a big, back basically on it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was during the time, actually, I lived upstairs over my store [George's Music Room, Chicago, Illinois].  I had the apartment up there.  And, and I'm the hype-ster, you know, I used to call myself the Barnum and Bailey of black retail, you know, anything for excitement because  music is excitement.  This is the closest thing that these children in this neighborhood growing up will come to, will, will be able to touch and come to and touch the industry.  I mean I was able to attract all of these artists and they would come and just touch the kids and, and excitement.  And so this opportunity came became many of the stores, they refuse to put that big ass on their roof.  And me, that was a perfect thing for me.  I didn't care.  And so it was, it was so funny, the day they delivered it, UPS [United Parcel Service] comes and this is, a box, and this big ball.  I didn't know what the hell it was.  And the same day, the people to install it showed up.  During the time, The Source magazine had just started their van, The Source van.  They'd come on the road and they were in the yard at the time with EPMD, K-Solo, Redman.  They were all just hanging out in the yard, meeting the kids and this was before they had exploded as big artists.  But the van was in the yard.  This was before I even had the grass and stuff out there--as a matter fact, I have to get it taken care of this summer.  But, and so we go up on the roof, me and this guy, the installer, and so they pull it up on a pulley like, to pull this big, huge thing.  And they said they have to install it.  They had the big pump, we put up there.  We--I had the electric line already set up, up there.  They turned this thing on.  The thing started opening, opening, big ole (laughter).  I didn't know it was gonna be that big.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And so it was the funniest, and then it had this little mark on it, so I'm trying to rub this black spot off the side of the butt, right, and it was like a patch.  That happened to be because that same butt was on a roof of Tower Records in, on Sunset Boulevard [West Hollywood, California], and somebody shot it with a arrow, and deflated it (laughter).  And it wound up coming to Chicago [Illinois], where I was the only store with the balls in, in the Chicago area and Illinois to put it on his roof.
Speaker 1: The balls to put a butt on the roof.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Exactly.  That was, that was crazy.  And, oh, we got a publicity because the year end issue--I think it was 1993, of Playboy magazine, in the back they had pictures where people send in the year's best photo.  And we had a little segment in there with the big butt on my roof.
Story_ID: 544545
Speaker 1: How did the neighborhood react to that?
Speaker 2: Oh, they had no problem with it.  Man--see, you have to rem- when you look at this neighborhood, it basically looks the same as it did almost when I first started, but there used to be a supermarket on the corner.  There were more merchants around.  But nobody brought excitement to the neighborhood like I did.  You know, the excitement I'd bring, the other merchants would benefit as well.  You know, who comes to the, who comes to Lawndale [North Lawndale, Chicago, Illinois].  You know, they know it's gonna be trouble.  Never, one time.  It was almost like the neighborhood put a halo around this store because the kids that grew up winding up being the thugs, they protected the store.  They wouldn't let nothing happen to George's [George's Music Room, Chicago, Illinois], no matter what.  I didn't condone any of the things that were done.  As a matter of fact, I was one of them old fashioned merchants, the kids get out of line, they get their butt whipped, and I'll take him home, like, "I'm tell my mama."  Then get in front of the house and the kids find out I know their mothers and fathers 'cause I used to whip their butts too.  And so it's that type of merchant I am.  It's--I often say I'm a better merchant than a businessman.  A merchant is part and parcel of a community.  I'm not in a mall.  I'm not so far removed from the pain that this community receives.  I'm not far from when the houses catch on fire or when the guys lose jobs.  Those over the years that, they'll shop with me every payday, and then one day they'll come and say, "George [HistoryMaker George Daniels], look, I'm running short, I--you know, I got laid off, you know, the kids ain't got food."  First, I go in my pocket.  "How much you need?"  Now, try that at any store in the mall.  It ain't gonna happen.  And so this is, these are the people that are responsible for me still being here.  I mean who's gonna come from somewhere to shop at George's other than the neighborhood.  So this is why I never left.  Over the years, with, you know, with the heightened visibility and the opportunities and I've been made many offers to, you know, to put a black face on a white owned business, if you will, that I've refused to do.  That's, that's not me, you know.  If, if I was chasing the money, no problem, but like I told you earlier in the interview, I just did this to make a living.  And as long as I can continue to make a living, then I can continue to keep my integrity.

Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about some of the Chicago [Illinois] artists, especially the contemporary--I mean the popular ones nowadays like R. Kelly--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and Common or Twista.
Speaker 2: I know them all.
Speaker 1: You know, a lot of them are West Siders and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, West Siders, citywide (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, citywide.
Speaker 2: I've got relationships with all of them.  This was a place of Do or Die, Crucial Conflict, they all used to perform on the sidewalk, Twista, I remember his first manager as well as the first time when he first got signed with RCA [RCA Records].  I'm so proud of him because he stood to test of time.  He was determined, and his quote, success--I teach them, you know, if you get caught up with that word success, you'll lose it because it's a title everybody else gives you.  The minute you believe you're successful, you blew it, you blew it.  What you wanna do is achieve constantly.  You--it's like a ladder.  You just keep adding steps to your ladder.  But the minute you start getting hung up and believe in the hype, you're gonna blow it.  And see, he's one of the youngsters that just kept his head to grind and he made it.  And he earned it.  He's not a overnight wonder.  That kid busts his butt for years, a lot of disappointments and ups and downs, but he stood the test of time.  I'm very proud of him.  Common, the same thing.  He made his adjustments.  His style was more New York [New York] method of delivery versus Chicago's staccato, up tempo delivery of hip hop or rap, should I say.  And, you know, R. Kelly has been here, being raised by Chicago sound and black radio because of his mother, Joanne [Joanne Kelly], who exposed him to Tyrone Davis and the Sam Cookes and the Johnnie Taylor and the B. B. [HistoryMaker B. B. King] and the Z.Z. Hills and so on and so forth.  So that's why his way of delivering music, this is why he stays so vital.  His sound is, is unique as a Marvin Gaye sound.  Whenever you hear an R. Kelly song, you know it's R. Kelly.  You know, there's no imitations there, and that's because he's self-contained, produces, writers, creates and the whole darn thing.  So he, he has the luxury of creating a trend rather than reacting to a trend.  He never reacts to a trend.  And that style comes from classic R&B musicians and artists from back in the day.  But that's based upon his exposure.  Who else do we have?  Well, we have a number of blues, from Koko Taylor, but I mean Muddy Waters out of Chicago.  You know, you name it, and so the influences or the music of the day, it's a shame that it doesn't have as much influence as it should.  I recall when Eazy-E, the rap artist used to come here to do the in stores, sign the autographs, before he would sit down and sign anything, we got the lines outside, he would shop and buy vinyl, all blues.  He'd buy fifty to seventy-five, a hundred albums, every visit, all blues, the Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, that's what he bought.  I wished he was talking at the time he's doing, letting young people know, man, this is my taste in music.  How many more kids would love the blues?  See, why to use those images to, to foster an appreciation of your culture.  And see, this is what's being lost, and so today, with the help of corporate radio, with the help of corporate record companies, with the help of bean counters being at the top of the record industry, rather than record people, now what you hear is everybody duplicating.  You get a hit record, and it's a smash, the next thing you know here comes somebody else sounding just like you and just like her, and just like them.  I sell the music, and I gotta look at the label to see who the heck it is.  You can name me, name me one artist right now that's come out within the last ten years that has a unique sound that, that you, you know it's them?  There're very few, if any because they would have been duplicated by now.  They, you know, they're worse, worse than the bootleggers now, duplicating rather than having a unique identity with your sound and one of the only ones that I know of is R. Kelly.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite of the Chicago musicians?
Speaker 2: R. Kelly, period.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, you know, he's a reflection of what's current and what's old.  And when you listen to his music--when he did that 'Step in the Name of Love,' oh, my goodness, man, that's become the national anthem all across the world.  I've traveled the world.  Everybody wanna learn how to step because of him.  You know, he has, he has a connection to the community, to give them the music they want.  It's not like he goes in and experiments.  You know, he, he socializes, he, he sees a song.  He doesn't sit down and just off the top his head starting writing.  And I have, you know, I have this appreciation because I am quite close to him, so I have the, the luxury of being able to tell it like it is.  And I don't have to guess about it 'cause I see him in action.
Story_ID: 544547
Speaker 1: Now, in terms of success, was there ever a time when you just wanted to give up this and say, well, it's not gonna work, it's not gonna, it did work, but it's not now or--
Speaker 2: One time I was gonna do that, and that was that form of bankruptcy I did.  And it wasn't really bankruptcy, but it was 'cause I was at home, and I'm trying to figure out.  I was in debt.  I had, you know, just take--I, I did things that I really wasn't qualified to do as far as being in the music industry, and the visibility I had and the opportunities that were given me, I didn't have the staff nor the ability to follow up.  But I had become a distributor.  I started wholesaling myself, whatever.  And it wasn't structured right.  Again, the lack of having that academic structure in my background probably would have facilitated me better in knowing how to staff.  And so--
Speaker 1: About what year is this?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-six [1976], around there '75 [1975], '76 [1976], something like that.  And so, I was getting ready to go to bed one night, and I'm, I'm really disturbed, you know, people are suing me, and I don't know what the hell to do.  I'm in debt, and I'm watching television, just before I'm getting ready to sleep, Melvin J. Kaplan, come on the commercial about bankruptcy.  "If you so and so," you know.  Now, him and his daughter comes on this.  This is where--he was one of the first, if not the first lawyer, bankruptcy lawyer to do commercials.  And now I see him now--one day I wanna go down there and just tell him, thanks.  He probably, he probably--that, my file has probably been gone outta there.  But I go down there, and I'm the first one in the office, in his office.  I'm sitting there waiting, and it ain't like he has a big staff.  He has a receptionist, and it's him.  And so, he said, "Come on in, Mr. Daniels [HistoryMaker George Daniels], sit down."  He said, "Now, tell me what's happening."  And I explained to him, so and so.  He said, "Okay."  He said, "Look, give me your keys, you know, you can, you can go on and go get a job and we'll just--." I said, "Get a job?"  He looks up.  He said, "Well, if you had a fresh start, you, you know, if your debts were gone, you could make this work?"  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "Oh, okay, forget it.  Take your keys back.  We're gonna do an assignment to benefit creditors."  And it's a form of an auction.  He said, "Look, go back to your store, get all your personal items out and so on and so forth.  And then bring me the keys and a list of all your creditors, the people you owe.  And we're gonna, we're gonna do this assignment to benefit credits.  We're gonna set a time for people to come and view all of your inventory.  We're gonna send it to everybody you owe, the notice that they can come bid on whatever is left at George's Music Room [Chicago, Illinois], and then they'll have an auction."  But you come view it, you had like two days to come view the stuff.  And so the auction was like forty miles outside of Chicago [Illinois] (laughter).  And so they did the thing and what have you, and, but only one person showed up at the auction.  It was my father [George Daniels, Sr.] (laughter).  So I was in debt, over three hundred thousand dollars, and this is a lot of money back then.  And my dad bought everything for two thousand five hundred bucks.  Then, then he had me go to court to get legitimate paperwork, federal.  I went before the judge and explained my situation and what have you.  And so--because I did everything according to Hoyle.  Everybody was notified, just, it was liquidated and Melvin Kaplan gonna divvy up and pay whoever is whoever.  And in about a week or so, I reopened, but it was my dad's record store (laughter).  And it was legal.  It was legitimate, and it worked, but again, this is--had I not seen that commercial that night, I may not be here today.  I would probably think I wouldn't have because they, oh, they were coming at me.  These was, you know, major labels and stuff.  They were coming at--after me.
Story_ID: 544548
Speaker 1: Now, you've alluded to this a couple of times, but, well, if you had something to do over again and could do it over again, you'd probably go finish school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, a bunch of--oh, god, not only that.  It'd be a whole lot of things I would over again.  I mean, you know, anybody that says if I had a chance, I'd be the same, they're crazy.  You know, I, I wouldn't take that for nothing.  You know, they just need to take a little more inventory, they'll see a bunch of stuff they'd wanna change.  But life is what it is, you know, you know, you know while you're here.  You just never know when you're gonna leave.  And so while you're here, find a reason to smile and be happy every day, you know, even, you know, try to turn negative stress into positive stress.
Story_ID: 544549
Speaker 1: Well, tell us this.  We always ask this question, now, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, from my viewpoint in the business that I'm in, hopefully, as time moves on and with the, the controversy behind the dimes (unclear) event and the effect and the influence that the business that I'm in has on the black community, and see, to me, the black community are the children.  You know, there's a, there's a certain group of us that we can put in a dump truck and dump them in the Atlantic Ocean and they'll never be missed.  But that's because they were missed as children.  We need to start getting in that pre-school and work with our children for the future.  We need to get the heck away from the darn, Internet so darn much.  Our kids have become so antisocial and self-centered.  The music that influences them and the parents that just give them everything and this doggone, you know, the timeout stuff and, you know, the corporal punishment.  You can't spank your kids.  All of this is ridiculous.  The bottom line is, it has--it shows a reflection in our music.  It shows how integration has changed the sound of our music because we have our educated black kids coming from the suburbs.  We--can you imagine having black kids that can't dance.  There was no such thing, heard of that in the black community.  I mean the vast majority can hold a beat, but now when you see what's out here now, the dilution.  Any time you take anything and add something to it, you dilute its strength.  And we've lost our strength as a culture, as a people because of this self centeredness and just like right now, in America, on hip hop radio whether it's a black station, white station in different, but they play hip hop, the two hottest records out right now, "This is why I'm hot, this is why you not" ['This is Why I'm Hot'].  The number two, "I just bought a Cadillac, I'm gonna put some Ds on that Cadillac" ['Throw Some D's'].  What the hell is that telling you?  When--and these are black artists.  That's what they're saying, but not just them.  Ninety-nine percent of the music that has come out in the last ten or fifteen years, that had massive success, I got the girl, I got the house, I got the bling, bling, I got the car, I, I, I, I, I.  Where is we and us?  Where are the love songs that talk about this or that?  It's gone.  That's what I fear that is gonna happen to us because when we lose our rhythm, when we don't walk in rhythm any more, we lose our soul.
Story_ID: 544550
Speaker 1: Give us what you just gave us in terms of where these record companies were?
Speaker 2: Okay, in conjunction, where The HistoryMakers' office is, at 1900 South Michigan [Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois], you're right at, right in the middle of the historical part of the music industry.  You had Chess Records at 2120 Michigan.  You had One Stop Records [Ernie's One Stop Records]--the man that I first got involved in music with was in the, the 2000 block of--just a few doors north of 21st [Street] and Michigan.  You had Scepter Records, you had Decca Records, you had Vee-Jay Records and Vee-Jay Records which was black owned.  A lot of folks don't know, Frankie Valli was on that label.
Speaker 1: And The Beatles--
Speaker 2: And Beatles, the first label--there was a deal that she wanted to get with Capitol Records, and they had to take The Beatles, so the first label they were on.  Ewart Abner who eventually wound up working for [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy, used to work for Vee-Jay Records.  And so you had Brunswick Records in that era.  United Records distributors, that was at 1835 Michigan Avenue.  Right across, right down the street, not far was the Cotton Club [Chicago, Illinois].  It eventually became that.  It's not part of that whole history, but it's, it was a historical location for many artists there, started their careers there with a little, small stage.  So, you know, from 12th Street to 26th Street, on Michigan Avenue was known as Record Row.  You could walk down the street and you'll see Jackie Wilson, just--Aretha Franklin--not Aretha--yeah, Aretha would be because she recorded for Chess, a gospel.  Her first gospel record was on Chess.  And her father, C.L. Franklin, recorded at Chess.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, you had the musicians, see, you were under contract.  If you were a musician and you played at Chess Records, you only played at Chess.  You didn't go to other labels.  But they used to sneak and do it, but it's a fact that they had it--I was there when the Chicago musicians unions were fighting to keep the synthesizer from showing up in music 'cause they knew the handwriting was on the wall.  It's like me looking at the Internet and digital delivery of music and what does my future hold?
Story_ID: 544551
Speaker 1: It's like, a few weeks ago--or months--well, James Brown, when he died, we did a condolence card that we always do when major artists pass.  And people come to sign the card, and we get it to the family.  And so this grandmother comes in with her grandchild, I would--he was about five, six years old.  And she's been a customer of mine for years.  I hadn't seen her in a while, and we hugged.  She said, "Hey, my grandson."  I greet the little kid, and he holds up his PlayStation 2.  "Hey Mister, can I download some music in here?"  I said, "Oh, my god," there--where is my future as far as being a music retailer if I expect to sell a physical product?  So, you know, it's a unique thing to be able to see your mortality when it comes to what you do for a vocation because that was my future unless I participate in this digital delivery to my customers and give them an atmosphere where it's still a shopping experience, then I'm gone.  But have no fear.  I ain't going nowhere 'cause I'm already working (laughter) on this participation in the digital delivery.  But it, it hurt, the fact that, wow.
Speaker 2: Now, just, two things.  One, we've--you mentioned Johnson [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois] being near The HistoryMakers' office too--
Speaker 1: Yes, Jet magazine, it started--I would guess that would be 1800 or 1801 South Michigan [Avenue].  It was on the corner.  It was on the southwest corner of Michigan and 18th Street.  There was a, like a old greystone there, like a mansion style of a building.  That's where I remember Jet and Ebony starting.
Speaker 2: Then back to what you were saying about forms of music, have you ever thought of--and I've been in some cities where they, they're opening up--used LPs have become a big business.
Speaker 1: Well, that's for the audiophiles.  Those were the people that still wanna hear the bacon frying, you know.  It's, it's not a huge market.  If there's a market, it's on eBay [eBay Inc.].  It's not the physical stores.  It's just people that just not shopping unless they're deejays, and if you're involved with like the deejay record pools, and you can do special ordering and what have you for them and so on and so forth.  But in most cases, the deejays now are downloading.  They have, they're spinning off, off of programs that they have on, in the laptops.  So they really, the physical product, the experience for the physical product--it started changing when they came up with the cassette and the eight track rather than the album and even the 45 [45 rpm record] picture jackets when they lost that connection with the artists.  Now, it's just connection with the sound.  The artist just conveys a sound that a producer creates which is the worst crap that I, I hate this, the way the business has gone.  You know, the star's only as big as the producer now.  What is this?  It's crazy.  You know, there's no delivery.  There's no sound, but anyway, that's a whole 'nother s- (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 544552
Speaker 1: How has the syndication of radio affect--
Speaker 2: That has nothing to do with it.  Well, the corporate radio being syndicated, yeah, maybe a few more disc jockeys ain't got jobs in the market, when Steve Harvey has thirty, forty markets, when Tom Joyner has a hundred and some markets.  But, you know, they really play some of the, the real classic music on those stations and what have you.  But what we need are stations that goes back to--if you--your favorite station, and you should be tweaked and encouraged and influenced by the different sounds of who you are.  It's, it's just like, if you gonna be stuck in one mode, then why do you change your clothes.  You might as well have the same, you might as well be like the Chinese have everybody wear green.  There's no variety in, in your rhythms.  It's just one rhythm.  It's all up tempo.  That's why the kids are so hyped up nowadays.  That's why these--they don't get, they don't have, they have never learned how to take time to even just think.  That's why they keep getting in trouble.  They just react and no thinking.  Music controls all of that for your moods and whatever, you know.  You gonna be listening to some hip-hop and read a book?  I don't think so.  But, see, kids are in schools with their doggone iPods on and reading a book, listening to Snoop Doggy Dogg [Snoop Dogg].  That doesn't make sense, instead of listening to Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven] or, or a smooth Nat King Cole song or instrumental, you know.  Those are the things that relax the mind and relaxes the soul and relaxes the body.  It's back in the old days, when you go into a club and the deejay and the club owner, they had a relationship.  The deejay would see who's on the dance floor.  He'd play that up tempo music thirty, forty minutes, get everybody, you know, thirsty and ready to rest because everybody ain't gonna dance fast, and there's usually that shy guy and a girl, they've been looking at one another.  But, you know, that music is too fast.  So then he goes into twenty minutes of slow jams.  People that was up there, they going to bar.  The guys that were sitting there and the lady there, they was saying, "Now, I'm gonna get up and go ask her, you wanna dance?"  And she's so--you, everybody left the club happy.  Everybody accomplished what they wanted to accomplish.  Nowadays you go into a club, and the deejay put the headphones, and he's looking at a computer.  He be up jamming, ain't nobody on the dance floor.  He's not even paying attention.  He's in his little--it's ridiculous.  These deejays, deejay for themselves.  And see, so, again, this is what's wrong.  It's that I-ism.  It's, it's really--
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) destroying the society.
Story_ID: 544553
Speaker 1: How are you getting involved in the digital downloading the music at this point?
Speaker 2: Well, I gotta find out which, what's, what company is more feasible for me to be able to do business with.  So, you know, as I get my website developed to be flashy enough to link onto, to iTunes, if you will.  You know, I could qualify to be--but you have to have a pretty fly website going on.  And there's different other services.  This convention coming to town this weekend, NARM [National Alliance of Recording Merchandisers; Music Business Association], and their trade show is gonna offer opportunities to partner or get involved some kind of way.  You know, if I could only react as my customers react, and as they get the iPods and all the other things, they're letting me know, but, you know, you're gonna get me music, then you have to get it the way I want it.  The consumer's always right.
Story_ID: 544554
Speaker 1: Now, you've been honored by the city and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and by your community.  There's a--I saw a picture of you not long ago throwing out the first pitch of the Cubs [Chicago Cubs] game.
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually, that was the White Sox [Chicago White Sox].
Speaker 1: White Sox, okay.
Speaker 2: They put the caption on there wrong--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 2: --but that was a good looking pose I had.  I was really, I was throwing that ball.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you did a better job than the mayor of Cincinnati [Mark Mallory] (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, he got hurt (laughter).
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and so--
Speaker 1: But when you look back on everything you've done to this point, I mean, what today would you say is your legacy?  Or what, what would you consider to be your legacy today, I guess?
Speaker 2: I stayed home, home, meaning the inner city.  You know, it's--you know all the years, over the years, I--the hundreds of employees that I've had, I've given 99 percent of them, most of them, their first jobs ever.  See, that's one of the biggest things that's missing in our inner city neighborhoods, an opportunity for our kids to have their first entry level job in the neighborhood where you know the parents and it's small enough business, so whether they sweep up the joint or they--you can, you could start teaching the disciplines of a job.  Everybody wants to earn some money.  How do they get an opportunity?  And this is what I've been known for over the years.  Literally, over the years, 90 percent of everybody's worked for me, usually have walked, has walked to work.  And so I, I wanna be known as the guy that gave young people an opportunity to make a living.
Story_ID: 544555
Speaker 1: Tell us about your family.  Now, who--do you have children?
Speaker 2: I--my daughter just turned twenty-one April 20th, 2007.  My son turned eighteen February 9th of 2007.  My daughter's name is Maxine [Maxine Daniels] and my son's name is George, Jr.--III [George Daniels III].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my daughter goes to Northern Illinois University [DeKalb, Illinois], majoring in marketing, and minoring in English.  She's doing very well.  I'm very proud of her.  She's, she works in the store [George's Music Room, Chicago, Illinois] and every now and then in the summer or what have you--it's not mandatory.  She has other jobs that I encouraged her to go because I wanted her to have a diversity in relationships and how to deal with all kinds of people, you know, not to be limited.  And she's, she's such a wonderful young lady, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm married to Regina Daniels, who's--we've been married fourteen years.  It'll be fifteen November 7th.  And it's because of this store that I met her.  We were doing a in store with this, a group out of Miami [Florida].  I forget the name of the group.  And so we did a small type of in store autograph session.  And so it was over, and the group was still hanging around.  This is when my office was up front.  And so I looked at her, I said, "What's up?"  And they say, "Oh, we're waiting for our publicist."  I said, "Okay."  I sat down.  Next thing you know, the publicist walks in.  It's Regina.  I get up.  They introduce me.  I sat down.  We exchanged cards, and I looked over at her, and she looked back at me.  I got up, and we started talking.  And we met July 18, 1993, and we got married November 7th, 1993 (laughter).  And, but that was--out of everything, the greatest asset that has been for me, is the relationship she created with my kids.  Regina didn't have any kids and so my daughter was seven years old when me and her met, and my son was four.  So that's the only woman that they ever knew me to be around.  And she has really turned into their mom, and she's, she's done a great job in helping influence and shape the attitudes of the kids.  She's a great woman.  In her own right, she owns Daniels Entertainment Group.  She's a publicist and she has a few pretty high profile clients that she works with.  But she's a mother, a housewife, and a businesswoman, and my wife (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. All right.  Now, is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Let's see, the--no, I guess we've covered quite a bit of ground.  Again, to reiterate, about my brother Max Newsome [Max Newsome, Jr.] and my sister [Maxine Newsome Boyd], lo- who became my mother as well because when they became my guardians, she was, very young wife and a mother and then she sends for, you know, they send for a eleven year old, twelve year old kid, you know, and her name is Charlotte [Charlotte Newsome], and her--my three nieces who I just had breakfast with yesterday, Marsha [Marsha Newsome], Joann [Joann Newsome] and Paula, and Paula is an actress, Paula Newsome.  As a matter of fact, she's in the, that movie--I just saw it the other day, Over- 'Reign Over Me' with Don Le- how do you--Title- Siegel [sic. Don Cheadle].  I forget how you pronounce his last name, (pronunciation) Title, Tittel.  And, well, anyway, she's in that movie.  But she's done 'ER' and she's a bunch of episodes on television shows.  So I'm truly proud and so grateful, you know.  My, you know, for my brother to, to think so much of me.  And he was only twenty something when he sent for me.  And for him to not want me shifted around anymore, it shows the love of brother that's just so unusual, you know.  You love your family and what have you, but, you know, he was on his way, getting his medical degree and married.  He had his family to deal with, and then he takes on a responsibility that my parents [Elvina Guillory Daniels and George Daniels, Sr.] didn't take.  And I love him so much today because of, because of that because I would, I would give him--80 percent of who I am is because of the influence of my brother and my sister-in-law, Charlotte.  They, they instilled the type of values as far as family because remember in others--in the rest of the story, I shared everybody else's family.  And my brother and my sister-in-law became my family.  So it's like, it's still today, every holiday, Christmas, Thanksgiving, I'm right out there in Beverly [Chicago, Illinois] at the house.  And so, if nothing else, that's what I don't want missed in this story, how important he has been.  And that's it.
Speaker 1: I'm sure they're proud of you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he lets me know that, yeah.
Story_ID: 544556
Speaker 1: The last question is similar to legacy in a way, but it's a little different.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a person that drained all the energy out of the universe to, to energize himself to enjoy life, to be able to put a smile on somebody else's face, to convey to the young people that you gotta, you know, there's a long road ahead of you.  Just take your time and, and do it right as, you know, there's a lot of old parables and things that my father [George Daniels, Sr.] taught me, and how to respect everybody, your fellow man.  It doesn't matter the--

Speaker 1: You know, we, we as a people, we--open housing did more damage to us than anything else because no matter what you had back in the day, there were no middle-class or upper-class black neighborhoods.  Everybody lived where black folks lived, and we lost that.  And I would hope that our people start gentrifying their own neighborhoods again, and, and stay home and so our children can have more example because other than that, the examples are coming from television.  They're not coming from the neighborhood.  They coming off the Internet.  I'd like to be remembered as a person that would promote the fact to slow up the Internet, slow up the so called progress because where is it taking us?  Why are we in such a hurry?  You know, our corporations are not individually owned anymore.  You have these companies, they're conglomerates.  They're, they're--it's Wall Street that's determining everything.  There's no heart in us anymore.  The sensitivity is dying very quick in our children.  If it dies in our children, then the future is dead.  And that's really scary when you look at the Iraq War.  You look at how we devalue life.  Yes, Virginia Tech was horrendous, thirty-two kids [killed at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia] (background noise).  Why is that white America's dead are more valuable than the rest of the world's dead?  Look how many people are dying and have died in Iraq when they dropped them damn bombs, not before the car bombs.  I'm talking about before the car bombs, when we did it, you know.  What's the legacy gonna be?  You're putting seventeen, eighteen and nineteen year old kids with high powered, military armament, learning how to kill.  What you gonna do when they come home?  I saw what happened when Vietnam [Vietnam War] guys came home.  They flooded the cities with drugs to slow them down so the police could catch them because when the mind is gone--and that's one of the things that has happened to our society.  And so what are they gonna do now?  You gonna have a bunch of maniacs coming back here, who play the video games, who have become crazy.  That's how that kid learned how to be so meticulous in the way he killed, from video games, all in the name of the almighty dollar.  Something's gotta give or we are gonna implode.  Society's gonna die.  So I would like to be known for the person that said it first.  Watch your back.
