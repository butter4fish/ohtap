Story_ID: 28807
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five, lightweight questions we always ask as sort of a warm-up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food?  Yes, I do (laughs).
Speaker 1: What is it?
Speaker 2: Actually, I have several.  I would say my--boy, now, I've got to think about this.  My favorite food category is seafood, and more specifically, I like, I like clams.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I have a favorite color, and that is green.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?

Speaker 1: Okay.  And, the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes.  "We're moving forward, and we're moving fast."
Story_ID: 28808
Speaker 1: So, I'm going to ask you about your family history now.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your family's side, but separately, then we'll put them together.  So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Wauneta, her maiden name, Norton, now Adkins.  And Wauneta is spelled, W-A-E--I'm sorry.  W-A-U-N-E-T-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story behind that spelling?
Speaker 2: We've, we've actually been trying to get some insights on that, but it is a--somewhat of a unique spelling versus the traditional way to spell Juanita is typically with a J.  But we were--I guess we were never successful in terms of determining what led to it being spelled with a, with a W.
Speaker 1: Did your grandmother name her?
Speaker 2: Yes, my grandmother named her.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And what is your mother's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is August 28, and I want to say 1936, and the place of birth was DeLand, Florida.
Speaker 1: Leeland?
Speaker 2: DeLand.
Speaker 1: DeLand.  Okay.  How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: I think it's spelled, D-E-E-L-A-N-D [sic, DeLand].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about your ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace them, first of all?
Speaker 2: Well, it turns out on my mother's side, I can go back as far as my, my grandparents, which they both sort of grew up and resided in south Florida, and my mother actually went to school in the south Florida, south Florida area.  So I can trace it back as far as my grandparents.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did your mother grow up in DeLand?
Speaker 2: Yes, she grew up in DeLand, and also a place called Deerfield Beach, Deerfield Beach, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which all of these are locations in--I would describe it as south Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So as far as you know the family history of your mother's line is it pretty more--
Speaker 2: In south Florida, yes.  That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Correct.  So, so what were your grandparents' names?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My grandmother's name was Irene, and my grandfather's name was Willard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what did they do for a living?
Speaker 2: They-- and you'll see a thing where I came--my family is from really sort of humble beginnings.  So both of them--my grandmother was pretty much a maid and did a lot of housecleaning and support, and my grandfather had more of a trade where he did a lot of work in the--I'll call it the landscaping, landscaping area.
Story_ID: 28809
Speaker 1: I read someplace in the information about you that you were the first generation to go to college?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  My--I have a brother and a sister, and we were the first generation to get a higher education.  I went off into engineering.  My brother was more around education and business, and my sister was an accountant.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what--you have any--are there any, any stories about the kind of education your grandparents had or mother in south Florida?
Speaker 2: So, in terms of my mother, high school was in south Florida.  And then my mother became, as a profession, a nurse, where several decades she served in helping people.  And then, sort of an interesting point, at age fifty, she decided to pursue a higher education degree and was pretty successful at that.  So she became a--more of a registered nurse as opposed to her beginning.  She was a--I guess it was called an LPN [licensed practical nurse].
Speaker 1: Right.  Yeah, a practical nurse.
Speaker 2: Practical nurse, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's--so she decided to go on and pursue it past the age of fifty.  What was the name of her high school and college?
Speaker 2: You know, I really should have done more research on this, but the college where most of the education was done is actually in Miami [Florida], a community college called Miami Dade Community College.  In terms of high school, that is a detail I don't recall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Then Miami Dade Community College.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your mother have any stories about growing up or about how she got involved in nursing in the first place?
Speaker 2: Well, just based on a lot of conversations growing up, she always had a deep interest in helping people.  And so it was really a passion in terms of--at least from her point of view, her contributions in terms of making a different in the world.  So it's always been around this notion of helping people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any other members of the family involved in nursing or the medical field at all?
Speaker 2: No.  My--and we'll get to my father's side--but in terms of family members, no.  She was, I would say, the most notable one in terms of that profession.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did, did she come from a big family herself?
Speaker 2: She came from, I would say, a medium-sized family.  She had, she had a brother and a sister, so it was three of them.  Yeah, an older brother and a younger brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In those days, that may be actually a small family.
Speaker 2: It could be, that's right, yes.
Story_ID: 28810
Speaker 1: We're going to go over to your father's side now, and I think it's more actually history that we can find--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on his side.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We--I actually have more history on my father's side.
Speaker 1: Can you first give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My father's name is Archie Lee Adkins.  Archie is spelled, A-R-C-H-I-E, Lee, L-E-E, and then Adkins.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Okay.  His date of birth is September 23, 1933.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Louisville, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Louisville, Georgia.  Now, this is--where is Louisville, Georgia in relationship to--
Speaker 2: So Louisville, the way to think about it, it was actually, if you look at, back in the history, it was actually the third capital of Georgia.  And it is sort of south.  It's south of Atlanta [Georgia], and I would describe it as west of Augusta, Georgia.  And, as you know, Atlanta is the fifth capital of Georgia.  I believe Augusta was perhaps the first capital of Georgia.  It was either the first or second capital of Georgia, followed by Louisville being the third.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And that's--I know I've seen like a family reunion book with some information, but tell us a little bit about Louisville, Georgia, and I think your family is associated with a big plantation.
Speaker 2: So my grandparents actually owned some farmland in Louisville.  And Louisville is a pretty, I'll call it rural-based area, a high degree of farming and agriculture in the Louisville area.  And that's where my, my father grew up.  And my grandparents actually had a farm where they had live cattle, as well as, they grew a few things as part of their system there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were cattle the main--
Speaker 2: So, part of it was cattle.  So, and it was sort of the traditional list. Pigs, chickens, and then various types of crop, including, corn, tomatoes, and peas and other types of vegetable-based products.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So they didn't have any major cash crop?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: They didn't have a major cash crop, you know, like, cotton or tobacco or something?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I would say, if you look at the vast amount of what they produced on the property, it was corn.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Large amounts of corn.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Although in the Louisville area, cotton and tobacco was some of the main products in the area.
Speaker 1: I know corn is used for feed a lot.
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 1: As well as food, you know, (for people?).
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So, now--what were your grandparents' names?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My grandmother's name is--was named Annie Jessie Adkins, and she passed away about three years ago at the ripe age of a hundred.  And my grandfather's name was Joe Adkins, and he passed away several years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, once again in the family history, maybe, that I've seen or the written history, I mean, you can trace your people all the way back to 1820, I think?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  And we've been doing quite a bit of work to look at--understand our past.  And, quite frankly, it's more work to do, but we've been able to trace it back several generations.  And I guess it would go all the way back to Allen Adkins, that I would probably describe as my great-great-grandfather.  So several--a couple of generations beyond Joe and Annie Jessie Adkins.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they went through the entire drama of being slaves, going through the Civil War, acquiring land, establishing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --themselves,--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --going forward.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And best as we can tell, I know--and we still have more work to do, but the name was acquired, we think, from the slave owner.  And then--we--they go through the sort of the full life cycle in terms of, you know, from the slavery to--sort of, I would describe as an indentured servant to getting through the wars and then now to the current generation.
Story_ID: 28811
Speaker 1: Now, your father [Archie Lee Adkins], I assume he grew up in Louisville, Georgia?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My father grew up in Louisville, Georgia, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, now what were his ambitions, and did he serve in the War [World War II] or did he--
Speaker 2: My father did serve in the United States Army.  So he--when he finished high school in Louisville, he went off on to the Army.  He actually had the opportunity to do part of his tour duty in Korea, and then he spent most of his time in the base in Virginia.  And, you know, after the Army, we spent a very short period of time in Georgia, and then the family migrated to Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did your father migrate to Florida basically because of your mother [Wauneta Norton]?
Speaker 2: Partially, but I think some of the logic back then was more the opportunities.  They felt that they had a better set of opportunities in Florida versus Georgia or other locations.  So--and then we also had other family members in Florida, so I think when you look at the combination of family being in Florida and the view of opportunity at that time, they felt Florida was the best location.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  You know, just looking out, looking--from the outside in, you know, when you look at that era in the South, you know, I don't know what the difference in Georgia or Florida would be (laughs), but I guess the--these opportunities would be economic opportunities and things like that, that we--that are, you know, have--
Speaker 2: You know, I think some of it was economic, but I also think some of it perhaps was lifestyle, because, you know, at least their point of view was there was a difference in terms of lifestyle between Florida and Georgia.  Georgia has historically been associated with farming, although that's not necessarily the case of today.  But if I put myself, during that period of time, I think that was the view, that a change in lifestyle, and then perhaps more economic opportunities, given that Florida was going through a period of growth and a high degree of tourists, tourism in the state.
Speaker 1: So, did the move directly to Miami [Florida]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They moved directly to Miami, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I didn't ask you this, but is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Well, I think--well, they met when my, my father was in the Army, and I don't recall the specifics and location, but they did meet while he was in the Army in Florida.  And they, I guess, decided that, you know, it was clearly interest on both sides, and they're now about to celebrate fifty-five years-- fifty-five years of marriage.
Speaker 1: Or they would have been. So they were married from--so, when they get married, in the '50s [1950s], right?
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: They should have been married in fifty--it should be 1957.  Yeah, 1957.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So are you the oldest of the children?
Speaker 2: I'm the middle kid.
Speaker 1: Middle kid.
Speaker 2: So my sister is--was born in '57 [1957].  I was born in '58 [1958], and then I have a brother that was born in 1960.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it's three of you.
Speaker 2: Just three, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28812
Speaker 1: Now, when you consider your parents' personalities, their dispositions, how they walk, talk, what they look like, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I think I'm, I think I'm a hybrid.  So I would probably say I have, probably the spirit and the drive from my, from my mother [Wauneta Norton], but I will also say in terms of mannerisms, I probably have my, my mannerisms from my father [Archie Lee Adkins].  So my father was a pretty, I'll call it, calming, sort of--I would say, very approachable human being.  And my mother was a bit more, I would say, feisty, and I would say more aggressive in terms of her personality and style.  And depending on the situation and scenario with me, I think you will see a blend of both of those, both of those approaches and both of those styles.
Story_ID: 28813
Speaker 1: Now, what did your father [Archie Lee Adkins] end up doing for a living in (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Okay.  So my--I would say my mother [Wauneta Norton] and my father, they--again, I'm from very humble beginnings.  My father ended up being in a long career doing this, as a custodian in a middle school.  And then my mother, as I described, started a career and had a very successful career in nursing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, your father was in a job where you got a decent--some decent benefits and--.
Speaker 2: He had great benefits, because he was a custodian for a school in Dade County [Florida], part of the Dade County School System, and worked a number of years as part of the county system.  And upon retirement, he benefited from their benefit system.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now it's different from a lot of jobs you could have in those days, with no benefits and no--
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 1: --no retirement.
Speaker 2: And I think when you look at back then, I mean, many of the city jobs and the county-based jobs, they did have pension programs and benefit programs for their, for their employees.
Story_ID: 28814
Speaker 1: Let's go back to your siblings, and can you name them and tell us what they're doing?
Speaker 2: Okay.  So my--I'll start with my oldest sister or my sister.  Her name is Marion, now, Dollard, D-O-L-L-A-R-D, and she majored in business administration and accounting.  And today, she continues to practice in her profession.  She attended local schools there in Miami [Florida], started off in--at Miami Dade Community College, and ultimately ended up finishing her degree at Florida International University [Miami, Florida].  And she's there with her husband, Jerry, and they have three kids; a set of twins and an older son.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's Marion.  My younger brother, Barry, which is really Dr. Barry Adkins, who has his Ph.D. in administration, and he's on a number of--I'll call it assignments--job assignments in the Miami Dade County Area, working in administration, as well as in the education system in Miami.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is his--
Speaker 2: And he was a graduate from Florida State University [Tallahassee, Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he primarily works for the school system?
Speaker 2: And the county, because he's done a number of jobs ranging from managing Parks and Recreation to managing the animal shelter to--now, he's doing much more in education.
Story_ID: 28815
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think I have a few.
Speaker 1: What's the earliest one, the one that, you know--
Speaker 2: I would say--I would say the earliest childhood memory would be our summer visits to Louisville, Georgia, where my grandfather [Joe Adkins], one of the things he was most proud of was his tractor.  And I recall when we were young, one of the most exciting events for us daily was to wait for our grandfather, as he came down a clay road coming home from work, and we could see him in the distance.  And the thing that was most exciting about that for us is we would meet him as he was coming down this road, and we would end up riding with our grandfather on the tractor.  And don't know why, but that is a memory that has, that has been with me.  And I remember, these were very, very early days, and we did this for years.  It became sort of a tradition and a pattern, when we would visit our grandparents.  And one of the major events was to meet our grandfather and take a ride on the tractor-trailer.
Story_ID: 28816
Speaker 1: You were born in Augusta, Georgia, right?
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: But you were raised in Miami [Florida], is that--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: and a sort of an interesting story, though a partially story, my father [Archie Lee Adkins] was sort of--or our parents, they were sort of in route from Virginia to Florida, and a short stay-over in Georgia.  And it turns out my mother [Wauneta Norton] was about seven months pregnant when I decided to show up.  So most of my early years--actually, early months I should say--was then in Augusta, Georgia; and then, my parents ultimately moved, moved on their way down to Florida.  So it was very short interim stop in terms of how I ended up being born in August Georgia versus, say, Miami, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So they didn't really intend on living in Augusta?
Speaker 2: They would stay--but they were there for just a brief of time; and I decided to see the world.  So, I think that changed, you know, quite frankly, the location of birth for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you grow up in the same neighborhood all the time, or did you move around a lot?
Speaker 2: No.  We started off in a place--I think it's still referred to it this way--a section in Overtown, Miami.  And then we ended up in a small neighborhood that, when you look at Miami, you could sort of position this neighborhood as sort of south of a pretty notable place in Miami called Liberty City, and sort of north of Downtown Miami.  So we grew up in a sort of a small neighborhood between those two locations.  And it was a historical--or predominantly black, Hispanic, and also had a heavy, I call it, Caribbean influence, in terms of the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was the name of that neighborhood?
Speaker 2: The section was called Allapattah, which is an Indian name.  As a matter of fact, my elementary school and middle school was called Allapattah Elementary and Middle School.
Speaker 1: Now, how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I haven't looked that at Allapattah in a long time, so, A-L-L-A-P-A-T--Allapattah, Allapattah---T-A-H.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You got it?
Speaker 1: I got it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: All right.  So this is Allapattah neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, I know, Overtown is one of the--is like the business community of black Miami, from what I understand.
Speaker 2: It has, and it's becoming that more so, and when you start to look a lot of the renovation that has occurred in Overtown, Miami, you know, you now have a vibrant fashion district, you have great restaurants.  They sort of refurbished the area in terms of living opportunities.  So the area continues to expand through various types of renovation projects.  But, at the time when I was growing up, that was a very challenged area from, let's just call it a social economic point of view on one end.  And then when you look at Liberty City on the other end, that was also a very challenging environment.  And so Allapattah was sort of in the middle of those, those two locations.
Story_ID: 28817
Speaker 1: Now, what's the spelling of Allapattah [neighborhood in Miami, Florida], again?  I think there were was a--
Speaker 2: Okay.  It's spelled, A-L-L-A-P-A-T-T-A-H.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So two Ts in there.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Instead of one.  Okay.  Now, what was the difference between Allapattah and Liberty City and Overtown?
Speaker 2: I think it was a pretty consistent stretch of the community where you sort of profile Overtown through Allapattah through Liberty City.  It was, I would say, a predominantly, you know, black or African American environment.  I would say the income level I would probably characterize as ranging from low to low-middle, the lower portion of middle income.  The neighborhood had a blend of cultures, but more black.  But it was an increasing influence from Hispanic environments because of a lot of the Cuban migration to Florida.  And then I have the influence from the Caribbean.  So, you know, a number of citizens are people from Jamaica and the Bahamas or, and places like Trinidad.  So--and it sort of profiled, you know, I think, the reputation that Miami has as a city where it was, you know, it has been described as a melting pot in terms of people from different cultures and environments coming to Miami for--looking and seeking for, you know, new and exciting opportunities.  But, if I had to profile it, it was primarily African American with an increasing influence of other cultures and citizens from other locations.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Overtown had seen better days, you were saying, when you (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, Overtown at that time was a very, I would say, very challenging, very challenging environment.  You know, and it was sort of like any large, you know, I'll call it, urban, you know, city area, where it had its challenges, you know, based on the conditions of the environment.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did--when you were growing up, did Overtown still have, like, a lot of black businesses and recreation--
Speaker 2: Yes.  But most of these business you would--I would characterize as very small businesses.  So, you know, your typical mom-and-pop-type shops.  And then overtime you start to see some of these businesses scale in size, but for the most part, they were very, very small, very small businesses.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Allapattah--we always ask this question like this, what were some of the--now.  Oh.  Was a certain neighborhood in Allapattah that you grew up in that had a name or was it just--was it Allapattah?
Speaker 2: That section--that's what that section was referred to.  And I actually grew up on a--most of that section, the streets were numbered.  So the Allapattah section was somewhere between, like, 32nd Street to as far north as 62nd Street, and around 62nd Street is where I would--somewhere around there, that's where Liberty City started.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's like between--
Speaker 2: And I actually grew up on what was called 38th Street.
Story_ID: 28818
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I grew up on 38th Street [Miami, Florida] which is--which ran parallel to a interstate.  I guess it was called Interstate 112, which was the access road, if you will, to Miami Airport.  So I grew up in an area where, depending on the flight paths, some of the more memorable sounds were hearing the large commercial jets fly over the neighborhood, which was a, which was a very vivid picture.  As a matter of fact, it was both visual and in audio, we're seeing the large planes fly over, and then really listening to the sounds that they, that they produced.  The other sounds was sort of the sounds of the neighborhood, you know, where--I actually grew up in a neighborhood that I think, it was very active with multiple generations.  So it was great, and it was common to see kids out playing various sports in the, in the neighborhood.  Many of them--some of it was organized.  A lot of it was sort of made up and creative.  And so when you sort of blend the sounds of the neighborhood, you know, the laughter, the kids having fun, the airplanes flying over, that's what keeps me going in terms of memories of, of my early childhood.
Story_ID: 28819
Speaker 1: Now, now, on your block, was it primarily African American or Caribbean (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: It was primarily, it was primarily African American, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, now, what did you like to do as a little kid, you know, in Allapattha [Miami, Florida]?
Speaker 2: I think it was a range of things.  You know, I actually enjoyed being out in the neighborhood with the other kids and, you know, doing things ranging from street football to baseball or even basketball.  But I also enjoyed private time at home, and I would dream a lot, I guess.  It would be probably safe way to describe it, where--and I think this is really the creative, creative side of me, where I enjoy reading things like comic books.  I love cartoons because cartoons allow you to have a unlimited or unrestricted imagination, if you will.  And so those are sort of the things I enjoy.  So it was a broad range where some of these things were much more intellectually stimulating, but at the same time, I was a typical kid, where I would go out and, and have fun with the other kids in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite comic book or cartoon?
Speaker 2: My--yeah.  Well, I loved--well, I loved all comic books, but if I had to sort of center on one, it was Marvel Comics.  And my, my favorite character was the Mighty Thor.
Speaker 1: Now, why?  Why Thor?
Speaker 2: I--you know, it was something about--it was something his, his utility tool, his tool being the hammer.  And then when you look at Thor's environment--or actually, when you look at Thor, he was actually somewhat of a gentleman (laughs), but at the same time, possessed a great, great power, and it was just always fascinating that he had all of these supernatural strengths, and at the same time, for whatever reason, the hammer is one of my favorite utility tools.  So I think the combination--and again, this is sort of connecting creativity with the practical realities of using things like a hammer to--and a hammer is a tool that you create things.  You build things with hammer.  So I think that's why Thor always resonated with me, because of his--of his hammer.  And you could use a hammer to build things with, which to me means creativity.
Speaker 1: There's some engineering joke about get a bigger hammer or something, but I can't think of what, what it is right now.
Speaker 2: That's right (laughs).
Speaker 1: But were you aware--I know, Stan Lee, when he wrote Thor, he used Shakespearean things and Shakespearean kind of syntax for Thor, who, you know, and did that--
Speaker 2: At the--honestly, at the time, I did not have a complete appreciation of that, but the older you get and the more you start to, you know, to reflect on things and, and get more educated on things, that became more obvious that he leveraged, you know, things from Shakespearean as part of, as part of his, his storytelling.
Speaker 1: Other people might not appreciate this, but having read comics and being aspired one time to be a comic book artist, I know that Jack Kirby is the most engineering-friendly of the artists, in terms of drawing perspective and machines, and how things are connected--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --with imagination.  I mean, that's been written about, you know, quite a bit by, you know.  People actually criticize comic books and think about--did that--did you like the artwork in terms of how the, you know, things were connected in--
Speaker 2: Oh, I know.  And this is--
Speaker 1: --that perspective?
Speaker 2: So when I--I think that's the reason why I had an attraction to the comics, because, at least from my perspective, I can actually see the creativity.  And then it allows you to--it allowed me to open up my imagination.  And, quite frankly, I would actually daydream a lot, which some people argue--I'm not sure if that's the most healthiest thing, but at least over time my daydreaming became a lot more controlled, where, even in my role today it allows you to think about things from a different perspective, unrestricted, unconstrained.  And I think when you're sort of in that zone, that's what fosters innovation.  So, you know, my association with comic books, I honestly think it was sort of redefining in terms even my platform today, which is associated with my, with my profession.
Story_ID: 28820
Speaker 1: Now, did you like to take things apart and put them back together?
Speaker 2: Yeah, which was, I would say, if I had to describe three things that I really enjoyed, of course, playing in the neighborhood. The second one is around comic books.  But the thing that I really enjoyed the most was understanding how things work, you know, whether it--I would say, home appliance, you know, or some type of tool.  But I would always-- my curiosity around how things were put together, how things were built, and actually how they work, was always an area of interest; even to the point where it was somewhat of a challenge growing up, because I would actually experiment on things.  And the good news is, my, my parents actually created an environment where they actually encouraged that.  But at times it could be challenging when, you know, you're taking apart the family's toaster or blender or vacuum cleaner, and with the hopes that, when you put it back together, it will, it will function the same.  And most of those experiments turned out to be okay, but, but not all of them, so.
Speaker 1: (laughs).  Okay.  What one went one, or would you tell us about one that went wrong?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean things like the vacuum cleaner experiment didn't go quite well; although I will tell you, my, my father [Archie Lee Rodney], at a point in time, would get more involved in the process, and I don't know if that was his involvement.  I would argue part of it was interest, but at the same time, part of it was driven by need (laughs).  And then some experiments with some of our small AM radios didn't go quite--didn't go quite right.
Speaker 1: Now, did your dad have a--I know often a custodian in a school or in any place, actually, has to do a lot of fixing of things.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And was he a handyman?
Speaker 2: My father was a handyman in all dimensions.  And to your point, in the school system, you know, his role, you know, would span across a number of activities, some as part of his job.  So he was very handy.  And, actually, a lot of the things that I learned, particularly mechanical, my mechanical skills I actually picked up from my father, you know.  My ability to repair things, like lawn mowers or work on changing brakes on a car or, you know, changing belts on a motor, those were the types of, I'll say, mechanical skills, that I picked up from my father.  And as part of that mechanical process, because of my creative point of view, you know, I was really focused on how things really work, and why people approach certain things the way, the way, the way they constructed them.  So it was much more of just trying to really understand--not just how to fix things and put them back together--but why does, why does, why does it work this way, and what was the motivation in terms of, you know, developing it that way.
Story_ID: 28821
Speaker 1: Well, you were getting ready to tell us something about AM radios, too, but I (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, it's I've had experiments with some of our smaller radios where, you know, taking them apart and, with the hopes of putting it together, and in many cases those experiments went--they went okay, but I didn't have a hundred percent perfection at doing that.  But the good news is, just by going through that process--I mean, quite frankly being encouraged by my parents to be creative, I think that was some of the foundations that led me into this direction of having this interest of being an engineer or scientist.
Speaker 1: Now, did you work on the vacuum tube-type radios or the transistor (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Back then--back then, it was actually both, because that was sort of the era where we were moving from things that were more tube-based to solid-state.  And I actually had the benefit in my childhood to actually participate in some of that, some of that transition, and--
Speaker 1: I believe--correct me if I'm wrong--I think around 1960, '61 [1961] is when the first (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: It slipped out.
Speaker 1: --transistor radios--
Speaker 2: That's about right.
Speaker 1: --hit the black (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: It was early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: --with the earplug--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, you hear mono [monaural sound recording].
Speaker 2: Early '60s [1960s].  That's right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And they came in different colors, and people would give them to their kids on Christmas or their birthday or something.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So, did you have a transistor radio in those days?
Speaker 2: I had, I had a--I'm trying to remember which year I actually had my first transistor radio.  But I'm pretty sure or me it wasn't the early '60s [1960s].  I would probably say, for me, it was probably more of the mid-to-late-- mid to late '60s [1960s].  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So--all right.  Did you ever involved in shortwave at all?
Speaker 2: You know, I never really got deeply involved in that, although I took on an interest in terms of understanding the, I'll it the TV, television broadcasting-type of environment, in terms of really trying to understand how antennas work.  And then why things would be broadcast on certain frequencies.  So it was more of, you know, understanding the process of broadcasting.  So that was--so my interest start to move more in terms of just how these systems work.  And, you know, and then from there I started to pick more interest.  As a matter of fact, one of my first vocational classes in high school was writing programs on a punch card tabulating system, which I, frankly, was a little fortunate that our high school actually had those types of capabilities where it allowed me to continue to expand in understanding different types of--different types of systems.  So I went from trying to understand mechanical things, small electronic things, to understanding how systems would work.  And the one that was most fascinating to me was to really understand how television and broadcasting, how that process really worked.
Speaker 1: Now, was that interest encouraged by the school or was it something that you ventured out on your own to acquire?
Speaker 2: Now, I honestly--I think it was a combination of things.  So I think part of it was me, you know, because I, for whatever reason, it was just something I was always interested in how you would build things.  I would also--some of it was encouraged, and I would say that came from my parents, because a lot of these experiments, and all of them wasn't successful experiments, but my parents, they actually encouraged me to continue to be--to continue to be creative.  And then I would say I had the benefit of some great, great mentors and teachers, where, you know, science and math and technology, we typically view those as very difficult areas.  But I had people that would actually encourage--encourage me to maintain--maintain the interest.  And I think when you sort of put all of those combinations of things together, I think that sort of built the platform of, of, you know, putting me in a position to pursue careers--to pursue a career in engineering.
Story_ID: 28822
Speaker 1: I want to ask you a question about the atmosphere in Florida in those days, I guess, for a young black man who wanted to know about science, because the space program, I think, was the most--was the centerpiece--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of science for, you know, the United States--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in those days.  And that was--it was taking place in Florida.
Speaker 2: Yep.  The big--that was, I guess, the big era of most of the Apollo programs.  Now, let's see--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] and stuff.
Speaker 2: --in '63 [1963], if I remember right, when we put a man--a person on the moon.
Speaker 1: That was '69 [1969], but--
Speaker 2: Sixty-nine [1969].  I'm sorry.  Sixty-nine [1969].  But the first Apollo flight, I think, was '63 [1963].  But, yeah (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yes, '69 [1969].  I think they started Alan Shepherd in '59 [1959]--
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: --he was the first guy to actually go into--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --what people call space, and then [astronaut John] Glenn orbits in '61 [1961].  And then there's a progression to '69 [1969] when--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --we put a man on the moon.  You're about eleven?
Speaker 2: I was--yeah.
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) You're eleven years old.
Speaker 2: That's right.  I was young.  So--
Speaker 1: So they're in your formative years, NASA, Cape Canaveral [Florida]; all that is--
Speaker 2: And those were some interesting years, because if you think about that timeframe, the Space Program and the investments that we were making in space technologies, it was a--it was actually a lot--sort of the Civil Rights Movement, an influence during that time.  I can remember when I was in high school, it was a much heavier emphasis, in my opinion, on, on higher education; at least the messages coming from, from our government.  So those were some--that was sort of, I would describe as a very interesting--interesting period of time.  And I would say some of these influences, like, the space program, some of the things that I was interested in in terms of understanding of how television broadcasting worked, you know, I think all of those influences allowed me, you know, to continue to develop an interest in science and technology.
Story_ID: 28823
Speaker 1: Well, I'll just kind of walk you through school.  We'll talk about maybe some, some of your mentors in school.  Where did you start to school?  Who was your first ele-- school?
Speaker 2: My first school is Allapattah Elementary [School, Miami, Florida].  And then I went to the middle school.  One year at a school called Robert E. Lee, which was for the ninth grade.  And then high school was a school called Miami Jackson Senior High School.
Speaker 1: Well, let's kind of go through one at a time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Allapattah Elementary, you were there through the entirety of elementary school (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: That was grades one through--let's see.  One through--the elementary was one through five.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's about right.
Speaker 2: And then I think the middle school was six through eight.
Speaker 1: Now, in grades one through five, did you have any science at all?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, yes.  I think back then it was mostly the basic earth sciences and, you know, those types of sciences.  And then middle school became a little bit more advanced.  And then, in the ninth grade, that's when it started to get a bit more heavy, when you start to get into the biologies and the chemistries.  And then, then high school was advanced biology, chemistry, and things like, things like physics.
Speaker 1: So were you--I know you were valedictorian in high school--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --so were you a good student all the way through?
Speaker 2: I was--I think I was a very good student.  I mean I--it turns out that I actually enjoyed learning.  I actually enjoyed studying.  And, you know, so at least from that perspective, you know, if your interest level is high, you know, the degree of difficulty in terms of getting through it, you know, that it was a lower degree of difficulty.  So I really--I really enjoyed the opportunity to learn or to study new areas, you know.  So it was--I would argue it was somewhat natural for me.
Speaker 1: Okay. But you're saying the level could have been higher in terms of stimulation from the schools that you attended (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: No, no.  I would tell you, I would say I'm somewhat fortunate, you know, given my--the environment that I grew up in where my parents, they were very focused on the next generation improving their, their quality of life through education; very, very focused on that.  So it, it was structure and discipline around during well academically.  So I was fortunate from that viewpoint.  I think the other piece of the equation is I was genuinely interested.  And then I would say the third part of the equation, I actually had teachers that really invested in their students.  So, I think, given the fact that I demonstrated interest there was clear interest on their part to invest in me, and encourage me to go as far as I can.  Now, I actually had some teachers that would stretch me.
Speaker 1: Well, let's name some of these teachers.  Any, any at Allapattah Elementary (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.  As a matter of fact, my most memorable teacher at Allapattah was Dr. Hartfield (ph.).  He was my math teacher.
Speaker 1: Now, was he a Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: No.  He wasn't a--no.  I don't think he was a Ph.D.  But he had a rather disciplined way of making sure: A, you did your homework; and then B, you were actually comprehending the subject of math.  He had an interesting technique where he would randomly call on you in class, and you would have to perform real-time on the, at the time, chalkboard in front of your fellow classmates.  And it actually forced, I would call it a behavior of being prepared, because in the classroom real-time, you could be called on at any moment.  And the last thing you would want to do is to be up in front of the class, not being in a position where you can--where you, where you can tackle the mathematical problem at hand.  And he had this-I thought it was a rather interesting technique that kept everyone at the top of their game. And so very, very, very memorable in terms of Dr. Hartfield, or Mr. Hartfield.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Anybody else?
Speaker 2: I can go through--I had guidance counselors; Mrs. Lipton (ph.), who served as, as a mentor.  Mrs. Tellus (ph.), who served as a mentor.  And in all cases, they were strong believers in, you know, a solid education, and they were very instrumental in, you know, giving me guidance and counsel in terms of how to manage my, you know, my education through middle school and high school.
Story_ID: 28824
Speaker 1: Tell us about Mrs. Johnson.  That's one name we left here.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Mrs. Johnson was very instrumental in my high school years.  She was my guidance counselor.  And I actually had the good fortune of seeing Mrs. Johnson last year at a recognition event for Dade County [Florida] schools, where they were recognizing some of their more successful alumni that left the area and has done well--has done well in business.  And I actually had the--a great opportunity to see Miss Johnson.  The last time I saw her was in 1976 when I graduated from high school.  So she was very instrumental in my education process as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you were about ten years old, this is the year when Dr. Martin Luther King's assassinated, and there riots all over the country, and I'm assuming in Miami too.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Was this rough year for you?  You were in your last year in elementary school, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And that was an interesting, I think, era in time.  Well, quite frankly, it was a lot of stress in the environment.  And, you know, for such a national icon to be assassinated, it was--it was impactful, I think to all age groups, you know, because of what he stood for.  And I also remember, because, you know, given Martin Luther King, the investments that we're making in the Space Program; it was a period of time where it was just a lot of interesting dynamics occurring in America.
Story_ID: 28825
Speaker 1: This was also the year [1968] that I actually in martial arts.  And one of the things that I recall very vividly during my childhood is the experiences that I had as part of being in the martial arts, which is something I studied from ages ten through--and to when I became an adult.  And, quite frankly, this was, I would say, one of the other recipes around, you know, my overall, I think success in life.  Because, again, I did grow up in a very challenged environment.
Speaker 2: So what was it, a dangerous environment, in terms of (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: In some respects, because many of the kids I grew up with, they became--they were lost in terms of the elements of the environment in the streets.  And like, you know, any challenged environment, you have various conditions you need to deal with, and a large portion of that is making smart decisions in terms of progression and survival.  And through the arts, the art section did some, I think, incredible things for me.  Of course, when you study the arts, a lot of it is about self-defense, but it also provides learning around discipline and control, as well (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Now, is there--yeah, but is there any particular incident that--or something that happened or somebody that you knew that was already involved in karate that got you involved?
Speaker 1: You know, it's kind of interesting.  I think I sort of evolved to martial arts, and maybe some of this came through the fact that read a lot of comic books and watched a lot of cartoons.   But, at a certain point in my life, it made a lot of sense.  At least we concluded it made sense for me, my brother, and sister to study the arts, because we, again very challenged environment; but at the same time, the arts offered more than, you know, self-defense, and it was actually a good experience in terms of the teachings around discipline and control.  And I learned so much from martial arts that I think it just applied to life in general.
Speaker 2: Now, were you looking for that kind of teaching about self-control (simultaneous) (unclear)--?
Speaker 1: Not initially.  I will be honest with you, you know.  Most of the motivation, initially, was really around, you know, having additional tools to--end the event that you needed to protect yourself, you had some capacity to do so.  But as you start to go through the martial arts process, you actually, you quickly realize at least this form of martial arts as really about--more about self-defense, control, and avoiding challenging or compromising situations.  And then if that was the last resort, then you had those tools to protect yourself.  And it was--I think it was a great platform for learning, because the discipline and structure, and actually a lot of the education; really understanding what the martial arts were about, how they-- the origin of the arts became, I would say, very--an instrumental of my development in childhood.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So this is Nisei Goju Ryu--
Speaker 1: It's called Nisei Goju Ryu.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Which is a Japanese form of the arts.  And it's Karate.  It's the form of Karate.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I know at one time they used to, in the community, we used to call everything Karate, you know (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Right.  That's right.
Speaker 2: Until Kung Fu came along, everything was (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: That's right.  That's right.  And Kung Fu and Taekwondo and other forms.  And each martial art, they have sort of a unique personality.  Karate was much more about power and forward moving, which again when you think about it, characteristics of Thor.  You know, so a lot of--I can pattern a lot of the things that I expressed interest in, there were similarities in common areas of convergence there.  But, the Japanese styles were much more about forward movement, and then it also was a lot of form in terms of, you know, style and grace, and in terms of what we call the Kata, which was a Karate dance.
Speaker 2: Now, did your parents get you involved in this?
Speaker 1: My parents, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My parents got us very involved.
Speaker 2: Because I was thinking there, since your sister and your brother, too, I mean, you know, that sounds like your parents got you all in--
Speaker 1: And some of my early experiences in terms of traveling with groups of people participating in martial arts contests around the United States, those were also some very favorable memories.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So where did you go, for instance, as a student; you know, I mean as a participant in tournaments and such?
Speaker 1: Well, we participate throughout--tournaments throughout the state of Florida.  We actually had opportunities to participate in tournaments in New York City [New York], you know.  So, we actually had a good opportunity to move around, you know, other states, places in Georgia and Alabama.  So, really had a opportunity to see more places--more places through the martial arts.
Story_ID: 28826
Speaker 1: So were you involved in anything like Boy Scouts [of America] or any other kind of a youth activity, Boys' Club, any of that, in growing up?
Speaker 2: Earlier, I was involved in Boys' Club, but most of my involvement actually ended up being around the martial arts, because it was--we would actually--the arts required participation somewhere between three to five days a week.  So outside of the martial arts, my other involvement would have been in sports, organized sports associated with middle school and high school.  But most of my focus was around the martial arts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now you achieved a black belt [in Nisei Goju Ryu, a Japanese form of Karate] by time you were thirteen?
Speaker 2: I was pretty well-accomplished at the age of thirteen, and, again, it was--it was one of these areas where I had deep interests and dedication.  And I was able to showcase and demonstrate my skills to the point where I was recognized as a black belt at age thirteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is that really pretty much for--
Speaker 2: That's pretty fast.  That's--as a matter of fact, it was--well, it's just very fast.  Different forms of martial arts may have different timetables to black belt, but Nisei Goju Ryu, for that form of Karate, that was, that was pretty fast advancement.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I think I heard you say that you've continued to (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: And I remain active.  I remained active pretty through my college days.  In my--I will probably say I became less active in my late to early--my late twenties or early thirties.  I am, today, probably mentally active versus, versus physically active.  And, again, when you think about the martial arts, a portion of it was mental discipline and, and mental training.  So some of those techniques, in terms of concentration and focus, I still, still use today.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, do they help you in business?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  When you--in the business world, you have to have a broad range of tools, you know, in terms of how you collaborate with people, how you focus, and then how you drive results.  And a lot of the lessons from martial arts, I think could be applicable to business.  And I remember my Karate Sensei would always talk about speed is the combination or is the combination of balance, focus, and timing.  And as I think about that equation, you know, a lot of that can be applied to business, because, you know, we work in a market environment where the market is moving at a certain velocity, the opportunities are based--the opportunities are time-dependent, the balance is around how you might make, make your investments, and then the focus is the markets you decide to select and the opportunities that you decide, decide to focus on.  So, you know, I think about some of the lessons from martial arts, and a lot of those principles apply to business as well.
Story_ID: 28827
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your middle school?  I don't think we got that.
Speaker 2: It was also Allapattah.
Speaker 1: Allapattah Middle [School, Miami, Florida]--
Speaker 2: And then for one year, I went to Robert E. Lee [School], and that was for the ninth grade, which I would presume ninth grade, I guess that's really considered the start of high school, so.
Speaker 1: Now, is this the beginning of bussing in Miami or integration?
Speaker 2: So, the Robert E. Lee was a funny one, because, yeah, some of that was associated with, with bussing.  And the school systems started to sort of restructure themselves.  And Robert E. Lee, before I--I think I was the first class at Robert E. Lee, and before that I believe it was--I know it wasn't a predominantly black school, but my year that I went there, it became more of, of a black school after they redistricted.  The bussing, that was part of the era of bussing and how do you start to redistrict school districts.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I just thought of the name, Robert E. Lee.  It probably was not a black high school.
Speaker 2: That's right.  (laughs).  That's right.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, and you went on to high school at--
Speaker 2: Miami Jackson Senior High School [Miami, Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was this a neighborhood school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was a large--it was one of the largest public schools in Miami Dade County.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm trying to remember how many students.  I want to say four thousand students.  But it was one of the--
Speaker 1: That's pretty big.
Speaker 2: --it was in the class of large public schools--in the large public school segment.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was the school predominantly African American?
Speaker 2: It was.  Although, we had flavors of Hispanic, and then over time, you know, other influences from, particularly, the Caribbean.  But, yes, it was primarily African American or black.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--okay.  So, you're in school from--until 1972, is that?
Speaker 2: I graduated from Miami Jackson High School in 1976.
Speaker 1: Seventy-six [1976.  Okay.  I'm sorry, 1976.  So.  Alright.  So, did you have a chance to take calculus in high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Had the opportunity to do calculus and physics in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is good, you know, that's a pretty good curriculum for a neighborhood school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I--it was--it was a very good school.  And, although the number of kids taking those advanced classes, it was a--as you can imagine--back then it was a smaller number.  Although, I will tell you, kids today, they get a lot more preparation to be in a position to take those types of classes.  But I was, again, fortunate because of my interest in education, the family support system, and strong mentoring, and, and teachers that really cared made sure that I was on a track where I was in a position to take both calculus and, and physics during my high school years.
Speaker 1: Now, were you free to make, you know, school your primary occupation?  Because I know some would either have to work, have a job or something to do in high school.
Speaker 2: No.  I was, actually, and then this is again back through my family principles.  My parents was really focused on making sure we got the best out of our education process.  And they were able to, you know, it wasn't like we were, you know, middle-class or--I'll call it--I should say middle-income.  Because when you think about the salary of a custodian and the salary of a licensed practicing nurse, we grew up in a very humble and modest, you know, environment.  But the emphasis for us was focus on our education, and then, sort of the goal was to make sure that the next generation improves the quality of life.  And so I actually thought my parents, in terms of--they stayed focused and they kept us focused.
Story_ID: 28828
Speaker 1: Now, now, you were valedictorian of your class.
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: And were you involved in other school activities?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was actually the student council president my senior year, and then all three years I participated in track and field.  And then, also, I was still doing the martial arts.  So I was a pretty--I was a pretty active student.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you have a chance to participate in any, you know, regional honors activities?  I know some people been involved in Boys--what do they call that with the government that the--
Speaker 2: Oh, oh.  No, no.  I--actually, my, my class didn't really get a lot of opportunities around that.  Although, I would tell you, Miami Jackson High School [Miami, Florida], and that was around 1978, which is the year my wife graduated from Miami Jackson, they started to get more actively engaged and involved in those different types of external programs, if you're--external honors programs, if you will, yeah.
Speaker 1: Like the Junior Council World Affairs.
Speaker 2: Right.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Boy's Nation (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now when you--so when you were a senior thinking about graduation, did you--you had a good counselor, Ms. Johnson you said it was.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And did--what were your aspirations, and how did she help you reach your goal?
Speaker 2: So I always wanted to be an engineer or a computer scientist.  And I'm--I've been trying to--you know, going back in terms of what influenced that.  Perhaps it was some early opportunities to work on, and believe it or not, it was IBM equipment. An old tabulating system in one of the vocational classes where we had an opportunity to write a small program using, at that time, punch card technologies.  And, you know, I concluded that that was one of the neatest things in the world, which I think helped influence a declaration I made pretty early in high school, that, "I will be a computer scientist, I will be an engineer."  And then through, you know, discussions with teachers, and counselors, and parents, that was encouraged.  That was encouraged.  I, I also wanted to go to, for whatever reason, Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia].  And I think some of that was influenced by, at that time, you know, in terms of exposure, I was getting exposure to, on occasion, of Georgia Tech football.  But I knew Georgia Tech was the school that was called the Rambling Wrecks, you know, and the engineers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it seemed like a cool school for (simultaneously) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: It just felt like the right--
Speaker 1: --engineer to go to--
Speaker 2: --it just felt like the right association.  And then, again, if you--my interests, I loved the maths, I loved the sciences; and then this wonderful experience with this punch card technology.  It just sort of all came together and made sense that I wanted to do creative-type work, build things and program things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, so,  you applied to--did you apply to any of the other schools?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, I did--I ultimately ended up applying to other schools, and it turns out, graduating from Miami Jackson, I didn't go to directly to Georgia Tech.  It was actually I indirectly went to Georgia Tech through what was called the dual degree program.  And it was a five-year program; three years at Rollins College [Winter Park, Florida], two years at Georgia Tech.  And the beauty of the program was you end up with two degrees.  So, when Rollins College expressed an interest, and we started to look at the programs that they had with Georgia Tech, I thought it was a pretty good deal to be a--to sort of concentrate and focus on physics at Rollins for three years, and then go to Georgia Tech for, for engineering.  And as part of that process, you have the experience at two colleges and universities, and then end up with two degrees in a five-year period.  So, although I applied to Tech and other schools like the University of Miami [Miami, Florida], University of Florida and Rollins College, and other schools, I ended up in this dual-degree, five-year program.
Story_ID: 28829
Speaker 1: But you initially, I guess, enrolled in Rollins [College]? Is that where--?
Speaker 2: Rollins, that's right.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Now, what's--tell us about Rollins.  Is that a HBCU [historically black college and university]?
Speaker 2: No.  Rollins turns out to be a very small college in Winter Park, Florida.  Rollins was a total of eleven hundred students at the time, twenty-four blacks on campus.  And they-they, they sort of discovered me or I guess we perhaps discovered each other about the same time.  But after I started looking at Rollins, and looking at the curriculum, and then looking at the partnership it had with Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia], it just felt like a good opportunity to pursue or spend some time at Rollins for three years in connection with two years at Georgia Tech in this dual-degree program.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, were any special teachers at Rollins that (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Dr. Ross, who was my physics and astronomy teacher, who, I would say, initially when I went to Rollins, he wasn't convinced that I would be successful in the physics program.  But over time, he became a very, very, very strong supporter.  And a lot of that was just demonstrated by, by my academic performance.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we maintained a very good relationship for a number of years after I left Rollins, graduated Georgia Tech. I was in the business world working for IBM.  So we've maintained a very good relationship for a number of years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, so did you get your degree from Rollins first or were they conferred at the same time?
Speaker 2: They sort of did it around the same time.  So it ended up being a, I guess, a Bachelor's of Arts with an emphasis in physics.  They actually awarded the degree in 1982.  And then my Georgia Tech electrical engineering degree, I received in 1981.  That was my first undergraduate degree.  So, in that dual-degree program, you know, Georgia Tech was '81 [1981], Rollins was '82 [1982].
Speaker 1: Now, was there a significant African American presence as student or as faculty members in either school?
Speaker 2: Georgia Tech--well, first of all, Rollins, no.  I'm trying to remember if it was any--it could have been maybe one black professor at the time, but--and some administration staff people; but in terms of teachers, no.  Georgia Tech, yes.  As a matter of fact, the black professor at that time at Georgia Tech was Dr. Dorothy Yancy, who actually became president of Johnson C. Smith [Charlotte, North Carolina].  She was actually president of Johnson C. Smith for a number of years.  And she taught--what did she teach?  She taught black history and heritage at Georgia Tech while I was a student--while I was a student there.
Speaker 1: Now, she's related to Dr. Asa Yancy, isn't she?
Speaker 2: Maybe the same--
Speaker 1: Could it be?
Speaker 2: --Dr. Yancy?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: J. Johnson C. Smith
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I thought the name was Dorothy, though.
Speaker 1: Oh, no.  I thought he--no, I'm saying, is she related?  I think she's related to Dr. Asa Yancy--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --the famous M.D.--
Speaker 2: M.D.?
Speaker 1: --in Atlanta [Georgia], associated with the (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: That could be because her roots were, her roots were Atlanta, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28830
Speaker 1: Was there a black student organization on campus?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, even at Rollins [College, Winter Park, Florida], although we had, you know, twenty-three, twenty-four blacks, we had a black student union.  And while I was at Rollins, I actually started a Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity chapter there, which was challenged in terms of being sustainable.  But we did have an opportunity to get a few people in partnership with the Bethune Cookman College, which is in Daytona Beach [Florida] not forty miles away, help us form one of the first black fraternities at Rollins.  But Rollins had a black student union organization.  Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia], on the other hand, had more representation there.  We had a black students union, we had NSBE, which was the National Society of Black Engineers, we had several fraternities and sororities on campus.  So Georgia Tech had a stronger base in terms of organized black organizations.  And, I'm trying to remember the black population at Tech at that time, but it was several hundreds of blacks on campus.  And the school population, I believe, at that time, was about eight thousand students.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, eight, including grads, it's probably eleven thousand students.
Speaker 1: Any of your fellow black students--I mean, are any of them that are noteworthy, that you remember today?  I mean--
Speaker 2: That was there at Tech with me?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see.  I would probably say the head of the--not.  I'm just trying to decide if he was there.  Dr. Gary Mays, who is now the head--
Speaker 1: Right.  He's the head of--
Speaker 2: --of the School of Engineering--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --at Georgia Tech.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Who else was around then?  And then I have a--I'm just trying to think--a couple of colleagues that's in pretty senior positions at various companies, like Georgia Power and Light, and some of the financial, financial firms that was, that was in school with me.
Story_ID: 28831
Speaker 1: So, off-camera, you said that Dr. [Andrew] Williams was there [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] before you, you think--
Speaker 2: I--yeah--
Speaker 1: --he's a robotics engineer in Milwaukee [Wisconsin]--
Speaker 2: I believe, if I have my time scale correct, he was there before me.  And I was there '79 [1979]--starting in '79 [1979] through '81 [1981], and then I took--I went--actually started with IBM, and I took a leave of absence from IBM to go back for my graduate degree.
Speaker 1: Dr. Gary May was there.  I think we mentioned in the last segment.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and he's currently--he's currently the dean of the Engineering School there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you said there was a chapter of that National Society (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.  The National Society of Black Engineers.  We actually had sort of a black students union-type of group.  Several black fraternities and sororities.  As a matter of fact, I started--I'm the founder of Kappa Alpha Psi at Georgia Tech, the chapter that's there now, actually over thirty years ago, which is still a very active and strong chapter there.  So, we actually had a major black Greek organization, fraternity and sorority at Georgia Tech.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were you able to maintain the same high standard of academic performance at Georgia Tech that you had in high school?
Speaker 2: Georgia Tech has it--had its moments, and it had its challenges.  And it's a very, very tough school.  And I will tell you, in 1979 when I showed up at Tech, the first year was a tough year for me.  It was a, I would say it was an eye-opener in terms of a lot of bright students, and the subject matter was extremely, extremely challenging.  And once I got my balance, I was able to get back to some of the academic performance standards that I, that I was accustomed to.  And it was an adjustment that I had to make.  So very tough start, but I would say a pretty strong finish.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I take it that your position at IBM came about through them recruiting you.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--now, was there a--who else was recruiting on the campus at Georgia Tech for (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: So, Georgia Tech, like many of the universities, have these career days where a number of companies come to campus to meet the students.  And this particular career day had a number of companies from the information technology industry.  So companies like IBM-- at the time, companies like Digital, Intel, Motorola, NCR, GE [General Electric], you know; so most of the major companies in the information technology industry.  And as part of that process, I was able to spend some time with IBM, and they expressed an interest in me.  And I was clearly interested in IBM based on some of my, my early experiences with IBM equipment dating back to high school.  So, they had a set of opportunities that interested me, and then that's how it all started in 1981.
Speaker 1: Now, was this a specific program for minority students, to increase the participation of African Americans at IBM?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  I wouldn't say that.  But IBM has always been a company that believed in a diverse workforce.  So, as part of their practice, they would look for--and they would--we would say this, and we still say this--we look for the best and brightest across any constituency in any geographic location.  So I happened to have some of the characteristics that IBM was IBM was looking for at that time.  And they clearly had some opportunities that I was very, very interested in.  And, you know, and I actually knew at that time IBM was the type of company that I would be interested in working in because of what they stood for, you know, clearly a technology leader in the marketplace.  But at the same time, it was a company that viewed diversity as a business; that if you want the best and brightest across various constituencies, generating ideas and making contributions that could make a difference in our industry, and that's what IBM stood for, and that sort of valued proposition resonated extremely well with me.
Story_ID: 28832
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about the history of IBM, since we have an opportunity here.  It has an interesting history, so if you could just kind of summarize it, and summarize the participation of African Americans in its history.
Speaker 2: So, IBM--we actually celebrated our centennial in 2011.  So it is a company that has existed for over a hundred years.  And in the beginning it was sort of a collection of three companies that came together, that formed what is known as International Business Machines today.  And when you look at IBM's history, we've been a company that has transformed or sort of remade ourselves multiple times over that hundred-year period of time.  And when you look at IBM, IBM has made significant contributions in pretty much every industry we can think of.  You know, when you think about the space programs, and Apollos, you know, the control systems and the systems that did all of the computations to put a person on the moon, those were IBM systems.  When you think about when [President Franklin Delano] Roosevelt decided he wanted to put in place a social security system, well, you had the challenge of keeping up with wages and hours; therefore, you had to have systems to do that.  And some of the first systems were IBM systems that enabled our social security system that we all know today.  When you think about the airline industry, you know, the first system which was called Sabre [first online reservation system] was based on IBM technologies, which allowed us to transform how you book airline reservations.  And you could even go even further back when the first challenge that we dealt with was how to count people.  And it was actually the census, where we built tabulating machines to do counting.  And then--now, when you sort of roll forward in terms of what we're doing today, most of the systems we build in some way helps major industries, whether they're financial industries, health care, manufacturing, automotive and there's transportation industries around the world.  So IBM has been an information technology provider for over a hundred years, and it is now a company that generates in excess of a hundred billion in annual revenues each, each year.
Story_ID: 28833
Speaker 1: When you joined in 1981--I have a note here that IBM had just introduced its first PC [personal computer] (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We entered the--
Speaker 1: The [IBM Personal Computer model] 5150 I think?
Speaker 2: The 5150.  We entered the PC market.  And in the early '80s [1980s], this was sort of a new category of computers where computers became personal.  So computers moved out of the centralized, managed environment in business to now you could have a computer on your desk or even in your home.  And IBM, in a very significant way, actually help build the market opportunity around what was at that time called personal computers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And just kind of--before--just kind of summarize what it was like prior to the personal computer, and what was the computer like when you were in college?
Speaker 2: So, the computers, when I was college, they were--we called them sort of like centralized systems.  And the reason they were called centralized is because it was typical a large system on a raised floor, in, in a sort of dedicated room.  And the number of users of this system was, was, was not pervasive.  It was a limited number of users.  So centralized resources supporting, supporting business operations.  And so when I was in college, it was systems like, you know, the IBM 360, which was built in 1964, which arguably was the, the first machine that established what I would call, the modern computer techniques that we use today, programmable systems.  I also worked on a class of systems that they called mid-range systems, and these were the (Vecs?) and PDP-11 systems.  So they were a smaller, sort of mid-class set of systems, but still had the same characteristics of being in a managed, controlled environment.  And those are the types of solutions that I worked on before the introduction of personal computers, which it sort of defined the new era of computing, we sort of call it the distributed era, where computing became more distributed and more pervasive, and it enabled more users of the, of the technology.  So, computer moved from a centralized operation of business to, you know, being distributed to lines of businesses and even computing in the home.  And so that's coined--that's why we coined sort of the term back then, personal, personal computers, because they (simultaneously)--
Speaker 1: Now, could--
Speaker 2: --became more distributed.
Speaker 1: --could a PC, in 1981, communicate with another PC--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There were some ways to do it, but they were not--let's just call it, consumable ways.  There were different techniques in terms of, you know, what we call attachment technologies that allow you to communicate.  But until you got standards and protocols like the internet, which enabled more users and new types of applications to make things more pervasive, you, we started to see a change in terms of computing and technologies going into the hands of the masses.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So this is the--the 5150 is a, is a desktop computer basically?
Speaker 2: It was a desktop computer, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And what was the capacity of it?  I mean, I mean, compared to, say, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, ('cause?) I know the number, but, boy, it was--if I remember right--boy, I don't.  I know the memory was, like, sixty-four--I want to say it was sixty-four K [thousand] bytes, which is (laughs), in today's terms, very, very small.  In other words, those systems back then, you couldn't do a sophisticated spreadsheet or download, like, music, as an example, or even download video content, like a movie, because it wasn't enough memory in the system to hold that information, and then to process that information.  And now we build systems where, if you just look at the capabilities, you know, those systems back then--some of the smartphones that we carry around today have more--much more storage and computing or computational capabilities than these desktop machines that we introduced in the early '80s [1980s].  And that's really a statement in terms of how the technology continues to advance and enable new applications and new capabilities and new, new solutions.
Story_ID: 28834
Speaker 1: Now, who were the rivals of IBM in those days?
Speaker 2: Back then you had--we had companies like, you know, let's see.  Radio Shack actually had a machine called, I think they called it the Track AD or something.
Speaker 1: And (unclear) it Tandy Corporation
Speaker 2: The Tandy.  Then you had companies emerge, like, Compact, Dell, HP, and a number of information technology companies started to make investments and enter the segment along with companies like Apple and others.
Speaker 1: IBM, I understand, was a big sales force in those days.  I think they had more employees.  And even today, IBM has quite a few employees.
Speaker 2: Well, IBM is a global company.  I mean, we do operations in over a hundred and seventy countries around the world.  We have well over four hundred thousand employees around the world, and we have a very comprehensive portfolio of business solutions.  And these business solutions include system products, software products; and then we also do services in terms of different types of services and in terms of helping companies deliver business, business value.  So a very comprehensive portfolio, and a global provider of these products and solutions
Story_ID: 28835
Speaker 1: So, you started out as a, in a, a researcher--was it in--
Speaker 2: In-- my first role at IBM was actually as a test engineer.
Speaker 1: Test engineer, right.
Speaker 2: And I worked on, at that time, products that connected to computers.  So these were print-up products.  So most computers, you need some form of output and reporting, and I had the opportunity to work on print-up products that are attached to our computer systems that allowed customers to print their information.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Those are the days when printing paper was that big paper (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: It was, yeah.  (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: --dot matrix--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Dot matrix (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Right.  Dot matrix printers with, you know, ribbon-feed cartridges and, you know, the piles of paper that would, that would float through these printers at high speed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so that was my first role.  And coming off of that role, I actually--I went back to Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] to get my advanced degree in electrical engineering.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Did--now, let's see.  So, you were--when you went back to Georgia to get your advanced degree in electrical engineering, you had a focus on computer science, I guess--
Speaker 2: Yes.  My focus at the time was computer, architecture, communication, and actually, optics.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, now what do you mean by optics as such in this context?
Speaker 2: So, in this context, using different types of materials to use in computer design.  So things like optical fibers and optical channels, lasers; so anything that was associated with refracting or bending of light.  And then you could connect optics to communications.  And even some of the systems that we're building today, they're beginning to use optical links and inner-connects within the systems to transport or move information and data.  So optics as applied to both communications and computers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, now, you're going to school this whole time that you're working for IBM as a test engineer, right?
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: And so was that--
Speaker 2: No.  No, no.  When I was a test engineer, I had graduated from Georgia Tech--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --worked for IBM for a year as a test engineer, full-time employee.  IBM was gracious enough to approve or allow me to go for a year, take off a year, to go get my master's degree; then I came back to IBM, and that's when I joined the PC, the PC company, when I worked on personal computer products.
Story_ID: 28836
Speaker 1: Now, what about your Rollins [College, Winter Park, Florida] degree in physic, was that--
Speaker 2: So Rollins--so the way that worked is, I was at Rollins from 1976 to '79 [1979]' Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia], '79 [1979] to '81 [1981]. I graduated from Georgia Tech in 1981, received my electrical engineering degree; Rollins in '82 [1982] awarded me my bachelor's of arts and physics; and in '82 [1982], I was actually--'81 [1981], '82 [1982], I was working at IBM as a test, test engineer.  And the Rollins thing was really how they timed things with graduation and a number of things.  But it was for that five-year period, from '76 [1976] to '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember Dr. Marc J. T. Smith?
Speaker 2: I know the name, but I wouldn't--I know the name.
Speaker 1: He should have been at Georgia Tech at the same time.  He's a fencer, you know.  He was in the Olympics at one time.  I don't know if you remember him, but he's at Purdue now.
Speaker 2: He's at Purdue [University, Lafayette, Indiana] now?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You say he's a fencer?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He was in the Olympics.
Speaker 2: I should have known him then.
Speaker 1: An Olympic fencer, too--
Speaker 2: Fencer.
Speaker 1: (simultaneous)-- as well as an engineer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But we interviewed him in the spring.  But--okay.  So are there any particular mentors at Georgia Tech that you've had or, you know, special teachers that--
Speaker 2: Let's see, special teachers, I would say my electrical engineering teacher, Dr. White, was instrumental.  Dr. [Dorothy] Yancy, she was very instrumental during my--the year I was there in graduate school.  So if I had--those were probably the two more notable.
Speaker 1: How did Dr. Yancy help, 'cause she's an historian, basically?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you know, I ended up developing a very good relationship with Dr. Yancy.  And so she was always there as this, you know, sort of an educator, strong figure, where I can have a broad range of conversations with.  So we ended up developing a quite unique, I think, mentoring relationship.
Story_ID: 28837
Speaker 1: Now, one of the products that you worked on with IBM, one that you focused on the most, I guess, in the--was the IBM ThinkPad, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, when did you start working on that, and what role did you play in the development of that?
Speaker 2: So, I had a couple of engineering management assignments where one of my roles was to work on our first portable, portable PC, where we basically took desktop technologies and made it mobile.  And I worked with one of our labs, and a lot of this development was occurring in a lab in Japan called--we called it the Yamato Laboratory [IBM Yamato Facility, Tokyo, Japan] where most of our work around packaging things in a smaller form factor, and making a mobile-based technology was occurring in Yamato.  So I actually had the opportunity to work with that team on those set of products.  And then to follow that up, I actually had the opportunity to work with the team that delivered the ThinkPad brand of products, where this became a very successful brand for us, where it actually took mobile technology to, I think, a leadership level in the industry, where we were able to start building personal computers that weighed less than seven pounds, and they ultimately became lighter, and lighter, and light.  But we were some of the first to introduce products that sort of broke that seven pound barrier.  And it used interested and new technologies, like, thin film displays that give you better graphics and resolution.  We used different devices for the human to interface with the machine, and we introduced the red pointing stick in the middle of the keyboard, when, at that time, the conventional way to deal a with a computer is type on the keyboard, or to use a separate device from the computer called a mouse, where you were able to move and sort of travel around the screen.  And what we did is, we said, "What if you get rid of that external device and put the utility device on the keyboard?"  And it was sort of a transformational thought in the industry that drove additional innovations around how you build mobile-type, mobile-type PCs [personal computers].  So a couple of opportunities.  And then I've actually had opportunities to work on other products within our portfolio that I think was equally exciting.
Speaker 1: But before we go on, how, I guess, how was--or what role did you play, I guess, in, you know--you've been describing some of the technology here in terms of making a desktop or laptop.
Speaker 2: So, the--when I was working on ThinkPad, I had a role that was called the operations executive.  And my job was to make sure that the dollars we invested in bringing out new products and technologies as part of the business equation, we would see a return on those investments.  In other words, I was supporting our business model in terms of driving growth from these new solutions.  So, in my role, I had oversight responsibilities with the team that was developing the product, to provide project management--product management, and then also to some degree work with our marketing and sales teams around market management once we introduced the product in the marketplace.  So it was a--it was a very interesting role.  And it was it really a role unlike some of the previous roles I had, where I was doing much more of the engineering.  This role, I actually had the opportunity to do much more of the management and the decision-making in terms of bringing the product to market.
Speaker 1: Now, I may have went too fast here, but--now, when did you work on ThinkPad?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see.  ThinkPad was--
Speaker 1: I know it was introduced in '92 [1992].
Speaker 2: Nine-two [1992].  So I worked on ThinkPad--I had to--this would have had to be around 19-let's see.  Let me get my years right.  So '89 [1989].  This had to be somewhere between '88 [1988] and '92 [1992].
Story_ID: 28838
Speaker 1: Tell us about some of your scientific work before you got involved in management, and then about the transition.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So the work that I did over the years, a lot of my work I did in my first year with the company was test engineering.  So this was, actually, certifying our products to make sure they did their intended function.  And as part of that certification, we looked at, to make sure that the product was safe in the marketplace for the consumer.  So we do a lot of different things to make sure that the product, in all respects, from noise, heat, temperature, that it was safe for the consumer.  Then after that, I moved into working with our PC [personal computer] design teams, designing these systems.  So I led teams in terms of building a lot of our early desktop products.  I worked with teams in terms of building what we called the first server product.  This is the Intel--using Intel and Microsoft technologies.  I worked with teams to build those types of products, and I also worked with the teams, as I described, building some of our first mobile products in an engineering and management capacity.  And what that means is, we had the responsibilities to come up with the concepts of the product, come up with the architecture of the product, the design of the product, how it gets manufactured, and then work with the marketing and sales team in terms of how the product will be sold in the marketplace to businesses and consumers.  So most of my role was to come up with the ideas in terms of the features associated with the product, and then design it in a way where we can build or replicate the product, and then support it through our marketing and sales channels.  So it was sort of end-to-end, life-cycle process, where most of the engineering was on the front end in terms of conception, architecture and design, manufacturing, and then release to the market.  And I was pretty much the guy that worked with the various teams from concept through release to the market, that entire life cycle of the development of a product.
Story_ID: 28839
Speaker 1: How many, say, engineers will working on--would form a team to work on something (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Okay.  So it depends on the complexity of the product.  But we can have literally thousands of engineers working on a product.  So, a good example is, when we were doing the, the ThinkPad product, we would have--and there are several types of engineers, because you have some engineers that do the testing, some engineers that do the design, some engineers that do the manufacturing building of the product, and then you have programmers or software developers that build the software and applications.  So when you start to add up that total community, it could be literally thousands of people working on building a computer product.  And a good example of that was when I was--the last group I had in IBM, I was assisting some technology group, I actually had an organization of about thirty-five thousand engineers and programmers that was responsible for building our portfolio of our products.  And these were engineers and programmers across multiple labs, forty different labs around the world with various capabilities.  Because when you look at a computer system, there are different types of components of a system requiring certain types of skills and expertise.  And when you start to add that up, it can literally be thousands of engineers and programmers on building a system.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, back to ThinkPad, again, what's the significance of the name ThinkPad?
Speaker 2: You know, it was--branding is an interesting art form.  And, you know, IBM has always been associated with the word, "think."  You know, it dates back to the founder of the company.  And we just felt that sort of using the word, "think," and in an extension of that would be a pretty good way to describe the product, because at the time, it was a very innovative product where we really packaged some of the latest technologies into a mobile package so that the thinking was the "think" brand, and the "pad" being the mobile product.  And so the combination of the two is how we positioned the product.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah.  Think being the motto of IBM--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --from way back to 1911.  Okay.  So the--what were some of the--were there any--now, by this time, I know Apple's got, you know, its Plus [Apple Plus personal computer] and SEs [Macintosh SE personal computer] out and some other models.  I mean, Apple--what was--was IBM thinking about what Apple was doing (laughs)?
Speaker 2: I think we've sort of been--we've always had an approach to the market that focused on solving problems for our clients or enabling them, enabling them with capabilities that would allow them to, you know, generate better value from the market.  So most of our focus is concentrated around business solutions for our clients.  And back in that timeframe, you know, that was our focus.  Now, as you know, today if you sort of roll forward, as we see the market and the opportunity changing, we're no longer in that--providing those types of computer solutions, because, again, the world constantly changes, and IBM is a company.  When you look at our hundred year history, we've focused on--and stay focused and invest on innovation.  And we do change the company and our approach and our investments are consistent with the movement in the market.  So back then, that was a great segment.  It was a significant portion of our business.  And overtime, as we start to go into this next era of computing, where intelligence is being embedded into things that don't normally look like a personal computer, and we think the world is becoming more cognitive, and we're going to start to build more learning type systems, we're now making those investments and working with our clients on those types of innovations.  And this was a segment of the market we were in for, what, two decades.  And the opportunity for us no longer made sense since some of the other opportunity spaces working with our clients made more sense in terms of providing them more value.
Story_ID: 28840
Speaker 1: Describe the transition from being an electrical engineer primarily to being part of management.  And is that--is that something that was usually done in those days?  I mean, 'cause I don't think it is anymore from what I've been told, and I think it's more from the management, you know, graduate school for management and then into, you know, big-time management without--it'll be harder for electrical engineer to do that today.  That's what I hear (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But I would tell you, the transition--I think it was, it was natural for me.  And, although today when you look at--if I gave advice to kids today, I mean, you know, engineering is still a great profession, and then connected with a business, a business degree, is more of the model for today.  But back when I grew up in the company, being really strong, I'm in engineering disciplines.  That transition to management, it wasn't a very difficult transition, because most engineering projects, you need a broad range of capabilities.  You need the experts that understand the technologies and the architect and the systems structures, but you also need people that understand how all of that works together, and at the same time, manage it within a business process and a market context.  So my role sort of evolved in those areas.  And I think by having the practical experience of engineering and building products, it actually allowed me to be a more engaged and connected manager and leader, because understanding the products and technologies, and then connecting that with the market and our clients, I actually think was--proved to be a pretty good model for me.  Not just for me, but for others in our industry.  And as--and you sort of, like, look at the--how managers and leaders are being developed today.  I do--I still think you still have to have some foundational capabilities and some of these management and leadership capabilities to be the most effective business leader or, or business innovator, because you're going to need those capabilities.  And when you hear me talk about a notion, I call it the movement from being I-shape to T-shape.  You know, I honestly think you really need to be really deep and good in a domain.  But at the same time, you have to have the broad set of capabilities, including business accruement, critical thinking, you know, collaboration skills, how to build a business process and the business plan in terms of managing technologies and various business solutions.  So, to me they're somewhat very inter-- interlinked and connected.
Story_ID: 28841
Speaker 1: I know, just reading the history of IBM, IBM culture fostered something called the open-door policy.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right?  Where it--describe that for us, and did that facilitate your, you know, transformation from more engineer to manager?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm not sure if there's a direct correlation between our open-door policy.  But what the open-door policy in IBM provided, it provided an environment where, you as an employee, had the opportunity to communicate to anyone in your management or leadership chain--chain or chain of command or organization.  And it was as a good practice, and it continues to be a practice in our company where employees should have the flexibility and freedom to express their point of views to various levels of management.  And we describe that as the open-door policy in IBM.  And employees can take a broad range of things to management.  And it's highly encouraged that you work with your, you know, your first line or your current management; but it was also encouraged that, depending on the scenario or the opportunity, it was highly encouraged for you to have the opportunity to work with other members within your management structure.  And that's why it was called an open-door, because the manager's door is open to the population independent of where you work in the organization.  And now, there could be a correlation to that in terms of how that has helped me over the years.  But I honestly think the key for me was being able to work well with my colleagues, being able to deliver results against my assigned tasks, and also being somewhat aggressive around, you know, making sure I'm making a difference and making an impact.  And as I make that difference and impact, it was known by somebody.  And I think that was the recipe for me.  I've always had sort of three things that I--sort followed me throughout my career.  You know, I have fun on everything I work on, because it's contagious.  And if I'm not having fun, then I think it's my responsibility to figure out how to do--to do something else.  I've taking risks in terms of working on tough, tough problems and opportunities.  And, you know, the third thing is, you know--if, you know, if you take risks, I mean, you clearly want to be--you want to prudent risks, and then you want to be known for something by somebody.  So if you think about those principles, having fun, taking risks or prudent risks, and being known for your impact, that has been a pretty good, I think, set of conditions or recipe or me.
Story_ID: 28842
Speaker 1: So, what was IBM's strategy with the ThinkPad, I guess, in terms of marketing it, you know.  I think I as--well, I know we discussed it on the phone.  We were talking about the massive sales force of IBM being able to get behind a product and push it.  But a lot, you know, a lot of people, you know, tout the Apple products, but they don't get out there like IBM.  I mean, it was they're--what's the thinking behind IBM's strategy?
Speaker 2: So, most of our focus has been whatever color--enterprise of commercial, business clients versus, say, consumers.  So the thinking around the ThinkPad was, it was a mobile PC [personal computer] for the business environment, and for business application.  Now, clearly, the product actually beyond the business environment, where small businesses, and even individuals, purchased the ThinkPad for their, for their personal computing use.  But our positioning--and when you even look at IBM today, most of our investments are targeted at providing enterprise or commercial business, business solutions.  Those--that is sort of the market or segment we really focus on.  And you can sort of look at IBM's history in terms of, you know, the solutions that we've been providing over, over the decade in terms of enabling businesses, the productivity and value-based tolls, so that they can--that they can run their business.  So the position around the ThinkPad was very consistent with our market approach than--and even if you look at our market approach today, around some of the new systems that we're doing, whether it's in our hardware portfolio, software service portfolio, or new solutions like Watson, which is our new cognitive system, that is very focused on enabling applications and capabilities for, for business.
Speaker 1: I know when we talked about this on the phone, and I wasn't told to say this, but we used ThinkPads at [The] HistoryMakers from the, I guess, from 2002.  And when I got there she had all ThinkPads, and she mentioned that she [Julieanna Richardson] liked them because they were durable and reliable, basically.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And, you know, she could afford them, and then they were, you know--
Speaker 2: But, so, when you look at a lot of the attributes of the ThinkPad, and then this just builds off of IBM's heritage, you know, quality is, is a top focus. Quality, reliability, and serviceability of our products.  And also, when you look at some of the large systems we build, availability of the products, because you're going to want the capabilities available when required.  So those are sort of standard hallmarks of performance or excellence for us.  And the ThinkPad benefitted from that as being part of the--part of the IBM brand.  So a number of clients would say, "Innovative solution with some great technologies and capabilities that enable mobility, but at the same time, vary reliable, you know, and quality-based, quality-based product."
Story_ID: 28843
Speaker 1: Now, IBM went through a restructuring in 1988, I believe, right?  Could you tell us about that, and how did that affect research and development?
Speaker 2: So, it turns out one of the constants in IBM is our commitment to long-term research and development.  And this is a company that really, really doesn't waiver from that, you know.  So when you look at how the company started, and even when you look at our profile today, we continue to invest heavily in R and D, in research and development, because we have an innovation agenda, and we do believe innovation is part of--part of the capabilities in the--and solutions that we provide to the marketplace.  This point on restructuring, just like any company, we have been faced throughout our history--not once, but it's been times in our history where we were challenged in terms of sustaining our growth, and, you know, continue to make a difference in the marketplace.  And that was sort of an inflection point for us back then, where we actually had to rethink our overall portfolio and the focus of the company.  So we made adjustments.  And like any, I think, market leader or high-performance company, they are willing to deal with change.  And, you know, I think that's one of the hallmarks of, you know, a company that has survived for a hundred years, that we are willing to deal with making change, and we continue to invest in innovation.  And I think if you take those two principles, those have been sort of foundational for, for IBM.  And even when you start to look at where we are today, we are already asserting, and have been asserting, that as we see the future, moving forward, we think that there is a new wave of computing.  And we've already started making the investments.  We've actually already delivered some products to the marketplace that will start to, you know, deliver on what we're describing as the cognitive era of computing; you know, the ability of, you know, systems that will have more learning techniques built into the systems as opposed to this current era or the previous era that we've been was more about programmable systems.
Speaker 1: Okay  Okay.  Now, in '93 [1993], you know, IBM was experiencing a downturn when Louis Gerstner--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah, Lou Gerstner joined the company.
Speaker 1: --became the CEO [chief executive officer].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--well, there was this dramatic acquisition of Lotus, you know.  Now, what were your thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: Well, Lotus--so, first of all, the point on Lou joining the company, he actually the--I guess, the first--he was the first CEO in our history that was hired from the outside; not a heritage IBM--IBMer.  And I think he did some fundamental things to help, sort of, get IBM back on a growth track.  And it was really going back to what we were good at - focused on the client and making sure that we are making the investments that will make a difference for the marketplace and our clients.  And, as you can see, throughout his tenure along with the senior leadership team, we made, again, the necessary adjustments and changes to get us back on the growth path that, you know, back on the growth that we wanted to be on.  So when you look at Lou, he did make a difference through his leadership along with other leaders across, across the company.
Story_ID: 28844
Speaker 1: At that time [1993], now, you went to Harvard Business School's Program for Management Development [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now this is a program that was a short-term program--
Speaker 2: It's--you think of it as the Harvard Program for Management Development.  It's sort of like a compressed MBA program.  And this is back to some of the earlier points I was making around it was a program that helped tune your skills in areas of management, leadership, marketing, other domains or areas, or other areas beyond just, say, in my case, engineering.  So it allowed me to add some additional tools as a manager, as a leader, in terms of having more capabilities, in terms of managing, you know, complex projects and driving new opportunities and new, new spaces in the marketplace.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in '95 [1995], you become vice president of commercial desktop systems.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right?  Now, what were your responsibilities?
Speaker 2: So at that time, I had responsibilities to over--I had the oversight of the development community.  And this was the team of people that had the responsibility to, to conceive, architect, design, and build our portfolio of desktop computers.  So it was, in a sense, a much larger job and a bigger portion of our PC [personal computer] portfolio.  Some of my earlier jobs was either working on a single product, or a manager of a group that provided a single product.  This was an opportunity for me where I was managing a portfolio, or multiple products as part of my overall management responsibilities.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now you addressed it somewhat, but what's the--can you give us any idea of the proportion of resources spent on new technology versus sales?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a tough way to look at it.  But--and I'll give it to you at a macro-level view.  So the IBM Corporation, on an annual basis, we spend $6 billion on average in research and development.  So it's a fairly sizable number in terms of the investments we make around new product innovations and new services and solution offerings. So a very significant part of our business.  The company is also organized where we have a large global sales force with direct sellers, our resources in a hundred and seventy countries around the world, and we also work with business partners as well, in terms of reselling our products to various market and client opportunities.  And then we have, as part of that structure, a market and a communication group that works with the engineering teams and the sales team in terms of positioning and promoting our products in the marketplace.  And some of the roles that I've had in the company, as a general manager, allowed me to oversee that process end-to-end; from the product development innovations to how we market, brand, and position our products, to how we enable our, our sellers and business partners to sell our products.
Story_ID: 28845
Speaker 1: Give us some idea on, on the impact of the acquisition of Lotus [Development Corporation] to (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: So, Lotus was one of, one of our [IBM] earlier acquisitions that allowed us to extend our software portfolio.  And then--
Speaker 1: Just kind of explain for those who may be watching this in the future and don't know what Lotus is.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So Lotus was an acquisition of a set of products, and I will call them business productivity product, that allowed you to do things like, spreadsheets, or word processing, or, or graphics, freelance drawing, charts and graphics.  So it was a suite of business solutions.  And we acquired Lotus to extend our software portfolio.  And that was one of some of the--one of the early acquisitions that we've, that we've done in IBM.  And if you sort of roll forward to today, we have done literally hundreds of acquisitions.  Many of them have been software-based to enable our, our portfolio of solutions.  And IBM is one of the largest software providers in the world.  When you look at the breadth of our capabilities in terms of database, software that allows you to, sort of, file and store information; our collaboration of software which allows you to interact with others; and then some of our tools, rational software in terms of tools that help developers build software capability.  So a broad portfolio of capabilities in our, in our software portion of our business.  So acquisitions is part of our business model, and when you put that in combination of the $6 billion that we do in research and development, designing and building new solutions, and then also acquiring certain capabilities in the marketplace, and Lotus was an early example; this is how we build a complete end-to-end portfolio of solutions that supports, you know, the needs of our client base.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, in those days the chief rival for Lotus, I guess, would be Microsoft, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  And--
Speaker 1: Was there a relationship between--I guess a few people would probably want to know the history.  What was the relationship between IBM and Microsoft in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, so, IBM and Microsoft, most of our early involvement was around when we created this market segment called the PC [personal computer].  And some of the major capabilities in the systems was, you now, the system design and technologies that IBM provided, the microprocessor from the Intel Corporation, and then Microsoft had software solutions that, when you package these together, we provided what was called a personal computer solution.  So, Microsoft was a partner in many respects, in terms of delivering PC solutions.  And it's just like any market or any set of market conditions where their business, as they scale their business, and as we continue to scale our business and provide complete solutions, there were some areas that we, even today, we continue to collaborate, and then there're some areas where we compete in the marketplace, and that competition is based on the client making the decision in terms of what's the best solution and set of capabilities for their business.
Story_ID: 28846
Speaker 1: So, this takeover of Lotus [by IBM] was a big business splash in nineteen, I guess, eighty--I mean '93 [1993], I guess.  Yeah.  So, and there was--but, now, you became--there was something called Notes that Lotus had that was--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Lotus Notes.
Speaker 1: --supposed to be really big at one point.  And it was for a minute, but it didn't--
Speaker 2: No.  Lotus Note is still part of our portfolio, which is more of a--the main utility in Lotus Notes was the email capabilities.  And that's our email system that we still use today here at IBM, and a number of large clients around the world use that as their email system, you know, to run their business.  And then we have other extensions that we built off of LOTUS in terms of the ability to do texting or Sametime.  The product is called Sametime, the ability to send messages.  So think of it as an integrated platform for email and messaging and managing your calendar.  And we continue to use that product to run our business as well as we provide those capabilities and solutions to other companies.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  Okay.  So that's what that is.  Now, this is the late '80s [1980s] is when--email starts in the early '80s [1980s], I guess.
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: And then it doesn't really, really start picking up a lot of speed until late '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Late '80s [1980s], right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Then by the '90s [1990s], it's really--
Speaker 2: And it's boom. And when you start to think about today, a lot of our communication is different forms of collaboration beyond email.  When you think about the role of social media and how that is transforming how we, how we communicate and collaborate.
Story_ID: 28847
Speaker 1: Now, I think the next big role that you had was in becoming the general manager of the UNIX server division [of IBM].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what is UNIX? I know it's a platform, but how is it different from what you were using before?
Speaker 2: So before we were--I was working on systems that was built primarily on Intel and Microsoft technologies.  And a lot of innovations from, you know, we would couple IBM package, IBM technologies around it.  But our UNIX platforms were a--I'll describe it as some of our large system infrastructure capabilities, where large clients that require high-performance systems that can grow and scale as their business or demand changes, was these types of systems that I built, which was a family of products called the RX-6000, which is now today called our System-P or P-Systems--power systems, based on a set of technologies or technologies from what we call our power microprocessor family of solutions, coupled with a software environment that we build, that is running, you know, is using a UNIX operating system, environment.  And these systems go into large banks, you know, transportation environments, design environments where high performance and then reliability, and then scale is required for these application environments.  So a very large system segment for IBM.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, is it--back to our earlier question, could a non-engineer actually manage something like the UNIX division?
Speaker 2: The answer to your question, it's possible that a non--let's just call it engineer or computer scientist that can manage UNIX--but I will tell you, it is much more enhanced if the person really understands technology and systems design.  You know, because a lot of these roles--let's say--it's not that much separation between the decisions you make associated with the technology, and the systems solution, and how that will resonate and connect in the marketplace with our clients.  And it is quite often that--I spend a lot of my time--I spend a lot of time in the lab with the engineers and programmers building these solutions, but I also spend a lot of time with our clients.  And a lot of our clients, when they talk in terms of their business and their applications and their solution, they also get into the details of the system and the infrastructure.  So a person in my role is much effective with our clients, when I can communicate with them at all layers.  You know, I meet with vice presidents of infrastructure.  I meet with chief technology officers who get more into the design and architecture.  At the same I meet with chief marketing officers, CFOs [chief financial officers], CIOs [chief information officer], and CEOs [chief executive officers], where they might spend more time on the marketing and the business value of the product.  So the role that I've been in, in terms of engineering connected with business, has made me much more effective in terms of dealing with a broad range of constituencies within our client base.
Story_ID: 28848
Speaker 1: Would you say that this period of time, I guess, the late '90s [1990s] or early 2000s is a time when there was, maybe, you know, is the time when there was the more collaboration on a part of engineering concerns to make a product?  I mean--maybe I'm--I know in the old days the automobile--see, Ford made all his parts at one time.  But General Motors had different, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --corporations around the country making different things, and they would shop, you know, for the one that think would work the best.  It seems the PC [personal computer] industry, that's just how--especially for IBM, that's how it works; that you would go--shop for the best solution.
Speaker 2: So when you look at--we actually have several different approaches to building systems.  One model you describe in terms of the integration of solution capabilities from multiple providers to build an integrated solution.  But we also build systems based on the investments that we make in terms of a total integrated solution.  And you'll see, based on the requirements of the design or the complexity of design, one of those models may be more applicable.  You know, so for the systems that we sort of call industry standard system, based on Microsoft and Intel technologies, that, to your point, was much more about collaborating with multiple players or providers of technologies in the marketplace.  Some of the more advanced systems that we're building, like, our Watson cognitive system, or even RS-6000, or even our mainframe technologies, a lot of that is based on direct investments that we make with our R and D [research and development] spending, and also some collaboration with partners, because you need to run solutions and applications that we work with third parties so that we can provide clients complete solutions.  So the development/delivery model is actually a hybrid model today.  And in some system designs, you'll get more working with industry partners.  And other system designs, you'll have much more of a balance in terms of working with business partners.
Story_ID: 28849
Speaker 1: IBM experienced double-digit growth in 1999, did--what would you say your role was in that in terms of--.
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.
Speaker 1: Were you big enough yet to have made an impact (simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No.  I think so.  Nineteen--let's see.  Nineteen ninety-nine [1999], I was--I was still working on UNIX, the UNIX systems. And this was a segment of our business that was very challenged.  We were not the market leader in this category of systems.  As a matter of fact, Sun Microsystems was the market leader.  I believe followed by maybe, perhaps, some HP; but we were a distanced third.  And by 2002, I believe, we actually turned this segment around.  And since 2002, we've been the market leader in this category of systems.  And a lot of that, again, was based on making the right investments around leadership solutions that connected to solving business problems for our clients.  And when we tuned our investments in a way where it was delivering true value for our client, we were rewarded with growth and more opportunities to do business with an extended set of clients.  So, yes, 1999 was the start of a turnaround in our UNIX business based on, I think, some wise investments we made and a better connection with the market and our clients.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Just the technical--not the technical note here I forgot to ask about in terms of UNIX.  Now UNIX, I've been told, is one of the first systems written in C language.
Speaker 2: C+ or C, yes.
Speaker 1: C+ or C?  Well, what is--why don't we talk about here, generic terms of that?  I mean, what makes that better than--
Speaker 2: Well, the C was just a method in terms of enabling programmers to write software or to develop software.  And this was just one of the tools, if you will.  And common--having common tools for programming or our software community is a good thing, because you have standards, and common approaches, and techniques to do things.  So C allows a broader community to build capabilities and solutions as a software tool.
Story_ID: 28850
Speaker 1: I have a note here also that in 1999, IBM saw itself as coming out with a cool, new attitude (laughs).  That's how it's expressed here.  Well, tell us about the cool, new attitude of IBM in those days.
Speaker 2: So 1999, a cool, new attitude.  So this was--this was around--a lot of the work that we were doing at the time was things called like e-business and solutions like that.  So, this particular year, we introduced a new--let's just call it, branding.  We started to introduce a new branding around our products, because we do think that some of the capabilities we provide are pretty compelling; and quite frankly, cool.  So when you start to think about things that we're doing today with Watson technologies, that's some really cool stuff, because it's going to transform things like health care and financial services.  And back then, when we were building some of these UNIX systems, and to look at the types of capabilities it was enabling our clients--it was actually enabling our clients to do some really compelling things, just given the advancements in the technologies and how it was transforming; how they would run applications and deliver business values.  So we felt that, at that time, you know, let's, you know, though we are focused on commercial and enterprise clients, these products are doing some very cool things in terms of enabling clients to do some really, really compelling and exciting things.  And so that was sort of the backdrop around that.  And I think we were using terms like, "cool blue," and it was a whole bunch of marketing positioning that we used at that time that was pretty exciting.
Story_ID: 28851
Speaker 1: Now, you told someone at a certain point that UNIX--the success of UNIX, I guess, was the biggest event in your career up to that point.
Speaker 2: It was.  I will tell you, that was probably the highest impact job I had in the--I had in the company, because, again, this was a business that was, frankly, in trouble.  And, fortunately, you know, working with a number of colleagues across the company, we were able to turn around this business.  And not only turn it around, we actually positioned it to be the market leader for its category, and it's still the market leader even today, in 2013, you know.  So a lot of hard work started in 1998, '99 [1999].  The turnaround started, and then we started gaining significant market share, became the market leader somewhere around 2002, 2003, and we haven't looked back since.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In 2000 [sic, 1998], you were forty-two years old, and you joined IBM's Worldwide Management Council.
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: So this put you at the highest level of management for IBM?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So the Management Council at that time was the top senior executives in the company responsible for significant portions of the IBM business.  So around that time, you know, running the UNIX business and then other large businesses to follow.  I was in a position where the roles that I had, had a material impact on the performance of the company.  So I was a member of the Worldwide Management Council, which is now the group that we call today, it's called the Performance Team.  So, you know, you sort of rolled forward today.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now your next big move was when you were promoted to vice president of development for IBM's Systems and Technology Group, right?
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Two-thousand three [2003].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about that.  How did your role change when you took that job?
Speaker 2: So that role became even a bigger development role, where I actually had the complete portfolio of all of the hardware products in IBM.  And, actually, before that I actually had a really interesting role for two years after I left the UNIX business - managing a group called Pervasive Computing, and was really interesting because we had a point of view early that said, "You know, computers will look different, intelligence is being embedded, and business processes and different devices, so it's going to change the landscape of the information technology environment."  So I worked on those technologies for two years, and then I moved into this role to manage our entire portfolio.  And it was a huge global role, because it was literally tens of thousands of engineers and programmers across various geographic regions, forty-plus development labs around the world.  And it enabled an $18 to $20 billion segment--$18 billion segment of IBM.  So very, very significant in terms of the breadth and the scope, scope of the role.

Speaker 1: In 2004, I guess, prompted by the new CEO, Lou Palmisano--
Speaker 2: Palmisano, yeah.
Speaker 1: --IBM actually sells its PC- PC [personal computer] business to Chinese-based Lenovo.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Lenovo.
Speaker 1: And what's your view of this sale?
Speaker 2: Well, the sale of our PC business to Lenovo, at that point in time, was the right, I think, time for us to sell that business, because, again, we started to see patterns in the marketplace where value was migrating to new spaces and into new areas.  And this was very consistent with the role I had after coming out of the UNIX business on pervasive computing, because we started to see where the PC was no longer the centerpiece in IT [information technology].  New types of devices were being enabled as part of the information technology environment.  And intelligence was moving into new types of devices, sensors, and actuators becoming part of business processes, even buildings.  You start to look at how intelligence was being--medical devices being embedded, smart phones, tablets.  So our view, at the time, was, you know, and this is traditional at IBM in terms of continued change and sustainable investments around innovation.  That was a point in time where we said it made more sense for us to focus on other areas of growth with our clients.  So the decision was, it became more straightforward over time where, since the PC was no longer the center of IT, this was an opportunity for us to sort of divest in that area and start to invest in other areas, like, more investments in software, more investments in services, more investments in what we're calling today smarter planet solutions, which some of the things that I worked on as part of Pervasive Computing, is consistent with some of the things that we're doing around what we call smarter planet solutions.  So our view was, the value and the opportunity was shifting, and it made more sense for us to focus on those new areas of opportunity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Was there any reason why China was--I mean, you have any analysis as to why China wanted to take over the PC business?
Speaker 2: Now, I'm not sure if--well, I mean, when we looked at the opportunity, Lenovo was, you know, among the list of interested parties, and that's who we ultimately closed the business, business transaction with.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they were really interested in still making PCs then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And even today, when you look at Lenovo's business model, they are--they continue to be a strong, you know, provider of PC-based, PC-based solutions.
Story_ID: 28853
Speaker 1: What is IBM, I guess, focused on today in terms of business solutions, you know--you mentioned the, the big star of IBM, the Watson, who's on Jeopardy (laughs).
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Is this actually the product that's being (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes, it is.  So we are witnessing a new era of computing.  And I honestly think this is one of the most exciting times for information technology.  I've been at this--I've been doing this for well over thirty years, and I can tell you I've never seen this amount of change and excitement in the IT [information technology] space.  So when you look at the four areas that we're focused on, we're focused on an area called analytics, and that's largely driven because we're seeing an unprecedented growth of data and information.  And a lot of this data and information is being generated from some of the points I made earlier, in terms of intelligence is moving into new types of devices in business processes, and it's generating new sources of data and information.  And analytics is a way, when you apply the analytics to that, you can extract new insights and new capabilities from that data; so big area of focus for us.  And Watson is a good example of these analytics type of systems.  And I'll come back to Watson.  The other exciting area that we're seeing is what I would describe as cloud computing.  And it's a talked-about subject, but a good way to think about it is, computing resources or information technology resources will have different ways that will be delivered to business users and consumer.  And cloud is a way to think about how the infrastructure continues to evolve in terms of how computing services will be delivered in a much more simplistic, simplistic way.  So cloud computing is a huge opportunity as we look forward.  The other one is a smarter planet.  And this is back to this notion where intelligence is being embedded, and because of that, it's actually transforming applications and industries.  So think about industries like health care or financial services, where now, because of how intelligence and technology is being embedded, we can, we can leverage that in terms of providing better solutions and, and higher value on an industry dimension and for, and for our clients.  So we're doing interesting projects, like smarter cities, where, because you have sensors and actuators being embedded in the cities, and with our technologies, we help on things like smarter transportation.  So doing things around better traffic flow and managing city operations, as an example. Doing neat things around smarter energy, or smarter water management, so using the technologies to provide a better, either public services or better value, to the, to the marketplace.  And then when you look at the other area we've been focused on, we have, as part of our strategy, a focus on what we call growth regions around the world.  And there are places like Africa, where they are going through pretty interesting economic expansion.  So we are playing more and more of a role in working with various countries across the continent in terms of helping them build out their infrastructure, whether it's the banking system of infrastructure, or providing better health care services, or better safety and law enforcement services, or energy and utility; so, opportunities around smarter or growth markets.
Speaker 1: That's mainly around installing new infrastructure-high-tech infrastructure in developing countries?
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28854
Speaker 1: In 2007--no, 2009, I'm sorry, you were named senior vice president and group executive at IBM; so IBM Systems and Technology Group, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this is a--so this is--the way that's stated here, this happened after your boss was arrested--well, but, just, you know, tell us about that.
Speaker 2: So, in two--I was--I became responsible for the entire group, and if you recall, my role before that was being responsible for our product portfolio, so I had the responsibilities to develop and build the products for the business unit.  And then I assumed the overall responsibility, which extended beyond just providing the products, but it included managing our worldwide operations, including marketing and sales, and playing more of a direct role, not only at the product level, but also at the business level with our clients.  So I became the overall group leader as part of that.  And then I was in that role up until, I believe, it was March of this year.  And now I'm in a new role where I have corporate strategy, and this is really the strategy for the IBM Enterprise, where I work with, you know, our CEO and Chairman, as well as our senior leaders in terms of, you know, the areas that IBM will focus on around helping our clients, and, also, sustaining the growth of our business; and also, being consistent in terms of maintaining our focus on the continued innovation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Basically around those same four areas that you outlined before?
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28855
Speaker 1: Tell us about the IBM Blue-Green System?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Blue Gene System.
Speaker 2: Oh, Blue Gene.
Speaker 1: Blue Gene System.
Speaker 2: Oh, Blue Gene--Blue Gene--no, no.  Blue Gene is a good example of some of the leadership capabilities that we deliver to the marketplace, and it is a--think of it as a supercomputer that performs some really, what I would call, leading edge or complex, you know, scientific and technical computations and applications. So Blue Gene is in some of the national labs around the world working on and solving some very complex problems.  And some of these problems can be in the area of things like DNA sequencing. You know, understanding--you know, applying computer techniques to have a deeper understanding of the DNA structure, or doing very complex fluid dynamics-type applications, or very complex applications around, you know, motion and management.  So a lot of different types of very complex scientific and technical applications that the Blue Gene has been deployed, deployed, deployed to do.
Speaker 1: Yeah, with specializing in low power consumption (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, actually, what makes the Blue Gene rather interesting when compared to other competitive or offerings from other companies is that, when you look at how much work it does for the amount of power it consumes, there is nothing that comes close to this machine.  So it is a green, if you want to use that term, a green supercomputer in terms of top, world-class, computational capabilities.  But at the same time, it does it in a very power efficient way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Two thousand nine [2009], you were awarded the National Medal of Technology in Innovation by President Obama [President Barack Obama].  That's for IBM, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Blue Gene was recognized in a very significant way by the president with the National Medal.
Story_ID: 28856
Speaker 1: Tell us more about Watson.  Now, Watson made its television debut on Jeopardy, and he beat everybody (laughs).  But he did trip over a couple of questions, but he basically beat everybody's pants off on Jeopardy.  And you say that he's--I mean, Watson, the mainframe Watson--is it being purchased by municipalities or corporations or--
Speaker 2: Yes.  So--yeah.  So I think--so I think Watson represents where this next era of computing is going.  And I think about Watson as sort of the first offering of a cognitive system, you know.  So, when we look at the history of computing, you know, the first era is about tabulating, counting things.  The current era that we are in was more about programmable systems.  And now we're moving into an era where I will describe as cognitive systems.  And Watson is the industry's first example of that.  And when you look at IBM's role across the all of those eras, we've sort of been sort of the leader and the catalyst in terms of enabling these eras; you know, the tabulating era, you know, we built tabulating machines.  When you look at the programming era, when you look at products like the 360 [IBM System/360, 1965 IBM mainframe computer system] and the other products that we built that enabled the era; and now this cognitive era, we see Watson and other offerings like that playing a very significant role.  And Watson has been busy since Jeopardy, you know.  Jeopardy was a good example to showcase the capabilities of Watson, being able to ingest large amounts of information and providing answers, you know, with confidence supported by evidence.  And we think this is going to be a new form of computing.  And we've already start to apply Watson to areas like health care, as an example.  And we've been working with clients like Memorial Sloan-Kettering [Cancer Center, New York, New York], and places like WellPoint [Inc.] and others, to apply Watson technologies to health care.  And then it'll be--we'll be applying it to other segments like financial services.  We also have solutions of Watson that we will be providing for, you know, decision support and call center-type applications, because you can start thinking about Watson in terms of the role it might play when you call about a problem or a concern, and you can have a dialogue with Watson, Watson is ingesting this information and other sources of information to respond back to you with the most appropriate answer, with a high degree of confidence supported by a wide source of evidence.  And we think Watson is, is going to transform the industry in terms of bringing these advance analytics and cognitive capabilities to many of the applications we know today.
Speaker 1: Is there a cultural--or do you try to make steps to make sure there's not a--that Watson doesn't have a cultural bias?  Because I know--I know it's been said by experts that certain intelligence tests have cultural bias.  They really demonstrate that there is a bias, you know, where Watson--I mean, where certain tests whether or not you think like a Minnesota white male or, you know, rather than--or how you are--you know--you know, in terms of how you approach a job of being a policeman or a fireman, and that sort of thing.  Is there a culturally biased--
Speaker 2: I don't think this will apply to Watson, because Watson will generate its, I'll call it response, based on the information and data it ingests.  And Watson will actually have the ability to look at multiple sources.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not just one source, but be able to aggregate multiple sources.  And then look at the credentials of some of these sources.  So I think Watson, when you start to think about it, is a tremendous accomplishment and set of capabilities, and again, as it gets applied to various industry opportunities like health care, and financial services, and decision support systems, we think that this is going to really start to transform the landscape of information technologies.

Speaker 1: I learned a couple of things about IBM I did not know in doing, doing this research.  One is that, IBM is, as of 2012, is the second largest employer in the United States.
Speaker 2: As of 2012.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  This is--yeah, it's the second largest firm in terms of number of employees.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We're pretty--we're--you know, as I said, you know, in terms of our global footprint, a hundred and seventy countries around the world, we have colleagues, you know, four, over four hundred thousand colleagues around the world working on a broad portfolio of hardware-software and services.
Speaker 1: And it's also the--that year it was the ninth--the ninth most profitable, and the nineteenth largest in terms of revenue.
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Also, in 2012, Virginia Rometty was named CEO [chief executive officer] of IBM, as the first woman CEO.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And probably the highest-ranking woman CEO in the country, I would think.
Speaker 2: Yes, I--well, I'm clearly-- my point of view, I think so, when you think about Ginni--we refer to her as Ginni, you know, when you think about IBM and then, you know, the opportunity that we have as an innovation leader with the, you know, the new leadership coming from Ginni, we're pretty excited about this.  And when you think about some of the--some of what I've been talking about around this era of computing, you know, Ginni has been sort of central in all of those new discussions and strategies moving forward, as well as many of the strategies that we put in place over the, over the last ten years.  So very exciting times for the IBM Corporation, and we do think we have one of, if not, the top leader in the information technology industry.
Story_ID: 28858
Speaker 1: Today, as you are the senior vice president of IBM Corporate Strategy, what are the prospects for young black people, in terms of being involved in IBM?  Who's--are there any young stars on the way up now, and what are the prospects for those starting out?
Speaker 2: We--IBM has always, I think, done an incredible job around building capabil--leadership capabilities that--you know, I think, it allows the company to sustain its image in the marketplace and its role in IT [information technology] as an innovator.  And one of my roles, and I have many roles in the company, clearly line of business roles and my corporate strategy responsibilities; but I also do a lot in the area of mentorship sponsoring, and I'll call it leadership development.  And we do focus on various constituencies, you know, women and minorities, in terms of being in position and having a rich pipeline for talent that can compete for various opportunities, and high-impact opportunities in IBM.  And this is something we've--we just do as a course of--as a course of business.  We are a highly diverse workforce.  You can look at diversity even on the point that I've been making earlier around geographic, you know.  So we are a highly diverse company, and we do believe in leveraging the talent across, across our business.  And that's one of the roles that I serve in as a senior leader at IBM.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there, are there any specific programs you can tell me about in regards to mentorship of minorities and women?
Speaker 2: Well, a good program is what I do.  I actively, and I have formal mentoring relationships with various employees in the company.  And some of these employees could be entry-level employees, mid-career employees, and even employees that are much more advanced, or executive-level employees.  And as part of that process through our mentoring and coaching sessions, I--I'm sort of an additional tool in terms of helping them think about their careers and helping them sort of navigate and leverage out various opportunities across the company.  And these are some--these are formal-type opportunities that we have in the, in the company.  So that's one, that's one example.  We also have diversity network groups in the company, where the various constituencies get together and share common and best practices as it relates to career development and career advancement.  So we have various communities that leverage best practices, you know, and techniques; and then we also have more direct things, like, senior leaders like myself that mentor various people across various constituency groups.
Story_ID: 28859
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about something called Strategy Fifty.  What is Strategy Fifty?
Speaker 2: So it's actually a group of, I'll call it, the strategy executives from some of our top Fortune 500 Companies, that get together on a periodic basis to talk about various patterns and strategies as it, as it relates to the market, and where it makes sense, things that they can share in relative to what they're doing, in terms of best practices within their business.  So it's a very good group of my peers across various industries in some of the top performing companies in our industry where we get together and, we share a common agenda around certain topics. We look at things, like, different types of market trends, where it makes sense.  If we're doing things in our business that we see where it makes sense to share more broadly across the community, we do that.  And it's been a pretty good group, I think, that is really driving, I'll call it, open collaboration, for the strategy officers in our industry.
Speaker 1: Who are some of the other companies involved?
Speaker 2: Oh, if you could--you could almost take the list of the Fortune 50 companies, and, more than likely, you'll find a representative from one of those, from one of those companies.  It's a pretty--it's a pretty strong group in terms of this representation.  Any Fortune 50 Company and the-that is providing IT [information technology] products and, and solutions.
Story_ID: 28860
Speaker 1: Today, do you see yourself as one day being the CEO [chief executive officer]?
Speaker 2: Well, it turns out I have a very--I like to think, critical and important job today, being responsible for the corporate strategy for IBM.  And I've actually had some really, really neat jobs over the years that, honestly, I think prepared me for my current opportunity.  Now, like, probably most people in my position, I will tell you that, you know, depending on, you know, circumstances and conditions and opportunities.  You know, being a CEO of a company is not a bad thought, but at the same time, I'll be honest with you, most of my bandwidth the focus has been around, you know, the pretty exciting role that I have today.  You know, I continue to make, I think, an impact in the industry from an innovation perspective, from a product perspective, even from a people perspective.  And when you think about a community like IBM and some of the comments that you've made in terms of being a pretty sizable employer, and sort of the role that I play across products, process, and people, I'm, I'm pretty busy and pretty well, well employed here.  And in terms of running a public company one day, who knows.
Story_ID: 28861
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything that you've done to this point today, what would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: My professional--?
Speaker 1: Legacy.
Speaker 2: So, I think, when it's all said and done, I feel pretty good about the impact and the contributions that I made.  Not only for my company, but also for, I think, the market.  But I, but I, (unclear) I think when it's all said and done, I really want to be known, I think, for making sure that I helped enable the next generation to stay on this path of innovation.  And, quite frankly, that's why I devote a fair portion of my time giving back in many ways.  You know, I serve on multiple boards at universities to make sure that we are thinking about the curriculum and academics the right way to enable various constituencies.  I personally sponsor scholarships for, for kids from underprivileged or challenged environments.  I'm beginning to seek out more on the opportunities presented by STEM, STEM Education, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, you know.  So my role, I think, as I look at it, is to help--hopefully, help the catalyst in terms of making sure that we're producing more engineers and scientists for the twenty-first century.  And it's an interesting thing.  You know, when I graduated from high school, you know, 60, if I have this right, 60 percent of the world's scientists were in the United States.  And I think that's--that is pretty accurate.  If you sort of look at it today, that number is now down to like 15 percent in the U.S.  And then I can also decompose that more in terms of what that means for various constituencies.  So, one of the things that I am really, really focused on is--and in particular, is making sure that the black constituency or the African American constituency participate in some of these STEM-related opportunities.  And there are some other statistics that says that, you know, when you look at sort of the sustained economic growth of the United States, you know, we're--about 50 percent of that growth comes from, you know, where only, like, 50 percent of the population in the STEM discipline is actually driving 50 percent of the sustained economic growth, and when you sort of--if you believe that statistic, that really suggests that we have an opportunity to create more and more scientists, technologists, some engineers, and mathematicians, because the opportunities are really, really ripe.  And I want to make sure that all constituencies have an opportunity to make a difference, whether it's participating, and, you know, the economic opportunities, or really making a difference in terms of, in terms of innovation.
Story_ID: 28862
Speaker 1: Would you say that most of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today lie in STEM [science, technology, engineering, mathematics] education (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes, but I would say first and foremost, I think, we need to make sure everyone gets a--an opportunity to have a shot at higher education, so that they can, at least, improve their odds for a better quality of life.  So, first and foremost, I think the focus should be on higher education.  But since I'm an engineer, I am clearly focused on how many more scientists and engineers and technologists and mathematicians that, that we can generate.  And it's also some discussion that's going around--well, should we continue to call this STEM or maybe a more appropriate term as STEAM, because when you start to including the arts--because when you start to look at the role of the engineer moving forward, this is--will be more and more about, not being good at just your engineering or your technology domain, but you also have the attributes and the skills and the qualities of being a business leader, being able to collaborate more, or having the--having good techniques around critical thinking, understand the financial models of financial management, how to deal with clients, how to make markets.  So more of this T-shaped individual versus, versus an I-shape individual.  So, a lot of the things that I'm really focused on is how to make sure we have a healthy pipeline so that, and specifically the black constituency can compete, for a better quality of--quality of life.
Story_ID: 28863
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about your family.  I know you got married in 1983 to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Michelle.  Michelle Collier Adkins.  We actually grew up in the same neighborhood in Miami [Florida], three blocks apart, went to the same elementary school, middle school, high school.  But I didn't really meet her until we were at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Beorgia].  I grew up on 38th Street, she grew up on 48th Street.  The highway actually separated us.  Although it was three blocks apart, it was a highway that separated us.  She graduated salutatorian of her class.  We had all of the same teachers, and, as a matter of fact, Mrs. Johnson was instrumental in making sure that when Michelle was a freshman at Georgia Tech, and I was a transfer student at Georgia Tech, we were able to connect and look after each other since we were from the same hometown, and sort of the rest of story fills in that, when we met, we decided that it was interest in, in a number of areas.  And she's been part of my life since, yeah, since 19-19-- 1980--19--I'm sorry, 1979.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have children?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We have two boys.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what are they doing?
Speaker 2: Our youngest son is about graduate from Georgia Tech, which is where Michelle and I graduated from.  Michelle graduated from the School of Management.  She went into the accounting arena.  And youngest son is now a student there, who will be graduating next semester, and he's doing sort of an interesting major, which is a combination of sort of art, technology and business.  And he's a very accomplished and gifted artist and animator.  And then my oldest son graduated from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County [Maryland], and he is now working for T. Rowe Price.  And he was a--he was an economics major.
Story_ID: 28864
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How I would like to be remembered.  Boy.  I think I would like to be remembered as someone who made a difference.  And you can characterize making a difference in many ways, but I am committed to technology excellence and innovation, and I am committed in terms of making sure we have a generation of workers that they can also make a difference as we move forward in the twenty-first century.  So I'm now at a point, I think in my career where it is much more gratifying for me to see others develop and others make a contribution.  So, I think when it's said and done, that's what I think I want to be known for; being sort of the platform, being the catalyst, being the, the supporter, helping to develop talent that will continue, that will continue to innovate.  So when you start to look at how the distribution of my time is beginning to change, this is why I'm beginning to spend more time with educators and academia.  I'm beginning to spend more time with communities.  I'm beginning to spend more time with the generation that's coming up.  So this is how I think I want to be remembered, you know, clearly, clearly making a difference.  And that difference, hopefully, we will see a stronger representation from all constituencies, but more specifically from the black and African--African American constituency across science, technology, engineering, and mathematics [STEM].  And I think--and I'm convinced that when it's all said and done, that's what I'll be known for.
Story_ID: 28865
Speaker 1: Sir, who were some of your mentors here at IBM?
Speaker 2: So in terms that I had--I've had a number of mentors here at IBM.  My very first mentor, when I became an IBM executor, was a senior vice president by the name of Bob Stephenson [Robert Stephenson].  And Bob actually had the job that I had aspirations to have years, years later.  And it turns out I ended up in the role when I was responsible for our Systems and Technology Group at the time Bob Stephenson was the senior vice president running our Server Group, which, over the years, we--it's sort of been renamed to Systems and Technology Group.  So Bob was my first mentor.  Bob was very, very instrumental in terms of helping me think through the types of skills and experiences I need, needed to be competitive for jobs with higher impact and higher degrees of responsibility.  The other person that was very instrumental in my career was a guy by the name of Nick Donofrio [Nicholas Donofrio], who--when he retired from IBM, he was the senior vice president for innovation for the company.  And, quite frankly, Nick was probably the individual that, at multiple points in my career, played a role in terms of some of the types of assignments I had in the company.  So between Nick being a very constant in my career, and then Bob, more of when I got into higher levels of management, they played a very central role.  And then the third mentor that I would describe, because these two gentlemen were senior executors, corporate officers of the company.  They ultimately became corporate officers of the company, but there was one individual that retired from IBM that has been a mentor for, boy, I think almost, somehow he discovered me at IBM, perhaps--probably when I was with the company after about five years.  And his name was Ted Childs [J.T. Childs].  And Ted at IBM was our diversity officer.  And arguably, when you look back across IBM's history, and look at many other things that we've done in the area of diversity, Ted has had--has played some role in our diversity practices and policies.  And Ted was a very good mentor that was part of our constituency, and he did a number of things in terms of driving leadership programs, mentoring and buddy-type programs, the Diversity Network Groups. A number of things that, that has allowed IBM, in my opinion, to remain as being viewed as one of the diversity leaders in our, in our industry, in diversity in many, many, many, many dimensions.  So if I had to pick three people, Bob and Nick, more from a career perspective, Ted more from helping stay connected with our community in terms of advancement and development of the black constituency.  So I, I'd like to think about Ted in that capacity, and he's always been a pretty good coach and, and a person that I can bounce things off of, you know, that perhaps I didn't feel as comfortable bouncing off of some of my other mentors.  And this is sort of a lesson in mentorship, because I think you should have a spectrum of mentors where you can have--you can cover a vast amount of topics.  Because the business world is a very complex world.  And there are different types of scenarios and experiences, and by having more of a spectrum of mentors, you can, you can leverage that, you know, in terms of how you, how you drive your career.  So, those are my--if I had to pick three, those would be the three.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this photo, I believe, I'm age fourteen and it's--I'm in my martial arts uniform.
Speaker 2: You're a black belt.
Speaker 1: I'm a black belt in Nisei Goju Rju Karate.  Correct.  And that is--hang on.  Is that my brother [Barry Adkins]?  Let me look at it.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Which ones are on the (unclear)?
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  (unclear).
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  These are.  I can tell you which ones are.
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Well, that's all right.
Speaker 2: This one may be my brother.
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  I think we determined that that is your brother.
Speaker 2: That is.
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  I think--
Speaker 2: It is.  Yeah, that's my brother (laughs).  That's my brother Barry.  That's my wife, that's my wife, Michelle.  And that was taken and published in one of the IBM Diversity magazines, and what year would that be?  I'll have to look that up.  But it would have to be in the mid-90s [1990s].  That one was a--actually, I think she sent that because that's my baby picture on the corner that we can't find the--
Speaker 1: No, we got it.  We got it.
Speaker 2: Oh, you have it?  You actually have my baby picture?
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  (unclear) yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So that one was, a group of high school kids for Black History Week picked their favorite person, and the high school, they did a magazine on me in--I think that was in Washington, D.C.  This one is the principal of the school in New York City [New York].  There's a program--a pretty innovative program called P-TECH [Pathways in Technology Early College High School].  And you'll hear President Obama [President Barack Obama] and others talk about it in terms of how this program will transform education.  And basically it extends education from K through twelve to more like K through fourteen, and they teach more math, science and vocational classes in those additional years.  This one was two years ago, my wife's fiftieth birthday, and I tried to be romantic and we went to the Taj Mahal [Agra, India].  This one is the capital campaign for Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia], where they are raising--I forgot how much--a ridiculous amount of money.  And I was the capital campaign speaker at the Georgia Tech Coliseum to kick it off to the school and the community of Atlanta.
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: That was actually three years ago.  And this is my wife, Michelle, at the same event.  And that kid there is the first recipient of the Rodney C. Adkins Scholarship.  He's a engineering and computer science student.  That is a picture of my family about five years ago.
Speaker 1: Can you name them from left to right?
Speaker 2: Rodney the Second, I guess, the original Rodney, Michelle, and then Ryan, which is my son at Georgia Tech.  So Rodney, you know, you'll be seeing my son at Georgia Tech.  This is me with Dr. Freeman Hrabowski, who is the president of UMBC, University of Maryland Baltimore County [Maryland].  And that's when I received my honorary doctorates degree from that school.  That is me at age five.  This is me in 2011 in Boca Raton, Florida, celebrating our centennial.  And that's the birthplace--Boca Raton is the birthplace of the IBM PC [personal computer].
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's one of the original systems that's in front of me.
Speaker 1: (unclear).
Speaker 2: This was this year, and I was demonstrating a recipe that Chef Watson, Watson, our cognizant system, created that we served to the--to our top sellers--I should say, our top performers at a IBM Recognition Event.
Speaker 1: Computers who have servers?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's also in 2011, where that's a group of the IBM senior leaders ringing the bell on Wall Street [New York, New York].  I don't know what year was that.  Oh, that was when I did the 'Black Enterprise'--I--yeah, I received an award from ''Black Enterprise,' 2011.
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  What was it for?
Speaker 2: Executive--Corporate Executive of the Year.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: That is when I--one of the happiest in my life.  Dr. Paddock (ph.) gave me my degree at the commencement service at Georgia Tech.  That's me in 1976, my senior year.  That's me also in 1976.  I was the student council president, and I was addressing the school.  I don't know what I was talking about then.
Speaker 1: You did then (laughs).
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.  That picture, from left to right, that's my grandmother, who died--she passed away about three years ago at the ripe age of a hundred.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Annie Jessie Adkins.  That's my father, and my mom, and that's me.  And that's in 1981, when I graduated from Georgia Tech.
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  (unclear).
Speaker 2: Archie and Wauneta.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got it.  What year was this?  This is the year where we received the National Medal from President Obama for the IBM Blue Gene supercomputer, because it doing some very interesting work to support our national agenda.  So he--
Speaker 1: Two thousand nine [2009], probably?
Speaker 2: Two thousand--yeah.  That sounds right, 2009.  Yeah.  This was 2011?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And that's Earl Graves, Sr., who is the owner and publisher of 'Black Enterprise.'  This one is--and I want to say 2007--that's my mom, Wauneta, my father, Archie, and this is when I was being recognized at an event as the Black Engineer of the Year.  That's that same event with Rodney the Second, me, Michelle, and then Ryan.  We're always in that order.
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  This photo is when I was delivering my Black Engineer of the Year speech.  This is--we are in native Indian attire at the Taj Mahal, and this is Michelle's--this is precisely her fiftieth birthday, October 27, 2011.  This is a picture of me getting off of the plane in the Serengeti in Tanzania, Africa.  Oh, different order this time.  Okay, this was about two years ago. Rodney, Ryan, Michelle, the other Rodney.  This is a special one, because I belong to a fraternity called Kappa Alpha Psi, and both of my sons are members of the same fraternity.  And Ryan is actually the president of the fraternity that I started over thirty years ago.  I was the founder of the fraternity at Georgia Tech.  So Ryan, on the right, Rodney on the left.  So they're members of the same fraternity.  I wouldn't know what year this was, but we are somewhere, and that's just a younger version of me and a really, really, really, small version of the boys.
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  (laughs).
Speaker 2: (laughs).  That's our wedding photo in 1983?  Yeah, eighty--he's saying yeah (laughs).  Okay.  Eighty-you're saying yeah, '83 [1983], because it'll be, yeah, it'll be thirty years this year.  Yeah, so '83 [1983].  Okay.
