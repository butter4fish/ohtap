Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that management compels me to ask of everyone.  And they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have a favorite food?

Story_ID: 349994
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [John Madlock] side.  But we'll start with your mother's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Estella, E-S-T-E-L-L-A, middle name Mae, M-A-E, Madlock, M-A-D-L-O-C-K [Estella Leggins Madlock].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother's birth date was June 23, 1913.
Speaker 1: Alright.  And where was born?
Speaker 2: In Sardis, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In Sardis.  Now, now what do you know about your mother's side of the family.  How far back can you trace your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Well I didn't have the opportunity to know my grandmother [Lucille Leggins] at all.  My mother's mom died when she was sixteen.  I did have the joy of knowing my grandfather.  His name was Bennie Leggins [Benjamin Leggins], and he was such a delightful guy.  He was eighty-six when he died in 1976.  My mother was one of five children.  She had one sister and two--three brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do you spell Leggins?
Speaker 2: Leggins, L-E-G-G-I-N-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Are there any stories passed down through the family about life in that part of Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Well, Sardis, Mississippi, of course, is a very small town where everybody knows everyone, of course.  It is a very tight knit community, very religious folks.  Lots of churches, as you can imagine.  Everybody really sort of looking out for each other.  So, I grew up in a community where everybody--well, you talk about children being raised by a community--certainly, this was the case.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any particular stories about--did anybody in your family talk about, you know, what your family was doing after slavery or during slavery or Reconstruction or--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Are any of the, or the Civil Rights Movement or--
Speaker 2: Especially a lot of talk during the Civil Rights Movement because being born in 1950, certainly the late '50s [1950s] and early '60s [1960s], there was a lot of activity in the South regarding, around civil rights.  My aunt on my father's side, my father's youngest brother's wife, was very involved in the Civil Rights Movement.  She often participated in meetings.  She often was out working with groups and she often spoke about meeting and visiting with Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and a number of other leaders that we, we read about, but at the time, I'll tell you, we weren't sure--for sure that she really knew them.  But it turns that she did.  So there was--
Speaker 1: What was her--I'm sorry, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Jewel Madlock.  She was married to my father's youngest brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And she worked with SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] down there?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't believe she necessarily worked, but she did a lot of volunteering.  A lot of volunteer work.  She was a housewife and did odd jobs like any of the other women there in the community.  Very active in her church, but she was also very involved in various causes.  And at the time, obviously, that was very brave on her part.  Very, very brave.  But it was so very necessary, as she often talked to us.
Story_ID: 349995
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Estella Leggins Madlock] talk about growing up in Sardis [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Certainly.  Mom, as I said, was one of two sisters.  There were five children in the family, three brothers, two girls and because their mom [Lucille Leggins] died when she was sixteen, she talked about really sort of taking in the younger two--her younger brother and younger sister--and sort of taking care of them, becoming like the surrogate mom.  She and my father [John Madlock] got married shortly after my mother died--her mother died--I guess like at seventeen she was already married and took in the younger two and caring for them.  Mom was known for her talents.  She was very, very talented.  She was very gifted in a lot of ways.  She was a stellar homemaker.  She was an excellent cook.  She could, you know, sew really well.  She often took in various projects for people.  She was very active in the community.  Lots of speaking engagements.  A lot of volunteer work.  So, this is who I had an opportunity to watch as I grew up because she didn't work outside the home, but she enjoyed all her interactions with people and volunteer efforts.  She often spoke of it as being her joy.  And I now understand what she meant by that, that she got a lot of joy in giving and sharing and helping.  It was not unusual for us to be asked to clean our closets and share it with other families, yeah, in the neighborhood.  Or, she would prepare enough food for everybody, including those individuals that she thought might need a little help.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a--now, did your--your mother went to school in Sardis--
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.  She was a product of the public school system there.
Speaker 1: What was that system like when she was growing up?
Speaker 2: It was obviously not as established.  You're really talking about one-room schools with all the grades, all the kids in it.  I remember my mom telling the story about the students who--and she was one of them--that would often time get selected to help, you know, teach the other kids.  So, as a result she would be called upon to, you know, take a class or whatever, or teach a class, whatever, as a substitute because people knew of her gifts and the fact that she didn't mind volunteering and, you know, they knew that she taught Sunday school and all these sorts of things at the church, so it just was a natural carryover for her, as well as since it was a good way to have her own kids be included as they were growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Well, none that I think that they agreed on.  (Laughter) But, again, being this, the close knit community that it was, dad tells his version--told his version of how oh, she saw me and all this sort of thing, but I think they met at like some kind of church social because in the South, in the early days, the church was really the hub of everybody's life.  It was where everybody went.  You talk about putting on your Sunday best and it's just there all day.  Since my mother and her family was there, my father and his family was there.  Although she tells the story about him really being outside under the tree with his friends and she was inside listening to the services, so I think they met from there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was the name of the church?
Speaker 2: McKivor Missionary Baptist Church [Sardis, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: M-C-K-I-V-O-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's a name I've never heard.  McKivor, huh?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Missionary Baptist Church, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: A little church that sat on the hill and everybody got there.
Story_ID: 349996
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Sure can.  John, J-O-H-N, Lewis, L-E-W-I-S, Madlock [John Madlock].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: December 7, 1910.  And he was also born and raised in Sardis, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what do you know about your father's side?  And how far back can you trace people on your father's side?
Speaker 2: My father was one of five children as well.  And, my father's mom died in 1955.  Her name was Matilda [Matilda Madlock].  I only had a visual image of her.  She was this very kind, charming lady--very soft-spoken that sat in her rocking chair and she had hair down to her waist.  I remember as a child being told to not run through the house or, you know, because she was very ill at the time.  So we would go and visit--brief visits and I just remembered that image of her smile and her letting me brush her hair.  My father's father, Leslie Madlock, was quite the jokester.  He was the storyteller in the family.  We, over the years, as little kids would go and sit around him at his feet and he would tell us all these stories about how in the woods lived all these exotic animals and all this stuff, and I grew up forever believing in all this stuff.  You know, I wouldn't go outside the door.  That was his way of making certain that we were in when we needed to be in and all of that.  And, as he would tell all these stories--do you know for years I thought his name--his name--his nickname was Burk Hall.  That's because he sat on a paint--a five gallon paint drum, a big paint drum and it was Burk-Hall Paints [Burk-Hall Paint Company].  So everybody would refer to him as that (laughter).  And as he would sit there on this stoop on this paint thing turned upside down and tell us all these crazy stories and as gullible little children, we believed this stuff (laughter) and so for years.  But, yeah, he was quite the jokester.  As I look back, I would say oh my God, you know, Bill Cosby and all those guys would have learned an awful lot from him.
Speaker 1: Can you remember a story?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, the one he used to tell us about how there were panthers and mountain lions and all these kinds of things just at the foot of the house in the trees--in the woods, and we were never to go there because these things would get us.  So one day I remember saying, "Well, Grandpa, I saw you walking through there.  Did you not see the panther?"  And he said, "Oh, no, no, he doesn't bother me, I'm tough.  I told him don't bother me, I'm tough."  (Laughter) And so we're like--no such thing.  So, all these years, he had us believing that the State of Mississippi had all these exotic animals and leopards and things out there but I guess that was just fun for him.
Story_ID: 349997
Speaker 1: --Who do you think you take the most after, your mother [Estella Leggins Madlock] or father [John Madlock]?
Speaker 2: Probably the most from my mom.  As people say the older I get, I look like her and mannerisms and stuff.
Speaker 1: I saw a picture, and it is a striking resemblance.
Speaker 2: Well that was one of the running jokes, my dad used to say, "Oh, my God I've got two of you," because he said that we both were very determined, we were very engaged in whatever and committed and active all the time and--but I believe I have a wonderful blend of the two.  Dad was very hardworking and very talented, very creative, easygoing, loved people.  Just--every walk of life and as a result I kind of get into that, I don't have any fear of heights and fear of this or that, you know, level individual.  Mom definitely was the caretaker.  She definitely was the one who was very much into doing well, taking care of yourself and others.  Make certain that, you know, take care of your brothers, sisters--that sort of thing.  And you just sort of pick all that up.  I believe I inherited my interest--I know I inherited my interest--for volunteering and working with others from her, just sitting there watching.  Because as the other kids, you know, refused to be babysitter for that day or whatever, then I was like palling around with her wherever she went and I would sit there playing with whatever, my coloring books and when they called her to the stage to speak I would stop and listen.
Speaker 1: Now was she a member of any other organizations outside of the church [McKivor Missionary Baptist Church, Sardis, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Well she was very involved in the church because there were so many organizations in groups.  You know, the usher board, the women's board, the this, that.  She was forever the--she was called upon to help plan any number of special women's day programs for churches across the community.  She was very involved with the community, community center there in Sardis [Mississippi].  It's dedication and support of it.  So there was a lot of community-based things that she would get pulled into.  She knew a lot of people and as a result they thought, oh, well then you can help us cultivate other relationships and she often did.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the community center?
Speaker 2: Sardis Community Center [Sardis, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Sometimes these places are named for some particular individual in the community.
Speaker 2: No.  Unfortunately at the time it was just the Sardis--it was the Sardis Community Center and it was the newest wing of the original Sardis Elementary School [Sardis, Mississippi].  But when the building--the main building of the school was torn down, this newer building remained and they turned it into a community center and that was the community's request.  And it was some place for the kids to go, you could have events, you could be there and it was fun.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how many brothers and sisters do you have, and where do you fall in the birth order?
Speaker 2: There were ten of us and I'm the tenth of ten.  So, I'm as good or as bad as it gets, (laughter) as I would often say to my folks.  I would--I've teased over time, you know, it's no wonder I sort of ended up in the areas that I've worked in all my career, margins and finance and whatever because by birth order I was the bottom line.  So it naturally helped me out.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what--now you're the baby of the family growing up.  What was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The youngest.
Speaker 1: --the youngest.  Okay.  Not the--okay.  But you know how we say that.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Story_ID: 349998
Speaker 1: Well, first of all do you have an earliest childhood memory?  First childhood memory.  Can you remember--is there something that--?
Speaker 2: That really stands out?  I think the earliest would be just growing up on the farm.  You know, obviously with ten kids you kind of need a lot of space.  So my earliest would be just kind of hanging around with everybody, and if you're the youngest, you've got to figure out, you know, you're really entertaining yourself because the next oldest child is like four and a half, five years older and they're the big kids and you're the little kid.  So you're at home with mom helping or whatever.  I remember just kind of being a little bit of a daredevil.  Going--sneaking out the back door, going off, and, getting rides on the horse.  Unapproved!  And going off farther than I was supposed to go and only if you get turned in by the neighbors.  You know, on Sunday they would see me, they'd say, "Didn't I see your little daughter running across my land, you know, whatever, on her horse," or whatever.  So I would get turned in even though I thought I would have gone off and that.  So I think those memories where I had this freedom, this open space.  All the people around me, yet I had my little breaks or escapes as well.  I thought living on the farm gave me a real appreciation for self-sufficiency because we grew everything.  You know we had all kinds of fruits and vegetables and all that sort of stuff.  We had livestock and I would talk to dad [John Madlock] about the business end of things.  Like, well, if we're going to take the cow to the livestock, how much are we going to get?  And how do we price that?  So he explained that it's by pound.  So I thought that if you continue to feed the cows and all that sort of thing, that it would be nice and fat and you'd get more because they'd weigh more.  Right?  And so I would talk to dad about that.  Now the reason--the selfish motivation for doing that is because I figured well good, the more money he gets once he's done with all the other stuff, I'll be able to get a bike (laughter). So that was my plan.  To try to encourage or influence the family's finances that way.
Speaker 1: Now did your family own its own land or was it rented or shared or--
Speaker 2: Well, the land that we lived on for the most part belonged to us.  It was, you know, a nice little size farm that we had.  But over the years there was--the early years--I'm sure, there was land that my father rented or his father [Leslie Madlock] rented or whatever.  And then it's like anything, you move on to do your own thing.  And, so we--my father had cotton, he had corn, and all kinds of other vegetables and all that sort of thing.  He was known for the, you know, the quality of the fruits and vegetables and definitely known for the livestock because they were clean and they were well feed because I saw to that and I just thought it was just--you know--my way of helping because all the other kids were off doing whatever they were doing.  Some had little part-time jobs in town [Sardis, Mississippi].  Others were busy with school projects and I wasn't quite there yet.  So I would kind of do my little thing so that I would get a little monies.
Story_ID: 349999
Speaker 1: Now this is a question that we always ask.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: In the summer obviously, and of course being on a farm, you don't have the benefit of city lights, so the skies are lit by the stars and it's just--you know--that the moon was out and the stars would have a beautiful reflection.  You could see shadows and all that sort of stuff.  The flip side is if it was cloudy or not it was extremely dark and you'd be very concerned and they used--we used to say that: "Oh my gosh, you can cut the darkness with a knife."  Or the stillness because the next family away was a significant--maybe miles away--you know from there.  And, you know, you just keep that in mind as you were doing things.  I would imagine that we were conscious of schedules thus my grandfather [Leslie Madlock] telling us those stories, like get home before it gets too dark in case you can't find your way.  You know, just being mindful of things like that.  Very hot in the summer.  Thick hanging humidity.  But I was born in the summer, I was raised in the South.  I probably dealt with it far better than some of the other kids.  Loved it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  About how far were you from town [Sardis, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: It was probably about a good ten to twelve miles from town.  We were one of the families that was just kind of--we used to say on the outskirts of town because we didn't have to go very, very, very far but it was just on the outskirts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any other sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Lots of interactions with other kids from other places, you know, so people would come in, you know, to the communities.  A lot of, for instance, a lot of the kids or a lot of my friends would visit their family in the South during the summers and that, that's when I started the cross-pollination of experiences and cultures and listening to other kids and hearing about things that they were doing and their schools or in their cities or whatever.  We read a lot of--I read a lot of books of far away places and just thought that, ooh, you know, the world's out there and I'm certainly going to explore it.  My mom [Estella Leggins Madlock] was constantly reading so she subscribed to all kind of magazines and things like that and there were always these interesting little articles that she'd read and she'd tell us about them.  Whether it had to do with homemaking, whether it had to do with some recipe, whether it had to do with, you know, something going on in the world so you'd kind of heard about, heard about all that.  And that was an evening conversation.  Because it was a large family, there were ten of us, it was a party every meal.  I mean there are twelve people at the table, you know, with all the kids and mom and dad [John Madlock], and I would always have my little space there and sitting on a pillow or two, you know, to make sure we would have our favorites.  My dad loved desserts so as a result so do I.  So there was always a big meal--always, always, always.  Probably the most precious memory I think back over the years, all of the wonderful gatherings at the holiday time.  Which is why Thanksgiving is so important, and it's my favorite holiday because you have this bounty of food that you've been planning for and all this and the focus is on the gathering and the focus is on the food and the people coming and all that.  Well of course all the meals were at our house because who's inviting ten kids, you know, to come, you know, for dinner or whatever, so we would always have, and we had the space, and it was just loads and loads of relatives and friends and neighbors and everybody and that's a tradition I've adopted for my daughter [Latonya Lumpkin] and I.  We do the same thing.
Story_ID: 350000
Speaker 1: Does it make a difference that you grow your own food?  I mean, you know, I just, does it make a difference when you have your own--you grow it yourself?
Speaker 2: Well, I--certainly, because we were able to have as much as we want and you know, I think that I didn't so much appreciate it then but I certainly do now.  You know, the food was natural, it was pure, it was not impacted by anything.  It was fresh.  We could go and pick as much of whatever and if we knew say, oh, a cousin was coming and bringing some new friends that they had met, oh well, we got to go pick some more or whatever and you must do that.  I thought that it was a wonderful way for us to be creative as well because once you start cooking and you realize, oh gee, the squash are in so let's go and add some of those.  Oh gee, the tomatoes are growing, let's add some of those and it was just always a wonderful thing for us.  As a kid, of course, you always wanted everything from downtown.  You wanted to go get the hamburgers like everybody else had, but just appreciating the fact that you could have it yourself and do it your own was a wonderful thing.  And as I said, my mom [Estella Leggins Madlock] was a terrific cook and lots and lots of people knew that, you know, so they were there.  I used to think I was all popular because it was me but, no, the basketball team was coming over for the chocolate cake (laughter) and it took me a lot of years to figure that out.  So everybody in town thought I was this major popular person, it was like, no, my mom cooks cakes and the guys want to come and have chocolate cake so it was really kind of--every, every, every--food was kind of the hub of the social event for us.  That and church, you know, that were the connectors.  There was always people coming home with us after church and as a result, you know, like I said it was always a lot of social things.  And mom loved it 'cause she, she didn't work outside of the house or anything but she was busy there with all of us and I just think that this is just, again, her way of showing her creativity in having a way to--her outlet with everybody else.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now where did you start school?  Where did you start?
Speaker 2: My--I went to an elementary school there in Sardis [Mississippi], it was called Greenhill Elementary School.  Little school in the town there in Sardis and--
Speaker 1: Now was it all black school.
Speaker 2: Oh, for sure--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --um-hm, for sure.  By the time I got to the ninth grade--I'm sorry--eighth grade, because the school went through to eighth grade then by the time you got to ninth grade the school, the public school that I could attend at the time was in the next town which is about six miles away and that was in Como, Mississippi.  C-O-M-O, Mississippi, and it was North Panola [North Panola High School], my high school.  So we would walk over to the elementary school, catch the buses that were taking us to the high school for us to attend.

Story_ID: 350002
Speaker 1: Tell me about elementary school [Greenhill Elementary School, Sardis, Mississippi].  What kind of a student were you and what was your personality like as a grade school student?
Speaker 2: Um, as an elementary student, obviously a good student, shy.  Very shy.  Followed every single rule because everybody knew my parents.  My father [John Madlock] was in and out of the school a lot because in addition to being a farmer, he was like a carpenter or handyman, whatever, he built homes in the off season and worked on things, so he would sometimes have a job at the school where he's painting or building or whatever.  And there he would be in his paint pants and everything else, and at lunchtime, talking about let's have lunch.  (Laughter) And I wanted to have lunch with my friends.  It's not cool hanging out with your dad.  But I was always known for my good grades in school.  So, wasn't like I was the popular kid on the block kind of thing except for when we had chocolate cake (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have a favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  I really admired all of them, but I will tell you that my third grade teacher, Ms. Ramelle Woodard, is probably the one that I refer to most even now in my life because she really concentrated on math for us, and she really, one day, really called me on the carpet.  One day I purposely because I was trying to be cool, I threw a pop quiz.  You know, you get called to the board and you do a test and all that stuff.  Well I knew this backwards and forwards, but, you know, you're at the board and everyone knows you can do this in three seconds.  Well, you know the other kids--well, you're not cool or they would kind of razz you a bit.  So of the three problems we had to do I did the first two really well.  Then you could start to hear people rumbling in the background.  So, I kind of blew the other one.  She knew I did this--she knew I did this.  So she kept me after school, and if you were kept after school that means you missed the bus.  Remember I--and now that means that my folks have to come and get me and that was hard to explain.  But while sitting there it was the most miserable hour ever because she's preaching to you.  But the one thing that she said was, you know, "Being cool isn't going to help you at all, and I know you blew that quiz."  She told me and she reminded me, she says now math will be able to do an awful lot for you and I know you've got the basis for it and it will be--you can--numbers can work for you and they can work against you.  But what you want to do is make certain that you're on the side when the numbers are working for you.  And then about then it just seemed like clockwork, my dad rolled up in the Chevy [Chevrolet] truck and, you know, really not too thrilled that he has to come over there and get me 'cause I'm not on the bus.  And, you know, you can imagine being punished for however many days and doubling the chores and all that stuff.  So that was just a hard lesson learned.  So even over the years, I go back to that because it was at that time that I realized what she was saying to me--she's like okay, you can make the most of this and not pick up a phobia about the numbers or any of that, or you cannot let others influence how you want to shape your life and get the basics you need, and then you can try and do well.  So I say that to all the young kids even now.  Numbers can work for you or they can work against you.
Speaker 1: In terms of the numbers, what were the numbers of students in your grade school?  We know this from knowing that Mississippi has probably one of the largest black population in the states.  One of the two states at one time where the black population outnumbered the white.  I mean, what, what was the--was the school crowded with people or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, the school that I attended in, you know, in Panola County [Mississippi], the county, there was maybe what, five or six thousand people or whatever, half of them were my relatives because we had a large family.  But the school, I didn't consider it overcrowded.  I think we had maybe thirty or thirty-five kids in each of the classes that I recall, you know, over time.
Speaker 1: That's in the grade school?
Speaker 2: In grade--elementary school.  And the teachers and everybody usually, for the most part, were teachers from other cities coming in to the community to teach because Ms. Woodard was from some place near Jackson, Mississippi.  She was not from around Sardis [Mississippi].
Story_ID: 350003
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So she [Lumpkin's elementary school teacher, Ramelle Woodard] would commute?
Speaker 2: No.  She--they would--many of the teachers would live in the community [Sardis, Mississippi] during the school year and then they would go home, you know, when school was out.  And I remember really missing them because you get to make friends with them and you see them.  When they would come back maybe back to town to attend some of the programs at church or some of the events at the school or something, oh that was big fun because you could go and talk with them about things and they weren't going to ask you about quizzes or your homework.  You know, they were just there.  Many of the teachers though lived there all the time and that's how they were at our church and every place else, and that's how they got to know the families.  And they were very, very strict and they would say the worst thing they could say to you is: "I will tell your dad or mom when I see them on Sunday."  That was punishment enough.  So you just, you know, got yourself back in line very quickly because that was kind of like a real sentence for you.
Speaker 1: Were the teachers really respected in the community?
Speaker 2: Oh, very much so, very much so.  The teachers in our community, the ministers, they were really on a pedestal.  Everybody referred to them as Professor This or Mrs. That or whatever, all the time.  It was something that I think was a wonderful blessing for me to have that kind of discipline early on because it just stays with you throughout your life.  But most definitely the teachers were our heroes.  They were the people we looked to for all the answers, for all the good, and then the other people that you spent the rest of your day with on Sunday was the minister.  So naturally these were two people that were as pure as you could get.
Story_ID: 350004
Speaker 1: You grew up during the beginnings of what we call the modern Civil Rights Movement.  In '56 [1956] you were, I guess, six--I guess, five or six years old when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was in Montgomery [Alabama] and--not that there hadn't been struggle before, but people were.  Did you have a sense of iniquity in Mississippi in those days, or when did you get a sense of what was really going on politically because it sounds like you were raised in a pretty much all-black world in a lot of ways, but--
Speaker 2: For the most part it was all black however, the family immediately across from us at the next thing were the Jacksons, and they were a white family.  My first little friend right there was Barbara [ph.], you know.  She would come in and visit from Ohio or some place and she was there, you know, every summer with her folks and they were no different than we were.  They had their farm, we had ours, and we would exchange all kinds of things back and forth.  But that's just like, they're one family.  My father [John Madlock] worked for any number of people throughout the community.  I mean one of his big claim to fame was how he did all this work on the mayor of Sardis' [Sardis, Mississippi] house, you know, at the time.  And every Sunday we would drive by this house on the way to church [McKivor Missionary Baptist Church, Sardis, Mississippi] and he would tell us the same story about how he was dropping the windows in with his crew and the storms came up and how they had to rush and da, da, da, da, because this was a big thing, the fact that he was working on the mayor of the town's house, and every Sunday to and from church he had to tell us this story.  Very proud.  And so, bad kids sitting in the back as we were, we're just mouthing it I guess, I know the storm came up and you had to go get the thing to cover the windows, blah, blah, blah.  But to think about that at the time, the fact that he had that as an assignment was really pretty big for him and for us, you know, and for us.  The other part of just sort of being in a little town like that, during the era, was when Dr. King and his groups were marching through the state in later years.  I think I had mentioned my aunt [Jewel Madlock] earlier.  She was married to my father's youngest brother.  We all thought that perhaps she was a little too brave sometimes because she was talking about these things that we'd never heard of.  You know, she was talking about people who we would read about or see on the TV and we often wondered if she really knew them or if she really was involved in these meetings.  Turns out she was, or she had been. And she would participate, you know, as the, they would call them freedom marchers or whatever, you know, back in the day.  As they were coming through the various towns encouraging people to consider, you know, registering to vote or wanting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] had a voter registration campaign.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Freedom Summer, the summer of 1964, you would have been thirteen I guess when they formed the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and went to the convention [1964 Democratic National Convention, Atlantic City, New Jersey].
Speaker 2: And she was always talking about that, always talking about that.  And, you know, we didn't necessarily know if she actually was involved in all the discussions because, you know, I just kind of remember sitting there and the folks were talking about these things.  That was very brave on her part because that was not an acceptable behavior at that time and when the various groups were in town, she was one of the first to help organize having food prepared, you know, whether it was going to the various churches and people were preparing food for the people who were in town, helping to find places for them to stay while they were there and all that.  'Cause they would move through the various towns, you know.  Then the next town away was Batesville [Mississippi] which is like eight miles away.  Then the next community would connect on and so on and so on.  Watching all of that naturally I was very curious because I was always very curious, and so I was reading the stories and naturally curious about it and it was just hard to imagine, hard to imagine as a child the impact obviously.
Story_ID: 350005
Speaker 1: Remember now, I had to take the bus to the next town to school because the high school in Sardis [Mississippi] was not open to me.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I mean did you ever wonder what was going on in the other high school, I mean in the Sardis high school?
Speaker 1: Oh, for sure, oh, for sure.  Of course we always wondered.  Because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What was your thoughts on--
Speaker 1: Well, you know, I figured like okay, well, you know, we have a homecoming, they have a homecoming.  Their homecoming photos may very take the first page--ours, a little caption if it made it at all.  You just wonder like anything, you know, anything.  You wonder, are our books the same.  You know, do we have the same kind of activities.  We didn't--we didn't have all that snazzy band equipment, you know, because often the community would have to raise money to support the band and the school and all that sort of stuff.
Speaker 2: Did you play in the band?
Speaker 1: Nope.  Didn't quite make that.  I was not in the band.  It was one of the things where because the school was public school and lots of community involvement or whatever, we needed to buy your own instruments and things like that.  So rather than buying the instrument to be in the band we made the decision we--my parents [Estella Leggins Madlock and John Madlock] and I--made the decision that, okay, concentrate on paying for the fees for whatever the classes you're going to need.  So we didn't--that was a luxury that unfortunately I wasn't able to afford.
Speaker 2: Were there a lot of fees associated with--
Speaker 1: I wouldn't say a lot but back in the day it probably seemed like, you know, because there were things that you needed for class fees or some of the other classes that you wanted to take or things you wanted to learn.  You probably wanted to concentrate on that.  And that's kind of what we did.
Speaker 2: So Panola High School (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) North Panola [North Panola High School, Como, Mississippi].
Speaker 2: North Panola High School, now is that--you said five or six thousand students?
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  That was the community, five or six thousand.  I graduated in a class of about a hundred and ten students in high school.  About hundred ten.  Now there was also a South Panola [South Panola High School, Batesville, Mississippi].  That was also the school that black kids, you know, went to in Batesville [Mississippi].  That was like eight miles away from Sardis.  Sardis was kind of in the middle and Como [Mississippi], the North Panola, the school that I went to was six miles away.  So we went, we got on, on the bus in Sardis and we rode six miles to the school in Como for high school, and you know, the other school in the county was South Panola.  The Sardis High School [Sardis, Mississippi] was the one where we were not admitted at the time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now were there--did you have the same kind of attendance problem we have in Chicago [Illinois], I mean students dropping out of school and that sort of thing or did they--
Speaker 1: Well, you know, not as much because I think it was such a close-knit community.  Everybody knew if you were out of line or whatever.  It was not unusual for anyone to see a student and say, "Well, aren't you headed to school or Sunday school or church, whatever," you know.  It was--everybody knew everyone.  If anybody dropped out it was big news.  Everybody knew about it because you were obviously not there.  It was not something that was supported in the community at all.  People, again, you know, where are kids going to go if you're not in school.  I mean there was the whole socialization, it was the basketball team, it was everything there.  I mean even the riding back and forth on the bus, we made the most of that because that's when you had the chance to see your friends and just to talk about things.  Again, you had your school, you had your church.  That was--that was your life.
Story_ID: 350006
Speaker 1: Was television or radio a big part of growing up at all?  Did you listen to a lot of music at home or--
Speaker 2: Oh, lots of music of all kind.  Lots and lots of that, lots of music of all kind.  But again, growing up in very strict Southern Baptist family, there was no dancing in house on Sunday.  (Laughter) Not at all--not at all.  And, you know, we definitely respected all that but, yes, music was very important.  We were in the choir at church [McKivor Missionary Baptist Church, Sardis, Mississippi] and all these things.  Music was very important.  And television--in moderation.
Speaker 1: Did you, do you remember seeing the Civil Rights Movement coming on television at all?
Speaker 2: I did.  We did, we watched some of that.
Speaker 1: And I ask because I've heard stories that people, some of the newscasts were censored in some of the southern states.
Speaker 2: Oh, there--oh yeah.  I'm sure.  But what was there we saw (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You could see--
Speaker 2: For instance, the biggest thing that I remember is when there was the march through the state and it had to do with voter registration.  It was in like the mid to late '60s [1960s] and I remember that particular day, it was Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and his leaders or whatever they had been marching for the longest and I think they were headed to Jackson [Mississippi], but they came straight through our town [Sardis, Mississippi].  And at church and at school I could hear the adults talking about: "Are you going, are you going, are you going?"  And different people were relaying the stories that they had been strongly discouraged to attend.  But people were deciding that it was too important not to go.  People went, you know, there wasn't any incident whatever.  The only incident was just, and it was minor, but it did catch the news, as some of the marchers were walking, I guess they were sort of walking on this one gentleman's property, I mean walking down the street and there's cars coming, kind of move over and he was running out telling them, get off his property, get off his property, and they just moved on.  That caught the news but beyond that--
Speaker 1: So you say that they were discouraged, what, were there--
Speaker 2: Told not to go.
Speaker 1: White employers discouraging them, is that who was discouraging them?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Because there were still people who perhaps were heavily renting or, you know, and solely reliant on others for their welfare and support of their family and they were discouraged.  I remember the day of that march, school actually was let out at noon because they expected that the group would make it through our town mid-afternoon and they just didn't want the children in harm's way.  And I'm very fortunate, and of course, as a young kid you're all worried, you're nervous, you don't know what's going to go on, oh my gosh, and it's, it's amazing.  But I'm very proud to say that there wasn't any disturbance at all.
Speaker 1: So you actually saw the marchers coming?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, I didn't see them now because remember we're living on the farm.  And that was away from where the road that they would have been going down but because everybody, you know, the school and everybody, you have to get past where they needed to go past.  I think our principal just thought that rather than have people in harm's way, he would let us go home a little early.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did things start to change any down there before you got out of high school [North Panola High School, Como, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, they did.  I, I think that the thing that was really noticeable was, you know, people, I hope--well it got worse, then it got better because I graduated in 1968 from high school.  You will recall Dr. King's assassination was around that time, and you know, in April in Memphis [Tennessee].  I was fifty miles away.  I remember that evening being outside with my friends.  By now we have moved off the farm and we are now living downtown, you know, whatever, you know, little downtown area.  I remember my oldest sister, Lena [Garther Lena Madlock Whitaker], coming home, she had been out visiting friends, and she came home and she was in a hurry and she said, "Oh my God, Martin Luther King has been killed in Memphis," and the chill going through the house and all this stuff.  And, you know, the older kids and, you know, my parents [Estella Leggins Madlock and John Madlock] were talking about this and we started accounting for everyone, you know, like, "Where's Barbara Ann [HistoryMaker Barbara Ann Lumpkin], where's this one, where's Cornell [Cornell Madlock], where's Edith [Edith Madlock Taylor]," you know, everybody's in because you just knew that this was not going to be a happy time.  And the mere fact that she came home, all of her friends wherever they were, they all just decided, let's go home.  Everybody went home.  And, you know, the next series of days were very challenging because this was just fifty miles away from where we lived, and this occurred at the Lorraine Hotel [Memphis, Tennessee].  It was a very sad time, very disturbing time in the communities.  And then, naturally you turn the TV on and you start watching all the reactions from around the nation in the largest cities, Detroit [Michigan] and Chicago [Illinois] and all around.  It was very disturbing, very unsettling, very unsettling.
Story_ID: 350007
Speaker 1: When you graduated in '68 [1968], they hadn't desegregated the schools yet, at that point?
Speaker 2: Nope.
Speaker 1: No.  But well, when you graduated from high school [North Panola High School, Como, Mississippi], I mean, well, did you get involved in accounting and numbers in high school?
Speaker 2: Well in, in high school I was always, again, the studious one, as a matter of fact, in high school I was voted Most Studious.  I was so hoping for some of those other categories where people thought you were popular, hip, and cool, but that's just what they did (laughter).  I was voted Most Studious and, which was fine, my parents [Estella Leggins Madlock and John Madlock] were very happy with that.  I was the class secretary.  I was very involved with all kind of clubs, debate club, math club, science club, every kind of thing because again the school was your life.  And it was a big thrill in high school to be called upon by the faculty committee who were doing programs of various things where there is, you know, Founder's Day or some special day programs that we would have, and if they would ask you as a student to be a participant, and, you know, I was fortunate that some of the teachers would ask me to have a public speaking role or to be a part of whatever the presentation was or whatever, and I totally got into that.  I always enjoyed the drama club.  I was in plays a lot, you know, I've played Lady MacBeth one time.  I thought that was totally fun--what a character but it was a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: That's kind of a switch from being real shy--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, on stage you can become all these things and at one point I remember sitting down with my dad saying, you know, I'm going to go into theater, I really want to do this and so I remember his advice--not advice--his directive really, it was like: "That is not a respectable career for a young lady."  You know, it was like, okay.  You know, so that was--that was that.  So the rest of that just kind of--but I really always liked the creative flair, always liked the characters, all that sort of stuff.  As a result I love theaters, you know, I love all that now.  That was really fun.
Story_ID: 350008
Speaker 1: Was there a lot of live music when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Not that I could attend or anything like that, I mean, because again (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now that's important to state--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In a very small community like that [Sardis, Mississippi] you'd need to go to a bigger town where there was a venue and also people who have the ability to pay.  The live music that I would experience growing up would have been at church, you know, the choirs.  Every choir would have some program, or every church would have some special program and they would have singers, maybe they would have some singer coming in who's kind of famous or whatever, and that would be just a treat, you know.  My mom [Estella Leggins Madlock], you know, being the emcee or announcing or whatever and this choir would get up and sing and whatever.  And that was just fun.
Speaker 1: That's why so many great musicians come out of Mississippi, both the gospel area and in the blues area, you know.  And so did you--from what you're saying you probably didn't hear much blues, I guess.
Speaker 2: No, I didn't hear very much blues because remember now, as the youngest kid they always thought that you were too young to do everything.  So even if the older kids went to these, you know, I didn't go.  So I just kind of, you know, would watch the variety shows on TV.  I would kind of listen to that way, but not going to any of these clubs because again it was a very strict Southern Baptist family so you kind of don't do that, and we just didn't.
Story_ID: 350009
Speaker 1: In your senior year of high school [North Panola High School, Sardis, Mississippi] were you the valedictorian of the class or were you--
Speaker 2: No, I was number three in the class.  Of course, we could always argue about being number two or one or whatever but fortunately my two best friends were, you know, were number one and number two and I was number three because our grades were just right there, you know, about a hair apart.  So as a result, you know, you have the commencement exercise, you have all the graduation services and at the, for the class night, the big deal was the lead speaker for the class night and I was selected by the faculty committee to be the lead speaker for the class night.  So I had the entire stage the whole time, you know, doing the whole program and everything.  And it was--and it was called, The Beautiful Dreamer.  Of course, I never forgot this, it's like four hundred years ago, never got this, because if you talk about how many pairs of eyes, you know, given the fact that, you know, how many students were in our class, and where we might be ten years from now, twenty years from now, thirty years from now, and I'm telling the story as various ones are coming on and doing their part, and then they would go off and I would continue to talk, and continue to talk and somebody else would come on and do their thing.  So that was a really a big deal.  And at the time, the teachers worked with you, and you spoke without notes because this was your delivery.  You were, they wanted, all of the speeches, you spoke without notes, I don't care how long it was.  That was what they did.  They made certain that you delivered, you know, and you needed to talk about it because I needed to convey, oh yeah, in twenty years we're going to be here, you know, we're on our way, we're going to do all these things.  So I was--
Speaker 1: There doesn't seem to be as much emphasis on elocution in high school any more, but when you were coming along they really--
Speaker 2: Very much so.  And as a result, and my staff will tell you, I have trouble following a script so much because we were trained to know your material, step into it is what my teacher used to say.  She would say step into the material, get to know it, read it, read about the author, kind of get a sense of what you think they were feeling or thinking of what might have been the time.  One of my favorite things to do is dramatic readings and, you know, we would get up and do a depiction of 'The Raven' [Edgar Allan Poe].  Thus, playing Lady MacBeth.  I mean, just really act it out.  And it was really a lot of fun and it had more meaning for me because you make those words come to life.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a favorite teacher in high school?
Speaker 2: Overall, well obviously Ms. Woodard [Ramelle Woodard] was the math teacher.  There was always Professor Hall [ph.], who was the algebra and geometry and all that, and he really had to make that come to life.  But I learned an awful lot from my business teacher, he taught economics and business and all those sorts of things and that was Mr. Bingham, Louis Bingham, and again he focused on something that wasn't readily talked about in the South at the time because young women were prepared to be a nurse or a teacher.  And I thought, oh, I'm going to be a dismal failure because I don't have the stomach for either one, I don't know, what am I going to do.  I remember saying to my dad [John Madlock], "Oh my God, how am I going feed myself, what am I going to do," and he said, "You'll be a great teacher because you got really great grades."  Well that was the only reason I didn't want to be a teacher because I didn't think that I had the same delivery that Ms. Woodard had or Professor Hall had or whatever.  I wanted to use something else.
Story_ID: 350010
Speaker 1: So when you were a senior in high school [North Panola High School, Como, Mississippi] were you on a--how do you see the future?  I mean, what did you think you would do next?  Did you think you would go to college at that point?
Speaker 2: I thought so.  However, the confusing, well the confusing part was again, you know, most of the preparations were to prepare young women to be a nurse or a teacher, and I kept saying, but that's not what I had in mind.  I really wanted to do business, I wanted to go into business, I want business.  So I was marched down the hall to the typing class and was told to, that was my orientation for business, and I just said, "No, this is not what I had in mind."  Well the teacher was totally offended.  I said, "I don't want to do this," and that was totally out of character because remember now I was the kid who never, you know, gave anybody any trouble.  I was always one of the, you know, the ones that they could rely on, and I said, "No, this is not what I had in mind.  I don't like typing, I don't want to type, and I don't care to type, I want, you know, to go into business."
Speaker 1: What you were saying, you didn't want to be the secretary.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, right, yeah.  It's what basically I'm saying.  And the teacher marched me down to the principal's office.  So I'm in trouble again, big time.  So I have to sit there now until they call my mom [Estella Leggins Madlock] and say, "We have Barbara [HistoryMaker Barbara Ann Lumpkin] in the principal's office and she's refusing to go to class."  Well, my mother's ready to, you know, just rip my lips off because what do you mean you're refusing to go to class, so I'm sitting there, they didn't let me go to anything.  The bell rings, come and go, and everybody's going wherever they go.  The bell rings come and go and I'm still sitting there 'cause it will take them a while to get over there.  And I tried to explain what I meant by that.  I said, "I am very interested in business but that is not what I consider business," but they meant typing and shorthand and that was the most you could probably expect to do.  And I said, "No, that's not what I had in mind."  So my mother sort of looked at this whole determined little person sitting there and just said, "Come on, let's go home, we'll talk about this some more."  So all the way home we're talking about this, we're talking about this and I said, "You know, I've been reading my books and they talk about all these different kinds of jobs.  They talk about real business in like companies, how they run businesses, and, you know, they do all these things.  That's what I want."  I want some, you know, I want to do that, that's what I want to do.  And, you know, my father [John Madlock] reminded me softly that there weren't those kind of jobs around there.  And I said, "Well my other books are also saying," you know, I'm reading about these other far way places and I said, "well maybe I'll go to some of the other places, I'd like to do that."  I'd like to do something different.  Well there was a bunch of teachers in the family, a bunch of ministers, so that was kind of like if you were a good student that was a natural progression.  You would be a really great student, I mean, a teacher, if you had all A's in school, I mean, you know, it comes natural.  And I was trying to convince them that yes, I was a quick learner and I could pick it all up.
Story_ID: 350011
Speaker 1: By fall, anyway, you get through high school [North Panola High School, Como, Mississippi] the rest of the senior year and you go through all of the events and things like that and I guess I started speaking up more about things I wanted to do, thinking more about things I wanted to do.  I actually was slated to go to one of the colleges, you know, for career day.  We'd go on a bus tour to various schools, and they gave me a battery of tests and they were determining if I would place, you know.  This was also a school that my sister, my older sister, older sister Edith [Edith Madlock Taylor], was attending, Mississippi Valley State [Mississippi Valley State College; Mississippi Valley State University, Itta Bena, Mississippi], and, you know, it was interesting being on campus that day and your older sister there who's all popular with her friends and stuff, and she's like, "Oh, yeah, that's my kid sister," and that kind of thing.  But as it turned out, I ended up going to Coahoma Community College in Clarksdale [Mississippi], and that was--my folks [Estella Leggins Madlock and John Madlock] were comfortable with that because one, it was closer to home [Sardis, Mississippi], which was major big time for them.  It was closer to home and I lived with one of my sisters and her husband who lived in the town where the school was.  So I lived off campus and they would see to it that I got back and forth to school and all that, still under this very watchful eye--very guided and all that kind of stuff.  So I went to school there and I became more me, you know, I became, you know, a bit more independent, doing more things.  Got involved with a lot of the organizations, still known by the teachers for having the good grades, but, you know, I participated in more things.  I also got in the drama club there, and that was a major outlet because that forced me to mingle with other kids from across the country, you know, because they were all there.  I remember meeting this guy from New York [New York], and he'd been in plays in New York, so we would sit and talk about that.  But the one thing that I really liked in school was my business teachers.  Mrs. Reed [ph.] taught economics, and her husband was the registrar, and it was interesting because it was this whole family thing.  They were from Boston [Massachusetts] originally but there they were in Mississippi at this very small college, and we would talk about Boston, we'd talk about all these other things, all the time.  And the speech classes that I got involved in because again, in business they talked about delivery.  They talked about being able to present whatever the product was or service or something and you needed to be able to relate to all people.  And mom was very strict about speaking and all that sort of thing so I thought oh, I can refine it, I can do.  But the one thing that I learned that I really liked about that is in the speech classes you'd walk in and you would have to do an impromptu speech on--he'd give you a topic and you've got to go with it.  So I think it was my, obviously, early learning from my [paternal] grandfather [Leslie Madlock] who told stories all the time, and the gift of that and the fact that, you know, I kind of liked theater that I was able to prevail in those classes.  So that was the kind of thing.  So I concentrated on all the stuff that I didn't get before and all that, and in the meanwhile between summer breaks I would come to Chicago [Illinois] and visit my older brothers who lived here and their families and, you know, my job was to babysit my little niece and all that sort of stuff so it was a win-win for everybody.  Also my favorite aunt and uncle lived here, and always just a big time.  And the thing was, even throughout high school I started doing this.  If you get good grades, my reward was my summer vacation, so you bet I wanted to make sure I got the good grades.

Speaker 1: Was Chicago [Illinois] the first big city you ever, you know, went to?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How did Chicago--what was your impression of Chicago?
Speaker 2: Massive.  Obviously, all the tall buildings; there weren't any tall buildings in my home.  I remember riding through the corridor, State Street, where the public housing units were at the time, and they were fairly new back then, whatever.  And I remember there were stories, stories, stories, and I remember saying this as a teenager to my Uncle Bennie [ph.], "Where do the kids play?  If they lived on the twentieth floor or whatever it is of these buildings, where does the kids play?"  And he says, "Well, you know, they have to come down the stairs or elevators, whatever, and they have a little park over there."  Well, I'm used to as a kid having all the free range, the run of the everything, you know, so I can't--I couldn't--it took me awhile to wrap my head around the fact that every child didn't have that same freedom.  And even to this day when I drive through the corridor, corridor of State Street and through where the public housing, I think of the same thing, does the children have places to play?  Are they able to play, you know, comfortably.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's interesting thing to say 'cause most of Chicago as you probably well know is from Mississippi.  I mean, most of black Chicago.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And I imagine that experience has probably been shared by lot, a lot of them, you know, said by where, what are we gonna, you know, where are kids going to play?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.  Now when I was here--as I've said, I lived--originally my oldest brother [Green Madlock]--when I first came, we lived in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] and it was a bustling community, 63rd Street, was very popular and everything and you could just walk up to the mall and walk home, you could do all of these things.  And, you know, you had a nice yard, it was like a two-flat I believe, and it was like nice yard and, you know, cookout in the backyard for every other weekend, everybody's coming over.  It was just--it was nice, but it was in the city you see and a lot of movement around.  We'd go to the movie, we'd come downtown, we do this, we do that.  But, you know, driving through the corridor there and all of these buildings I just worried, like, where do the children play?  You know, I guess the innocence of a child, like, where do the kids play, auntie?  Where are the kids going?  Course you didn't see the kids.  I didn't see any kids, you know, as I was driving through there.  I didn't see any kids.  So I just wondered, where were they?
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you started coming when you were younger, much younger than?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah, I would come every summer if I got good grades.  Between coming to Memphis [Tennessee] to be with my favorite aunt in Memphis, and, you know, the holidays or whatever, and when school was out, my big brothers would send for me to come and visit with them.  Oh, that was major fun, hanging out with the big guys.  That's was just so fun.  So as a result, I got to know a lot of people in Chicago at an early age and I formed relationships, you know, here at a very early age.  And, you know, we'd write back and forth, write back and forth, and us hearing about the kids and the things that they were doing here, or people, the schools they were attending and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was a natural transition when you graduated from Coahoma Community College [Clarksdale, Mississippi] as to come to Chicago?
Speaker 2: It was the most natural place because again I had this real tight relationship with my older brothers and their wives.  My favorite uncle and aunt was here.  I had also personal friends who was here and then, you know, as luck would have it, I met Lumpkin [Robert Lumpkin], and he was here.  It was--it was like all of these things, so it was the old, I kind of teasingly say, follow your heart kind of thing--
Story_ID: 350013
Speaker 1: Now how did you meet your husband, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, it's like all of this.  You know, you're back and forth over time with your family or whatever and you meet--start meeting other people, other kids, and he was four years older, so he was a college person, you know, way, way, way there.  And you'd just, by mutual friends hanging out kind of thing, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So about what year was it when you all met?
Speaker 2: Originally, met that like '70 [1970].  Probably, probably the last summer before, you know, graduating from Clarksdale [Mississippi], from community college [Coahoma Community College, Clarksdale, Mississippi] and coming here.
Speaker 1: So that'd be about 1970, I guess.
Speaker 2: Seventy [1970].
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yeah, well.  So did you come immediately to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So I actually came back--I actually came back to Chicago [Illinois] that late fall, probably October or November and never really went back.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what did you do in Chicago when--did you get a job immediately or--
Speaker 2: Well, little jobs, yes.  I, my first job that I had, I worked at some little boutique.  That was only like for like two, three months because I certainly didn't like the standing around all day, and just didn't feel that productivity.  And then as luck will have it, in talking with my older brothers and sister-in-laws who were here, and they were all actively working and all that kind of thing, we, you know, they taught me how or showed me how to read the paper, look to see, you know, what the job ads were and all that stuff.  And there was a, you know, there were placement agencies that were very busy at the time that would be the contact and they would do the search and send you out on a bunch of interviews.  So I was pretty good at talking myself, well I talked myself into an interview with a placement agent and they arranged for an interview for me downtown.  I didn't know how to get downtown.  So, I got the careful instructions that my brother wrote and took the train and I came downtown headed to the place that I was supposed to go for an interview.  And dad [John Madlock] always said, "Get there early."  So, I was an hour early and I was at the corner of Jackson [Boulevard], Clark [Street] and Jackson and the place I was going was also on Jackson.  But I thought, I'm an hour early, gee whiz, what are they going to do with me for an hour?  So, I look up and there I am standing in front of this huge bank.  It was Continental Bank [Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company, Chicago, Illinois] at the time, it's Bank of America now.  And I thought, ah, I'll go in here and I'll see what they have to say.  So I went in and I'm looking around and there's this beautiful, you know, foyer, I mean it's just--the first floor of the grand banking hall and it just was really new, and the security officer came up to me and says, "May I help you?"  And I just was kind of looking.  You know, here I am straight from Mississippi looking around, and I just said, "Um, yes.  Where's the employment office?"  And he said, "It's right this way."  You know, take this elevator and you transfer and you go here and there and all of that stuff.  And I was like, oh my God, this is confusing.  So, I must have looked puzzled because there was a very, very, um, well-dressed, very prim and proper gentleman that came along and said, "Follow me, I'm going that way," and I thought, okay, so I, you know, followed him.  We got on the elevator and then on the Clark Street side of that building, the elevators go to twenty, you know, go up--you have to transfer to go over to the express elevators to get up to twenty, and, you know, we walked down a corridor.  So, as I'm there, I say, "Oh, my God, this building is huge."  I've never been in a building that is twenty-three stories before.  So, he says, "Really?"  And I said, "No."  So we get off the elevator on twenty and he shows me how to get to where I need to go.  He says, "Just go through double glass doors and she'll take care of you from there."  Well, long story short, throughout the course of the day, I fill out the applications, I have an interview, I take all kinds of tests, they send me to coffee, they bring me back.  I meet people, they send me to lunch, I come back and they said, "We'd like for you to meet Mr. Johnson [ph.].  We think we might have an assignment for you."  And this all started at nine o'clock, I've never left.  It's like two o'clock by now.  And I said, "All right.  I'd love to meet Mr. Johnson."  So, they take me through these, you know, fabulous big, fancy doors and around the corridor and imagine this here's the person in a big leather chair.  This person is on the phone facing out the window and he turns around.  It's the guy who showed me how to get to the elevator (laughter) and I was like, uh, just like that, and he says, "Now, tell me about that little town that you're from."  And I was like "Uh--." I didn't know what to say finally.  But, that was my first foray into getting a job but I was fortunate.  I left Continental Bank with a Welcome to Continental Bank packet.  I had a job and, you know, this was before cell phones or any of that.  I left there--it must have been four o'clock because they scheduled the start day, the medical appointment, all these things and I'm doing everything because I was like, ooh, wait 'til I call home and tell them I got a job with a bank, you know, kind of thing.  And, so I get home off the train and I'm running, you know, to tell everybody and they meet me at the door, "Where have you been?  Everybody's been calling looking for you."  I clearly forgot about that appointment that I was headed to.  So, when people say, "How did you get into financial services?"  I say, "By accident."
Story_ID: 350014
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the other job about? Do you remember what--
Speaker 2: It, you know (laughter), I don't even know what it was now but I know the company was, was an insurance company that was on Jackson [Boulevard] at the time and, maybe I shouldn't mention the name, but, I, you know, 'cause I never got there.  I was supposed to go there for an interview but I never got there.  So, you can imagine the placement agency had called the house several times saying that I never made it to their office.  And then, of course, my family was getting a little alarmed because this is one of first trips downtown and here I am.  Just having a wonderful old time 'cause I've got a new job, I was talking to these people.  You know, they put me through ninety tests and--remember now--I was a great student so I aced all that stuff.  And, you know, then they said, you know, "You need to write an essay."  And I was like okay, so I was doing all that and--
Speaker 1: So, where were you placed?  What did they having you doing?
Speaker 2: Initially, I worked in HR, in human resources.  I was, my job was a staff assistant, and it was like first assignment was staff assistant where you did the same thing.  You know, you work with the applicants, you did a placement test, you did the scoring of the test, and I could score a keypunch operator test faster than anybody in the world because, you know, you had these little cue cards so you could tell exactly how many errors and how many everything, and all that.  And I did that for about like three months and after that I was promoted to, what they called a preliminary interviewer.  This is the person who does the screening to determine if you are employable at all, anywhere in the company.  You know, if you're going--and then you decide which category are you going to be, you know, an analyst, or, you know, auditing, or whatever.  So I did that for maybe a half of a year and then I was placed as a recruiter for the company.
Speaker 1: Okay, now were there many black people working for Continental Bank [Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company; Bank of America] in those days?
Speaker 2: There were some but, I wouldn't say many, no.  I was one of maybe three at the time in HR.  And HR was a pretty large department.  Pretty large department.  I was assigned as a recruiter to recruit for the personal banking units, so I was responsible for staffing tellers and, you know, some of the support groups, like some of the secretaries, the assistants, you know, those kind of like your beginning recruiting level jobs.  And then I moved on to like auditing and on to the heavy financial and on to, you know, some of the management roles.  It was a terrific, terrific way to get to know the bank, to get to know financial services and to get to know the leaders.  Because in HR you learn all the policies, all the procedures.  You're enforcing policy and procedures.  You understand about all the benefits because you're talking to the applicants or the employees about them.  I was a counselor for a while if there were counseling situations.  I did some of the special projects like the internship programs, the maternity leave coordinator, you know, just a number of special projects.  Hire the veterans.  One of the things that I had, you know, the owner to do was place the first sight-impaired secretary with the company.  And it was just a lot of things, and, there were a lot of really great leaders at the company.  At the time, it was number one.  We were always competing against First Chicago [First Chicago Bank and Trust, Chicago, Illinois], you know.  The bank held a global presence so it was a really great assignment.  And I spent ten years in HR.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I remember when I came to Chicago [Illinois], [HistoryMaker] Bob Petty, I think, was the spokesman for Continental Bank on the radio and he was a big deal at Continental Bank.
Speaker 2: Oh, major big deal.  Major big deal.  Excellent training ground.  Lots of really great people have worked there over time.
Story_ID: 350015
Speaker 1: So, after ten years you were--you say you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  After the ten years I had learned enough about the bank [Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company; Bank of America] and, you know, still my interest in business and all that, I thought, well, I would like to get a job on the line, you know.  And, the line is like this is--these are the posi- because obviously HR [human resources] is a staff function.  On the line, this is a position that's revenue generating, you know, where, where you're with clients, and you're working with--you're delivering a product to go to service, or a loan or something, and it's generating revenue for the company.  So you're helping the company grow.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's what you mean by on the line.
Speaker 2: On the line.  You're front line.  That's what we are, in the front line.  Or firing line, whichever, (laughter) you know.  So, I, from there I actually had an opportunity to speak with one of the managers that I had recruited for, and I was able to transfer to be a banker in the--what they called at the time--was the personal financial services group and this was the group that banked the wealthy.  You know, you were like a personal banker.  You'd have a base of accounts, clients and you worked with those clients solely.  That was a great deal of fun.  And I also was given the portfolio for the bank's retirees because I knew the bank policies and benefits and all that procedures from HR, they thought it'd be really great.  The bank retirees are coming in, they're getting their benefits or their lump sum payments and all that sort of thing.  You understand how that all works and what the tax implications mean.  So it would be a natural for them to talk to you and shortly after getting that assignment, the year or so later, the bank had what we call now a buyout, an early retirement program and everybody was paid by check.  Everybody that was, you know, a participant--there were maybe seventy to a hundred people--all paid the same day at the same time.  I remember them saying that the checks would be available after three o'clock, blah, blah, blah.  So, all the folks were running through the door and they were like "I want to see Barbara Lumpsum, Barbara Lumpsum."  (Laughter) Barbara Lumpkin [HistoryMaker Barbara Ann Lumpkin], but they would call me Lumpsum.  I have my lump sum check and I gotta get it in, you know, like this instant, otherwise, you know, I want every interest.  But, so, that went across the bank so people started calling me Lumpsum for a while because that was kind of what it was (laughter).  So, as you can imagine, with the portfolio of the bank's retirees, because the bank always wanted to take care of its former employees, it was a pretty active assignment.  You know, I had a couple assistants helping me keep up with the volume.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is in the early '80s [1980s] or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  By now I'm in the early '80s [1980s].  I was there with them.  I was in that role really for about four, three and a half, four years because I left in '85 [1985] to join the corporate trust department.  I left the PFS [personal financial services] group because at that time I thought, okay, now I'd like to do this for corporations.  I'd like to work with corporations now.  In the corporate trust group we managed long-term debt financings for corporations, municipalities, other institutions and that's how I learned the art of the long-term debt financings.  The bond issuances that people would do, and I did those for hospitals, higher ed [higher education], you know, municipalities and other companies.
Story_ID: 350016
Speaker 1: I know the big thing in Chicago [Illinois], this in those days was the Harold Washington campaign and that's, did you have anything to do with the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, not--
Speaker 1: Washington campaign or were you--
Speaker 2: Other, other than being a responsible citizen and voting and being, you know, respectful to those sorts of things.  In the financial services community, or in financial services, the rules were pretty strict.  You know, you needed very, very special approval to be an active participant in any political arena at all.  And mainly because they were very concerned about individuals giving the impression that the companies, they're acting on as the company opposed to as an individual, so as a result I really never got involved in any of that at all.  There were things that I would do, you know, as far as charities or helping out, but that was not in a political arena at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, how did you feel about, about that at the time in '83 [1983] when he was elected mayor?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was very supportive.  I mean I followed, you know, as much as I could read about him and everything.  I'm sure I attended some of the fundraisers as, you know, a personal--as an individual, but I was not on a committee or actively a part of.  I knew several people who were actively engaged in the campaign and a number of people who knew him, they say, personally, you know.  Quite well.

Speaker 1: This is in January of 1998.  I was being introduced and making my first--
Story_ID: 361034
Speaker 1: In those days, you're one of the few blacks at Continental [Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company; Bank of America]--or any of the major banks in Chicago [Illinois] really had, didn't have that many black people.  So you were like a pioneer in some ways--in a lot of ways, I guess.
Speaker 2: One of things that really helped all of that is a group of individuals who were in financial services in some of the banks across Chicago formed this organization but the lead group of these individuals were at Continental.  Some of the senior bankers that were around, like the Charlie Brummells [Charles Brummell] and, you know, any number of other guys.  They started the--Rich Shealey [Richard Shealey] was one--they started the Urban Bankers Forum [Urban Bankers Forum of Chicago].  And the Urban Bankers Forum was an organization that was designed to provide networking opportunities, idea exchange, all of that.  A place to come and share for African Americans who worked in financial services in metro Chicago.  And, the organization itself was held in very high esteem.  It was a national association of urban bankers and then there was a Chicago chapter.  The National Association of Urban Bankers [Urban Financial Services Coalition] held a conference every year and all of the various folks from the chapters from the respective states would go to wherever the conference was being held--be it Florida or Washington, D.C., Chicago to--and it was a two, three day long program with speakers and seminars and entertainment events.  All kinds of things.  Just a meeting of the minds for people to talk about common issues and concerns and what might be probable approaches to resolve them.  And, it was very good for me to be at a company like Continental where the leadership had the forethought and were willing to support, you know, such an organization.  So they gave us place to, you know, the meeting space, we were able to order refreshments for our meetings 'cause often we met after work.  If we met for breakfast they were kind enough to sponsor that as well and that really was in existence for a very, very, very long time.  In later years, they changed the name to Urban Financial Services because there were other types of non-traditional financial services type roles or institutions that provide financial services to individuals and these (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Credit unions, savings and loans--
Speaker 2: Credit unions, savings and loans, other investment banking-type firms or whatever because if you were not in a traditional bank you could be an associate member and all that but you didn't necessarily can run for office or things like that.  So they just sort of broadened it to include--because as the financial services industry started to change a bit in the mid-'80s [1980s] and especially the '90s [1990s] and all that you saw or as you witnessed any number of different types of financial services institutions or even insurance companies offering finance products--certainly credit unions.  And it was very--and Chicago like any city became a major market for that.  The investment banking firms--a lot of them, you know, established shops here in Chicago because earlier in the day New York [New York] was considered the financial hub and if you weren't in New York, you know, you couldn't do this type of transaction, that kind of transaction.  Well, quickly that changed because Chicago just became, you know, just the hub for things.  You know we have the stock exchanges here, we have all the major headquar- people were establishing shops here, you know, very dominant players here, the economy was ripe for it.  You had a growing very talented population, people to pull from and Chicago also is perceived as a bit more easy to navigate than perhaps New York or whatever.  So Chicago kind of came into its own with some of the major companies locating here.
Story_ID: 361035
Speaker 1: Did the Urban Bankers Forum [Urban Bankers Forum of Chicago] start as a national group or did it start locally and then go national?  In what year did it start (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it was going on major--maybe long time before I kind of got involved because you had to be at a certain level to be a member.  I do recall this, that although I was in financial services working there at Continental [Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company; Bank of America] and in HR [human resources] and it was my boss' boss that, you know, needed to say yea or nay to all the things that the group needed.  My first foray in--when I first submitted my application to become a member of Urban Financial Services [Urban Financial Services Coalition], I mean there was a membership team that looked at the application and reviewed it and all that, you need to be at a certain level.  You needed to be a banking officer at the time and you needed to be a, you know, at this level, this tenure and all that.  I wasn't a banking officer.  I was a senior recruiter but I wasn't a banking officer so my first application was turned down.  Of course, I had a whole lot to say about that because I had this really close working relationship with the person who would sign off on all the things that the organization needed.  So I thought, well, I could be the catalyst for the organization because we all work right here.  Well it was about eight months later I was promoted to whatever the rank was they thought was necessary so they wanted to start somewhere to keep it at a certain level--so I went back and then said, "Okay, here I am again."  And I was a member of the organization.  I learned an awful lot, met an awful lot of people because you could--through this organization, you could take a peek-see into the other financial services institutions and understand what they did and the core of what they did.  I received an award probably in '99 [1999] or so, maybe it was '98 [1998]--late, late '90s [1990s], from this organization as being a pioneer (laughter), and mainly because, you know, you've been in financial services a very long time.  By then, of course, I'm in city government but, you know, you've been in financial services for a long time and I just kept up with the organization because there were just all the individuals and all the products and services that you needed, someone in that group was involved in.
Story_ID: 361036
Speaker 1: Now, at somewhere along the way you went to DePaul [DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois], you went back to school, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  I, yeah, you know, because once I left Mississippi, came to Chicago [Illinois], although Continental [Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company; Bank of America], as I said before, was an excellent training ground, it also afforded you the opportunity to take some classes at night, and all that sort of thing, and I got in line like everybody else.  The bank also had very, very, very well put together training programs.  We would train as managers and leaders, and whatever.  And since I had spent all this time in HR [human resources], there were times when, if there was a new class being offered, they needed someone to, you know, go through the class and determine if it was gonna yield whatever desired results, and I often would volunteer to do that because, say, you could go through the class between four and six and you could still get home and not interrupt the day care arrangements too terribly much, as well as the bank also had arrangements with some of the DePaul University professors, like finance and accounting, in particular, who would come over to the bank and would teach courses, especially in the banking side.  When we were, you know, when I was a personal banker, from 4:30 until 6:30 they would teach these classes and it was everything, it was tons of homework, it was case studies, it was accounting, it was finance, it was just as tough as though you were sitting there in the classroom except you were sitting in the banking conference room.  Those kind of things don't probably exist as much anymore but this was kind of the way you grew up.  So I really had an opportunity to grow up and learn and grow with the company and the business.  Courses that I took at DePaul and Loyola [Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] were things like business ethics and, you know, other accounting courses and just things to add along the way.  But I was juggling various--young family and all kinds of other things, so work and family, school, it was like another compromise--
Story_ID: 361037
Speaker 1: You were at Continental [Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company; Bank of America] how long, I mean--?
Speaker 2: I actually worked for Continental twenty-one years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's until, 'til nineteen--
Speaker 2: Ninety-four [1994], early '94 [1994].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And after leaving Continental I was actually picked off by the competition.  I was working--I worked for Amalgamated Bank [Amalgamated Bank of Chicago] here in Chicago [Illinois].  At Continental, at the time, I was vice president in the corporate trusts and agency services department.  I was the number three--number three on the team again, number three guy.  And the area that we were in, we, again, worked in the long term debt financings, the bond issues, we would go out to various clients, be it institutional clients or corporations or whatever and if they were looking to do some type of long term debt financing, we worked with them to help them structure it, or do that transaction.  And it was a competitive market.  You know, you'd compete for it, you'd submit a proposal and you'd see who wins, and because of all this time and urban bankers, you knew all the bankers on the street, you kind of know who you're going up against.  It was not unusual to be driving up in your rental car and there you're looking over and you're seeing you competition driving up in a better rental car.  So you feel you've got to get a different car next time.  So you go through that.  The other thing, too, is I always made it a point to get to know the other bankers.  I called it friendly competition.  And eh, little competitive I suppose because there are times when there were big transactions that you were both in the hunt for.  Everybody knew that and, you know, you were doing what you could do to make certain you won and you're explaining it and you're working your client and if we lost and if I would see some of the guys at an event or something and I was like, "Oh gee, you know, so sorry you guys didn't prevail in such and so transaction but, really happy I did."  You know, there was friendly competition and I was going up against a lot of the local banks.  Amalgamated Bank was getting there, corporate trust business started, so they were within their first year or so of getting that started and they approached me to come and talk to them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what position did they--
Speaker 2: I was recruited and asked to be the head of their corporate trust and agency services department.  So essentially I went from being the number three guy to being my boss over at the new bank.  Of course, Continental's bigger and all that, but Amalgamated is certainly a force to reckon with.  Very tight knit group, hardworking, it was a great job.  I learned an awful lot.  I had the opportunity to build my own unit and grow the client base and the clients were kind enough to follow me over, so it was really great.  The first year, oh, we were having a ball.  The first year, we doubled our numbers in revenue, as far as the bottom line, and that was really good.  The second year we were well on our way to triple those numbers, given, considering we were starting out, you know, they had, they were in there--they were in their first two years like when I showed up of that business, that line of business was new to them, so the fact that I had been in that world so long at Continental and worked really hard to cultivate all this diverse group of clients, I was able to kind of tap that resource to bring it to a, you know, the mid-size bank and that's why the numbers were coming in as they were.  And towards the end of my second year, I was approached by Mayor Daley's [Richard M. Daley] administration.
Speaker 1: So this is '96 [1996], I guess.
Speaker 2: Ninety-five [1995].
Speaker 1: Ninety-five [1995].  Okay.  Okay, so at Amalgamated, though, were you the first African American to hold that high position?
Speaker 2: To hold that role, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And woman.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  You got both.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  The president [Robert M. Wrobel] at the time who is now the chairman and is a very dear friend, you know, he always called everybody by their last names.  And he would say, "And Barbara [HistoryMaker Barbara Ann Lumpkin]," and I would say "It's okay, say Lumpkin," and he would say "And Barbara."  There we were in our sales meetings or our management meetings or whatever, and we were talking through things and talking through transactions or whatever, and I always really loved, you know, the client activity, really into it, so I always wanted to have something really good to talk about, and, you know, prospects and where we are with transactions, how we're resolving this or that, the other, and he seemed to have been like the biggest, you know, co-sponsor and champion for that because he was saying, you know, "This is kind of where we need help with," you know, put us on the map, put us on the map, kind of thing, so for a smaller place, I acted as though we were the big giant, you know, just as Continental had been.  So that was very fun.
Story_ID: 361038
Speaker 1: So you're approached by the Daley [Richard M. Daley] administration in '95 [1995] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Um-hm. In '95 [1995].
Speaker 1: How did that happen?
Speaker 2: It was a surprise to me, too (laughter).  Mayor Daley had just won re-election in 1995 and he also had just received the authority to take over the public school system [Chicago Public Schools] and as a result, he was re-tooling his cabinet.  The budget chief at the time and his chief of staff and a few of the people who were going over to head the Chicago [Illinois] public school system and so they were moving some people around, the person who was comptroller at the time was being promoted to be CFO [chief financial officer] and they said they were looking to recruit the new comptroller.  I received a call one day and I'm thinking, "Oh my god, have we blown their account?"  I told the staff, "Look, if we're not balanced or we've blown this account, we're all fired so, oh, my god, oh, my god."  But that wasn't what it was about at all.  They invited me to come over for coffee and I thought, "Well, I suppose so, you know, I'll walk over, you're a client."  They didn't say why, they just said, "Have you ever considered government, city government before?"  And I said, "Well, I guess not, I've always worked in a bank."
Speaker 1: And those were the days of Paul Vallas and Gery Chico being the two (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that was the group that had gone over.
Speaker 1: Yeah, had moved over, right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And as a result, Diane Aigotti was named budget director and then, you know, then there was the comptroller role they were looking for.  So I went over and we were just chatting and I was totally convinced in my walk over that I really loved what I was doing, that I was having a really great time, this was a rather unique opportunity for someone like me, you know, the staff and my bosses and all of us.  We had this great working relationship and we were really making some significant inroads and, you know, I was just wanting to do what I could to pull that all off.  And, and besides, they never said, when they invited me over what the assignment was, they just said, "Would you want to come over and talk to us?"  So I went over and spent actually about an hour with them before--being myself, I said, "Okay, what exactly are we talking about.  What job are we exactly talking about?"  And they said, "Well, we're looking to fill the position of comptroller."  I said, "Oh.  Then that's different, let's, you know, let's talk more."  So that's how we started the conversation.  There were I'm sure, a lineup of very talented people.  All of them I don't know who they were or whatever, but I just can imagine that a City of Chicago with the talent that it has that there was any shortage in names.
Speaker 1: I might sound dumb here but, is that, you know, you got a big position in a mid-size bank [Amalgamated Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] and, you know, I mean, being the comptroller in the City of Chicago, is that more attractive than what you, I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, this is what I always try to do in my career is layer experiences.  I thought that, as I still do, that adding the additional experience and the opportunity to see and learn the operation of doing a bond issue from the side of an issuer, which the City of Chicago is and which the comptroller is all responsible for, seeing it from the issuing side, because remember in the past when I was working with the transactions and the clients, it was from the bank's perspective but not from the client's perspective, and I thought I would have been even a better banker because you understand it all.  I was--that was always my goal, to try and get to understand, top to bottom, soup to nuts, so, any conversation I would have with someone or if I was trying to resolve an issue, I'm talking about what I know, not what I'm thinking, or whatever I'm making up, this is a real live experience.  This is something that I, you know, can talk about with confidence and I thought, you know, for these, and this is my reasoning, I thought, you know these assignments are very high intensity, you know, very demanding, long hours, lots and lots of work or whatever.  I'll be back in a couple of years.  That was what I thought, but it became a life of its own and I ended up in city government almost six years and doing several different things from that assignment.
Story_ID: 361039
Speaker 1: From comptroller [of Chicago, Illinois] I was promoted to budget director, which was like a very interesting assignment, where you're working with all of the departments to craft the city spending plan and to also see to it that it's followed.
Speaker 2: When did you become the budget director?
Speaker 1: January of '98 [1998].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay, go ahead, I just wanted to make a--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  January of '98 [1998].  So in that role, you know, you met with everyone, all the stakeholders, internally and externally because that is, you know, I think the Tribune [Chicago Tribune] called it the mayor's enforcer because you're like the, you know, you're over spending, you're doing this, you're doing that, and then, of course, the Sun-Times [Chicago Sun-Times] referred to it as a pressure cooker job because you are in the hubbub of all of that.  Either people love you or they hate you because you're either saying yes to their plan or you're saying sorry, but you know you learn a lot.  You're at the table with the community leaders, you're talking about the projects and you're helping to, you know, develop them.  Now, of course, the previous role as comptroller, more people knew me by signature, than they did by name because the one thing that anybody's looking for the comptroller to do is sign their check.  So the signature was very famous but I walked through a door and they probably would have said, "We just need the pen, we don't need you," kind of thing.  So the comptroller, of course, is responsible for the finance department, the audit, the bond deals were done out of there, the benefits, the city employees are managed out of there.  So it was quite an active assignment as well.  You're the city's--you keep the city's checkbook essentially because all disbursements roll through the comptroller's office.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, but you, I take it you liked being budget director better.
Speaker 1: It was, see, I never had a job that was behind the scenes, the comptroller is a little bit more behind the scenes, although we found ways to make it come to life.  I mean we did a lot of things, you know, interacting with the departments to create this or that program, or to do this, the one big thing that I'm very proud of is we spearheaded and launched a direct deposit of payroll for city employees which is something that, you know, had not occurred before and I would, I had never received a check before so for my first few weeks and months there at the city, I never had any money 'cause I never had a chance to get to the bank to cash a physical check, so we worked to get that implemented and we're very, very proud of that.  As the budget chief I think the thing that was very important is the fact that you have an opportunity to oversee and hopefully add some degree of fairness to those efforts, those initiatives that's put forth for the benefit of the citizens of Chicago [Illinois].  So you're impacting the people in Chicago that you may never meet but hopefully enhancing the quality of their life.
Speaker 2: Is there a story from those days, I mean about a project that you were able to--
Speaker 1: There are wonderful stories.  One of my favorites involves Mayor Daley [Richard M. Daley] and he'll, hopefully, he'll laugh still.  But, one, you know, he would often, I was in and out of his office for meetings, impromptu meetings like maybe three or four times.  I guess the budget chief and mayor work very closely on a lot of things.  And it was a pre-election year and we were working through one of the new initiatives we were going to put forth for the next year, you know, is it going to be about the people not the bricks and mortar?  We determined that the overriding theme for the budget is going to be more, I understand, you know, the quality of life and support, so it's now, it's education, it's all this for kids.
Story_ID: 361040
Speaker 1: --One day he [Richard M. Daley] called me and I would always keep just a blank legal pad at the corner of the conference table and a pen ready to go because, you know, you don't want to miss things, I was want to take the notes to understand exactly what the issues are and if I got a call from the media or whatever.  So this particular day I get summoned to the mayor's office, so it's down through the stairway, run into the door.  Count to three and you run in, and in the room was his press secretary, Jackie Heard [Jacquelyn Heard], is a very dear friend and another one of the deputy chiefs, and the mayor and they're looking pretty solemn and I thought, okay so I'm going to get fired right here in front of my friend or something.  So the mayor is sitting there and he said, "I want a bus," and I look at them and I thought well if all he wanted was a bus you guys could have got him a bus.  What, you know.  So I said "You want a bus?"  And he's like, "Yes I want a bus.  B-U-S.  I want a bus."  And I thought you don't mean a school bus, and he's like, no, I don't mean a school bus.  They don't understand what I'm talking about, and I said tell me what you want to do with the bus, where you want to go on the bus, what, what do you want to do on the bus?  He said, "I want the homeless, I want to take care of the homeless."  And I said, "Oh you want a bus that the homeless can be on."  Okay, what can you--see it was like playing charades.  One of--he wanted a mobile unit that would have some way to connect, you know, it would go around, and on this you, you know, have case management, you know, it has a system loaded in, you can key in and pull up names and addresses and help homeless individuals, and he would say, "They're in the parks, they are under the viaducts, they are wherever, we need this bus to go," and I'm sitting there and I'm writing all this down just like playing charades and I'm talking with him and I said, "Okay, okay, I understand, you want a cross between the bookmobile and the flying swan that the fire department has, but you want medical services."  So I'm really playing charades with him and he's just as firm 'cause he said the homeless need protection, I want to help them, sometimes all they need is a cup of coffee.  Other times they need to know, maybe they have benefits they don't know about it.  Maybe they need, you know, a Band-Aid or two, you know, he was just really being all sincere about this and I was just writing everything down and I said, "I'll tell you what, give me a couple hours, I'll be back.  I'll figure something--I'll come back with a plan."  So I leave and I'm giving them a hard time like, guys, you give me, you know, cooler--so I go back to my office and I had very talented young people working with me in the budget office, and I pulled this long piece of paper out of the printer as I'm going in and it's like, "Okay, guys, this is what we need to do.  We gotta figure out how we get a cross between the bookmobile and Loyola's [Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] medical van in some kind of a unit because the mayor wants to help the homeless."  So we call, I put one guy on the phone to call a fleet department.  I call another guy on the phone to call Loyola, and I'm there with my big piece of paper and I'm drawing a bus and putting--so we're talking to the folks in Loyola and they said on the bus we have computers that link to the aid of this to that, and it can do case management, they can take in information, they can do intake.  On the bus is a nurse practitioner who can administer basic medical services and can help people get on their way.  We can do some tests on the bus.  We would check in to see if we can do an x-ray machine, or, you know, test for TB [tuberculosis] or whatever.  So we were just talking through this and I'm going uh-huh, uh-huh.  The fleet manager at the time found the manufacturer, the builder of that bus from Loyola and in Wisconsin and we're talking through it so we were putting it together.  So in two hours I was back down there with my Etch A Sketch and telling him what we were able to do, that we are able to talk to the folks in Wisconsin, talk to the people at Loyola, figure out what we could do, and now well we just--we found this firm in Wisconsin and this is what I think you're talking about.  It was, you know, this Mayor Daley's medical, mobile, sort of, whatever we'll call it, something like that, and we're just sorting this out.  And I said, "Is this what you're talking about?"  And he looks at it and he looks at me like, he says, "Yeah, that's what I want."  I was like, good!  (Laughter) It was just too funny.  But, so to this day when you see those two big buses toddling through town, I have to sit back and smile because that was one day that was pretty tense (laughter) when no one understood what exactly he was talking about, but he has this, this vision of things and, you know, it sometimes, it's just like--it was just like playing charades.  And these two individuals said, "I didn't have a clue as to what he was talking about.  When you came in the door, it was like oh, boy."  But we figured it out.
Speaker 2: So, it--
Speaker 1: And that was years later, here the buses are.  They're still here.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a good story.  I mean it--so you're a valuable part of a team in terms of that, being able to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, I hope so.
Speaker 2: --figure out--
Speaker 1: I hope so, I hope so.  I particularly like, in all of the jobs that I've ever had, the ability to solve an issue or apply new approaches to resolve old problems or whatever.  The banking experience was great for teaching me that.  You may have had this, you know, lineup of clients today, but you can rest assured that everybody else was interested in that same, you know, base of clients, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 350025
Speaker 1: So are we ready to talk about being treasurer?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was appointed treasurer in June of '99 [1999] to carry out an unexpired term.  The previous treasurer needed to vacate--had to vacate the office, and I was appointed treasurer of the city [Chicago, Illinois].  As you can imagine, quite an honor to serve the city in such a role.  I was very excited about it because it was--you know, it was the one position where I would be able to use every single ounce of experiences that I've gained over all those years, be it banking, be it whatever, you know, and other units of government.
Speaker 1: Is the city treasurer generally elected?
Speaker 2: It is elected.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That was the--
Speaker 2: It is one of three elected positions.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The mayor, of course, the city clerk and the city treasurer are the three citywide elected officials.
Speaker 1: Was that Miriam Santos?
Speaker 2: It was Ms. Santos.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It was kind of a controversy there when she left that position, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  She had a legal (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, you're coming in--
Speaker 2: She had a legal matter and she stepped away, yes.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: So I came into the office at a time where there was a lot--it was heightened attention and, you know, a lot of public interests in the office and its operations and all that sort of stuff based on some of the things that dealt with her legal matter.  And it was quite a bit of what to do, you know, right away, you know, to restore order and to restore staffing and also sort of restore public trust, you know, heighten visibility of the office again, have people understand why it exists, what it does, how it supports the city, that sort of thing.  Well as treasurer, you're the custodian of the dollars--of the city dollars--you manage the city's portfolio so you are managing the portfolio and you serve on the public pension funds.  And you serve as custodian for the public pension funds.  The thing that was pretty exciting for me as a person who had essentially grown up in banking was all of the individuals that I had worked for, all of the bankers and various CEOs or whatever were the first to raise their hands and say, you know, we're more than happy to help in any way we can, please let us know.  So at my disposal was, you know, all of the financial experts in Chicago [Illinois] and New York [New York] as well because I'd worked as comptroller with the CFO [chief financial officer] to interact with the rating agencies and the banks there as well.  So what I did right away was to sit down with the various leaders of the financial services community and in some cases along with their economists and their portfolio guys and understand clearly from the inside how they build their union, how they built their treasury operation because my goal was to build a real treasury operation for the city that it, you know, so that we could be able to support the city in the long haul.  And I had an opportunity to work towards that.  I was fortunate to be able to recruit some very talented people to join me in that effort to, you know, that had financial services experience, who had proven track records, who were interested in doing that kind of a job, and we rolled up our sleeves and we worked literally 24/7.  I was in that office just slightly less than a year, but when I look back over the calendar that I kept, when I look back at all the events, sometimes morning and evening in the same day while running the, you know, in the office and everything else, it's just numbing, because I can't imagine I kept up that pace.  We had an awful lot to do--
Story_ID: 350026
Speaker 1: It was also the year of Y--the millennium is Y2K [Year 2000], so we needed to switch over the systems and everything else.  So it was everything from soup to nuts to deal with, the systems, the staff, the--all kinds of technology, getting voicemail, email, all that.  And--
Speaker 2: Just to pause on that for a minute, the Y2K phenomena.  I mean, the whole country seemed to really be abuzz about the Y2K, and a lot of fear in the air.
Speaker 1: A lot of fear.
Speaker 2: Cities purchased special equipment all over the country.
Speaker 1: All over the world.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All over the world.
Speaker 2: Everything from water to special (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh gosh, it was flashlight batteries to--
Speaker 2: --flashlights to--
Speaker 1: --every single thing.  The, the--
Speaker 2: And nothing, nothing--I mean, or did something happen and we were prepared for it and dealt with it--I mean, did nothing happen?
Speaker 1: I'm not aware of any significant thing that occurred, but you didn't know because the way many of the computer systems were, you know, built at the time when we were approaching Y2K, they were not built to--they were built for the 1900s, they were not built for the, you know, two thousand anything, so they were worried that is it, you know, would the systems cut over and if the systems or the computer chips didn't cut over, whatever, might that, you know, the traffic lights might malfunction.  Computer generators that generate all the water pumping stations might, you know, so it was all kinds of things that could be potentially major catastrophes for cities, individuals, everybody and it was across the world.  And you can imagine as the treasurer there is this extra burden of being concerned about that because you're holding the benefit of one's pension funds within these accounts or you're managing the dollars or you're involved with the pension funds, or you--the city's dollars, you know, whatever, and you just didn't want that to be on your watch as a problem.  Obviously Y2K was a new issue but nonetheless you wouldn't be responsible for it.  So as a unit and as the administration, we worked very closely to see to it that all of the systems were communicating effectively and there weren't any glitches that we could tell and we were doing what we could do get everything structured.  Now the hardship for me going into the treasurer's office in June of that year is I knew for a fact, because as budget chief, I'd been on the Y2K executive committee and had been working at this for a year already for the rest of the department.  So here as treasurer, I really need to play catchup, bust the thousands and thousands of hours that we put into this working the weekends and everything to see to it that we had everything in place, and we had tested and retested because we--this group was not a part of the previous group.  So we get through that and then, also, all of your providers providing any sort of service to the city that you need to benefit, you know, depend on, are they Y2K compliant?  So you needed to be able to say that for all the money managers that's managing money for the city, although they're doing it through your office, are they Y2K compliant?  If some--if there's a hiccup--am I going to be able to draw, am I going to be able to clear a check, am I going to be able to issue a check and not to mention the various members of my church, realizing that that was my job at the city, they'd be talking to me after service.  "Honey, are you sure my pension check is going to be okay?"  So you really have to say, "Yes, Mrs. Such and So, your check will be okay," or "I'll be there."  But I will tell you this, for the Y2K ball that the mayor [Richard M. Daley] had that New Year's Eve, I was one of the few people who had a pager connecting to all of my senior deputies on my belt with my ball gown on because I was very concerned that as the clock ticked over, people were reporting to me, "We're okay, we're okay, we're okay."  The guys in New York [New York], you know, the various banks in New York, there was just like a network, they agreed to, you know, contact me as well and let me know how they cut over because they were an hour ahead.  So I'm hearing from the folks in New York saying, "We're okay," in New York and, you know, our network is still working with yours in Chicago [Illinois] because I'm doing business with, you know, a lot of people.  So that was a very exciting time for me--a little nervous as well because I just thought oh boy, I hope I don't have this as a story to explain to anyone.  But we were very fortunate we did not have any kind of hiccup of any kind but, you know, one can say, gee whiz, was that all for naught, or one could say, gee, if you hadn't planned, maybe it was the planning that avoided the issue that you probably could have had because let's face it, some of the systems sometimes can be a little antiquated and you just don't know how they're going to behave in a real situation.  But that was a big time.
Story_ID: 350027
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know it was a big deal for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a very big deal.
Speaker 1: --city government all over the country.
Speaker 2: All over, all over.
Speaker 1: There were millions of dollars spent trying to--
Speaker 2: Millions of dollars and hours and hours and hours--
Speaker 1: --deal with the effects of or the projected effects of Y2K [Year 2000].
Speaker 2: But no one, no one wanted to be in front of a camera or any place else to say that we did not think of this or did not work on this and something happened.  If one red light, one traffic light had malfunctioned and someone was injured or worse, who would want to be responsible for that?
Speaker 1: Was there any voice that you remember that actually said hey, this is wasted time, we're not--this is not going to happen.
Speaker 2: Well, they probably didn't quite say it to me as treasurer [of Chicago, Illinois].  They probably said it to a few others but they probably didn't quite say it to me.  Along with all the things that we had to be responsible for, protecting the city dollars and all those pension fund dollars were paramount, so I don't believe anyone would've wanted to err on the downside of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well, okay, so we're in the year 2000 now and you're city treasurer, now you stayed the city treasurer until--
Speaker 2: I actually spent about nine months in the office.  I left in April, you know, of 2000, officially in April.  The former treasurer [Miriam Santos] was granted an appeal and she was able to be restored--
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: --to the office so the previous conviction was overturned.  And the other proud moment for me in government was to be able to sit down and work through all of that, you know, and basically in front of camera because there was an awful lot of attention, this was the first time this has ever happened and this was going down in history and all this sort of thing.  And I remember sitting there talking to the mayor [Richard M. Daley] one day and I said, "You know I always thought that it would be really cool to do a financial transaction that got written up by one of the New York [New York] papers," and I said I don't know if I thought this would be it because since this was the first time that one in office would need to do a reverse transition--lucky me--so I'm getting to do a reverse transition, and, you know, I was being lighthearted about it, but being very serious about it because we did an audit to ensure that everything was fine on the way out, all the books and records were intact.  We did a thorough transition report documenting everything from day walking in the door to day walking out the door and, you know, every media outlet in the country was interested.  I got several letters from other public officials across the country, also, sort of, you know, either admiring or saying they can't imagine going through, you know, such a transition and having it be so visible.  It was very, very public.  All I could remember was as I looked in the face of the cameras, almost on a daily basis, to do the updates like this is what's going on, this is what I know of the court case or what I don't know of the court case, and obviously it was my goal to always be in full compliance with the law because everybody was saying, you know, is she going to be able to return and what are you going to do and da, da, da, da, you know, I just never worried so much about what I was going to do other than, you know, there can't be two treasurers so I'm going to move on.  But in looking in those cameras I always figured, "Oh my goodness, there's tons of people looking back," so what I want them to see is an office and an officer in control of the business at hand and to know that their taxpayer dollars are being managed wisely.  So I didn't worry about that.  Now, I'm sure in my quiet moments I was worried, like oh, my God, what am I going to do?  But I didn't think about that so much, probably wide-eyed innocence or something, that I didn't worry about that so much.  But it was a fun assignment and it was terrific to be able to do that transition and hand that office over fully-restored, restructured, totally revamped, staff, technology and all and just hand it to someone that they can say, now you can take this and go on.  I'm very, very, very proud to say that the bulk of the people that I recruited into that office are still there today, and they're still utilizing some of those procedures.  And of course now we have a different treasurer, you know, in Ms. Judy Rice [HistoryMaker Judith C. Rice], who's also a very good friend.  So she talks about being able to use those procedures and things that I left as a basis to follow.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's an honor.
Story_ID: 350028
Speaker 1: Did you go to Northern Trust [Northern Trust Corporation, Chicago, Illinois] immediately after you--
Speaker 2: Not immediately thereafter. I, you know, just needed some time to kind of stop working the ninety hours a day (laughter) and sort of settle.  I worked--I went to the mayor's office as a special assistant to the mayor [Richard M. Daley].  I was working on a number of projects.  One of the things that I worked on was--the mayor had appointed me during my tenure as treasurer to a mayoral task force and that task force was charged with coming up with ways to identify opportunities to utilize minority women-owned firms at the city [Chicago, Illinois].  And I was fortune to have business leaders, public and private sector, higher ed [higher education], medical services, across the board, work with me on that and we served up some really interesting kind of cutting edge, I think, ideas about what the opportunities could be and how we could reshape, how we could restore.  And one of the things that was in that report was some of the things that's in place now in city government and it was kind of like how to restructure and instead of calling it purchasing maybe we call it procurement services.  So here it is.  I just did that assignment and together with everybody else and when that project was over, it was quite an involved one because we met with the various groups and met with the various individuals, met with community, met with, you know, faith-based, met with all the state collators and everybody else and when the new procurement chief was appointed in 2000, I said, "Here's the bulk of the work that I've worked on and here are some of the things that the group thought might work."  And I worked on a few of the other projects there in the mayor's office concentrating on maybe finance, or community outreach kind of stuff and while deciding what I would do next.  And that's when I went to Northern Trust.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was at the end of the year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it was at the end of 2000, end of 2000.  Okay.
Speaker 2: December 2000, I joined Northern Trust.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how--what position did you hold at Northern Trust?
Speaker 2: I went to Northern Trust in--my official role was senior vice president.  I was first placed in the public funds group.  My role was, it was like an undefined role, it pretty much one that I supported the leadership of that group and over time, the role sort of morphed into senior vice president and head of its public affairs and government relations kind of group.  Kind of a new role that had not yet existed before at the company, and it took on various shapes depending on the nature of what we were doing.  But the central core of it was to help position the company in the, and its core products, in the communities it served.  And if that meant sitting there with some of the investment guys, talking to a client about an investment transaction, that was helping protect the turf.  So basically my role was to join the others, to partner with them to help protect and grow the business.  Also, interact with all of the key decision makers external to the bank, be it organizations or political figures who would have an impact on the corporation's well-being.  Part of my role was a lot of problem solving, lending a hand in developing strategy to resolve certain things.  You might say I got involved in some of the more complicated, more complex situations, which was kind of fun for me because I kind of like the activity.  So that was the job.  It was--talk about a trailblazer--much of it had to do with a lot of the external business, you know.  Anything that might impact the bank's impression, its image or its client base--
Story_ID: 350029
Speaker 1: Are there any stories from the Northern Trust [Northern Trust Corporation, Chicago, Illinois] days that you have that--
Speaker 2: Well, the Northern Trust is a wonderful institution and the leaders are very--they're very close-knit, they're long-tenured people at Northern.  The chairman himself has probably been with Northern his entire career.  Bill Osborn [William A. Osborn] is someone I've known for a long time prior to going to Northern, we've served on boards together, that sort of thing.  They are very community-minded, they are very family-oriented.  They encourage you to take vacation, something that I had not been able to do very much of in previous jobs.  They have a use-it-or-lose-it policy for vacation.  The nurturing, the family focus is very, very important.  Northern has won for the last probably fifteen years the award for being one of the places that's great for working moms from Working Mother magazine, that sort of thing.  So they are also listed as one of the top ten most charitable corporations, so they really encourage senior leaders to be involved, actively engaged in community and, you know, volunteering, and that sort of thing, which was great for me because when I went to the bank, I still--I had a number of organizations that I was already volunteering for, so I was able to continue that and build on others.  And that was really a great thing for me.  I think some of the things that was interesting was being able to sit down with the senior leaders like the chairman and his team and really talk through--maybe some of the external factors that might impact the bank's image or its product or service and help lead the effort or lead the effort to address those things.  That was really great.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now one thing that--I mean Northern Trust as an image in the black community has been kind of a, you know, with the dichotomy of Chicago [Illinois], North Side and South Side, it's like--it's Northern--it's not (laughter) the South Side at all, but Northern Trust opened a branch on the South Side.
Speaker 2: Yes, at 79th [Street] and the Ryan [Dan Ryan Expressway].
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Which is--
Speaker 2: 79th and the Ryan.  Yeah, I--it's interesting how, how your life come full circle because I was in city government and part of the ribbon-cutting ceremony for that branch some years ago.  It's a wonderful facility.  They do a lot of work out of there.  There's a community room that they have expressly for the purpose of various organizations and the community will use that as a place to hold their meetings or their events, or whatever.  It does a lot of things like that.  Perhaps people don't really know all that because they just hear what they hear.  But it is--it's very open-minded in the sense that it is community based, refreshingly so because you can do here a lot of those things.  I--
Speaker 1: I like the idea that it's Northern Trust that kind of makes people feel like, oh they feel a little more confident about the neighborhood or something.  Northern Trust has a branch there, you know.  I don't know.
Speaker 2: Well, I think just like anything, you know, you move to a neighborhood and you look around and you see, you know, where the houses are there or whatever, but I think that the mere fact that they're this financial giant established a space there says this community is solid, it's credible, and we want to be associated or we are associated.  Northern has a rich history, and it was formed in 1889 by the Smith family, and it's been going strong ever since.  It has weathered a number of storms throughout the years, and it's done it well.  You know, I remember as a banker competing against Northern years ago in the financial services--on the person of financial services side, remember we bank the wealthy, too, and Northern was doing such a thing and, you know, there were clients that they were able to help along from us.  So I think over the years the leadership understands that that impression may be out there, and I know that they do quite a bit to try to dispel those images.  And I think part of it is because there is a lot of people who don't quite understand Northern's core function.  It is--it is not heavy retail like some banks are, like any of you may have some banks that have heavy retail.  They're doing this--open a checking account they give you fifty dollars, or do this, that, or the other.  Tradi- it's a very traditional financial services institution and wealth management is its mantra, and then of course it does institutional services.  So, it's not auto loans and everything else you know, it has a very kind of a focused core mission.  It's not--does not have credit cards or student loans or things like that, and typically when we think of retail, this is where the largest population of individual would go for the individual types of transactions.  And I think that that's what has led to some of its--the confusion around it as well.
Story_ID: 350030
Speaker 1: You've been at Northern Trust [Northern Trust Corporation, Chicago, Illinois] until just recently, right, you went back (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I was in Northern Trust until late last September.  It's about this time, actually this week last year that I received a call from the mayor [Richard M. Daley] asking me to help him out, or to consider coming over to take the role--take the helm of the chief procurement officer role, and obviously not a role that I would have thought of for myself at all because I have done all those other kind of roles, you know, and financial services and all that sort of thing.  But like anything, he's pretty convincing, as well as I looked at it as an opportunity to perhaps take the blend of experiences, personal interests, to try to be a part of the solution.
Speaker 1: I know there were some problems, but I don't know how much you want to say on camera about what the problems were, but just for a frame of reference for whoever's watching this, there was a fire truck scandal, a lot of other things going on in the administration.  They did not touch the mayor directly, but a lot of people associated with the mayor or the city administration were in trouble under the investigation at a certain period of time and then some.
Speaker 2: Well, unfortunately like anything the city has had some challenges that were legal in nature and it's sort of weathering those storms, you know.  What I think the mayor has been very committed to do and is very interested to do is, as he said, unfortunately, you know, these things have didn't pan out as you'd hoped do whatever or, you know, he's trying to make certain that citizens of Chicago [Illinois] know that he is very committed to doing what is right, he always has been.  He's looking to restore, he's looking to rebuild.  As a matter of fact, when he was talking to me about this role because I asked him, "Why me?"  I mean I've--the purchasing that I know is kind of like at the boutiques or whatever, it's not like I've, you know, ever been a procurement officer, and the one word he used was that: "I'm interested to reload.  I really need someone that I can trust who's going to go in, work hard, do what's right and fair and be and treat people well."
Speaker 1: Now this is interesting because this is basically the second time that this has happened.
Speaker 2: What second time?
Speaker 1: The first time was Miriam Santos and you were drafted [as city treasurer] and it's a crisis--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --somebody's in trouble.  The mayor looks around and says who can we get here that's trusted and is going to make this work right, and I think Fran Spielman, in an article last year, described you as a--almost described it as a baseball game where they--you're the utility infielder they bring in to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh (laughter).
Speaker 1: --clean stuff up, you know, you're the one that--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, I mean I'll take that as a compliment.  I think that--I don't look at it personally that way.  I look at it as here's an opportunity to apply the experiences and the skills that I've gained over time to one as a great listener--listen to what the issues are then think real quickly to what could be a probable solution.  Relationship management is something--a skill that I've worked on really hard to hone over time and try to help get through crisis because--oh yeah, there's been a few.  The other thing is just the sense of focus, the balance, like what's right, what's wrong.  Understand, you know, the essence of the world you live in and do what's right.
Story_ID: 348399
Speaker 1: Return to this--almost a situation where you come in to restore the department or restore credibility to something.  Have you--I know you're modest and you don't think of yourself as doing this, you know, obviously, but does it cause you to reflect on the way government is really about at all?
Speaker 2: Of course it does all the time.  And, you know, because when you are in government--at least my role for being in government, I see it the same as I did any other assignment I had, rather it was at the bank or any place else is that, you know, it is my goal to do the best job I can for the benefit of those individuals I serve.  And obviously if it's at the bank because if I did the best job that I could for the benefit of, you know, the clients and all that stuff, it was going to mean real benefit for me at the end of the payday or bonus time or whatever.  Obviously there aren't bonuses or anything like that in city government, but the bonus for me is the feeling of knowing that you were able to make a contribution and you chose to make a contribution for the benefit of others.  As I've said, there are a number of people that I may never meet or see, but if we were able to get those buses out there and were able to help the homeless and, you know, when they roll pass me in traffic, you kind of hit the smile, or when you look at any other program that you had a hand in or helping to do, you--the same thing, and hopefully it lives on and is appreciated that way.  It just goes way back to my childhood days.  We did what we could in the community to help the others and maybe this is that and more, you know, in broader scale.  You know, I just look at it as just to do something for the good of the whole.  Yeah, it's a huge sacrifice, the hours are long, it's really tough most days and you do a lot of running, you do a lot of interacting.  It can be very demanding.
Speaker 1: What are your goals as procurement officer, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, because as the, the department of procurement services is a contracting authority for the city.  All of the, you know, the--we're involved with all of the departments and towards helping them in the acquisition of their goods and services that they need in order to deliver their services.  My goal personally is to build an infrastructure in operations and staff a team and all that with procedures and technology and everything to support the city's whole contracting processing for the long haul.  I'm not looking for a Band-Aid, I'm looking for ways that we really can address the operational issues thus the award--time to award contracts efficiently and smoothly--departments understand what they're roles are, we understand what we're doing--we do that.  Our vendors respect us.  I want to make certain that the whole tone or the essence of contracting in Chicago [Illinois] is respected and well regarded.  I'd like to see this department--and we're getting there quickly, and rebuilding it within departments because I'm following the same kind of strategy that I would if I with the bank.  And that's because getting to know my client is the other commissioners and the department has understanding what exactly does street sanitation [City of Chicago Department of Streets and Sanitation] need and why this product and what's involved in it.  I also want to get involved in understanding the industry around the development of that product.  Like I can make projections, we can do analyses to determine where we might go with a purchase, when might we go with a purchase, how do we leverage our dollars.  Bottom line is, I'd like to see procurement services be thought of as the business hub for the City of Chicago.  And that's huge for me because it's the business hub.  This is where all the contracting spending rolls through.  And if we can make the most of those dollars, we're doing far more for the citizens and we're doing--we're making Chicago really the vision, you know, the visionary that it is.  I mean, most, most cities that I move through, whether when I'm on vacation or there for business or whatever, once they realize you--anybody realizes you're in city government--how do you do this, how do you guys do that, what are your thoughts on this, what's your policy for this, whatever.  We're way out there in front of them already on many things.  I'd like to see us really, really get out there.  And far enough, that others would really have to work to catch up.  Just as when you're in the bank, you want to be with the financial giant.  You want to be with the solid player and you want to be respected as a solid player.  I want the same thing here.
Story_ID: 348400
Speaker 1: What's the role of your office I guess in terms of ensuring or helping more minority contractors get, you know, contracts in the city [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: We manage in procurement services--the city's business enterprise programs fall under my umbrella as well as part of the procurement services currently.  The city's business enterprise programs are the minority women-owned firms and disadvantaged business enterprises, businesses owned by people with disabilities, all of that.  Those people that are certified in those categories would fall under our program.  Our job is to see to it that they're properly certified--they're accurately certified to do business with the city.  The other thing is as departments make their requests, you know, we advertise for whatever product or service or good or whatever it is, it is our goal to work with the departments to ensure that we continue to find ways to engage or to include more minority women law firms.  Some of the things that we're doing to work with departments to address those, those issues so smaller companies which they typically are can participate as maybe looking at how a contract--when we contract, you know, look at the size of the transaction.  If it's some jumbo transaction, does it really have to be?  Or can be build it such that smaller companies would be encouraged to respond to the RFP [request for proposals] or would apply or whatever.  Can we increase competition?  Can we--by doing that, we'd get better pricing thus I can, you know, money can go further.  What are the barriers that minority, women law firms face, how do I address those?  It's the same thing when I was looking at the bank saying, "Okay, Mr. or Ms. CEO, here are the things--here are the challenges we face in the Northeast, here are the challenges we face in the West Coast."  We're in the Midwest; we've got to figure out how we smooth all this out, and these are the three things that we need to do, the same thing here.  What are the barriers that, you know, small firms face?  Is it insurance, is it access to capital?  Is it--gee, they don't know how to apply, you know.  Do they have the where with all?  Do they know about our projects?  Do they know enough about our projects that they feel welcomed?  Do they know enough about us?  So, it's the targeted outreach is working to see how to get real access to capital.  I don't mean just somebody just say they have a bond program, but really kind of get to know the financial institutions and say, "You know, what does your program really do?  How does it work?  What kind of firm would fit your profile?  How do they get in line with you?"  We're working very hard to see to it that all of our procedures are transparent.  Everybody understand how to apply.  Lots of stuff loaded on the web.  So, it's a very active portion of the assignment, but I think it's a very critical portion of my assignment.  This is the part of the job as I say to the mayor [Richard M. Daley] and to the chief of staff and everybody, this is the part of the job where I really like step in to it.  You, you know, you have to personally step into it because you really have to feel the passion around wanting to help the businesses, and they have to feel that you care.  You know, they're like okay, we've heard this before.  How many, you know, you've had like how many, you know, procurement services people or whatever.  But do you understand us enough that you'll know how to address the issues or you'll recognize them when we tell you about them 'cause sometimes maybe, you know, they don't, don't want to be as forthcoming.  But a part of my role at say Northern Trust [Northern Trust Corporation, Chicago, Illinois] was working with minority, women-owned investment firms or securities brokerage firms, and working with the company and the portfolio managers around the globe to see--to work to develop a program for which they could also utilize minority women law firms to help do our trades, place our investments.  So this to me is a layer of that.  So I would hope that when I'm talking to the firms that they would be able embrace me in this role and understand that the experience and the, the things that I'm talking about isn't stuff that I just read yesterday or I just made up last night.  It's experience that I've gained over time by actually being part of the community that they live in one, and two, having experienced some of those things maybe in my own career, so I see it very differently.  And it is a very personal charge.
Story_ID: 348401
Speaker 1: Now we always ask this question, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: I really hope that we can find a way to really unify.  You know, if we could find a way to come together for the good of the whole.  For some of the things that I've faced over time is just, you know, I realize the issues have been grave, they've been disappointing, they've been a lot of things.  But I always see it as, you know, a glass half full.  If not, I probably would just like give up.  You know the song, "They never told you it was going to be easy," well that is more than true, but if we could agree to come together and determine those things that's beneficial and good that's, that's important for our community as a whole rather than individual concerns and agendas, I think we'd get a lot further.  And to be able to rally with someone or groups that can help us get there because you know it's like anything, if you start to--start the cherry picking of it off or whatever you start to vying the crowd and people go different directions.  I'd like to see us kind of get back to that, if we could.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know the last--as a banker in the last couple of decades, we've seen a decline of black banks in Chicago [Illinois].  Drexel [Drexel National Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] closed, Independence Bank [Independence Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] is closed.  How do you see the black bank in terms of stress in the black community now?  Is it still needed or is it--is banking just too complicated at a black bank?
Speaker 2: I will always think it's needed.  It is complicated.  It's a very--well obviously the risks are there and they're there more and more regulations that the SEC [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] and everybody, everybody places on the government, everyone.  And as in anything we you're placing your hard earned dollars with anyone, the expectations triple fivefold.  I was interviewed once by a magazine and they were wondering if I thought as a banker that had been around for a few years, if I thought that there was a future for people of color in banking.  And I thought, well of course, I think there's, there's a future, and it should be a healthy future for people of color because who would be the best candidate to tell you how to market to me?  I would.  Who would be the best candidate to tell you if this is that product or service is going to go over my community?  I would.  Who'd be best to be able to tell you how not to make some of the blunders that can turn off an entire community, an entire opportunity for a whole new product base or new line of clients?  I would.  Or people who are from those communities.  So I think that the diverse blend of all those experiences and expectations and understanding peppered with obviously the skill and know how, but they bring the sensitivity of those communities and I think financial services would be wise to factor that into their plan--
Story_ID: 348402
Speaker 1: Now when you look back on everything you've done thus far, and you're still in the prime of life in terms of the kind of work you do, what--is there any major thing that you would do differently now?  I mean, if you could go back and do it again?
Speaker 2: Probably, yes.  I think that I would probably would've had the nerve to raise my hands sooner to say that I wanted a line position.  I probably would've gone to the bosses sooner to say that I would like to work in this unit to do something taking a little bit more risks.  Because any--when I managed to get the nerve to say I want to be considered for this line position and I want to work with a corporate client because I'm number two on this transaction anyway, the number one guy talks sports and weather but when we turn to the portfolio and start talking, I'm the one talking about it.  (Laughter) I would've--I maybe would've had--wish I could have had the courage to do it sooner because when I manage to get in the role, I felt like I had to play catch up and work myself to death.  And the reason why I said would've done it differently is because the response I got when I managed to walk in the boss' office at seven o'clock in the morning because I wanted to get that conversation over before everybody got there is he said, "I'm glad you came forward because we wouldn't have thought of you."  So, I think I should have made him think of me sooner (laughter).
Story_ID: 348403
Speaker 1: Have you ever thought of political office or--
Speaker 2: Like running for office?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Only when people ask me.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Only when people ask me about it.  I've never just say thought about it to myself that I'm going to run for this or that the other.
Speaker 1: So it's not internally generated, but people have asked you to then before?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I've had people offer to mount a campaign, just telling me what office kind of thing, and I was like, oh, well, I think you're being a little bit ahead of the game.  As I'd said, I've enjoyed the assignments that I've had.  I've been very fortunate, I've been very blessed.  It was a wonderful honor to be treasurer to do what I could.  But I, I went in just as I look at this job, I went in and looking at it from the business perspective, I was like, "You know mayor, I'm very interested to build the treasury operation just, just like any other boutique up down LaSalle [Street] or Wall Street."  I want the same kind of portfolio managers, I want the guys with all the series, you know, exams taken just like everybody else.  That's what I want to build.  I want to be able to sit down with the economist and plot where we want to go with things just as any other boutique.  So I really never thought of it as political as much, but I was looking at it as how do you deliver this.
Speaker 1: But what are your future plans for the immediate future now?  You're--I'd say you're in the prime of life in this now, so what do you see for yourself?
Speaker 2: Well, I hope to be able to drive through some of the initiatives that we've started there in the procurement services office.  We--we're launching or we launched some months ago this huge initiative to try to revamp the way we do contracting in Chicago's [Chicago, Illinois]--the byline at the bottom says setting a new tone for contracting, whatever.  And it's mainly because of some of things you referred to earlier, many people have a whole different impressions in their mind.  Many people told me I was totally crazy for taking this assignment, I mean if voice box--the mail box at home and at work was just jammed with everybody calling me telling I was crazy.  And you know what I told them, I said, "Probably."  But I'm looking a little bit beyond that and saying that, you know, I've been on the side of the table and on to the side of the fence and say, "Gee, I wish somebody would come in and help do this or that," or "I wish that this could happen to do this or that the other way," and everybody sitting around the table saying the same thing.  So, was it that it was kind of up to me to take that little--you know, put the tone in the water or the jump in the water or whatever.  As I said, I didn't look for this or didn't go apply or whatever, but you know, being approached and sort of having someone say, "You have demonstrated your ability to work through challenging assignments before and get through it in one piece and, you know, have people feel good about the process.  I'd like for you to help me do this again."
Story_ID: 348404
Speaker 1: With that in mind, what today would you say is your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I--on the professional side, I think probably the contributions to city government [in Chicago, Illinois].  That's what people most recognize or know.  And on the--and in the banking side, I think people would say the ability to really kind of execute, manage the relationships and get through complicated transactions without too much of a hiccup.  And personally, hopefully being a good mom [to LaTonya Lumpkin] and just being grounded.
Story_ID: 348405
Speaker 1: Now, yeah.  Well tell us about you.  You, you have a daughter?
Speaker 2: Well I have one daughter, Toni [LaTonya Lumpkin].  My daughter and I essentially grew up together.  My husband [Robert Lumpkin] died when she was really very young and being a daddy's girl like I was a daddy's girl, it--you can kind of feel that so the two of us just bonded together because, you know, she just said she would take care of me now.  And so I guess that what's she feels she's done.  So we literally moved through this whole career and working and all those things together.  I worked really hard to kind of stage my assignments that I would take so I would have little travel or few layovers, when she was in younger years.  By the time she got to the eighth grade, I think I took my first assignment where I needed to travel and be away overnight, but I really wanted to support a family who was kind enough to pick up, you know, the pieces for me.  We're very close.  We've spend an awful lot of time together.  She is probably my chief principal adviser she calls it because--well you know, she, she is a very talented young woman and not shy like I was as a child (laughter) at all, and I think as being an only child and growing up around adults and being involved in a lot of things and that sort of stuff and mine just telling her as it is kind of thing.  There's some pretty good advice I get from her from time to time.  And that's really the core of my existence.  I don't believe I would've worked this hard if it had just been me.  I wouldn't have had that motivation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there anything we haven't asked you about that you think we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Oh, gee.  I think we've covered a lot.  We've talked about a lot of things.  Things that I like to do personally, what makes Barbara [HistoryMaker Barbara Ann Lumpkin], Barbara.  We talked about music.  Certainly love music of kinds and don't really quite relate to rap, I don't quite understand it so much.  But cooking is a hobby.  I love to cook.  Thanksgiving obviously is my favorite thing to do.  Love all of that--it's all fun.  Really enjoy reading because it takes you anywhere you want to be.  It just kind of takes you--
Speaker 1: What are your favorite kinds of books?
Speaker 2: I have enjoyed reading African American female authors.  And just because unlike most people, the reading a story for the story, I'm reading the story--the book for the story, true, but I'm also looking at range and tone and this and that, only because someday I'll say, oh you know, I'm going to write a book one day.  You know, maybe not.  But, you know, I get into that and I try to imagine that writers, you know, life at that time and on, and on, and on subject to vivid imagination so just really kind of keeping it.  Love [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou, she is just really, really, solid and just so insightful.  So you learn a lot from that and you just kind of and now she also gives you this inner peace because she is always forever reminding you not to forget yourself.
Speaker 1: Okay, anything else, or?
Speaker 2: I think that's about it.
Story_ID: 348406
Speaker 1: Okay, well the last question is similar to legacy, a little bit different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I really would hope that people would think of me as a thoughtful and caring individual without agenda.  I must say this ten times a week, and someone manages to give us a compliment or something, they are always saying, oh, you know, great job procurement officer, commissioner great job, great job.  It's not about me you know it's the whole core of the point of what we are doing that is so important.  I would that people would think that they could rely on what I was saying or doing, and we did the best that I could, and you know this is just who I am.
Speaker 1: Okay, well thank you very much for spending the time with us.
Speaker 2: Thank you, it's my pleasure, my pleasure.
