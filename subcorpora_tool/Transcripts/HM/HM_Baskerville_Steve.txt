Speaker 1: We're going to get started.  My name is Tom Jefferson, and I'm the interviewer.  The videographer is Matthew Hickey, and the observer is Julieanna Richardson.  Please state your name and spell it?
Speaker 2: I'll give you my full name.  A lot of people don't know me as Herman, but my name is Herman Stephen Royal Baskerville.
Speaker 1: Okay, could you spell those for us?
Speaker 2: Herman, H-E-R-M-A-N, Stephen is S-T-E-P-H-E-N, Royal, R-O-Y-A-L, and Baskerville.
Speaker 1: Your date of birth and location of birth?
Speaker 2: May 12, 1950 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: And today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date.  You've asked me the hardest question of all.  I think it's August 24th, 2013.
Speaker 1: And the location of this interview?
Speaker 2: We are at 1900 Michigan, South Michigan, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: At HistoryMakers.
Speaker 1: I've gotta ask you this question.  It's a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: What's today's weather forecast?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, it's at least partly sunny, partly cloudy and partly accurate.  That's an old weather joke.  This is beautiful.  My--I have had an easy week.  My goodness.  The streak continues, 85 and sunny, with a light Southeast wind.
Speaker 1: And your occupation?
Speaker 2: Well, meteorologist, but actually, it's a little broader than that, broadcaster because some of the work I do is beyond weather in the studio.  I'll go out and I'll interview people.  I'll go out and do live shots at festivals.  I've hosted programs.  As you'll discover, there's a variety performance that I do from time to time.
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll get into that in a little bit more detail a little bit later on.
Story_ID: 95870
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you what we call some "People Magazine"-type questions.  They're very simple, just to, you know--what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food would be a loaded pizza.  It would be, you know, sausage or ground beef and pepperoni with onions, cheese, of course, and it would be heavy, heavy in my hands.  That would be the right pizza.
Speaker 1: Deep dish?
Speaker 2: Deep--no, you know, I like thin crust.  I grew up with thin crust pizza in Philadelphia.  That was--I don't even think we had any deep dish there, my experience.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of year is winter.  A lot of people chose summer or hot weather.  I can appreciate it, but for me, I like the quietness of winter.  I like a snowy day when you can hear everything for miles it seems because it's cold, and you don't see a lot of people scurrying around, and snow quiets things.  It's peaceful to me.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, but I didn't know I had that color as my favorite.  And I was thinking about (laughter) work, and work-related issues.  And this is a round-about way of getting to my favorite color, but we have these evaluations at work where your super--many people have that in jobs where the supervisor will talk about the year and how it all went and bring up any observations.  And so on one of mine, a couple of years ago, it said, "wears too much brown".  And I went, I said, what in the world is this?  And I went, of all the--what?  And I went storming into his room, and I said, you know, I get all the other stuff, but what's with this brown?  And he laughed and said, look at you.  And I had on a brown suit, brown shoes (laughter), had a lot of brown in my tie.  I didn't even realize it.  And then I asked somebody, one of the reporters there, do I wear a lot of brown?  And she said, "Well, you do".  And I never noticed that.  So I'm trying to cut back on my brown.  I guess I like brown, and I like, I like autumnal colors, in that family.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, no, I kind of like to explore places.  I mean I--there's a lot, I get an interest out of discovery.  For someone that likes winter, I usually gravitate somewhere warm though, like central Florida.  I've gone to Arizona, sort of like Arizona, discovered Vancouver, thought that was an interesting place to--so I like the opportunity to explore.  And I'm not a camper or that kind of explorer.  I like plenty of air conditioning and a brand new LED TV in the room, and I don't want the original bathtub.  I want it all just put in there last month.  That's comfort to me.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: There are sayings that have become favorites that I didn't--most of these things come from my mother [Mary Baskerville], and the most, the phrase I remember the most stuck with me since I was a kid was, "It's better to have and not need than to need and not have."  And it took me a while to understand what that was about.  But, for instance, my mother would, you know, pack a heavier coat than I needed for school or give me an umbrella on a, the kind of day we have today is really sunny, but give it to me every day.  And her line would be, "Well, it's better to have and not need than to need and not have", and you'll never know when you may need something.  And I think that applies to a lot of aspects of life.  You know, there were subjects that I didn't necessarily thrive in, in school, but down the road, needed it.  I wasn't a science whiz.  I never saw myself as a scientist or science teacher, but I was encouraged to do well in a subject like that, just in case.  And here it is every day I have a career and a job where science is important.  I didn't know it then that I needed it, but it turned out that I very much had to use it.  So it was good to have that tucked away just in case.  So it sort of applies to that.

Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit more about your mother.  What was her name?
Speaker 2: Mary Elizabeth Baskerville or--
Speaker 1: And do you know where she was born?
Speaker 2: In North Carolina, in Lincolnton, North Carolina, which is about 30 miles or so away from Charlotte [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: And where did she grow up?
Speaker 2: She grew up in that area, grew up in North Carolina, went to college there in North Carolina, was a teacher for a while.  And after that had, worked for a long time at Sears Roebuck when she came East, Northeast up to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And my memory of my mother was working at Sears and working at a store called John Wanamaker, big department store.  But she is, was quite an ambitious and, I mean she was a serious worker.  That's what I got from my mother.
Speaker 1: Let me back up just a second.  What was her date of birth?
Speaker 2: It was April 23rd, and I'm sorry for not giving you the exact date, but I think it was 1917.
Speaker 1: And do you know what her education was?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm not certain whether she finished college, but I know she went to college in North Carolina, and I don't have the school at the top of my head, but there're a variety of black schools in North Carolina, you know, like Shaw [University, Raleigh, North Carolina] and Johnson C. Smith [University, Charlotte, North Carolina] and North Carolina College.  So one of those schools, she attended early on.
Speaker 1: Did she tell you about any of her experiences growing up in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: She did.  It was, and I would get glimpses of life in North Carolina 'cause I went to see my grandmother every summer.  But my mother, you know, her life in the South, in the '30s [1930s], '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s] was quite different from anything that I experienced growing up in Philadelphia in the '60s [1960s], '50s [1950s] and ['60s] [1960s] and '70s [1970], not a whole lot different, but different.  And, you know, segregation was very much evident everywhere.  And she would tell me about episodes that she would have as a young girl and a teenager just dealing with being a part of the black community and being careful where you went because things weren't as loose or as free as they were where we were in terms of being able to do what you want.  I remember when I'd go down, for instance, to--and I can still, this is very vivid in my memory, I'd go to the theater in Lincolnton to see a movie on a Saturday night.  You'd go to the back of the theater where there was a black cashier and black stand for popcorn and drinks, and then you'd go up to the balcony which always struck me as, you know, just being a kid during those times, never understood it, but understood that that's what--there were things that happened.  Once you got South of Washington, D.C., it was a whole different protocol and way that life operated in the South.
Story_ID: 95872
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned that she experienced certain episodes.  Did she tell you about any specific episode that, then?
Speaker 2: Well, she would, you know, she would tell me, one of the, one of the sad parts of bigotry and hatred is that, you know, it's an adult thing really.  And it gets passed on.  And she, when she was younger would, wasn't a nanny, but she would sort of babysit and care for some of the younger kids in a white family as a part-time job or so.  And she remembered sitting on the porch with the, one of the youngest kids on her lap.  And some black folks were walking down the road, and the little girl told her, "Turn your head, Mary, here comes some N-words".  Here's a child, that, you know, where'd she get that?  She knew my mother was someone that she loved, but yet--and didn't see her the same way, but was taught to have that kind of attitude about folks that you didn't know.  And, you know, I've had that happen to me growing up.  You know, I used to love to play baseball.  Now, this is in the '60's [1960s], and a guy on my block named Larry West, we were sort of some of the better athletes on the, in the neighborhood.  And we were short stop and second base.  And we didn't have an organized team.  But we knew some guys who went to our school were on a team, but in the Italian neighborhood or the white section, it wasn't that far walking distance.  And we were all excited about perhaps joining that team.  So Larry and I go off, six or seven blocks away, sent off as champions to go see if you guys can make this team.  And we see the fellows that we know, schoolmates of ours who are glad to see us.  And we're there on the field practicing with them.  They were in their uniforms.  And we're all having a good time.  The adults pull up, coaches pull up, have a fit 'cause they see us practicing on that field.  Tell us to get away.
Speaker 1: Let me bring you back to that a little bit later.
Story_ID: 95873
Speaker 1: In terms of your mother [Mary Baskerville], you said she was a teacher?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What did she teach and what grades?
Speaker 2: Well, she--elementary school, I believe.  And she did that very briefly.  She, for some reason did not teach, and I don't think it was just easy to pursue it or to get a job necessarily when she moved.  She moved to Atlantic City [New Jersey] as a young woman, and that's where she met my father.  And that was in the '30s [1930s].  And my sister was born in 1938.  So my sister's in her 70s.  So my mother and father married in New Jersey in Atlantic City.  And, but my mother didn't teach during any of the years that I was growing up.
Speaker 1: What brought her to Atlantic City?
Speaker 2: I think just opportunity more than anything, and to get away.  And I think--Lincolnton [North Carolina] was a very, very small town.  And I think others in the family, most others, were leaving because one of her sisters settled in Washington, D.C., one in New York City [New York], another sister in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and another brother.  So everybody sort of moved Northeastward.
Speaker 1: How many siblings did she have?
Speaker 2: She had seven.
Speaker 1: And can you name them all?
Speaker 2: Yes, (laughter).  No-- (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION);
Speaker 1: All right.  And don't ask me about my father's siblings 'cause he was the baby of 12 (laughter).
Speaker 2: What age was your mother when she moved to Atlantic City?
Speaker 1: I would think she was probably late 20s or so.  But I'm really guessing now because I don't know a lot of that part of her, her story.
Story_ID: 95874
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father?  What was his name?
Speaker 2: Herman, Herman Roy, Royal, and I don't know a whole lot about him because he passed away when I was 11.  But every memory that I have of him makes me smile because I remember enjoying being around him and always wished I could have had more time with him, and always liked it when other relatives would say, "you smile just like your father".  And I think that may have been one of the reasons why I like to smile so much.  My, his mother--now, just briefly, we'll get off, but my grandma, Jenny, was about, ooh, 88 or so when I was 10.  But she would sometimes confuse me with him, and say Herman, and I always loved it when she did that.  But my father was a, I guess we would call a laborer construction work.  But he was really an artist too.  He was the only person that I knew way back then who could take old silverware and make jewelry out 'em, for fun, rings and twist them and turn 'em into bracelets and things.  And he could, I remember he could draw.  I don't have that skill.  My sister has that skill, being artistic in that sense.  But he was, I saw art in him.  I remember he sang, for the joy of it.  I mean he'd like to sing.  He was very outgoing, and I imagine I'm more like him.  I've had other older relatives who'd say you're more, you're just like your daddy.  So I think that part of him is in me, especially to do what I've, the path, the career path and the, sort of the things that I've liked to do in life, I could imagine he would have liked to have done.
Speaker 1: Now, where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Virginia, and, in the Richmond area, baby of 12.  His, that part, although I recently, and I haven't really had a chance to look at it carefully, but I've recently discovered more about that part of my family in written form which is a tremendous sort of a family tree.  But being the baby of 12, when he was growing up, there were some older brothers that he knew their name, but he didn't know them well 'cause once they were 16 or 17, they were gone, just to make room.  So, you know, the kids were leaving earlier then 'cause he left--the reason why he went to New Jersey was to go live with his older brother, my Uncle Bill.  And my Uncle Bill had a barbershop in Atlantic City [New Jersey], and he volunteered to take care of his baby brother, Herman.  And so Herman left Virginia, once again, with the hope of, you know, doing something better or creating a life that was different from Virginia and settled there.
Speaker 1: Let me back up just a second.  When was your father born?
Speaker 2: Around the same, 1917 or 1918.
Speaker 1: And you said, what year--when did he go to Atlantic City [New Jersey]?  How old was he then?
Speaker 2: I would think he was in his, around that same time--well, he was probably a young, a teenager when he got there, didn't meet my mother [Mary Baskerville] until later.  But part of the story with their meeting was that he was a lifeguard.  And they sort of met on the beach.  I don't know if he--he came up with some daring rescue move (laughter) and met my mother that way.  But they had, they met in Atlantic City.
Story_ID: 95875
Speaker 1: What do you know about your grandparents on your mother's [Mary Baskerville] side?
Speaker 2: My grandmother, her mother, my, Lula, my grandma, Lula, Lula was her name, Lula Carson.  That was my mother's maiden name.  My memories of her, and once again, she died when I was about 10 or 11 years old.  My memories of her are sitting on the porch with her, she in her chair, and me on a swing and just quietly spending time together.  And I remember how gentle and peaceful, it was almost like that that Bill Withers song, "Grandma's Hands", where he sings about the relationship with his grandmother being sort of quiet, and she wouldn't let anything happen to me and babied me.  And I sort of liked that.  I was grandma's baby, but I remember that she was very strong.  See, you know, I've been pretty fortunate that, you know, even--both my grandfathers passed away before I was born.  My father [Herman Baskerville] passed away, you know, when I was 11.  So I was surrounded by uncles who cared a lot and were there, around as role models.  But I think it was the women in my life that were the real heroes.  And my, and very strong, you know, my grandmother had been married twice, and both of her--and was widowed.  But she was a strong woman, raising, you know, eight children, and keeping the house together.  And, you know, I always felt that about her.  And my mother, I could imagine what it was like for her keeping things together after, you know, raising a young boy in West Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] after your husband passes away.  And she was, she gave me the worth ethic that I have.  I talk about my father being artistic.  My mother gave me a strength that was her example.  You know, she went to work every day and didn't--she always would say--you talk about phrases that are favorite phrases, "Mustn't lose our job".  She said that to me until the week she passed away.  She died when she was 96, two years ago, "Mustn't lose our job".  Her attitude of keeping the house together and keeping the home together and what's important is making sure the family is taken care of.  So, she was very, very strong.  And I always admired that the most about her, steadfast, keep going to school and do the right thing and didn't have to preach it because she sort of lived it.  You know, she was, I remember her working way out on Roosevelt Boulevard which a long distance from where I grew up in my neighborhood.  And there was a big snowstorm, and I was worried about her getting home.  I would come home, one of the latchkey kids.  I would let myself in at the end of the afternoon.  I knew my mother would be home maybe another hour after that.  So I wasn't home alone that long, but I would get home before she would get home from work.  But this particular snow-stormy day was, it was 5:00, 6:00, 7:00 o'clock, dark.  Mom still hadn't shown up.  She would call and give me updates.  She would take three different pieces of transportation, a bus from our house to the subway, and then another bus to get to work, and to get back every day.  And she was determined to get home.  And she kept telling me, I'm, I will be there, just hold on.  And she would, and then she walked the last leg of her trip.  Instead of being able to take the bus, she walked that distance.  But that was her determination, and my mother loved being home.  That was part of, you know, as I reflect on all of this, my mother thought there was nothing more important than home, being safe at home.  And she'd make sure that we felt comfortable at home.  I had her sister, one of her sisters for a short while lived with us, two of her brothers for a short while lived in our house.  Our house was home to a lot of people, and it was because of her and her, the environment she created.
Speaker 1: I wanna take you back for a minute to your grandmother.  Did you know anything about her parents?
Speaker 2: You know, I didn't.  I knew very little about her, I mean her family.  I knew that she had other brothers and sisters that I would see occasionally, like I'd go to the house in North Carolina, and I'd see Uncle Bob show up, which was one of her brothers.  And he'd come in with a pipe and a cane, older man as well.  See, all of these folks were, by the time I was nine, 10, 11 years old, they were up in age, in their 80s or so.  So I didn't know very much about them.
Story_ID: 95876
Speaker 1: What did you know about your grandparents on your father's [Herman Baskerville] side?
Speaker 2: Well, the only, I knew my grandfather was John Baskerville, and would just--I knew him by photos only, knew him as a stern-faced man with a pipe in his hand.  For some reason, pipes were very popular.  My grandma, Jenny, his mother was the one I knew more.  She, and this was in Baltimore.  They had moved to Baltimore [Maryland] and lived.  My grandma's house on my father's side was right in the city in Baltimore, Maryland.  And it sounds funny, but my Grandma Jenny loved "Tarzan", the TV showed, loved it.  And I remember sitting in her room with her watching "Tarzan", and I don't know what it was about it, but that was--our time was spent together sort of sharing her, her room and her TV show.
Speaker 1: Was she able to tell you any stories or memories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: No, she was pretty guarded.  I could only imagine some of the things that she had experienced as well because they were both Southern--when I say both, both my grandmothers, Southern women, and being in their upper 80s in 1960, you know, they had seen a lot.
Story_ID: 95877
Speaker 1: I don't know if I asked you.  What was your grandmother's name on your mother's side and your grandmother's name on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Lula Carson was my mother's mother.  And Jenny Baskerville, J-E-N-N-Y, was my father's mother.
Speaker 1: I wanna talk a little bit about your childhood and your growing up.  What are some of your earliest childhood memories?
Speaker 2: I can remember, the very earliest--you really wanna know the earliest thing I can remember--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --the earliest?  I can remember busting my bottle on the wall, swinging it by the (laughter), the sipping part.  I'm talking about, that's how I stopped drinking a bottle.  And I can still hear that (swishing noise).  That's it, and I think (laughter), my father [Herman Baskerville] or somebody yelled "That's it", like that's it, not getting anymore.  And that was, it wasn't traumatic, but it was a moment.  And the other thing that I don't remember, but they, the story that my mother [Mary Baskerville] used to love telling was me running up and down the hall in that same house, singing, "I like Ike", "I like Ike".  [President Dwight] Eisenhower had ads on TV that were cartoons.  And it was, "We like Ike" or some reference to "Ike" and nicknaming him "Ike", and I latched onto that.  I guess it worked.  I couldn't vote, but I guess it worked.  I was singing "I like Ike" up and down the hall.  Those were my earliest memories, but--
Speaker 1: Did you know who he was?
Speaker 2: No, no (laughter) no idea.
Story_ID: 95878
Speaker 1: Although I did have an interesting presidential encounter--skipping ahead.  I was in the All-City Boys Choir in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], which was a big deal.  We didn't wanna do it.  You sort of got drafted into it.  When they discovered you could sing at school, they would pull you into--a great experience for us, but it was being a seventh grader or I might--a seventh grader, you didn't wanna do that on a weekend.  But anyway, we would, we sang on Independence Day, one hot day in Independence Hall.  And the Marine Guard bring this old gentleman up to us, and he's got two canes.  And he bows.  And we don't know who this man is, and we bow back as part of the gesture of the choir.  And it was [President] Herbert Hoover.  I just think that's astonishing when you think about how eras in life, the lifetime, that kind of, sort of overlap, Herbert Hoover from the Depression in the '20s [1920s] sort of overlapped my life.  But that was my, that was a moment that I'll never forget.
Story_ID: 95879
Speaker 1: But growing up in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], I was thinking about that as well, as I was thinking about it today.  I didn't realize how much talent I was surrounded by.  And I'm talking about people that were my age.  I mean, that were classmates of mine.  Subconsciously, I think I got the message that a lot is possible, don't have to be rich or grow up in Hollywood or be privileged to have good things happen.  I didn't verbalize it that way then, but, for instance, we used to go to house parties and the guys that could sing and entertain, by the time they were in high school, they were professionals.  And they were the Delfonics.  I would see them every day in school, and had gone to the high school where Wilt Chamberlain had attended.  He was already a star, but he was visible.
Speaker 2: Overbrook?
Speaker 1: Overbrook High School.  Bill Cosby was from West Philadelphia.  He was a name.  We knew he came from where we lived in that sense.  As kids, we understood that.  There was a classmate of mine named Kenny, Kenny Bluford, his older brother loved flying.  He became the first African American astronaut, Guion Bluford [HM].  These people were around me.  And there was a boy named Bobby Hayes.  Bobby Hayes was a phenom as a drummer and a percussionist.  And Jazz musicians, when they'd come into town, would get little Bobby, get his parents to bring him to the club to play with them.  I don't know if you have recalled a man named Mongo Santamaria.   Mongo Santamaria, well known, jazz artist, would come to our school and play with Bobby.  There was talent everywhere.  There were examples that weren't adult mentors, but I think it was around you that things, if you applied yourself, things can happen.  We also had negatives, you know, we had gangs, and we had people that didn't choose the right path.  But there were choices all around us that were visible. It was one, another guy in my class liked languages and went on to study Chinese and eventually interpret Chinese in the Air Force.  But these were, you know, these, this was West Philadelphia, row homes, nothing in our minds is extra special about, certainly about where we were, weren't, didn't have, we didn't come from money at all.  But we came from a pool of kids and adults who were expressing themselves in all sorts of ways, and I think in my mind, in the back of my mind, I always thought, I always thought that I would be a success.  I didn't have anything to base that on.  I mean I remember when I got out of college and was, I--my very first job was sorting checks at the VA [Veterans Administration], and I can't--let me back up.  It wasn't my first job.  It was my first job after I had a family.  I had, my son was born, but it was my first job--but anyway, I'm sorting checks at the VA.  I knew in my head I was gonna be in television.  I knew that I would do what I wanted to do, and they would laugh and joke with me, the coworkers around the table.  I would say, this time next year, I'm gonna have a TV show.  And everybody would sort of laugh at that.  I saw in my head that that's what I wanted to do.  And I didn't see any reason why I couldn't.  I don't know where that came from, but I think, as I look back at it, there were a lot of examples of talent around me, and along the way people encouraging me, like my mother [Mary Baskerville] and certain teachers and other examples of people pushing you as well, saying, "Go ahead, go for it".
Story_ID: 95880
Speaker 1: What was your family life like?
Speaker 2: It was, my sister since she was so much older than I was growing up--I'm not gonna dare say old, older, was out and gone pretty much.  She was, you know, almost like an adult to me being older.  And my mother [Mary Baskerville] and I were pretty much the unit for a long period of my life.  And occasionally--but see, and when I say that, it wasn't just the two of us.  There was always stuff going on.  There would be my Aunt Cletta (ph.) living with us for a while, and my Aunt Cletta was a model, and my Aunt Cletta also worked for the newspaper.  It was called the "Philadelphia Independent", black-owned newspaper in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] at the time.  And so she had an exciting life, and my Uncle Charlie would come and live.  And Uncle Charlie was a traveler.  You know, he lived here.  He was, lived in Chicago [Illinois] for a number of years, where he settled first out of the [U.S.] Army.  But he lived with us for a while.  My Uncle George came and lived, my mother's brother, George, older brother came.  So there were people that were around and in and out of the house a lot that made it always seem kind of alive and active and greater than just my mother and myself.  My best friend--here's a, to me, an interesting story.  My mother shared a room, hospital room with a nice woman named Dorothy whose son was born three days before me.  And as roommates in the hospital, got to know each other to a degree and wished each other the best as they parted.  Five years later, they are next-door neighbors.  My mother moves into the house next door to Dorothy whose son was born three days before me.  That boy is still one of my best friends.  I talk to him all the time.  His name is Shawn, and, but that's--isn't that interesting how life can give you all of these variances and ways of going down different roads.  But then something like that happens.  These two people meet and then they're neighbors and for me, my closest friends are still people that I've known for years, still people that I connected with in elementary school and in grade school for some reason.  We never--when I think about where I grew up, I think about it every day.  And I think, and I'm so--I still feel very connected to it.  My, the house--my mother passed away just two years ago, lived in the house I grew up in all those years.  So going home for me was always going home for, you know, close to 60 years or so, going home was going back to that same block and going back to that house.

Speaker 1: This was West Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  What street did you live on?
Speaker 2: On 62nd Street, 62nd and Master.
Speaker 1: What was the neighborhood like at that time?
Speaker 2: It was, it was great.  It was very, it was a, eventually an all-black, eventually.  But my memories when I was a kid, when I was, even up through my teenage years, it was a very mixed block.  The DeAngelis family lived two doors up, the Weinsteins were on the corner, a family, Jewish family that owned the grocery store.  There would be--and all of these families had kids.  And we would play half ball.  We called it half ball.  You get a broom.  You cut off the handle, the tip of it, and you make a bat out of it, and cut a tennis ball in half, and you played baseball.  You hit a, you hit one of these half balls into somebody's hedges, that was a single.  You hit it in the yard, a double.  You hit it on their porch, a triple.  You didn't want it--it was great to hit a home run, but that meant losing it 'cause you'd hit it on the roof.  We played that almost every day.  And I was, you know, you were exposed to all sorts of things you didn't necessarily know.  Like the Weinstein family I mentioned, Jackie would sometimes have to go off to Hebrew school.  We never understood that.  Man, why you leaving the game in the middle of the afternoon (laughter).  I gotta go to school.  What kind of school?  You know, we're disappointed, but we were all sort of, you know, it was a block where every--I mentioned that my father [Herman Baskerville] had passed away.  I had a lot of parents on that block.  I couldn't down the street and act up or do something silly because somebody would call my mother [Mary Baskerville] and have the authority to tell me to go home or to stop doing that.  So we were always very much looked after, I felt.  There were, it was an atmosphere of parents really caring about what you did and letting you know, and putting you in your place.  And you respecting what they said.  It wasn't just some woman up the street who was scolding you, but that was somebody who really knew your mother and could really call her or come down to your house.
Story_ID: 95882
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned that, you know, you had relatives, aunts and uncles, that came to your house a lot.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: What were holidays like in your house?
Speaker 2: Well, Christmas, of course, was the, that was a winner.  That was the one where everybody would--and Thanksgiving.  It was full, it was full of family.  It would be all of these people who at various times would come and maybe live there for a short while, but they'd all show up for that kind of reunion.   So holidays--and, of course, I'd always reap the biggest benefits 'cause I was sort of, I was the baby, and so if anybody got a gift, it would be me.  But I just remember holidays as being a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 95883
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any siblings, you mentioned a sister?
Speaker 2: Yes, my sister, my sister is--and she followed that path of being a teacher.  My sister would go back to North Carolina as a teenager and as a young woman.  She went to North Carolina Central, which was North Carolina College then in Durham and made a career out of teaching.  My mother's, my mother's older sister, my Aunt Carrie, who just passed away the year after my mother, and she lived to be 101.  And she was a career teacher.  I don't wanna say the most successful of the kids, but certainly everybody looked up to Aunt Carrie because she had, she was the strictest, the one that would keep everybody in line, the eldest, and very much a teacher.  And she taught first grade for, oh, my God, what felt like 50 years.  I mean at her funeral, there were people in their 70's coming up saying that they had my Aunt Carrie as a first-grade teacher.  I always, I thought that that was quite the tribute that they would turn out like that.
Speaker 1: What was your sister's name, and when was she born?
Speaker 2: Sylvia is her name, Sylvia Barbara.  And she was born in Atlantic City in November of '38 [1938].  So it's a big age gap between you--
Speaker 1: Big age gap, yes.  And she thought she was my second mother for a long time (laughter), and then our relationship changed and we were more, I wasn't the nuisance little brother.  We grew closer as we both ages.  We, we--and she would know more about the family than I did, and I would--I'm still learning things from her that I never knew about people and where they came from and what life was like from her point of view.
Speaker 2: And she tells you some of the stories that she has acquired over time?
Speaker 1: Yes or just--
Speaker 2: Maybe--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --insight into what people were like that were different from my childhood memory then.  She had more of an adult version of it.  And I, I don't know a particular, other than, I mean she certainly experienced more of all of these things that I talked about.  You know, her, her version of life in the South was more of an adult version of life in North Carolina in the '60s [1960s] than what I knew or was aware of.  So she sort of experienced more of that.
Story_ID: 95884
Speaker 1: Tell me some of the sights and sounds and smells around your house during, in your neighborhood during those times when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, it was loud because it was full of kids.  I lived in the second house from the corner.  Mrs. Robinson was next door.  Mrs. Robinson was a beautician.  And on her enclosed porch, she would do hair.  And her grandson, Georgie, was a couple of years older than me.  So Georgie was there.  Shawn, the baby that was born three days before me lived right next door.  And across the street was Andre, and there, you know, I could go every other house there were kids, and they were all about the same age.  And so life outside was frantic.  You know, we'd play these baseball games I mentioned with the stick ball.  You'd have, you know, seven and eight pairs of kids waiting to play next 'cause there were that many kids around.  I never had to leave the block really to be entertained.  So my world was small in that sense 'cause everybody I needed, and everything we needed was right in that long stretch of the 1400 block of 62nd Street, waiting for the water ice man to come.  And he'd come with his truck, and, you know, that was exciting.  Not Mr. Softee, the "Water ice" man.  I would awaken every day to these noises.  There would be a family that was in the other side of the alley where this woman would yell for Angelina every morning, something her little girl would do, Angelina [stretched out call].  And I'd hear that screaming Angelina.  The man would come down, there was a blind man that would come down with brooms, yelling brooms, brooms.  And woo, that was the second, you know, those were our roosters in the morning, you know, the brooms, Angelina, all of this was going on, time to wake up.  So it was very, very alive like that.
Speaker 1: Do you--
Speaker 2: That's why maybe I like winter so much, you think?  Maybe that's why I like the quiet, stillness of the snow 'cause that would be the only time it would settle down.  It would be completely calm, would be in the winter.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any particular smells?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember the, you know, maybe mustard pretzels, I don't know if that smells.  I'll tell you something that I used to do.  Remember I mentioned a man that lived, that had the grocery store on the corner.  I was very much a TV kid too.  I think that probably had something to do with what I do for a living.  But I used to watch the "Soupy Sales Show".  And Soupy Sales at the start of the program would say, "Okay, and today for lunch, I'm gonna have baloney and cheese on some wheat bread."  And then the show would go on.  So during the course of that half hour, I'd run over to the store and they knew that was part of my routine on the weekend.  And they'd cut me a slice of whatever that was that Soupy was having, if we didn't have it in the house.  And (laughter) I'd get a, you know, you'd tell Mr. Weinstein, "Hey, I need a couple--Soupy's having some baloney."  Oh, is he?  Boom, boom, they'd cut me off a couple of slices of baloney and I'd run back home and make my sandwich so I could have lunch with Soupy, which was a thrill for me on weekends, but that was part of the routine.  But I just remember it being, I won't say chaotic, but it was noisy.  It was full of kids and it was all we needed.  I remember that being a part of it.  I never felt the need to go downtown or to take a trip somewhere necessarily.  I had all the adventure I wanted on that block because of how lively it was.
Story_ID: 95885
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned going back down South from time to time.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: That was, how did you get there?
Speaker 2: That's a great question.  How did I physically get there?  Wow, that's a great question 'cause that's part of my memory too.  We'd take the Trailways Bus and would, and the most important part of that trip was how many sandwiches were gonna be enough to pack.  And we'd pack sandwiches for this journey to go from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] to Charlotte [North Carolina]  and then from Charlotte to Lincolnton [North Carolina] by another bus.  But it was, it was always mainly by bus 'cause my mother [Mary Baskerville] didn't--we didn't have a family car.  My mother didn't drive.  So we were very much public transportation folks, and I didn't have my first car until I was--access, I didn't have access to a car till I was an adult really.
Speaker 1: Did your family go other places besides back down South?
Speaker 2: No, we, you know, we never really vacationed far other than going to the shore, New Jersey, going South to visit relatives.  All our trips were to visit other relatives.  So it wasn't necessarily trips just for the sake of exploring somewhere else new.  We were--and it seems to be, I don't know whether it's a Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] thing.  I don't know whether it's an Eastern thing or a neighborhood thing, but a lot of people that I know, even to this day did not go far, the people that I grew up with.  I can still go home and find a core of people that are there, not necessarily in the same house, but haven't explored or chosen to explore that much because they've still--that sense of, everything I need is around here, kind of learned that.  I don't know where we got that, but they had to pull me kicking and screaming to go take a job in New York, when I left Philadelphia.  I was reluctant to do that.  Travel really, one thing about travel I have learned is that it really opens your mind and it really makes you see things clearer sometimes.  You know, the farther you go, then you can come back to where you were.  You can still appreciate it, but, you know, there are lessons to be learned in exploring.  I think that's why even now if I have enough free time, I'd rather go somewhere new than somewhere that I'm familiar 'cause I didn't do a lot of that growing up.
Story_ID: 95886
Speaker 1: Where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: To two elementary schools, went to John Barry Elementary until I was about fifth grade, and then went for a year to Cassidy Elementary.  Barry Elementary was in an all-black neighborhood.  Cassidy was in a mixed neighborhood.  In fact, it was a white area where the school physically was, and half of the population or close to it was black.  So it was mixed.  And that was my first experience in an atmosphere like that.  And that was when I was in sixth grade.  And it was also the area where, we had friends where I wanted to play on that baseball team, where these kids lived in that neighborhood, white kids who attended that school were friends.  And we played together as schoolmates.  And then from those years on schools were mixed more.  It was just, because they were in different neighborhoods.  Overbrook High School, for instance, was a very multi-sort of cultural area at the time.
Speaker 1: What happened to make you change schools?
Speaker 2: There was some coding of some kind where we, where I lived they just said, your districted to go to this school now.  So that was now sort of opened to our several blocks where I lived.  And so a lot of us started going to that school.
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: Yes, Mr. Gaines.  When my father passed away--I don't know if it's still so much true now, but there aren't a whole lot of men or males in elementary school as teachers.  And for me, it wasn't, you know, growing up and going to elementary school, all the teachers were women.  And here's Mr. Gaines, and I think I had Mr. Gaines the year, right after my father passed away, big man, who looked like somebody from my block, but there were no teachers on my--in my neighborhood.  But Mr. Gaines was this, was this man who was, he didn't look like what we thought a teacher would look like (laughter), you know.  He just had a roughness about him, but he was, he was cool.  And Mr. Gaines was entertaining, and I probably needed a male in my life at that point.  I don't recall him taking any special interests in me aside from everybody else, but I needed him then and was just--I remember being happy to be in Mr. Gaines' class.  Mr. Gaines had a--his wife also taught at the school.  But you were fortunate if you could get Mr. Gaines to teach you because there were so many women all around in the school.  And then there was Mrs. Moore.  Mrs. Moore--this is in junior high school now.  Mr. Gaines is in elementary school.  Mrs. Moore was embarrassing.  I know she loved me, but she would embarrass me.  She would always want me to enter the "smile contest".
Speaker 1: What was that?
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness.  It was the citywide, competition where "Who's got the best smile?"  And, you know, you can't be in the classroom and the teacher gushing over your smile and still be cool with the guys.  You know, I look around, and it's like, you know, there're guys who wanna fix that smile now.  Okay.  I got your smile.  And Mrs. Gaines, we used to have buy pictures, you know, for the end-of-the-year pictures, you could buy a little photo.  You could buy a 5 x 10 or something bigger if you chose, if your family chose to spend that money.  And Mrs. Moore came in at the end of the year with a photo of me like that, and she said, "Look at that cherubic smile."  And no--none of us knew what that meant.  I knew I was embarrassed.  I knew everybody else hated it (laughter).  But I have always been sort of a smiler, you know, not, like my sister isn't a smiler.  My father [Herman Baskerville] was the smiler.  My mother [Mary Baskerville] wasn't.  She had a beautiful smile, but wasn't a smiler.  I just sort of, it just came natural to me.  I never really was, wanted to put it on for any kind of front.  But it would get me in trouble in that sense.  I was embarrassed by it when it was, showcased that way.  And I just remember Mrs. Moore.  She was a very nice, memorable teacher as well.
Story_ID: 95887
Speaker 1: We wanna talk a little bit more about the smile contest.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: How did you do in the citywide competition?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I know, I don't think I--I may have, I certainly didn't place among the best smiles in the city.  But I think I may have done the best in the school or something like that.  And it was a, I don't know how long it lasted as a citywide competition for oral health and taking care of your teeth.  But I certainly, they certainly promoted me like I was the best, I had the best smile in the school, which was a big enough accomplishment right there.  So I remember Mrs. Moore because of that.
Story_ID: 95888
Speaker 1: And then I remember in high school, you know, high school was like a college athlete, leaving college and going to the pros.  Leaving middle school, leaving middle school and junior high school going to high school was a leap into a whole different thing.  It was a different feel that you were entering.
Speaker 2: Tell me the name of your junior high school?
Speaker 1: It was Shoemaker, Shoemaker Junior High.
Speaker 2: And where was it located?
Speaker 1: And it was at 53rd and Master [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  So I would have walked from 62nd and Master to 53rd and Master.  The walk to school for folks where I lived was sometimes dangerous because once you below 57th Street, that was a gang's territory that was different from the gang where you lived.  Now, we weren't gang--I wasn't a gang member, but, you know, gangs claim territory.  So just by living where you lived, you were associated with that gang, in the minds of gang members somewhere else.  So you were, there was some fear in that walk between my house and the, where the school was located for most people.  I didn't have that fear.  You know why?  I can walk down through there--and this is where I learned the importance of connections.  I can walk all around there because I was Mr. Baskerville's nephew.  Mr. Baskerville was a barber, and Mr. Baskerville cut everybody's hair down there.  So if you don't want your hair messed up, you know, you leave Mr. Baskerville's nephew alone.  So that was like protection that I had.  So, that was like having the police as a relative, having my uncle, my Uncle Bill, with his barbershop down at 54th and Ethan (ph.) which was not far from where the school was located.  He would cut the hair of all guys around there, some of the toughest ones.  But that was sort of like my protection.  But anyway, we all elevated ourselves when we got to high school, you know, even--there wasn't, even gang members changed.  They sort of got like, I used to do that.  It wasn't, and I'm talking about in those days, in those times.  High school became this, it even, I think it even frightened them, you know.  Everybody was scared of that move from junior high school to high school.  And that was Overbrook High School, and that's where, you know, the lessons got tougher, and school became serious, more serious if you wanted it to be.
Story_ID: 95889
Speaker 1: Now, Overbrook is one of the better-known high schools in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] because of some of the people that came out of there.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you have that sense of that was Overbrook, when you went there?  Did it have a tradition at that time?
Speaker 2: It did.  It very much had a basketball tradition during my time there.  I mean the immediate history was how, the kind of powerhouse it was in basketball.  Wilt Chamberlain, not many years prior had graduated from there and became the best in the world at the time.  And Walt Hazzard [later  Mahdi Abdul-Rahman]  and [Walter] Wali Jones, these were other heroes who went on to become basketball stars in their own right.  So it had that legacy and then there were also other performers who would be, or names, I should say.  I shouldn't say just performers.  I'm trying to think of who they are off the top of my head now.  But they're--it had, it was certainly, had a reputation of being a place where, oh, yeah, we've heard of Overbrook, or we know Overbrook or you go to Overbrook?  Wow, big city school, like King High School in Chicago.  I mean it was a huge school with a variety of people there, interesting characters.
Speaker 1: What was the racial composition of Overbrook at this time?
Speaker 2: At this time, I would think it was probably 50-50 of black and white and maybe even more white than black, just because it was located on the hill, we called it.  And the nickname for Overbrook was the Hill Topers.  Overbrook sat up at 57th and Oxford, which was, had bridge, and the bridge right next to Overbrook, was a bridge to a section of town called Winfield.  And Winfield was totally white at that time.  So that's why you had a lot of white students who would come and be Overbrook students and outnumbering other, you know, any minorities that were there at the time.
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite teachers at Overbrook?
Speaker 2: I did, I had memorable teachers.  And I remember Mr. McGuiness, see, you know, Mrs. Moore was sweet with the smile contest.  We're going to enter Steve in the smile context.  Mr. McGuiness had this rule of you had to--he hated work that was handed in that didn't have a name.  Someone forgot to put the name on it.
Speaker 1: What grade was this?
Speaker 2: Oh, this was like 10th grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Mr. McGuiness taught history and hated it.  If you didn't, if you can't remember to put your name on the paper, he didn't want anything to do with it.  I remember somewhere in that year, we had this big project, you know, that we had to hand in.  It was well thought out and a couple of weeks to do it.  And he's passing back all the papers, passing 'em back.  And we're waiting on our graded papers to return.  Some important, like worth half the year or something.  And then I didn't get mine.  I could see that I wasn't, mine wasn't coming.  And he said, I have one last one.  I don't know whose this is, [crumbling paper] (laughter).  So I guess it doesn't exist.  I never forgot to sign my name on a paper after that.  I'll leave here today.  You got something for me to sign, I'm not gonna forget it.  That's a harsh way to learn a lesson, but it was a little more, almost military-like in high school.  Things are different here, folks.  That was a cue that, oh, it's different here.  There're no smile contests to enter (laughter).  There's no pampering going on here.  And so teachers had a way of making you remember their rules.
Story_ID: 95890
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: That's an interesting question.  What kind of student was I?  I was, I think I was a pretty serious student.  I think it was because of the people I hung around with.  I, I didn't choose angels I was around, but I was around--my friends were, you know, they were happy to get good grades.  I'll put it that way.  When they got A's, and B's, hey, that was an accomplishment.  And me being a part of that crowd, I wanted to do that too.  So we were competitive in that sense.  I mean we would like to outdo each other.  What'd you get?  A 92?  I got 95.  I mean we would take joy in that.  So I was a fairly serious student, did homework when it needed to be done, always wanted to do well on my tests.  I, at that time, didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, but I knew school was a part of it.  And here's an interesting thing about how kids get steered sometimes.  My counselor coming out of high school, guidance counselor, from test we all had to take, some kind of aptitude test about what your career choice would be, decided that I needed, I would make a mechanic.
Speaker 1: Is that the Stanine?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know.  But it was an aptitude that gave you a sense of, this is a career for you, mechanic, some kind of tool operator, so trade school was my destination.  And my mother heard that, and had a fit because I had thought about going to college, didn't know where.  But I was a good enough student to be able to choose colleges.  I mean I wasn't gonna have that much difficulty getting into college, but it was always college as opposed to any other kind of school.  And my, I remember my mother [Mary Baskerville] being very upset about this woman trying to say that that's the path, and this is where you're, you know, that kind of academic life ended for me.
Speaker 1: Was your mother a stickler for education?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was, because she knew that that would lead to a better whatever.  You know, and she had this philosophy that the more you learn, the more choice you have.  You know, she knew that if you didn't, if you weren't educated, you know, more--people are gonna tell you, people like this lady are gonna tell you what you should do as opposed to you giving her four or five examples of what you may do.  Education gave you choice, and so she pounded that in our heads.  And my sister was a college graduate at that, by that time.  And so I had, didn't know where I--Temple [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Lafayette [College, Easton, Pennsylvania], Penn State [University, State College, Pennsylvania], still I was thinking about staying close to home, relatively close, off--I almost went to Penn State, but I applied too late, accepted too late, that they wanted me to go to an off-main campus, campus, and then go 'cause they didn't have room.  It was so, everybody wanted to go to Penn State.  And so I shouldn't say it was a second choice, but an alternative was Temple, and I'm really glad that I chose Temple city school, right there in the city to go to school because that was a first time they were--they were experimenting and showcasing this brand new School of Communications, and I later discovered that that's where I wanted to go and be a part of.
Story_ID: 95891
Speaker 1: What other types of activities were you involved in high school [Overbrook High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?  Were you an athlete?  Did you play sports?
Speaker 2: I played for the, it's funny.  In where I grew up, we had just as much pride in playing for the West Philly Hawks, was a football team, community team, as opposed to the high school.  And played for the West Philly Hawks.  This was really in middle, in junior high school in those years, junior high through about the first year of high school.  We played neighborhood football--it was organized football.  Mr. West, who was one of the parents on the block was our coach who lived up toward the middle of the block, and a couple--I can't even remember the assistant coaches.  But they were our coaches, and we had uniforms, and we were playing teams in New Jersey and in other parts of Philadelphia.  We played Middle Creek.  Middle Creek was another area in Philly that had a team.  And we would, we played organized football that way.  And I loved football until, I loved everything about it except getting hit.  And (laughter) I, not ever liking that, and that being a major part of the game, I never really was serious about pursuing that other than at that level.
Speaker 1: What position did you play?
Speaker 2: I tried to dare run back punts and kick offs 'cause that seemed glamorous and wide receiver and running back.  Everybody wanted to be Jim Brown at the time.  Jim Brown was the man.  He'd just, running up and down and all over people.  And then we had local heroes.  I remember Tim Brown.  There was a guy named Timmy Brown.  And Tim was an actor too.  He was in "MASH", the movie.  But, anyway, we waited like all day long outside a paint store to get Timmy Brown's autograph.  I just remember that flashed in my head.  You're a football fan to go back to, the Eagles [Philadelphia Eagles] had a guy named Ben Hawkins, and he was a wide receiver, and he fastened his chin strap.  Can you imagine getting away with that now?  Never fastening his chin strap.  I had a summer job working at the Post Office when I was in college.  And on my route was Ben Hawkins' house.  But I remember, what a thrill that was.  But I was, I was athletic in that sense.  I played at every sport, but once again, the talent level where I grew up was so big from that pool of people, that you didn't sing--like I mentioned I was in that Philadelphia choir, but you weren't standing on a corner singing unless you really could sing 'cause we had Delfonics, and Blue Magic, and Stylistics and all these guys were in our school or a school near us.  They really could sing, you know, in an appealing way.  So you didn't, you didn't go play basketball on the court unless you really could play 'cause we had real good--there was a guy named Mike Gale that I went to elementary school on with, who played professionally for the Spurs and was a dynamic basketball player, and there were other Mike Gales all around the neighborhood who could really play.  So a lot of these hobbies, you know, unless you were really committed to it, you know, you were, you chose something else to do.
Speaker 1: What was the social atmosphere at your school, when you were in high school?  I mean were there a lot of house parties and those kinds of things?
Speaker 2: Yes, there were--
Speaker 1: Blue lights in the basement?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, there'd be lots of, every party was in the basement.  Every party had, you know, the girls on the one side 'cause--and boys on the other.  And I remember somebody asked me once, she said, "Awe, man, look at you.  I knew that was happening.  Look at my wall."  And I'm like what you talking about?  My wallpaper is coming off on your back (laughter).  Get out here and dance.  So it was always a challenge of dance, you know, dancing.  But house parties were very eventful, and occasionally, it'd be something in the church.  And the church would have this big gathering and we'd all go to this dance that would be held in the basement of the church.  It would be an even bigger thing 'cause there would be lots of people there for that occasion.
Story_ID: 95892
Speaker 1: Now, did you attend church?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went to the Presbyterian church, two blocks away from my house.  My mother [Mary Baskerville] was Baptist, always Baptist.  But, it was easy for me to go to the church two blocks away for Sunday school and bible school 'cause I could just walk there.  And a couple, and kids on the block gravitated to that church 'cause that was an easy walk.  So we just went, so I just grew up in that church, grew up in the Presbyterian church, while my mother continued to go to her Vine Memorial Baptist church, and I would go there too on occasion with her.  My sister wound up marrying a Presbyterian minister.  So it's just funny how it wasn't divided, but that's just how it--as long you went somewhere was my mother's attitude, it was fine.  You know, you were gonna go somewhere on Sunday morning.  And the routine would be to go to Sunday school down two blocks from my house.
Speaker 1: So, you picked that church just because it was easier to go to?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How did you make, I mean I can't imagine my mother letting me say, let me chose the church I want to go to.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, see, she actually, I mean she made the choice because she knew it would be less fuss about going.  I had no excuses to not be able to get there.  If it was raining, hailing, snowing, two blocks wasn't far.  You could still go.  Her distance to her church involved transportation or getting a ride to go.  So it was probably easier to have more excuses to not be able to go as regularly.  So in her mind, it was fine.  And, you know, and we knew people from the neighborhood that attended that church.  So it wasn't completely foreign.  And so she knew about it.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the first time you walked to church by yourself?
Speaker 2: I don't recall ever doing that.  I don't ever recall because, once again, the, my good friend next door went to that church.  We grew up going to that church or a couple doors down.  With all those kids in that neighborhood, you were gonna, it was almost like going to school.  You were gonna hook up with somebody to go 'cause there were, there were enough to be able to go.  And I don't remember doing very much by myself.  To be--with the distance between my sister's age and my age, you would think I would have more of a only-child experience.  But I never did.  I had, I always had buddies or partners or somebody that I could count on to do things with me.

Speaker 1: Now, do you have any other significant memories about high school [Overbrook High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember that, just little episodes.  I can remember not going to the junior prom 'cause I waited too late to ask Lynn Pinckney.  That was her name.  I waited and waited and waited and I finally asked--because I didn't know whether I--I was afraid she was gonna say no, you know.  She was beautiful, and like, oh, my goodness.  And I gotta work up the nerve to ask Lynn to the prom.  And I asked her, and she told me oh, I'm already going with Bruce.  Bruce?  And I'm thinking, you're going--I can still in my mind, it's like, if Bruce had a shot, I know I had a chance of going, and she kind of looked and said, I didn't know you cared.  So, I remember going bowling with some guys (laughter).  We're gonna, all the misfits, who didn't go to the prom, that night, we all went bowling.  I remember the senior prom.  I remember those big events like that.  I remember going to Washington, D.C. on our class trip.  That was a big deal to go by bus to the monument and to sort of tour Washington, D.C. pretty quickly.
Speaker 1: How did that come about?  Did you have to raise money in order to go or--
Speaker 2: I think so.  I'm not certain.  It was almost a given that you would go.  I don't think there was anything attached to it that was special that we had to achieve to be able to go other than that was what you did.  That's what all senior classes did each year, went to, took the class trip to Washington [D.C.].  I remember my girlfriend being on the basketball team.  And I would go, you know, her friends going to the game.  And I remember her scoring and looking up and going [kiss sound].
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Alfreda, Alfreda and Alfred.  She was a twin.  Alfred was her brother.  I don't know whether Alfred liked me that much.  We would have run-in's all the time, but it's tough dating a twin, but Alfred and Alfreda.  And my wife went to that school at the time, and I didn't know her.  My wife of 37 years (laughter) and went to that school, but I didn't know her then.  And she was on that team, and I didn't, just didn't--she was on that basketball team, remembers me because of her, you know, her teammate, oh, that's her, that's Alfreda's boyfriend.  And that was it.  But high school was fun.  I remember high school.  You know, a lot of people, there are some people who don't recall high school fondly.  I do.  I think, you know, you got a lot of responsibility.  You grow up pretty quickly.  At least I did in high school.  I had all those challenges.  The babying, the pampering stopped.  Your street smarts had to be more refined, just to survive.  I remember being stopped on my first day in high school by this senior.  And when you're in tenth grade and somebody's in twelfth grade, that's a huge difference.  And he asked me if I had my protection dues.  And I said, excuse me?  Your protection dues.  It's .50 cents.  Give me .50 cents and nothing's gonna happen to you.  I'll make sure nobody messes with you.  Really?  Protection dues (laughter).  You know, so I'm scrambling to get protection dues (laughter), you know.  But it's just things like that where, you know, that was, high school life was a whole different world.  But it was, I don't remember it being too difficult 'cause I was pretty good at entertaining.  I could, when I say "entertaining", I was, I wasn't the life of the party, but I was pretty sociable.  And I got along with a lot of people.  I can get along with everybody.  I mean I never had problems with tough, tough guys.  You know, they'd be going, you all right, man.  I mean, you know, there'd be some element of it that, of skill that would get me through a lot of different situations, maneuvering through the traffic of the different types of people you run into.
Speaker 1: How long did you have to pay protection dues?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I think I saw that guy maybe twice, you know, 'cause the school was so big (laughter).  But, but it was just, you know, somebody who wised me up to it, okay, what are you talking about, protection dues?  You know what that's all about?  I was so naive to not even know (laughter).  I'm thinking that this guy is somewhere watching out for me, you know, for real, you know, until the next guy asked for some protection dues.
Story_ID: 95894
Speaker 1: Now, when you were in high school [Overbrook High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], did you have any sense of where you wanted to go in terms of a career or after school, after high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I thought I wanted to be a lawyer.  I knew that I liked a verbal area.  I knew English in terms of subjects that I did the best in were the English courses, or literature or things that had to do with being expressive that way, more so than, more so than math and science.  I never thought that I would be related in any way to those fields, though I, you know, competent enough to pass and do well on 'em, but I always thought that I, you know, being a lawyer seemed very dramatic, and I just thought of it as courtrooms and winning arguments, and, you know, that's what lawyers do.  And it just on the surface, just looked like that's what I wanna do, until I got to college and had my second semester of political science.  And it was the most boring thing I'd ever studied.  I couldn't get over that hump.  And that's when I realized that that--I just had fantasies about what I wanted to become in high school.  And that was the main thing.
Speaker 1: Were you influenced by Perry Mason?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, Perry Mason and any other television show that had lawyers in it, just looked like a cool job.  Wow, that's a--and we had activists in the city that were, Cecil B. Moore, is a name of a lawyer, a famous Philadelphia lawyer who during those years in the Civil Rights struggle, for equal rights and for all sorts of issues related to better pay and all those things, he was vocal and polished and well dressed.  And, wow, you know, if there's a problem, there's Cecil B. Moore.  Hardy Williams, I--Oscar Gaskins.  When I was in high school, I handed out leaflets for, Oscar Gaskins was running for mayor or it could have been mayor or City Council.  But I remember I was among a group of students that campaigned for him.  But these were all lawyers.  They were attorneys who, I never saw the work it took to do it.  But I always knew that they were well respected and listened to--and good, and they were, you know, I could, I kind of saw myself with those kinds of skills, being able to express myself one day like these activists that were out there.
Story_ID: 95895
Speaker 1: Now, you were talking about some of the lawyers who were kind of political activists in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Cecil B. Moore and some of those people.  What was the political atmosphere in Philadelphia, say when you were in high school?  And what did you know about it?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a right--we're talking 1964, '65 [1965], '66 [1966].  I got to college in the fall of '67 [1967].  So it's a lot, you know, you've got people trying to, you've segregation that's legal in parts of the country and, you know, the War in Vietnam ramping up, and Philadelphia was full of, you know, people, you know, we have universities there like Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and Temple [University Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and LaSalle [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and a lot of students who were vocal.  You had a mayor who was straight out of a police background, you know.  Your mayor was at one point--
Speaker 1: This is Frank Rizzo.
Speaker 2: Frank Rizzo was nicknamed the Cisco Kid, pearl-handled gun, you know, visible on his hip.  And "You can bank on Frank" was the slogan, bank on Frank to keep the law and order.  So it was very conservative atmosphere with things liberals, liberal thinking being expressed.  So that's a collision course right there.  And, you know, the thing about growing up in the Northeast was that people--things were written on paper that segregated people.  But those things existed.  I mean you knew there were parts of town where, they were rougher and you were not welcomed, depending on the color of your skin.  There were jobs that weren't available to you just because you didn't have the connections to get 'em.  And pay wasn't the same for folks, dependent on job opportunities because of your color.  And then you'd have activists like the names we mentioned, like Cecil Moore and Oscar Gaskins and all, who were fighting for the rights of these people trying to make it a better life in Philadelphia.  I can remember, it wasn't when I was in high school.  It might have been my first year of college, tanks, you know, rolling down the street, Broad Street.  That was the scene in Newark [New Jersey] and Chicago [Illinois] probably had scenes like that, at episodes like that.  If you had a city where the mayor was really strong willed, and conservative, they were gonna show their strength that way.
Story_ID: 95896
Speaker 1: So it was--and then, and, you know, there were guys I knew in high school, who didn't go to college who went straight to Vietnam.  And the first person I knew, that I knew who was my age, right after high school, he must have been about 18 or 19, Nick Moreno was his name, was killed in Vietnam.  And everybody was getting stories like that.  That was frightening.  I remember that.  And the reason why I didn't go in the service, but the atmosphere was, you'd better--that was another incentive to go to school.  You didn't wanna get, getting drafted meant going straight to Vietnam, was the way it felt almost and seemed that way.  So the incentive to stay in school, that was the alternative to being drafted or to joining the service and going to war.  But my father [Herman Baskerville] died of a service-connected injury.  So I was a sole surviving son.  I wasn't gonna, I mean I could have gotten drafted, but I don't think I could have served and fought because of that particular situation.  But I knew guys who were quite tense when I was in high school and going through college.  And then it was powerful too.  I remember when [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was assassinated, I can remember exactly where I was in a group on the campus of Temple University, trying to join a fraternity from which he was a member--of which he was a member.  It was Alpha Phi Alpha and Martin Luther King, Jr. was probably the most well known, certainly of that time because of where he stood in terms of the stature across the country.  And I remember we were all sitting there and getting the word that that had happened, that April day.  And it was just, and then you have the, you know, Bobby Kennedy.  A lot of that was happening unfortunately, during my high school and college years, where it was very--I remember college--and we're talking about stages of life.  I remember high school being challenging in terms of a whole new world.  I remember college years as being tense and frightening and future very uncertain.  Here we were in college and it seems like, is this gonna really lead to anything really, the way the world is?
Story_ID: 95897
Speaker 1: I wanna step back just a second and when you were in high school [Overbrook High School].  Now, the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] police had a reputation for being somewhat harsh?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you ever have any run-ins with the Philadelphia police?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had, I remember walking down the street--and just an incident, I mean this is just an example of incidents that would happen.  I remember being asked more than once, just walking down the street, by someone, a police car cruising up beside me, "Where'd you get that coat?"  Talking about my coat, and if you said from the store, that was being smart.  I've had this coat for a long time.  Really?  Where's the receipt?  I mean just harassment like that was possible.  You know, the, I remember that the police cars were red at one time, and it was determined that, the way I understand the story, and I don't think you'll see many red police cars anywhere because that's an inflammatory color.  Red, incites, as opposed to calms.  And, you know, we used to always be fearful of the red car, oh, oh, here comes the red car.  We used to nickname them "red car", red car is coming, roll up on you and sort of an in-your-face look just from the bright, red color of the car.  But we were fearful of the police, didn't wanna be caught in a situation where you didn't have witnesses because it's your version of what the truth is according to what else might be presented.
Story_ID: 95898
Speaker 1: I wanna jump back for just a second.  You mentioned that your [clearing throat] excuse me, your father [Herman Baskerville] died of a service-related injury.  Did he serve in World War II?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what--
Speaker 2: And he was in the Pacific.  He was, the way that I recall the story of his injury or the biggest injury, he would climb telephone poles and fix wiring and was, had that kind of duty and somehow fell off one of those telephone poles at great height.  And he came back with epilepsy or seizures.  And they determined it was epilepsy.  And in those days treatment for epilepsy was just back away from the person until the seizure is over, really.  So I'm sure, nowadays it's treated so much better, but he eventually died from complications of epilepsy.
Story_ID: 95899
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from high school [Overbrook High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: In 1967.
Speaker 1: So you were 17?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That's pretty young (laughter).  I don't know how--but, well, there were, there were--we used to have an "A" and "B" system in school, where 3A--3A and then 3B, 4A and then 4B.  So they split the year up for, somehow for grade school.  And then they stopped it in an off, they stopped it when I think I was in 5A, and then I got skipped.  So I skipped a year and put me in a class, most of my school years with kids who were a little bit older, at least a half year or so older than I was, not just me, but there were groups of kids that that happened to.  They couldn't smoothly do away with that A, B system.  So some kids were chosen to be skipped ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you graduate from high school, and you're looking at college.  You said you applied to Penn State [University, State College, Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and you applied to Temple [University] and what other schools did you apply 'cause you had the Big Five in Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: Yeah, didn't have much interest in any of the others for whatever reason.  I mean I just didn't, and Bill Cosby went to Temple, so I think we were aware, I was aware that that was at least the name I could associate with the school.  And it had a big campus.  Penn [University of Pennsylvania] was too Ivy League, and I'm sure I wouldn't have gotten the grades to get into Penn, at least, I didn't even attempt.
Speaker 1: Was John Chaney at Temple then?
Speaker 2: Let me tell you, see, it's like Forest Gump, I'm living the movie.  It's intertwined with all these people.  No, I'll get--do you wanna hear John Chaney now?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: A backtrack, back, all the way back.
Speaker 1: Just to preface this, John Chaney was the basketball coach at Temple for a hundred years.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, there's a friend of mine named Rob, who I still talk to on occasion.  Rob and I and others went to Shoemaker Junior High, and that's where I knew him.  But when we talk about basketball or sports or Philly or whatever, he would always say, "And Mr. Chaney did this and Mr. Chaney"--I'm talking about who, you know, like John.  He would talk, he would refer to John Chaney as Mr. Chaney.  And I always thought that was respectful, but why do you keep calling him Mr. Chaney?  He was like don't you remember Mr. Chaney?  And I had Mr. Chaney for Hygiene in gym when I was in seventh grade at Shoemaker [Junior High School], John Chaney was hygiene teacher.
Speaker 1: The John Chaney?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went back, and then he went on and eventually taught and taught and coached at Cheyney State University in Pennsylvania before he went to Temple.  Fast forward years, and my son was looking at schools.  And I--and Temple's always sort of been proud of the fact that I had gone there.  And so I still had some, not as many connections.  I just haven't done so, haven't--but at the time, knowing I had children, college age, they were inviting to come, bring 'em to Temple.  I couldn't interest my son into going to Temple, but we were invited back.  And I had lunch with John Chaney that--and brought that up.  And he was smiling saying that was one of his first jobs as a teacher, teaching knuckleheads in junior high school, you know, gym and hygiene.  But that was an interesting Temple and John Chaney connection.
Story_ID: 95900
Speaker 1: Now, what was the atmosphere at Temple [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] when you started there?  I mean the war was going on.  The, [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] had been killed that year, Bobby Kennedy had been killed, the Panthers [Black Panther Party] were very active--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was going on, on that campus?
Speaker 2: It was very, it was pretty, pretty open to expression.  I'll put it that way.  I remember the "Last Poets", remember that?
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: They were a group, very revolutionary in their content and their message.  And I remember going to see the "Last Poets".  They were invited to campus to perform.  So you'd have entertainers and authors and poets who would come and deliver messages about why we were in trouble right now as a country.  So it was a, it was pretty exciting to be around a city school like that, you know, to be--on the one hand, exciting in that you were on top of the news of the day and what seemed to be important issues, not necessarily fun to travel the streets in an atmosphere where it was pretty clear that all the older people that you knew--and it wasn't just police.  A lot of older folks thought it was, you know, James Brown "Be Black and Be Proud", I mean there were some, I don't know if my mother thought that, you know, what's up with these, why is your hair like that?  And we all had 'fros [Afros] and they would hear these messages, I mean, you know, my aunts and uncles and people that I knew who were parents, I mean some of these same people that were always cool and a part of our life, thought a lot of that stuff was from way over here because they didn't grow up that way.  I mean they didn't grow up with an opportunity to challenge, and it was all about challenge by that time.  And they were afraid for us.  I mean when you look back at it, they were afraid that we would ruin our lives by maybe getting kicked out of school.  You know, maybe you will attend a function and they just wanna expel everybody at that concert, or you know, maybe you're blowing chances by being too vocal or around people who are vocal.  So it was a, all of that was going on at the same time.
Speaker 1: How many black students were at Temple when you first started?
Speaker 2: A very small percentage, I would say.  I mean if I had to guess, maybe 20 percent, and that's really stretching it.  I mean it was very, a small--very small group of minority students.  So, but at the same time, it was an atmosphere of, it was a school like other schools, you know, like Kent State, and, I mean there were--if there was a protest, it wouldn't just be black students attending.  I mean you would have the school turn out because it would be a matter of Civil Right or expressing a point of view that wasn't the establishment.
Speaker 1: Was there ever a take-over of the administration building?
Speaker 2: No.  Not that I can recall.  It never got, you know, we never had episodes on the campus that were directly, (unclear) with that kind of impact, you know, somebody being beaten or shot by, you know, the police or somebody in power.  There was nothing really that triggered, nobody got kicked out of school.  You know who eventually went on to teach there was Bobby Seals [sic, Seale], who I think is still teaching there, I think--I'm sorry, Bobby Seals [sic, Seale]. It's not Bobby.  Is it Bobby?  It's, one of the Black Panthers is a professor now at Temple, and I can't--we'll have to look that up at some point.  But anyway, but that's how far things have gone.
Speaker 1: Was there a black student organization?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And, and we, you know, you'd see black students congregate in part of the Student Union.
Speaker 1: Playing bid whist?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, or doing, right.  Bid whist and Pinochle, but it would be a meeting spot, where you'd go and you'd go and you'd meet at that part of the Student Union.  You'd always see somebody there that you knew or could talk to.
Story_ID: 95901
Speaker 1: But that was where, I went to school thinking I would be a lawyer, you know, on my way into college.  I'm on the "L", the elevated train 'cause I was a city kid, and there's this friendly guy that I'd seen on the campus who knew somebody that I knew.  And so we knew each other socially.  I was about to get off at my stop for one of the halls that, political science or some other thing that, other class.  He was going to the next stop to Annenberg Hall.  Annenberg Hall was foreign to me.  I said, really?  What's up there?  Oh, I'm taking television production.  Really?  Doing what?  Well, I'm writing and directing.  And I said, you--and performing.  And I said, you can get grades on that (laughter).  To me that sounded like easy money.  And I said, where is that?  And he says, right--and I didn't get off at my stop.  I went straight to Annenberg Hall.  In my mind, to see what was going on up there.  And that was the first year or so of the Communications program, and Theater was right next door.  It was Theater and Communications.  And Communications was, encompassed all of it, you know, news reporting and journalism, camera work, and then you had your theater students here who would be in your productions and so it was a whole different scene up there.
Speaker 2: Did you have any interests in theater at that time?
Speaker 1: I would dabble in it.  I never, although I went on, I've taken acting lessons in New York.  I went to Wynn Handman Studio.  I say that like that's a big deal because in that class, there would be people I knew who would be in soaps.  I mean so I'd see them working.  There would be some performers of all types.  I just went there to sort of hone the craft, to--I, just to learn more about performance.  But anyway, and I always thought I'd be behind the scenes.  I really did.  I thought the future and the security was not being in front of a camera.  That was really too shaky.  My Uncle B.C., when I got my first job in television, he got excited when I said I was in television.  He said, really?  He thought I knew how to fix them.  And when he said, oh, you mean on it?  Like he thought that was, what a bad move that is 'cause there's no security in that.  So that was kind of my attitude too.  That's risky.  He says, man, you better learn how to fix 'em.  And I said, okay.  But so I always thought the, you know, the things to learn were behind the camera, not in front of it.  And so I took directing classes and writing.  I took advertising, writing.  One of the most fun and influential teachers I've ever had, beyond high school was a guy named Howard Rice.  Howard Rice was part owner of an ad agency, Kalish and Rice.  And they wrote famous jingles for, like termites, Terminix, they wrote that jingle, and they wrote some other things.  And, you know, he would start off the whole course, I remember the first day, asking us what our favorite word was.  Nobody ever asks you questions like that.  I just thought that was, boy, this is so cool, just to be--you know, we were thinking in that school in ways I hadn't thought before with other teachers.  It wasn't boring to me to be asked a question, you know, what's your favorite word?  Not because you know what the word means, but just for--you know, and I even remember the word I chose was "Brouhaha".
Speaker 2: And what did you think that meant (laughter)?
Speaker 1: I didn't know.  I just thought it was a funny word, Brouhaha.  You know, there was a brouhaha over there, didn't, 'cause it didn't mean what it said.  It's like some disturbance or what.  But so I knew that that's where I belonged in that kind of expressive environment.  So--
Speaker 2: Was this your freshman year?
Speaker 1: Probably by sophomore year, by that time.  I had taken a year or so.  It was like walking through cement, taking this journey toward law.  It wasn't, law wasn't just standing up and closing arguments.  It was actually taking political science courses and so I journeyed there and didn't look back.
Speaker 2: So, when did--when did you make Communications your major?  Was that--
Speaker 1: That was as soon as I saw it, that second year at school.  And by the way, the guy that I sat beside is still a good friend of mine, who would be someone to be interviewed here.  It's Joe Terry.  I don't know if you know who that is.  Joe, for years, directed Oprah [Winfrey].  And among other--we actually got a chance to work together.  He was, when I worked in New York for the "Morning News", he was directing that show.  But Joe's a Temple [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] grad just like me, the guy who sat beside me on the "L" who said some interesting things are going on a block away, and we both managed to make careers of it.  And so I'm glad I made that choice which led me to being glad that I went to Temple as opposed to them having space at Penn State [University, State College, Pennsylvania].
Story_ID: 95902
Speaker 1: And you said your initial interest was to work behind the scenes?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How did you get pushed towards being an on-air personality?
Speaker 2: Well, coming out of Temple [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], first experience out of, you know, seniors and graduating, a good friend of mine--we're all looking for jobs at that point, a good friend of mine has an interview with the Board of Education about a children's show they wanted to start on radio.  And it involved writing scripts for the show.  And it didn't air, it hadn't aired.  They were developing it, and I mean to air it on public radio.  For some reason it didn't work for him, but he told them, I know somebody that would be good for this.  And he called me, and I went down and interviewed and got the job.  It was a four-man staff in the Office of Curriculum in Philadelphia, developing a show for children to--the goal to increase their scores on National Achievement Tests.  Our kids were doing so poorly in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], compared to other cities, on tests that, you know, some people thought were unfair, didn't really accurately give you conclusions you could use, but they were still being tested.  So the bottom line was, I don't care what your attitude is about the test, the kids are doing bad in them.  It's gotta be something to do.  So the goal was to increase those scores, verbal side of it, in particular.  Kids just didn't know enough words.  And they would be tested on the words on these tests.  So we knew we had to reach kids in the city, fourth, fifth and sixth graders.  How are you gonna do that?  What are they doing?  Where are they spending their time?  They're spending their time watching TV.  The director of this project had a notion of, let's watch TV with them and talk about what they're watching and teach them.  What do you mean, is what we were saying?  Well, we'll call it dual audio.  A child's at home, watching the TV, and his favorite show at the time is Spiderman.  There're plenty of pauses in the show, in the episode of any show, but in the cartoons they were watching, in particular, where you can interject things.  Spiderman, for example, the swinging on the vine for like 20 seconds at a time, and the music's playing, as he looks for a crook, he's investigating.  Investigate's a word these kids need to know and will be tested on.  So the voice (laughter) on the radio, watching the show with them will say, "Hey, looks like he's off to investigate".  That means look for something you can't find.  You ever do that?  And the child gets the word, gets the meaning and relates it to his life.  And so it was called dual audio, and we were writing scripts for the pauses within the TV show, picking two words an episode.  We had the distributor of Spiderman send us all the shows they were going to air in Philadelphia that year.  And we'd look at 'em ahead of time and write scripts for 'em; had all that taken care of, didn't have a host.  And so we would interview candidates to host this crazy dual audio show.  You'd go to a studio--the arrangement was that the host of the show would go to the public radio station 'cause it was gonna air on WHYY.  Now, I know it sounds convoluted.  That was just the call letters of it.  But the child at home would have the radio beside 'em.  We'd tell the kids by commercials on TV, how to tune in.  Like, hey, it's almost 4:30.  Time for Spiderman, get your radio ready.  I'm gonna watch with you.  And the kids would get the radio, and it was like having a buddy with you as you watch the show.  But they're learning, as they did it.  We didn't have the right person to do the show, and we're running out of time and running out of time.  And everybody looked at me and said, you've gotta do it.
Story_ID: 95903
Speaker 1: Okay, we were just talking about your experience with the curriculum at the Philadelphia Public Schools [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and the show that you're, this dual audio.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What happened next?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a funded, it was an all--the, we were relying on funds to keep the program and project supported.  And it wasn't an in-school activity.  It was strictly a supplement to what happened in school.  So it was different.  That's didn't last very long as a project to work on.  But it was my introduction into real broadcasting.  And then from there, I got an interview and audition to do a children's television show.  I answered an ad in the back of Westinghouse--I mean the "Broadcasting Magazine."  Sometimes people think that jobs don't come from that.  It was a generic ad in the back of "Broadcasting Magazine" that Westinghouse was looking for talent.  KYW TV in Philadelphia was a Westinghouse station.  And so I just sent a resume to New York.  New York got back to the Philadelphia station and said, take a look at this guy.  He wants to do some children's shows.  At the time, the atmosphere was "do more for kids".  Children's television is important.  "Sesame Street" was pretty much new.  "Electric Company" and "Mister Rogers [Neighborhood]", they were all hugely valued and money was being spent on children' programming, and everybody wanted to do it.  So the local stations got in on it too.  And they were trying to come up with a school--a show for preschoolers at the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] station, the NBC affiliate.  They called me down.  They put me in a room around this size with about 20 kids, and they had a cameraman.  And you know what they said to me?  Entertain 'em.  And that was the only instruction I got.  And the producer left the room, and I had 20 screaming, five-year olds.
Speaker 1: So what did you do?
Speaker 2: Everything I could think of, from storytelling to miming, to everything.  And they looked at the tape and said, "You're the guy".  And so I hosted and produced, coproduced, a show for Westinghouse, not just Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Chicago [Illinois]--I mean Philadelphia and New York [New York], San Francisco [California], Boston [Massachusetts], maybe Miami [Florida].  There were five O and O's, for Westinghouse at the time.  Philadelphia, Miami, New York, I can't think of the others, but they were big markets.  And instead of showing "Sanford and Son" reruns, they were gonna air this.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the show?
Speaker 2: "Expressway".  And I, that was my--I did television (laughter) for, real television on a daily basis for the summer.  It was a summer strip.  But that was really serious, and, then, man, this is for--and then I was so seriously committed, and I really was.  It was fun.  It's fun, the most challenging audience for me there is, is an audience of kids because they're completely honest.  If the story is really funny, they will laugh.  If it's really interesting, they will stay.  If they are bored and don't like it any more, they get up and they walk off.
Speaker 1: Now, these are pre-schoolers?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was the format of the show?  Did you have students in (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, no, no, no.  This, that was the audience.  The show didn't involve--there were elements of the show that had kids in it.  But it was mainly taped pieces.  I had a show--you know what was hugely popular at that station?  Within that, every Friday, I did something called "Troll Train".  I had the big, spinning ball, and I dressed sort of like Don Cornelius, cut out trolls all over the set and kids came in and danced (laughter), little, the little kids.  And all the, (laughter) all the workers at the station wanted their kids on "Troll Train".  You know, it was just funny.  It was just a segment within the show.  But we were doing, and then we would do things on--it was a lot like "Sesame Street" turned out to be, or "Electric Company" where you'd do pieces that taught manners, good manners or you'd develop skills that were social skills by the way you saw me interact with somebody on the show.  And that, so I was--I had my foot in the door.  They always say get your foot in the door when you're looking for a job.  My foot was in the door then.  I had a job at least for the summer at this NBC affiliate.
Speaker 1: What kind of music did "Troll Train" play?
Speaker 2: Kind of rock and roll versions of nursery rhymes and things.  So it was songs they were familiar with.
Story_ID: 95904
Speaker 1: But anyway, look, I'm at this NBC station.  And this is gonna come to an end.  It's gonna end soon, but they liked the strip of shows I did.  There was a guy doing a morning show, "People Are Talking", Maury Povich.  No, let me--I'm jumping ahead a little bit.  I go straight from this show to--do you remember a show called "Evening Magazine", "PM Magazine"?  It ran--
Speaker 2: "PM Magazine", yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes.  A lot of the cities had their version of it.  There was a version of it in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] called "Evening Magazine", and there were cohosts for that show.  The woman from that show was paired with me to do a talk, entertainment kind of show, kind of like "Kelly and Regis", replacing this children's show.  I got thrown in the deep end of the water from that experience to all, live adults come in, sit and we have all types of discussion and entertainment for an hour every day.  That's a huge leap.  I didn't have as much experience as the "Evening Magazine" cohost who was coming to be my partner.  And I reluctantly said, yes, I would do it, but fearful the whole time.  And it was mainly horrible, to me.  I mean I later on was a part of other shows like that, and it got better and better and fine.  But that experience was somewhat disastrous 'cause it was way over my head.  And eventually, they called us into offices.  She was called into one office, and let go.
Speaker 2: What was her name?
Speaker 1: Amy Rosenthal, who was very talented, but for us, in that situation, it was just too soon and too--different, you know.  I got called into another room.  And I thought, this is it.  I'm done.  My short (laughter) television life is over.  And a woman whose name I can't think of now, was a program manager, said to me, this show is over.  It's ended, but you're still gonna be here.  You know why?  Because you've got it.  And I'm saying, what?  She said, I don't know.  But you got it.  You got "it".  Nobody knows what "it" is.  But "it" meant enough to keep working, keep doing something here. So the next thing incarnation of a show like that had someone who had a lot of experience doing a show like that, and it was Maury Povich.  Maury came in and is the anchor in Washington [D.C].  And he came in and was anchoring the 5:00 o'clock show and doing this morning show.  And I was doing segments on that show.  And we worked together.  I eventually was, practically--we did an hour and a half live every day.  And I brought in some photos from those days.  You know, this experience isn't gonna end until next Wednesday.  But anyway, Maury and I are on this show, "AM-PM".  It starts at 11:00 in the morning, and it ended like 1:00 in the afternoon.  So there was interview and singing and dancing, variety, a lot for live television every day.  And so my experience on that show was much better and allowed to grow in it.
Story_ID: 95905
Speaker 1: Eventually, the boss running, the GM [General Manager] running that station comes down to me and he says, you know, I wish there was a way to get you involved in more of the day.  This is working so well.  Weather.  And I said, what?  The weather.  Why didn't I think of it earlier?  You'd make a great weatherman.  I said--
Speaker 2: What was your initial thought when he said that?
Speaker 1: You've got to be kidding.  I mean I had never thought of it.  Maury [Povich] was an anchor of the 5:00 o'clock newscast, and he liked the relationship we had.  And he thought that I could blend into a newscast easily from what he saw earlier.  The Dean of Science at Drexel University in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] was an old-time weather broadcaster, now Dean of Science at Drexel.  He says, you know, I like that guy.  Why don't you pay me to teach him.  I'll teach him the weather.  So the station sends me off to Francis Davis, Dr. Francis Davis, and several times a week, one-on-one, special course, special arrangement, I learned the weather like sitting there with notes and pad, pen, teaching me personally, meteorology.  Now--
Speaker 2: What did this education involve?  I mean how do you teach a weatherman (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Well, I mean it wasn't, it was an informal arrangement for sure.  But the goal was, see, there's a--we can't as TV meteorologists ever do as much as the weather service is doing.  I mean there are people on staff 24 hours a day, breaking up the day.  I mean there's broadcast meteorology and then there's meteorology.  I eventually went on and took courses, coursework at Mississippi State [University] where you get credentialed to have a seal 'cause are tests that you have to take and, but in those days, it was very loose.  I mean the entry into the world of weather was pretty loose, and there were--I got, one of the most popular weathermen in Philadelphia at the time was a D.J. who made the transition from being a D.J., straight into doing television weather, enormously popular.  I mean untouchable, popular for most of the years that I was in Philadelphia.  So, so the, the thing about, half of--even to this day, I mean now we can go on the air with credentials and study from the day, from whatever the weather of the day is, but the map isn't the star of that segment.  You are.  So it's as much personality driven as it is information, especially in this day and age because people have so--we are fighting all sorts of sources for--by the time I'm seen on the air, people have, if they wanted, gotten the information, six ways from Sunday, from their phone, from their iPad, from all sorts of alerts and descriptions of the weather.  And, you know, and, but the same for news as well.  I think news is changing that way too, but we're really getting off on a tangent, so much so that I'm not sure where--but that was my entrance into steady television work.
Speaker 2: Now, you didn't have like radar weather or did you?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, the thing that was most special about this arrangement with the Francis Davis who was this instructor of mine, he monitored me every day.  I mean I was, it was like riding a bike, you took the training wheels off, and sent me off, and I'm wobbling.  And I go on the air with all of the basics.  I knew what fronts and highs and lows were and what they did and where they came from.  I mean I could put a forecast together.  I had to also master the phrasing, and I had to also make sense.  And he'd call me after a show.  That was great what you just said, that was exactly what's gonna happen or he'd call and say, that was crazy.  Where'd you get that?   Or that's the most ridiculous thing I ever--and it was wonderful to have someone in your corner like that.  So I did, and I thought if I'm lucky, I'll keep this job for the rest of the month.
Speaker 2: What year was this?
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy, like seven [1977] or so, 1978.
Story_ID: 95906
Speaker 1: Two years into that, Maury [Povich] goes to New York [City, New York].  He always--I didn't have an agent or anything.  I was just glad to have a job.  And he took, he was--he had an agent in New York, and his agent calls me one day and says, you know, I'm going over to CBS tomorrow.  Could I show them you, because he asked Maury, who's this guy on "Maury's Day."  And he called me and said, (unclear) I said, sure.  And then, that next week, I'm on a set with Diane Sawyer and Bill Kurtis in an audition role, auditioning for the "CBS Morning News".
Speaker 2: And this was broadcast out of New York?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't know if you remember Steve Deshler.  Steve Deshler was doing the, it's all, this--the world is very small in many ways, but Steve Deshler was leaving New York to come to Chicago [Illinois].  I knew at the time his wife.  Do you know who Janet Davies is?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: That was his wife at the time.  And Janet Davies was in Philadelphia when I was there, so I knew her.  And Steve, I knew kind of casually.  So it wasn't like I was taking--the worst experience is when you're taking somebody's job, you know, but he was leaving on his own to come here.  And here I was brought in to audition for the job that he had.  So it was mutual, and it wasn't tense.
Story_ID: 95907
Speaker 1: Let me ask you something about the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] market.  Were there any other African Americans in front of the camera during this period?
Speaker 2: Yes, but none doing weather.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I remember, you--Don King--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Don King was sitting off on the set one day, and he was shaking his head like that, smiling, as I was doing--he was to be interviewed by the sports guys later.  And afterwards, I went over to him and said, what are you laughing at?  He said, I just can't get over it, a black man doing the weather.  And it was a first.  But I never really saw it in that kind of pioneering way.  But it was a first, African American weather in Philadelphia.  I don't know whether nationally.  I, I don't--'cause Spencer Christian, you know, did weather at ABC.  I don't know if you know that name.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But there were other black faces on, in the news.  We had Jack Jones.  I don't know whether Jack Jones ever worked in Chicago [Illinois], but he worked, I think he did for a short while.  And Beverly Williams was the only female, soloing a newscast.  And she was soloing the late newscast at the time.  We had a couple other people who were in front of the camera.  It was a, a pretty good cross section because of the population of Philadelphia.
Story_ID: 95908
Speaker 1: What other types of things were you doing besides weather or were you doing other types of things besides the weather?
Speaker 2: Well, I was feature reporting.  I was doing a variety of things.  You know, I would do mainly, I was working, still working on that live program every day.  So that was an exciting day.  You remember "The Mike Douglas Show"?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Mike Douglas' show was broadcast there.  So I'd run into these stars every day.  I mean you'd be on the elevator with Sammy Davis beside you or, you know, there'd be John Lennon down the hall.  And I think I learned more then.  You know what I learned from those days was how to behave as a person, as a public person.  The ones who--and generally, what I noticed was the bigger the star, the nicer they were, generally.  I mean I remember being in a green room and Kirk Douglas was, got up and said, "I'm gonna get a soda.  Anybody want one?"  Wow, I mean he's going out to the machine and get one.  Usually, you would think, well, he wants somebody to go fetch it for him.  But just niceties like that, you know.  Mike Douglas used to have a host for a week.  And they'd come and they'd spend the week in town.  Sammy Davis would come in for a week and bring a chef and a bartender and everything on him, for the building.  I mean, you know, memorable things that would make--you know, I'm walking down a hall, and Tony Bennett is singing with the band.  And I'm standing here with a couple of guys, and we're just young guys hanging out.  Hey, fellas, how you doing?  What's your names?  [in a Tony Bennett voice].  And then we all say our names.  And he's in between bringing his, and then he goes and continues to sing.  And I see him in the hall like an hour later, and he goes, hey, Steve.  Whoa.  Tony, I mean, Tony Bennett remembering my name.  And then I've seen other b-level, b-level, c-level stars pitch fits because, you know, breakfast is, I said, breakfast, don't bring me rolls.  I said, bacon and eggs.  And, again, you kinda of get a sense of okay.  Lena Horne was one of the best experiences I ever had.  I, I was sent to interview her and her band at a rehearsal.  And I got there late with the crew.  And I get there as she's toweling down and the whole orchestra half, is practically off the stage and walking in (unclear).  And I'm dejected, and she sees that.  And she says, "What's wrong, baby?"  And I said, "I want an interview, but I needed the orchestra." Oh, hey, Sam, hey, Bobby, hey--and she calls everybody back and does the interview the way that I wanted to have it done.  Wow, I mean just, and so you, and you understand why some people are hugely popular because a lot of 'em are pretty genuine, you know, and doesn't lie about who they are.  I mean if you--you can be fooled, but in most cases, people you like, who seem to be decent people, probably are, you know.  It's hard to mask it for a long time.
Story_ID: 95909
Speaker 1: Now, you're on TV every day just about, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: When did you realize that, you know, people on the streets knew who you were?
Speaker 2: That takes a long time to happen.  You know, even an anchor or personality that settles in a city, it takes years for people to stumble on you, by accident, with the remote.  So I didn't feel that for a number of years.  The biggest difference is from friends and family.  They start to see you as--like my Uncle B.C., is like, whoa, this is real.  (Laughter) I mean, never mind having to fix the TV.  That's okay.  I mean you, you turn a corner and, you know, there's a whole different respect for that accomplishment.  And so it was fun seeing how they felt about it.
Speaker 1: When did you think you turned that corner?
Speaker 2: When I had a job for more than a year (laughter).  I mean it didn't take long, but that's a tough business to stay in with any regularity.  I've been very fortunate.  You know, I've only had, I've worked in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and New York [New York] and Chicago [Illinois].  And I've been in Chicago for 25 years.
Speaker 1: You have?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes.  I was in New York for about four and Philadelphia about six.  I mean, so I never had to go to a very small market.  And I never--I have a theory about that too, you know.  People like to tell young people, looking to be in broadcasting, should start small, you know, and work your way up.  There's value in that, but I think the, I think Paducah [Kentucky] and, you know, North Platte [Nebraska], they're overwhelmed with resumes because nobody is thinking of--I think, look first where you know.  My first job was in Philadelphia 'cause I knew it.  I grew up there.  I knew what life was life.  I mean I have an experience I could, I was young, but I had an experience that I could tap into, you know, someone who lives in Chicago as, and grows up in Chicago, becomes a young adult and thinks they have to go to Nebraska.  No, your experience is here, and there are things you undervalue that you could tap into from where you are.  Like, don't be afraid of the big city.
Story_ID: 95910
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you leave KYW, and you go to the big, the bigger big city?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us again how that came about?
Speaker 2: Pretty much, accidental, just being a part of someone else's resume reel.  But at the same time, almost like the old expressions about opportunity.  You know, when opportunity is--you just have to be ready for the opportunity.  And the timing was right that they needed someone to replace an individual, and I got a chance to audition, did well in that.  And once again, you're sort of thrown on the set.  I was thrown on the set with, I'm trying to think of who stayed.  I think it was Diane Sawyer that stayed.  Bill Kurtis was, they were working together as a team.  And she couldn't stay for that audition--I mean he couldn't stay for that audition, so I auditioned in two or three fake weathercast and newscast with Diane Sawyer, and was later offered that job.  And I turned it down at first.
Speaker 1: Oh, you did?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because I'm from Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Nobody leaves Philly (laughter).  It's so clean, remember I told you, nobody leaves that neighborhood.  I just thought, I'm okay here.  I'm not looking to leave, and it's flattering, but I don't wanna--it was a morning show, it was a morning newscast that aired from 6:00 am to 9:00 am, like the "Today Show", and "Good Morning America".  It's too early.  I didn't wanna get up in the middle of the night, and I--I mean I had all the negatives in my head.  And I didn't wanna do it.  And so I said, no.  And I went back to work, I remember, and one of the anchors, knowing what I had done, sat me down quietly in a room one day and said, you gotta go.  And I said, why?  He said, because those chances don't come all the time, and what do you have to lose?  If it doesn't work out, you know, you come back.  You know, that's venturing into something else, and it's not like you're being pushed out of here.  And then a couple more people started to tell me things like that, and I said, okay, I'll try it.
Story_ID: 95911
Speaker 1: And worked there with Bill Kurtis, who was very important in me coming here.  Bill Kurtis and several other people who were behind the scenes had Chicago  [Illinois] connections and eventually came to Chicago, came back to Chicago.  And Bill Kurtis kept telling, you ought to come to Chicago.
Speaker 2: Now, was Johnathan Rodgers [HM] there?
Speaker 1: Yes, Johnathan Rodgers, when I first met him, was the executive producer of the "Evening News".  And I'd just see him in the building in passing, but I knew him to talk to.  And then Jonathan, got involved in a morning news that I was a part of.  And then Jonathan was, got the job as General Manager here at CBS.  And then when he came, he took a handful of people back to Chicago.  And then Bill was among them that, so it was a natural thing.  And all these people, I knew, so that made the transition for me easy to come from New York to Chicago.
Story_ID: 95912
Speaker 1: How did you feel the first time you were on air on national TV now, I mean you're in--going all way across the country when this really significant show?
Speaker 2: Well, I was embarrassed the first week because I made a comment, they said something about, "So you're from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?"  And that Liberty Bell must be ringing today or something like that.  I said, it sure is.  And I didn't realize that how things you say can be scrutinized so closely.  And the Liberty Bell doesn't have a ringer (laughter).  So, like the press is like how can he say that it rings?  He should know there's no ringer.  You know, it hasn't for years.  But it was a thing, like little things just put me on guard more.  Went oh, oh, so this is a different thing going on here too.  The thing about working nationally though, I'd much prefer being in Chicago [Illinois], for instance, than working a national show because you don't feel connected to anything.  You know, I worked in New York [New York], lived in New Jersey, but I didn't feel a part of--you know, people don't look at you as being from where they are necessarily.  They see you as a national guy.  So you may not be invited to certain--I mean you may be invited to come to our festival in El Paso [Texas].  Well, I can't just go to El Paso.  You know, they sort of look at you nationally.  They don't look at you as someone who can share in that community.  You feel more connected when you work in the city.
Speaker 1: You're not really a local person?
Speaker 2: No, and you're not looked at, you're not viewed that way.  And it's something, you know, you get more rooted when you're locally a part of the folks you're talking to.
Speaker 1: And you don't get out, get a chance to go out and do local shows and stuff?
Speaker 2: No, no.  And I think it's value in that.  I mean I think you feel more at home.  And it's just a, it's so big.  And it's a whole different ballgame too.  It depends on what you do.  I think it's much more cotton candy-ish, you lose your job quicker and decisions are made around people you don't know or ever see in the offices you never got--you know, on a national level, just an added--my experience was an added tension that could be difficult to deal with unless you're really a part of, like an established show that's got a history already, and you're just rolling.
Story_ID: 95913
Speaker 1: Now, you're in New York [City, New York], doing CBS Morning Show.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: When did you first go there?  What year was that?
Speaker 2: That was 1980.  It's all a blur after about 25 years.  But that was a colossal eye opener because suddenly, you're in a world where you're exposed to so many people from so many walks of life.  And they give a chance--and it's just, you talk about who can possibly see you.  I remember Nancy Sinatra said to me one day, my father likes you.  Oh!  I mean you know what I mean.  I can't phantom that.  I mean I thought that was, wow, Frank Sinatra's watching me?  Not just me, or you just, you know, you go in a dressing room and Jon Voight is there, and you talk to him casually about something.  Then there are, you know, there are poignant, moving experiences.  I remember when Rock Hudson came in the studio, just after he had let the world know that he had AIDS.  And that was at a time when people didn't know much of anything.  And I remember how tense everything was, just in how that experience was gonna go.  And you know what broke the ice?  He came in with Doris Day, and she came in hugging him.  And that gesture, I think, I mean certainly turned everybody's head around that day.  But she did that globally too, you know, because that was picked up by the press everywhere, that, you know, here's a woman who's not afraid to hug someone she loves whose got AIDS, and it's not about catching it in any way that you think you can.  Or you look over and there's Henry Kissinger, and you can casually talk to him about the day.  I mean these are all people on the set in an atmosphere like that, Mickey Mantle standing beside you and you talk to him or just any statesman or, you know, you got world leaders that could be there.  And it was, that was the biggest thrill out of working nationally on a show like that.
Story_ID: 95914
Speaker 1: Now, where did you go next and how did you get there?
Speaker 2: Well, I worked on that program--at the same time, that had a history of really doing poorly because we had revolving hosts of that show.  It was, I can name maybe a half dozen men who cohosted the show at one point, half dozen women from, you know, the--I stayed the last panel of people on that show, Maria Shriver and a guy named Forrest Sawyer and me, and we were doing fairly well, you know, in terms of the numbers.  But CBS decided, we're gonna give this show to programming, and we're gonna take it away from the news division.  And they brought in a whole different set of folks, Mariette Hartley and Bob Saget and some others.  And then, and the show was just different, and it still didn't do well.  But everybody I worked with was suddenly out of a job, didn't know where they were going next.  But we knew that there was a core that had decided to leave and go to Chicago [Illinois].  And I was just kind of taking it as a break.  I was doing a little bit of, just kind of dabbling 'cause I was still being paid under contract for another six months or so.  So to me, I was okay (laughter) for six months.  But it gave me a chance to kind of think about what I wanted to do next.  And it was, I almost stayed in the New York [City, New York] area to work at a station there 'cause it was close.  But it wasn't a part of CBS.  I was a part of CBS and knew a lot of people, and the connections that I had with CBS were stronger.  And the challenge of coming--everybody kept telling me, you're gonna like Chicago.  And I went, really?  I have one uncle in Chicago who loves it, but I don't know.  You know, it just was so--you know, I knew nothing about it.  I knew it was cold, and I knew about Capone [Al Capone].  I mean these are the things people like to tell you 'cause that's all they know.  And I kind of came to Chicago on a handshake to temporarily, you know, if you don't like it or as soon as your family doesn't like it, then there's no love lost, and you can just go back and choose something else.

Speaker 1: Now, you're married by this time?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, married and have two children.  And one was in elementary school and the other middle, so it was a--but it was a summer decision.  It wasn't like I was pulling them out of school.  It was a bad enough that we were gonna move, but they weren't being yanked out of school.  So it was a little, it was a little easier.
Speaker 1: Let me interject something here because I didn't ask you earlier.  What is your wife's name and your children's names and when were the born?
Speaker 2: Janice is my wife, and my sons, Aaron, and he was born in 1976, my daughter is Sheena, and she was born in 1980.
Speaker 1: Now, we're gonna have to come back at some point to your son, Aaron, because--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --of his career.  What year did you get married?
Speaker 2: In '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're still in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] at this time?
Speaker 2: Still in Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And still have a, and still-and that's why for the first year of my marriage and young family and all that, I'm like seriously looking for "the" right job.  That was a year, my first, very first day on television, I mean backtrack again--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --was the day my son was born.  He was born in the morning, and I had a TV show to do in the afternoon.  I remember his birth like it was yesterday.  To this day, I can't remember what I did on that show, that day.  I mean it, I just can't remember that.  I guess I had my priorities right.
Story_ID: 95916
Speaker 1: But (laughter), but anyway when I came to Chicago [Illinois], I came about--I had a very interesting news director, the guy who essentially hired me.  His name was Ron Kershaw.  Ron Kershaw, the character that Robert Redford played in the movie about news was modeled after Kershaw.  And it was, I can't think of the actress.  It was TV news and this kind of renegade news director type, and Redford played that role.  And Kershaw had worked in New York [City, New York], and he knew who I was.  I didn't know him, but he knew who--he had seen me.  And he was confident.  He was like, oh, this is gonna be great for you here.  People are gonna love you.  You're fine.  You're gonna be all right.  And then Mayor [Harold] Washington died the next month or so, so it's 1988 [sic, 1987] target.  So I mean I started in, fresh off of that, the Mayor died and reporters were going everywhere.  And he was gonna send me on the street too, to talk to people about reacting.  It was a day, not the day of his death, but the day of the funeral.  So, you know, there are people lined up everywhere.  And I said, I can't go out and talk to people.  They don't know me.  And he said, no, they'll like you.  People will like you.  And I went out, and it was comfortable.  It was all right.  I mean, you know what I mean, for someone new on the scene to not know in a situation like that, could be hard on many levels.  But he had enough insight to know that I could, it would be okay--it was okay.  And I kind of liked that quality about him.  He was really pretty shrewd as a person who could tell what would work and what wouldn't.  But anyway, that was one of the people that made it easier for me to be in Chicago.
Speaker 2: So you come to Chicago and you fall right into the middle of the biggest story, biggest--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --news story in Chicago at that time?
Speaker 1: Yes, and you learn pretty quickly, you know, the atmosphere and the importance of, you know, who's important and why they were important.  And I remember, and then the, just since being here, being around leaders of the city, and I had a lot of experience with Mayor [Richard M.] Daley, just in various ways.  And I remember Eugene Sawyer [HM], and, and I remember all of the councilmen who were vying for the opportunity to be mayor.  So it was all pretty exciting to, you know, a period of time, the first few years I was here.
Story_ID: 95917
Speaker 1: And how did your family feel about leaving New York [City, New York]?  I think you said you had some concerns.  All you knew about Chicago [Illinois] was Al Capone and the cold weather, which is no colder than New York--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, and believe, no.  I mean there are a lot of things that were--I think that's what made it easier.  A lot of things that were like--the first thing that I was struck by was how, to be such a big city, it didn't feel crowded.  And I was struck by that.  Wow, this is really a huge place to be, but doesn't feel like people are on top of you like it does in New York, can feel that way.  And the adjustment was pretty easy.  It really--I never, and it helped too.  I maybe underestimated being familiar to some degree in people's minds because a lot of people could at least say, oh, I know who he is or I've seen him before.  So that counts for a lot too.
Speaker 1: And that's from being on the "Morning Show"?
Speaker 2: Yes, so.  That was one good thing about being exposed that way.  It made it easier to be considered somewhere else if you were choosing to have a job in another town because people would have at least seen you.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us the station that you came to?
Speaker 2: I came to WBBM-TV which was a CBS affiliate in Chicago and worked with Bill Kurtis, and Linda MacLennan was an anchor.  Johnny Morris did sports, and Johnny Morris, being a football fan, was, that was a big deal to me 'cause I remember him from the [Chicago] Bears in '63 [1963] or as a kid, seeing him as a Bear.  And so, Gene Siskel was doing movies reviews, and there were, you know, being a part of that newscast was still like, wow, you know, this is, this is pretty special itself.  You know, here's Bill who had that national exposure, and Gene Siskel from the Siskel and [Roger] Ebert, you know.  You know, here's a former NFL player.  So there were a lot of people there that made it exciting to be around.
Speaker 1: How was WBBM doing in terms of their Chicago market in the ratings?
Speaker 2: I think it was doing, well, it had suffered, and then--it wasn't its absolute hay day.  It was near the end of that 'cause people's careers were not winding down, but late in their career 'cause Walter Jacobson had already had a long run.  And Bill [Kurtis] and Walter had been teamed together for a long time before Bill went to New York and then came back.  So it was established as a real credentialed news station, but there was a lot of competition and it caught up with it, and WLS by then.  Then Oprah [The Oprah Winfrey Show] starts--you know, I think the whole Oprah phenomenon did as much as anything for the ABC station because what seemed to happen is that people turn their TV in the morning and just keep it there, you know, or watch the soaps and everything straight on up to the news.  So that was taking off then.  Oprah was becoming a star.
Speaker 1: Who did you replace?
Speaker 2: I replaced, see, once again, I didn't replace anybody, which--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was, helped smooth it out.  One thing people hate is if they perceive you as taking somebody's job.
Speaker 1: We're gonna get to one of those in a little bit (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.  It was John Coughlin was a weatherman who was about to retire, looking to retire, knowing he was gonna retire.  He was going to do it his way.  And so it was pretty public, and I came in to--and they didn't have a weekend person.  They have sort of rotating weekend guys.  And since my arrangement was so loose, you know, if you like it stay, if not, you don't have to stay, I came in and started doing the weekend.  But eventually taking over where John Coughlin leaves, when he retired.  So it was a pretty smooth transition.  I essentially came into a vacant job 'cause they didn't have a set weekend person, knowing that eventually, I was gonna move over here 'cause the weekday man was gonna retire.
Story_ID: 95918
Speaker 1: What did you know about the Chicago [Illinois] market?  You knew, I mean you hear, you know, WLS is pretty powerful.  Did you know that much about the other stations in Chicago, and what the market was like?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew that BBM [WBBM] had some trouble--some history--they had Harry Porterfield [HM], who I now work with--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who, I knew that they in the minds of many had mishandled how Harry left.  I didn't know what the circumstances were, but I knew that it was ugly.  And so part of that transition here was trying to do something to get that audience back.  They weakened it, image hit, because, now, you know, if people perceive that you did somebody wrong, and they leave you, that's tough to do.  So part of the company's mission was to do something about that, to try to--and, you know, like it was never said to me.  But I'm sure that I was part of the reasoning in terms of trying to warm it up again, warm it up in the sense of getting people that may be likeable to come and fill the void.
Speaker 1: Were there any other African Americans at WBBM when you came in?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, John Davis [HM] was a reporter, Dorothy Tucker [HM], Lester Holt was here.  I'm trying to think of who else I'm leaving off, but those were the main three, Dorothy, Lester, John Davis--
Speaker 1: Was Monroe Anderson [HM] there?
Speaker 2: Monroe Anderson, but Monroe was sort of wearing two hats 'cause he was in management, in public affairs and also doing programming too.  Johnathan Rodgers [HM] is the general manager, and some writers as well who were African American, but nobody, I don't think there was anybody on a daily basis, other than Lester [Holt], Lester being a, anchored one of the shows, and then I was on an every day face.
Story_ID: 95919
Speaker 1: And you say you started out on the weekends.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: When did you get to the weekday?
Speaker 2: Maybe about a year later, after I got here and shared that with Harry Volkman who, one thing about it is if you are new to a place, part of succeeding is if it's perceived that the people around you think you're okay, that people already like--
Speaker 1: So peer acceptance is important?
Speaker 2: And you knowing that.  Like if I go on the air, and you've been a long-time loyal viewer of Harry, and Harry's been doing the weather for 25 years.  If I think Harry thinks you're okay, then you must be okay.  I mean I think it's, because people can tell.  We had a disservice done to a guy--give you an example of this.  A guy came in from Minneapolis [Minnesota] to do the weather, had been a huge success there, came--and his whole performance was out of the studio, but on a garden, on a rooftop garden.  I mean this is the way he did weather in Minneapolis and outdoors all the time, away from the set.  But that was the, here we are outside.  And he would describe the weather.  But he was outside.  He came to town, and they didn't change that.  They put him on the rooftop, never physically near the anchors or me or Harry.  So, we didn't really know him, and it, and it wasn't encouraged by management that we need to know him.  And that was the worse they could do.  If the people watching felt they don't know him, why do I need to know him?  And so it's really the phenomenon of what works and what doesn't.  Tom Snyder who had a famous talk show for a long time, gets hired to do the news in New York, anchoring every day.  He said he knew on the trip from the airport to the TV station that he was doomed to fail by the first billboard, he said--he saw.  And on that billboard was his picture and the words were "Now, New York's got the best".  Well, people will tell you who they think the best is.
Speaker 1: And how do you live up to that?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right, right.  We'll decide who's the best.  So, knowing what works and what doesn't is really hard to get your hands on.  But when you know that, I know enough to know that if I'm on the set and people like you a lot and know who you are, and you, in your actions, tell 'em--I once had a news director, and I think it's a lot of truth to this saying, people are gonna learn more about who you are when you're not talking.  I said, what?  He said it.  When you're on the set, people will know more about who, the kind of person you are by how you react to other people, not so much--you can sit there talk all day long about how wonderful you are, but they'll determine that by your behavior in the way that they, you know, they see you deal with people and treat people.  And here's another one too, gathered everybody into his office, "Everybody in my office right now.  I don't care whether you do the, you know, the Sunday morning religious show or the top anchor, everybody in here now, got some important line to give you.  I'm gonna say it once.  You can write it down if you want."  Always remember this--and I've never forgotten it, "It's tough, but this is the breaks and this is the way it is.  You ready?  Always remember this "You are who you appear to be so be who you appear to be."  What?  When you leave this building, you asked for it.  The folks at home didn't.  You asked for this.  When you leave this building, you'd better be who you say you are.
Speaker 1: So you have to take the same personality--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --out of the building.
Speaker 2: --because that spreads like tissue paper.  I can name instances where I've seen somebody that I know from the media do something that wasn't, was contrary to the kind of person I think they are.  I'm gonna tell everybody I know about that.  I don't know care how many ads you have on TV talking about how great the guy is.  If I'm outside and do something really negative in the mall to somebody, tell them to get away from me and get out of my face, that person's gonna tell everybody they know about that experience.  And it's not their fault.  Look if I didn't feel like going to the mall that day and being bothered, that's on me.  Stay home.  But, you know what I mean.  So that's part of the, of the experience of being--people who are wise about the importance of behavior should know that.  It's just like, I think all of--whether you want to or not, you know, I'm a role model.  Some people say, I'm not a role model.  I didn't ask to be a role model.  You shouldn't be getting that for me.  To tell the truth--
Speaker 1: Charles Barkley?
Speaker 2: Charles, right.  The truth is, that's just the way it is.  I mean you are in a situation where people will look at you and kids will look at you, and they will see what you do.  And that's part of your responsibility.  You may not ask for it, but that's tough.
Story_ID: 95920
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your first year in Chicago [Illinois].  Who were you teamed up on your, when you start doing the weekday news?
Speaker 2: Bill and Walter, Bill Kurtis and Walter Jacobson, and they were the first anchors that I had worked with that made it so conversational.  You know, news used to be pretty straightforward.  And what do you have, you know.  And here, and what do you have.  And they sort of talked to each other throughout the newscast and lead to you by sort of conversationally, which was hard to do.  But people who are really the best sort of have that quality, being able to be conversational about it.
Speaker 1: So what kind of personalities did they have?  Were they easy to get along with?
Speaker 2: Yes, I mean they were who they appeared to be (laughter).  Walter was, you know, really intense and typing at his, typing at his typewriter and getting perspectives together and sort of angry at some issue, and Bill was more relaxed and easy going.  And they played, I think they played off of each other so well.  And they create the--the couple anchors, I think the best ones I've ever worked with, and I've worked with a lot of good people, Maury [Povich] and Bill [Kurtis].  And you know, why, Maury Povich was an incredible anchor.  He told me something long ago that is one of the keys, that if I'm on the set with you, and you are a reporter, and I am an anchor, there's no way I'm gonna look good unless I do everything I can to make you look good.  And it's about making the package the best it can as opposed to being selfish about it.
Story_ID: 95921
Speaker 1: Now, tell me a little bit about, you're doing the weather, what is the technology in terms of weather reporting at this time?
Speaker 2: Well, it's very--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I mean your first year (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I mean we've got all sorts of real help.  You know, when I first started we were putting magnets on the board and clouds of suns and everything was pretty much broad, you know, like a broad area of rain will be here and then broad area moves here.  And now things are so localized and the computer has done everything to make it so different, you know.  You, you're not--and the speed of--the speed and the accuracy of the projections that you make, those are--I can look at, I can go to work now and look at a 48-hour computer model and what this particular model is saying the next two days are gonna be like.  And it'd almost be on the money in terms of the hour that--it'll show me that Tuesday night at 11:00, this area is gonna move right into Northeastern Illinois, and more often than not, the next 24 hours, you can be in the 90's percent for accurate.  I mean it's--the guesswork is practically gone.  They're so sophisticated now.
Speaker 1: What was your biggest weather story the first year you were in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, I, and maybe it wasn't the first year, but I was the first reporter on the scene with the Plainfield [Illinois] tornadoes.  I happened to have been in Oak Lawn [Illinois] doing something else, doing a story--it was a very, very hot day.  And we were talking about people who have strange jobs on hot days, and these were guys that worked in refrigerators all day with coats on, like meat lockers, trying to protect the meat or whatever, and it was like a hundred degrees outside.  And then I got word something happened in, around Joliet.  Can you get there?  And we got in the car, and we went out to a field, and it was commotion , and I, you know, 10 or 11 people out talking to each other in a frantic way.  What happened?  Tornado, and it went that way.  And the person pointed, and when he pointed, it was almost textbook.  Tornadoes tend to move on diagonal lines.  And it was from like North--it was moving from like Northwest to--Southwest to Northeast, Southwest to Northeast.  And we just followed the destruction.  It started getting worse and worse.  We saw some trees down, and we followed the line and then saw some rooftops gone, saw buildings just leveled.  So it was those Plainfield tornadoes and the toughest part of it was what the National Guard had to do that night, and they were, not afraid, but they were troubled.  One of 'em said to me, you know, I gotta go out there now in that field and look around, and I don't know what I'm gonna find there.  But it was the aftermath of that tornado that was probably the biggest--I've gone to two tornado scenes, not during the midst of the tornado, but here and in Utica [Illinois], there was some big tornadoes, more recent than Plainfield.  But those were the big--and I've had a couple all night, gotta stay, be in the station, blizzard episodes.  I'd much rather have a blizzard than the severe weather.  Severe is quicker, happens and ends quicker, but much more frightening because of the possibility.
Speaker 1: You know, that Plainfield tornado, do you remember what year that was?
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety [1990], I believe.
Speaker 1: There were a lot of casualties--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Over a hundred people?
Speaker 2: Yes, 'cause it wasn't just Plainfield.  It was Crest Hill [Illinois] and maybe parts of Joliet [Illinois].  But I'm, but it was, it was pretty devastating.
Story_ID: 95922
Speaker 1: We were just talking about Plainfield [Illinois], but I wanted to jump back for a minute.  Mike Douglas, what do you remember about him?
Speaker 2: That was just an eye opener every day.  I even remember the stars that would be a part of the store or that you'd see show up in person.  And the biggest reaction from fans waiting outside for a limo to pull up and for this star to get out, that I've ever seen.  I remember Mike Douglas had athletes and singers and actors.  This star got the biggest reaction from the most people that I'd ever seen, and you'd never guess who it was.  It might make sense when I tell you, but it was Jimmy Stewart.  But, you know, he'd have more popular people than that, but nobody touched as many people, I guess, you know, with "It's a Wonderful Life" and movies that, you know--you had little kids and old ladies, just screaming because Jimmy Stewart was there.  But that was a wonderful place to see all types of entertainers, Sammy Davis and, I mentioned Tony Bennett, and, you know, Peter Frampton, I remember.  I remember Billy Carter.
Story_ID: 95923
Speaker 1: Let's go back to your experience at WBBM.  You've been here a couple of years.  You've covered a couple of big stories and surveyed the Plainfield tornado.  What was happening at the station around this time?  Johnathan Rodgers [HM] has left by now?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can't--Johnathan stayed for several years at the station.  Bill [Kurtis] was firmly back.  Lester [Holt] is there.  The crew was pretty set for a while.  There wasn't too much change, but a lot of the change at that station was on the management end, where if you have revolving anything, it's not good, whether it's revolving personalities or revolving folks in charge, you're gonna suffer.  And we went through some rocky periods of several GMs [General Managers] in a row, which is never good.  And I don't know how I managed to sustain--I, people ask me, how did you manage to stay so long?  And my philosophy about staying somewhere is that I'm really like conscious of it, but I don't ever play politics.  I don't ever align myself with who I think is in power at the time.  I always try to stay focused on doing my job, doing it well, doing it for the people watching me, as opposed to those who may be running a place, and you just hope the rest of it falls in line.  But I've seen people align themselves too closely thinking that they are, they have an "in" if they butter themselves up to whoever seems to be running the place.  And then that person goes, and then you are looked as, oh, you're so and so's guy, and then you've gotta go too.  I'm, I was never affiliated with any one person.
Story_ID: 95924
Speaker 1: Now, while you're at WBBM, you're doing other things besides the news.  What were some of those other things that you were doing--I mean besides the weather?  What are some of the other programs that you're doing during this period?
Speaker 2: Everybody remembers "Sunday with Steve Baskerville".  Well, it was a short lived, but fun sort of public affairs, entertainment show.  It aired on Sunday morning, but, for instance, I'd have Ramsey Lewis on.  And he'd have his trio.  And they'd perform and talk.  So it wasn't all conversation.  Or I'd have a psychic on.  I had a coffee psychic on.  This woman would read how your cream swirls in your coffee, as if that tells you something.  And you know who got excited about that, I love it.  I had this coffee psychic on, and I get a call one day with a very pleasant, urgent voice.  "Steve, gotta give me the number of that psychic.  My wife's got to see who this is.  She wants to get in touch with her."  You know who it was?  Ernie Banks [HM].  (Laughter) And I was so flattered that he called, but it was, I mean it was a fun show.  You know, where are you gonna see a coffee psychic.
Speaker 1: How did that show come about?
Speaker 2: I wasn't doing the 10:00 o'clock news then.  I was doing the 5:00 o'clock--I'm sorry.  I was doing the 10:00 o'clock news, but I wasn't doing one of the early newscast, so I just, it was something else to do, that I had time to do.  And we did it every Thursday.  We taped the show every Thursday, and it aired every Sunday, "Sunday Morning with Steve".  I would eventually maybe like to get back into something like that.
Speaker 1: Oh, you would?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 95925
Speaker 1: What were some of the non-weather productions that you did?
Speaker 2: Did, well, I would do, some of the most enjoyable programming or broadcasts for me is to be around people.  I still like to be around people.  That, you miss that when you work in the studio.  When you go long periods of time in the studio, just doing a weathercast, you're not really physically near anybody.  But I used to do segments called "Best of Chicago" [Chicago, Illinois] where I'd go out--I'd ask folks at home to give us, where can you get the best hot dog?  Where can you, what's the best theater?  I think, or, and it wouldn't just be the best of it.  We'd go around on recommendation and highlight places and it was really more about the people you find there than the actual building or actual food that you'd find, people having fun, being labeled the "best" of whatever.  And so I would do those running features from time to time and various live shots that were not necessarily related to weather, but celebrating whatever occasion it would be.
Speaker 1: Were there any other ones?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think of, not here, not at WBBM.  It was the "Sunday Show".  It was the feature reporting, sometimes just taking weather on the road and being out before the 4th of July or Labor Day or whatever big celebration was about to occur.  One of the memorable weeks I had was, we used to have a show called "First Edition".  And you take, it was a pretty loose newscast, and I'd co-anchored that show.  Lester Holt got sick.  Lester--it must have been something bad to keep Lester from being on TV, but Lester, for some reason, could not make it.  And it was one of those things where they looked at me to co-anchor.  I'd never co-anchored anything ever, but I, we did that program at the old Marshall Fields, near the tree in the Walnut Room around the holidays, and it was a lot of fun to be on location.  I used to do, for one year at the Taste of Chicago, I did a whole series of shows live with grand stands at the Taste.  And we'd have people come on and perform who would ever be performing that week at the Taste [Taste of Chicago], would come on that program.  And we had a live audience and that was pretty-
Speaker 1: [OFF-CAMERA VOICE]:  (Unclear].
Speaker 2: That was pretty cool to get a chance to do some programming as well.
Speaker 1: Were there any other ones?
Speaker 2: Not that I can think of here, probably 2:00 in the morning.
Speaker 1: And that was in Chicago?
Speaker 2: No, I said, I'm gonna think of it at 2:00 in the morning and call you.
Speaker 1: Oh (laughter).
Speaker 2: But I (laughter), I can't, would like to in the future.
Story_ID: 95926
Speaker 1: What would be your ideal show like that, if you could put together anything you wanted?
Speaker 2: I would do, I would do a show that involves some conversation, but, and exposing talent.  I like to see talented people perform, and why they do--and where it came from.  I remember talking to Smokey Robinson once about where his songs from.  And it's just kind of cool to hear it, you know.  He said something like, he would go sometimes to Tiger games with his father, to see the Detroit Tigers play.  And they were awful, and it wouldn't be many people in the stands.  But he'd look, and he'd see situations in the stands, like it might be cold.  And he'd see two, he'd see a couple under a blanket.  And it looked romantic, and he'd say, he'd be thinking of song lyrics while he was at a Tiger's game, unrelated to the "Oh, Baby, Baby" or something.  But I just like, almost what this experience is like.  I like knowing where people come from and where they get ideas for what they do and then maybe let, letting 'em perform too.  So I like performance and getting to know somebody.
Story_ID: 95927
Speaker 1: You kind of have a reputation for liking to get out among people.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know, just I've always sort of been depicted as a people person.  That is really, when you think about it, a weathercast is a real people-oriented segment of a newscast period.  And that's where people are gonna identify with whoever is presenting it more than any other part of the show.  And then so, you've gotta be able to appeal to everybody.  Whether you're eight or 88, you wanna know what the weather is gonna be like.  And it's just, I think part of it is some of the experience.  My background from the old days, I learned from people who were real show folks, like one of my mentors that I did the weather with several times.  Remember Willard Scott?  Willard Scott was a real people person, and whenever Willard would come to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], we would do the weather outdoors together.  And, people near us, and I had not done that before.  And he just showed me, hey, it's about the people, and it's about the experience of, you know, everybody's got a story, everybody.  And if you talk to 'em long enough, you're gonna hear something funny or interesting or it is fun to be around people.
Story_ID: 95928
Speaker 1: So I started appreciating being around people, almost as much fun as when I did the weather with Rick James once.  That was a--
Speaker 2: What was that experience?
Speaker 1: He stood beside me, and he looked up, and he said, "It's gonna be a funky night."  And I'll never forget that.  That was great.  He was great.  He lived in Buffalo [New York], and talked about how boring it was there (laughter).  And he couldn't wait to get away from Buffalo.  This was near the very beginning of his career.  I think he had had a hit, and it wasn't Rick James, big Rick James at that point.
Speaker 2: One of the things you keep saying you like is the experience you have meeting people who have, you know--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --if you had to name three people, who would be the three most interesting people you've ever met?
Speaker 1: Okay, wow, interesting people.  Well, I'll tell you, I was around to witness--and once, again, you sort of learn more about a person when they're not on the air than you do any other time.  And when [President] Bill Clinton  and when [Albert Gore, Jr.] Gore and [Michael] Dukakis, they were all sort of running for the--the primary, I guess.  They were all running for the same office.  And they all came in to debate.  And you could tell when you saw Clinton and Gore, individually, that wow, these guys are very personable and very, you know (laugher), they had "it", whatever that "it" is, they made an impression pretty quickly.  And then at another setting, I got to meet them.  All the weathercasters from across the country were invited to the White House to hear Al Gore's presentation on global warming and presented with a panel of experts who were gonna tell us the latest about what they thought would happen.  And we went, I mean everybody, Al Roker and Jerry Taft, from here in Chicago, and a--people from everywhere.  It was like a weatherman's convention.  And we all go to the White House, and individually, President Clinton and Vice President Gore talked to us, and they talked to us for 45 minutes as a group, cue card and paper nowhere, and I think we were awestruck by how easily they handled it and how conversational they were and how they made it seem like they were just sort of thinking of what they were saying.  I mean those just qualities--and you could see how people are electable.  It's almost like, you know, President [Barack] Obama [HM], I had met years ago for just when, you know, it's true that he likes to work out and play basketball.  I met him at a health club.  Maybe he was a lawyer then, maybe not yet holding any kind of office or running for office.  What an easygoing, conversation, smart guy this was.  He had "it", whatever that "it" was.  It was impressive, and that was just somebody that was a familiar face at a health club that you knew could be whatever he wanted to be success wise.  Ted Williams, and I have photo of that.  That was great.  I mean Ted Williams, one of the greatest ballplayers is standing at the batting cage in Florida, and goes, hey, there's my weatherman and points to me.  And I come around, and there's press all around, wanting to talk to him.  He singled me out, pulled me over and we're just talking 'cause he liked fishing, and he always wanted to know what the weather would be like 'cause he was a fisherman.  And he's talking to me, it's like, really?  So what do you think about--oh, man, that guy can hit.  And then he'd comment here and there about certain ballplayers.  And I'm standing, going, wow, I'm standing beside Ted Williams (laughter), talking, casually talking.  And Henry Kissinger wanted to do the weather once.  I wonder if I could do that [in Kissinger accent].  And was, I don't know whether he was joking or not, but that would have been interesting to have seen him do the weather.  All types of famous people, to see them in a natural setting has been one of the greatest gifts of this career and ones I've been exposed to though.

Speaker 1: Talking about career accomplishments, you've won a number of Emmys.  What was your first one?  And what was it for?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I've won nine Emmys.
Speaker 1: We're gonna go through each one (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I can't remember.  I can't remember what three quarters of 'em are for.  But, you know, I'm, we're proud of those, but that's not what I'm most proud of.  Long ago, when I was first starting out and first made the transition into a children's show, I won the box.  And it was a little plastic--you know, I think there were two or three people that year that were given these.  What's so nice about it, is that with the Emmys, you assemble your best work, you hand it in, among others, and people vote, like, oh, I like his the best.  You know what I mean, and then you're--with this Box from "Action for Children's Television".  It was an organization that would safeguard the kind of programming the kids would watch and let folks know they were doing a good job with the kind of shows that they were producing.  Well, they were--
Speaker 1: This is in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: This was in Phila [Philadelphia]--but it was a national award.  The year, we, as a group, and the staff I worked with, our children's show won one.  NBC, as a network, had won one.  So it was, and I think another station from another part of the country had won one.  So they weren't--the beauty of it was that you--unsolicited.  You had no idea you were chosen.  You were chosen because we scoured and looked for you.  So I got, and I got what was called "The Box" from Action for Children's Television.  But the Emmy is, and that was the first one years ago, award like that, but the Emmy is also very special because you do work hard during the course of a year.  I got one for--got several for weather casting, and another for the program that I did, that "Sunday with Steve" show, won an Emmy, and the "Best of" series, where I used to go out and look for the best of whatever, got an Emmy.  So for the kind of work that I've done in Chicago [Illinois], through the years, each thing at one point has gotten an Emmy which is really nice, I mean each way of expressing myself, whether it was in the weathercast, whether it was in the feature series or whether it was the "Sunday Show", each one, at various times got Emmys.  It's kind of nice.
Story_ID: 95930
Speaker 1: Now, you've also, I guess--and I didn't know this, that weathermen get certified in certain areas, and you also went to down to, what, Mississippi State?  What--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, but that was--
Speaker 1: --was that about?
Speaker 2: It was long distance online, is the bulk of it where you get a CD, you get a series of CDs and you meet your--your instructor exists.  You have to go eventually to Mississippi.  It's all part of Mississippi State University, and I don't know exactly how Mississippi State wound up as the school of choice or "the" school, but that's where the [American Meteorological Society] AMS seals come from.  You go through their program of meteorology.  It's like a, it's like a refresher course, really.  But it's intense.  It's like two years of it.  And you've got courses that you take, and you take 'em online, and you take timed tests along the way, leading to the, leading to the certificate.
Speaker 1: Tell us what AMS is?
Speaker 2: American Meteorological Society.  And you don't have to be given, you don't have to have that seal, but if you go through a program like that, and you get it, you like to show you've got it.  So you'll see various newscasts where you'll see that the person's got a seal, 'cause they went through the program or a program like that.
Story_ID: 95931
Speaker 1: Tell me, you know, you mentioned when you were in the White House that Clinton [President Bill Clinton] and Gore [Vice President Al Gore] were talking about global warming.  And there's been a lot of controversy in the last, you know, few years about whether or not it really exists.  What are your thoughts on that?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's real.  It really exists, first of all, because and what we learned from that experience, just when we were listening to what the latest or what some of the thinking was about global warming, they told us way back then that, hey, it may not be getting warmer like you think of it getting warmer every day, but expect more extremes to occur, heat waves, hotter, snow episodes, snowier, dry spells, longer lasting.  You know, things will be more extreme.  And it seems like weather in the past five to 10 years has had its share of extremes, you know, the extremely devastating hurricanes or extreme drought.  You know, last year's weather, everything was extreme.  You know, we went--by March last year, we had had a whole slew of 90 degree days.  It was on its way to being record dry across a good deal of the country, extreme.  You know the extremes are there, and we are contributing to it.  So, I mean in my opinion, I think that it's real, and we as a big, collective "we" ought to be thinking about what we can do because it's, you know, it's not that farfetched that, you know, people may be coming up here in winters to get mild weather (laughter).  Who knows, 50 years from now?
Speaker 1: Why do you think there's a small pocket of people who don't accept this, and don't believe it's real and there's so much resistance to it, particularly in Congress?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, 'cause that's it, politics.  And it's, it's almost like, whatever stance you take on it, you know, let's folks know where you're coming politically, you know, just by the attitude you take about it.  And, but I, I don't know why--I mean you'll hear the argument that it's all cycles.  Well, we weren't around 400,000 years ago.  The same thing happened then.  You know, you'll hear people say something like that.  I don't know what the answer is, and I don't know what would change minds like that.  It's all rooted deeply in politics so.
Story_ID: 95932
Speaker 1: Are you a member of the National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I wanna talk to you just for a few minutes about some issues or controversies that have come up in Chicago [Illinois] over the last few years involving African Americans on TV.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Harry Porterfield [HM].  What did you know about that situation before you came to Chicago?  That was 1985.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, well, all I knew and what I knew was that, you know, Harry was a long time staple at BBM [WBBM], and I don't know whether he was anchoring long before, in the position that he had before he was taken off the newscast.  And I think, it might have been--was it Bill Kurtis that when he came back, took Harry's spot?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then Harry left to go to Channel 7 or ABC.
Speaker 1: And Operation PUSH (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And Operation PUSH was very vocal about--I think they tried to get his job back?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: But there was certainly a reaction to that, that was felt, New York wide too.  So I'm sure that's why Johnathan came, Johnathan Rodgers [HM] and others came to try to rectify that situation and make it, you know, make it seems as if the station was listening and trying to make moves to--because not that long after that, Lester Holt was hired as a--and if it did anything, it got more African American faces visible.  It got, you lost, but it awakened people, and those in charge, at least made more of an effort to get black faces upfront again.
Speaker 1: Did you--were you concerned at all about coming to Chicago when you heard about this?
Speaker 2: Not because of that, because--well, not--I think there was some distance between me being there 'cause I came a good half year later maybe which is, was some distance.  It wasn't like I was a reaction to that exactly.  And I wasn't really that concerned about it.  I was probably thinking more inwardly about any move I made being a good one, whether it was Chicago or not.  But it was, I didn't want to come into a hot bed of controversy, and it wasn't by the time I got here.
Speaker 1: All right, 1993, Dorothy Tucker [HM], PUSH gets involved in her, I guess, it was a contract renewal issue, and she's a WBBM at this time.  What was the feeling and atmosphere at that time, and--
Speaker 2: Oh, boy, I don't remember, you know, Dorothy--see, I knew that my feeling was that Dorothy was too rooted there to be fooled with for too long, you know, to ultimately lose.  And I think there're probably others that felt that way, that--and the station couldn't afford to have in that short of, relatively short amount of time, another episode where you're gonna lose somebody of color, whether or not a whole lot anyway, over something that could be smoothed over or rectified.
Speaker 1: And PUSH came in on that one also.
Speaker 2: And PUSH came in.  I don't remember PUSH being quite as, I don't think that lasted quite as long, and it was, it ended pretty quickly.
Story_ID: 95933
Speaker 1: Also, in 1993, Jim Tilmon [HM] is replaced, and I guess he was at WLS.  What were your thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: He was--
Speaker 1: I mean he was almost an icon in Chicago television.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was at MAQ [WMAQ]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at the time.  And I remember he had a huge celebration of his career.  And I think that--what I remember most of that episode is that probably folks didn't realize how much he meant to the journalism community, you know, 'cause people turned out in droves a couple of times.  There was one--remember, you know, and a couple sort of "good-bye" celebrations.  And he sort of, and then not long after that, you know, he came back to BBM [WBBM] and worked 'cause I worked with Jim for several years over at BBM.  So the most fun that I've had.
Speaker 1: What kind of personality was he?
Speaker 2: Ah, just--you know, a real--he was somebody who could really tell you how to--and there weren't many situations he hadn't seen in terms of just keeping your job, reading people, a real people person first of all.  He had that element about him of knowing what he was talking about and liking people and it showed.  And he was really easygoing.  His style was very gentlemanly, and I really liked that the most about Jim, unruffled was maybe the best way that I could describe him.  He was really pretty steady.  And I liked, I mean we would just have kind of, you know, he was older than I am, and more experienced, and I would just, just sort of listen to his stories, I mean 'cause he could tell you stories from his flying days, to his TV days.  It was more than just TV, you know.  He had this whole background as a pilot, and then the service too.  So he was a storyteller.
Story_ID: 95934
Speaker 1: We were just talking about some of the controversies that happened in Chicago [Illinois] over the few years involving African Americans in the Chicago market.  The last person I wanted to ask you about is Felicia Middlebrooks [HM].  She was on WBBM radio, and there were some, a controversy involving her.  Were you aware of that one?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I heard--now, for instance, with Jim Tilmon [HM], I think Jim's was just as much age related, you know, where, you know, it's one of those classic cases where we're gonna get the younger guy and the younger guy is gonna come in and we're gonna, you know, replace this guy, just my impression of what it was.  And it kind of woke everybody up when they realized, okay, Jim may be older, but people love this guy, and they still turn out for this guy.  And that's what eventually got Jim his, a job back 'cause he worked again after that.  And with Felicia, I think Felicia's was a lot related to contract and money and being compensated for what she thought was fair.  I was told long ago by the first woman, black woman that I worked with--she was an anchor.  There were two--they're all soloed, the big three networks in town in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] soloed.  There were two white males and black woman as a solo anchor at the station where I worked.
Speaker 1: Do you remember her name?
Speaker 2: Beverly Williams.  Beverly worked at CNN for a while too.  And it reminded me of Felicia's situation in a broad sense, general sense, that, you know, Beverly said, you know, it's tough.  They're gonna always try to make you feel like it's so, it's--what a blessing it is for you to be here, how lucky you are.  You're so lucky, just to be sitting in here today with this job.  Well, the truth is, they're lucky to have found you, you know, but they'll never make you feel that way.  And they will always treat you that way, and especially with pay.  I mean 'cause you're lucky to have the job.  Why, you know, that's your pay.  But Beverly then wasn't making what--she was making like maybe half of what those guys were making.  And they were all relatively the same in audience.  One may have been the number one station, but they were all liked.  And then, you know, here's Felicia Middlebrooks, a woman on a hugely successful newscast or news radio, rush hour, you know, morning time slot, it just reminded me of that dilemma that's been around for 35, 40 years, trying to be compensated like the guys.
Story_ID: 95935
Speaker 1: Is there anything else that you would like, that I haven't asked you that you would like to talk about?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.  What time is the dinner that we're gonna have here? (Laughter)  No, I'm kidding.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: What, anything that I haven't hit upon or touched upon?  You know, I didn't name names, I didn't name a whole lot of names, but there's so many people, you know, that, you know, you sit somewhere because other people believed in you.  And there were, there have been heroes and mentors in my life that people will never know.  You know, there was a Lonnie Mitchell.  It's just a name I'm throwing out there.  Lonnie was a, one of the first African American TV sales guys at a television station in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] who was older, somebody I knew in the business.  But he would just take me in his car and go around when he was making calls on some of the--giving me a sense of what the TV world was like or introducing me to people.  He once said to me, you know what?  You're gonna be a star in spite of yourself.  (Laughter) But he, you know, he was just somebody who--there're people along the way that believe that you can do what you see in your head.  And, you know, they're just as valuable as anybody else, you know, as, you know, the number one hero being my mother [Mary Baskerville].  And from all else, everybody else sort of falls into place, just various coworkers and teachers and people that continue to hold you up, and my wife, of course, for all these years.  It's great when you meet somebody, and you tell 'em what you wanna do, and she never laughed or thought it was a pipe dream and stuck throughout all of it.  But I can't think of any other specifics that-
Story_ID: 95936
Speaker 1: For somebody going into this business, what would you tell them about it and what they should do or what advice would you give them?
Speaker 2: Well, if, first of all, if you see it in your head, you can do it.  I mean if you see it.  I really do believe that, and it's an attitude of not--I have been around very talented people, more talented than I am.  But they didn't get the job, keep the job or last in the career because they didn't persevere.  I think perseverance is real underrated.  Somebody told me--and, you know what, I think it might have been Kenny Gamble [HM], with Gamble and Huff [Leon Huff HM].  I saw his photo here.  But, you know, it may have been one of the conversations, and well, I wanna attribute it to him, but he may not have said it, but somebody--you know, when you're looking for a job and looking for, trying to catch on.  You know where the job is?  The job is that last letter you decide not to mail because you've gotten 15 rejections already.  The job is that last phone call you're not gonna make today because you've made 15 other phone calls, and they've all said no.  You have to keep thinking that the job is where that next resume is, that next letter and that next phone call.  And people like--it's easy for people to tell you no.  It's easy to say, no.  So you'll hear, no, a lot.  I mean I have been rejected in my quest to get my foot in the door along the way, but people will tell you, no, just because they don't have time for you.  But it's the not giving up part of it.  That's the hard part.  You gotta keep working at it, like when I was working part time at the VA [Veterans Affairs], sorting people's checks during the day, at night I was still mailing off resumes.  In my spare time, I was making dubs of my voice to send off for voiceover work.  I was working at it.  You just can't sit and hope it happens and hope something--it takes a lot of work to be lucky.
Story_ID: 95937
Speaker 1: Now, your son Aaron [Baskerville] has been fairly successful in this business--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, and he's--
Speaker 1: Talk a little bit about him.
Speaker 2: I never knew he wanted to do it.  But he, and to be in television news 'cause we never--one thing I was always careful about was to separate the two.  I never really talked about it at home.  I always separated work and home, always tried to not bring work home.  But he would come to the station and visit and things like that.  But he's anchoring the CBS station in Grand Rapids [Michigan] and reporting as well.  And he has that job because he wanted an opportunity to anchor.  He had been reporting in Buffalo [New York], and he worked in Lansing, Michigan for a while.  So he's continuing to make a career out of TV news.  Another part of it is, you take the, whatever job is the first one, just take it.  I, he worked first behind the scenes at ESPN.  They have like a, you know, they don't pay much, but you get an opportunity to do various things in the building, you know, for the broadcasts.  You know, my first job was in children's TV, not much future in that, long term, but I got my foot in the door.  So take whatever job you can first in the building and then work from there.
Story_ID: 95938
Speaker 1: What do you still wanna do that you haven't done?
Speaker 2: Retire, kind of.  I don't know.  I mean I think I'd probably like to perform in different ways now, act maybe.  I always, I did for a short while, voiceover work.  That was a lot of fun, character voices for different kinds of programs.  I like to perform in different ways maybe, maybe teach.  I don't know how, but performance would be fun to teach.  You know, I get sometimes CDs from people, I have in the past where they wanna do weather.  And I'll see a disconnected arm pointing to the map.  Well, the map's not the star.  You are.  People will watch you tomorrow, not because of the map, but because of how you're doing it.  So they wanna see you present, I mean just giving it tips or advice.  At the weather channel, the map's the star.  There they wanna see a disconnected arm.  But not when you're trying give the--and even The Weather Channel is changing their approach.  You know, they are becoming more personality driven.  You notice like Al Roker in the morning, and getting to know who the people are that present the weather because that's what keeps people coming back.  They've gotta have some feeling for whoever's in front of it.  So maybe teaching, things like that or consulting.
Story_ID: 95939
Speaker 1: What would be your hopes and dreams for the African American community based upon all your experiences?
Speaker 2: That we continue to think about all the various ways of, you know, not just looking superficially at what is in front, like there are so many important decisions that are made by people you don't see.  And those are the real jobs and careers of value, being decision makers and being those who sit in the room when we decide what should be covered on a daily basis in terms of news 'cause that's just as important as anybody who's in front of the camera, is what they're gonna talk about and what gets presented, and how it's presented.  And so that voice has always gotta be there.  And when that voice is missing, it'll show up in whatever that production is.  So think about some of the less glamorous parts of the business, but very crucial.
Story_ID: 95940
Speaker 1: What would you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well, that he--that I had a joy for what I did and I enjoyed people, and I had a respect for those that were my audience, that I always valued that relationship and was pretty steady.  But for somebody to tell me, boy, he was always steady, that, you know, I never--I always admire people who can be consistent.  And if you can be consistently good or come every day with energy and enthusiasm and it shows, I always admire people who--but I, you know, when I turn on a television, and he may not verbalize it, but you can tell pretty quickly, you know, what makes you stick with that or keep going is if that person seems like he's talking to you.  Some people make you feel like, I don't know who he's talking to, but he's not talking to me.  And I think it's a very personal one-on-one kind of experience, and I always hope that people would feel that kind of comfort when they watched me, not that I have to be comforting, but I always, you know--I put in a lot of work into it.  It takes a lot of work for things to look relaxed (laughter).  So, I don't know what I'm--I just hope that my legacy is that he enjoyed his work.  He was good at his work, and he was someone to model yourself after.  It's a lot of responsibility (unclear).
Speaker 1: Well, we wanna thank you very, very much.  We have just thoroughly enjoyed this, and we hope that you enjoyed it somewhat also.  But this has been a great experience.  And thank you very much for appearing on our--
Speaker 2: I appreciate, and I plan on coming back every Saturday (laughter) and talking some more.  No, really, this is really a great opportunity, and an honor to be included among those who have been interviewed, and to have that kind of interest in someone's background or life is really quite a tribute.  So thank you.

That's my father and mother, the couple in the back row standing, and also my sister is to the far left, sitting.  And there I am right in the middle with my eyes closed as the man took the photo, at about six years old.  And one other person that I have to mention is Grandma Lulu.  She's there right beside my cousin, Debbie.  There's Lula.  I used to sit on the porch with her and rock and look at the people walk by.  That's in Lincolnton, North Carolina, okay.
Speaker 2: That's me and my wife--that's me and Janice in the middle, and my son, Aaron, on the left, and my daughter, Sheena, on the right.  That was at a cruise, I believe.
Speaker 1: Oh, look at that.  It speaks for itself.  That was with Ted Williams.  That was the year that the ball went through the legs of Bill Buckner and the Red Sox, but he was a coach at the time, Ted Williams, talking to me, man.
Speaker 2: That was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], the first time I had my son on the air.  That's him holding the Christmas tree ornament, and me reading a story to the kids.
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know who that gentleman is with me--no, that's the President Bill Clinton at the White House at a conference about Global Warming.
Speaker 2: That's me on the far left getting the key to the city and a send-off from Mayor [Reverend W.] Wilson Goode [HM] in Philadelphia when I went to New York [New York].  And they let me back in, time and time again.
Speaker 1: Wow, that's the fun bunch from WBBM.  The first crew I worked with, Bill [Kurtis] and Linda [McClennon] and Johnny Morris.
Speaker 2: We used to stage productions outdoors to get attention.  This was the corner of 5th and Market in Philadelphia in about 1976, fighting Duane Bobick  with Leslie Uggams as the referee.  It wasn't really fighting though, pretending.
Speaker 1: What an honor this was.  This had to have been around 1990 at the studios of WBBM-TV with Rosa Parks who had come in to be celebrated that night.
Speaker 2: One of the early days of Taste of Chicago and Mayor [Richard] Daley was real excited about it.  And so was I, and that's Michelle Iwokawa (ph.) who was an anchor at the time.
