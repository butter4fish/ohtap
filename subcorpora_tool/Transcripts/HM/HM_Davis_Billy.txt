Story_ID: 180595
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask as kind of a warm-up, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I don't know if I have a favorite food or not right now during this time, but I think I like omelets.

Speaker 2: A favorite, favorite phrase or saying, no, I just, I think my favorite saying is that I have learned to really say is thank the Lord (laughter).  I think that's it, really.
Story_ID: 180596
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  But we'll start with your mother.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Her name is Norris Wilbert Davis, N-O-R-R-I-S, W-I-L-B-E-R-T, D-A-V-I-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, now was her, her maiden name Wilber [sic.]?
Speaker 2: No, I think her maiden name was Oldham.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's spelled, O--
Speaker 2: O-L, I think O-L-D-H-A-M.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is there a story behind your mother's name, Norris Wilber.  It doesn't really sound like a typical female name.
Speaker 2: If it is a story, I don't really know it.  My mother was raised by her grandmother, so it's, it's a lot of, of, of history that, that went on between my mother and, and her, and her grandmother, and her mother, so it's a lot of stuff that, that, that we didn't get a chance, even though we knew them, we didn't get a chance to know all of the details of what was going on during that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was your mother--what, what, what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: So, yeah, I asked you your, your mother's date of birth and place of birth.
Speaker 1: July 12th, 1913, in St. Louis, Missouri.
Speaker 2: Okay, now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them, and what were they doing?  Were they, are they--is there history, you know, just in St. Louis [Missouri], or is there a story about their history being someplace else?
Speaker 1: On my mother's side of the family, I think that, as far as I know, that, that the history of her family is just in St. Louis.  She was raised by her, her grandmother.  And, and her grandmother worked for a family.  And so that's basically it.  And I know her grandmother, her grandmother took care of us when we were born, you know, helped her to help raise some of us.  And, and her, my mother's mother [Ruby Oldham], was, I would say was a dancer.  But we didn't really know her when we were young, but, but, but we knew of her.  But we didn't really associate with her that much 'cause she was always away.  And, and so we didn't really know that much about her until later in our lives when she started to stay at us, stay with us later.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So your mother was a dancer I guess--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, my, her mother--
Speaker 2: Yeah, your mother's mother.
Speaker 1: --my mother's mother, yeah, right, was a dancer.
Speaker 2: So your grandmother, but you were, your mother was raised by her grandmother, right?
Speaker 1: No, my--yeah, exactly right, my mother was raised by her grandmother, right.
Story_ID: 180597
Speaker 1: And so your grandmother [Ruby Oldham] was, was the dancer.  And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --did you know where she danced or if she was any, with any groups or--
Speaker 2: No, that, that, that, that we didn't know because all we would know is that her name was Ruby.  And all we would know is that when we seen her, she was, she was a little, she was a little hot on the sauce, especially being in the entertainment business.  And every time we'll see her, she, she wouldn't be dancing somewhere, but she would always say I will dance again, you know, so that's--but she was a sweet lady, but I think she was a little, little mixed up, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this, but entertainment is--I mean, life in St. Louis [Missouri], St. Louis was a big, was a big music town then--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and still is, I guess, and it's home of Josephine Baker.
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: She, she, she'd have been a contemporary of your, of your grandmother.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you know the story on Josephine Baker, Josephine Baker couldn't, couldn't get arrested, you know, in, in, in, in the United States, so she decided to, to leave the country and then went to, went to, went to France and became a big star there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and what you're saying is that her, whatever the talent she had, they weren't really appreciated in St. Louis [Missouri] so much or, or in the United States.
Speaker 2: Exactly right.  And, and she had talent, a lot of talent, but it was a lot of actors and actresses whose talent wasn't appreciated during those years.  But they all had to, to, to make a way.  Even though their talent wasn't appreciated, they were still entertainers.  They were still, that's what they, that was their passion.  That's what they knew to do.  And so a lot of us, a lot of us was like a dream deferred.  You know, it was, it was, it was just all a dream but something that couldn't be fulfilled at that particular time, just like a lot of the baseball players and stuff during that time.  But a lot of, a lot of 'em were fortunate enough to be able to get away and, and do something like Paul Robeson, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: So your mother's [Norris Oldham Davis] contemporaries would, I mean, Scott Joplin would have been a little bit too, too earl--I mean of your, your grandmother's contemporary, I guess.  I guess she would have been born on, what, about turn of the century or something, your, your, your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Yes, I would say or right before--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --before the turn of the century, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So in 18, in 1890?
Speaker 2: Yeah, somewhere around in there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so this is--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --this places her around that time, you know, of Scott Joplin, I guess, and St. Louis Blues and all that--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --talk--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was interesting.  I did--well, I was so young.  I wasn't even born during that time, but that was, when you hear the stories about the things that was happening during that time, it was you, you, you could, you could believe 'em because some of the stuff that, that was happening you grew up, I grew up in too, you know.  But, thank God some of the things were changing.  During those years they were starting to change, a little bit better.
Speaker 1: Now were there, was there a black entertainment district that, that your, your, your grandmother was involved, you know, around when she performed in--
Speaker 2: Now that--
Speaker 1: --St. Louis [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: [Nodding no.]
Speaker 1: I, I know there's got to be.  I just don't the name of it.  But, but in Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: It could have been.
Speaker 1: --you know they had the Regal Theater [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and Boogie Nightclub [Rhumboogie Cafe, Chicago, Illinois] and all those different things.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But in St. Louis [Missouri] where was the venues?
Speaker 2: St. Louis [Missouri] had a lot of clubs.  You know, they didn't have theaters, you; they had a lot of clubs and jazz clubs and, and, and what you call juke joints and stuff like that, where people would dance and, and sing and play.  And you take like a lot of people in St. Louis would go to East St. Louis, across the river, and they had, where they had gambling and all kind of stuff going on and had a lot of clubs over there.  So a lot of the entertainers would leave St. Louis and go to East St. Louis and perform, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, so your, your grandmother your saying, did she spend most of her time in St. Louis, or was she on the road?
Speaker 2: As far, as far as I know she--'cause I was so young that I, I just remember her being in St. Louis.  I didn't know, really, that much about her history as far as what she did, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 180598
Speaker 1: Okay, and now did your mother [Norris Oldham Davis] know her father, her, your, your, your grandfather?  Did, did she, was she raised--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: --around him?
Speaker 2: --don't know.  I don't think that she knows her father, you know.  And I think that--I'm, I'm trying to think what was the story.  It, that, that her father was, just disappeared or something.  He, he left, he left her mother, and so she never really, really talked about her father, and we never really knew him.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, now did your mother, she was raised by her grandmother, so, and you, and her, so this is your great-grandmother?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --on my mother's side, right.
Speaker 1: Right.  And, and she worked for a family--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in St. Louis [Missouri], right.
Speaker 2: A very wealthy family, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You, you know their names?
Speaker 2: No, I don't (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, these, often these names really tell the story too, you know--
Speaker 2: I know it.
Speaker 1: --who they actually were--
Speaker 2: --I know it, I know it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I might be able to find it out for you, but I don't know it right now--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --right off the top of my head, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, so what did your grand--what did your mother say about growing up in, in St. Louis?  What was it like for her?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother, unfortunately, she ended up having children very young.  And she ended up with two, two sons and before she got married.  And my father [William Davis, Sr.], my father, who raised her two sons, married her.  But my father knew their father, and my--and their, their fath--their father told my father, said I know you're in love with Norris.  He said why don't you go on to marry her?  'Cause she's a sweet woman; she's a good woman, and she needs to be taken care of.  I can't do it, you know.  So my father married her and, and raised her two sons along with five other children.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so did your mother do anything other than, you know, serve as a housewife, or did she--
Speaker 2: No, she, her, most of her life was just home, home keeping, yeah, and just keeping the house--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and trying to keep up with seven children, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now did she have any theatrical talent at all?
Speaker 2: Who, my mother?
Speaker 1: Yeah, couldn't she sing or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --or dance or anything?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No.  My mother, the only time my, my, my, my mother would sing, I'd have to catch her in the kitchen.  You'd have to sneak up on her.  She'd be in there singing--[mimicking singing]--little high voice.  And you'd walk in, and as soon as she knew you're in there she'd stop, just like that.  She would, she didn't let, want nobody to hear her sang.  I, I never saw--why don't you, why don't you continue?  She said no, I, no, I can't do it, I can't do it.  I don't know why, you know, but that was her, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now did she have a chance to finish high school or, or anything--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: As far as I know, I don't know, you know.  I don't know if she really finished high school or--
Speaker 1: 'Cause you said she had children early, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she had children early, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I think she probably was about thirteen or fourteen years old when she first had her first child, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 180599
Speaker 1: Let's go to your father.  Can you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name is William Davis, Sr.
Speaker 1: Right, exactly (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) W-I-L-L-I-A--
Speaker 1: Well, you don't have to spell it.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: And, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Actually, he was born, he was born in, in Arkansas.  His date of birth is 1908, '09 [1909]; I'm sorry, 1909, June 9th.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was born in, in, in a little town right outside of Arkansas.  I don't remember the name of it, but--
Speaker 1: Right outside of, of--
Speaker 2: Of Little Rock--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Little Rock, Arkansas, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about your father's side of the family?  What, what are the stories from that side?  How far back can you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: How far you want me to go back (laughter)?  I'll go back to Fred Davis (laughter).  Yeah, well, actually, they were, they, they, they, they were all kind of like born and raised in, in, just right outside of Little Rock, Arkansas.  And I guess--[clearing throat]--I guess there was some kind of a conflict that, that happened, racially, in Arkansas.  And one of the brothers, they had, my great-grandfather had about twelve children, him and Sally, Fred and Sally.  And I don't know how many boys and how many girls, but it was about twelve of 'em in all.  And one of the boys got in, in, in a, a problem with a fellow.  And he ended up hurting the fellow or something like that, and then, and when, when, when my grand, great-grandfather heard about it, he packed up the whole family in covered wagons, and they left Arkansas at two or three o'clock in the morning, and, and, and left there, and came into Missouri, and settled in a place called Kinloch, Missouri.
Speaker 1: Now, it sounds to me--I'm reading between the lines here, but you said he got in trouble.  He hurt a fellow, but is this a white fellow?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And you know, during those days, if, once they, they, it got around that, that, that they might end up messing up the whole family, and my great-grandfather knew that.  He knew what the, what, what the situation was in the South, and so he packed up the whole family, and they covered wagons and all that and booked to Missouri and settled in a, in a, in a county of Kinloch--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Missouri, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what did he do for--did he do like farm work for a living, or did he have another occupation?
Speaker 2: Who, my grandfather?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually, my great-grandfather was a, he worked on the plantation, and he was, he was what you call, he broke horses.  He was very strong and, and, and that, that was all he knew.  He knew how to break horses.  And he broke horses all the way up until he was in his seventies.  And he would have kept going until some, somebody came along and, and, and, and probably wanted the job and asked him, what, what, what, what is that old man doing out there breaking the horse, doing, I mean, how is he doing it?  You know, and it's not that he wasn't doing it.  But then all of a sudden, some kind of way his age got in it, and they retired him.  And then once they retired him, he didn't know what else to do, so he just kind of, kind of, kind of kicked back and just let life go, keep on going by, you know, because that, that's all he--he, he wasn't, he didn't have any schooling, so that's all he knew.  And, but the, the beautiful thing about it is that he lived to be a 113, yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is Fred, right?
Speaker 2: Fred, yeah.
Speaker 1: So he lived to 113.  And ha- he had twelve children?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And he's your great-grandfather, right?
Speaker 2: My great-grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Story_ID: 180600
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your grandfather.
Speaker 2: My grandfather is Phil Davis.  He was born in Arkansas, and (laughter), and Phil he was a, he was, he was a, a character.  I, I say that lovingly because I loved him, and, and, and I love all of my family.  And, and during those, those years, it's something, there must have been some real terrible stuff that happened to the Davis's down there because he swore that he would never work for anybody.  I guess that's where my father [William Davis Sr.] got it from because we all ended up being entrepreneurs.  And Phil, as long as I ever knew him, never worked for anybody.  He worked for himself.  He would, he said he promised hisself he would haul anything to, rather than work for somebody, you know, and that's what he did.  He, he sold fish; he, he went to the country and got vegetables and sold 'em off his truck.  He just made, he just made hisself a, a living off of things that, that, that he wanted to do because of what he swore he wouldn't do.  And, but while he was in Arkansas he (laughter), he married--he used, he used to go, go messing around on the, on the reservations, you know, because, you know that in, in those, in those places they had a lot of Indian reservations.  And he was messing around on the Indian reservation, and, and, and got to dealing with one of the, the Indian women [Davis' grandmother, Zora Banks], and ended up having three children by her and so, which was my father was one, and his brother, Ed, and his sister, Maggie.  And so those are the three, and then my father--I mean my grandfather ended up getting married again after he left--I don't know whatever happened to, to, to his, his first wife.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Trying to think.  I know, I know my sister and them got her name.  I, I, I can't think of it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That's all right.  We'll just--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But, but they, they, they, they're gonna send it to you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I don't know if they, if she passed away, or they ended up separating, or, or just what.  And, but, but Phil ended up getting married again, and they had probably about five or six more children and which we all know them.  We all, you know, the Davis family was huge, and it, and, and we all got along, you know.  And so that, that's, that's what I can tell you about that.  I don't know that much more about him.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now what, what did your father say about growing up?  Did, did he grow up part of the time on the Indian reservation, or did he--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --or was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --no, he, he would go back and forth because there was a little, I don't know what you, you would call it, prejudice or if the Indians--I, what I've heard is that, is that the chief didn't like Phil, you know.  (Laughter) They said the chief, so the chief would put him off the reservation, you know.  So I don't know what that was about.  But, so, but, but when this thing happened with them all coming to, to Missouri, my father was just eight years old, you know.  And so, when they all packed up, they packed up the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the brothers and the children, and so my father, and Ed, and Maggie all came to, to Missouri together.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was one of your father's brothers that, that was involved in the altercation when, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --your grandfather, Phil, took the whole family to, to Missouri.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --it wasn't father's brother.  It was my grandfather's brother--
Speaker 1: Oh, your grandfather's brother, okay.
Speaker 2: --my grandfather's youngest brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, but my, my father's brother, Ed, was one of the ones that was, that was married, that was born by the Indian woman, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right so--
Speaker 2: Fred, my great-grandfather, was the one packed up the whole family and came to--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to, to Missouri.
Story_ID: 180601
Speaker 1: What did your father [William Davis, Sr.] say about growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't, I, don't know if, if, if he even started school in, in Arkansas when he was down there, before he was eight.  And he could have, but he never talked about it.  And I, I, now that's something else I'll have to find out.  I never, I never really talked--knew if he started school when he got to Missouri, because when I got to know what was going on, they were all entrepreneurs.  They were working in, in--they had trucks, and, and, and, and, and working in the woods, and cutting down trees, and that's when, that's how I start to remember.  Then it was two brothers.  My father and his brother, Ed, had the business together, and, and they, we would cut down trees and, and to take, to take the lumber to the, to the mill to make paper.  You know, so that's, that's, that's, that was my remembrance of, of what, what, what they were doing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So they established a, a lumberyard or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had a lumberyard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They had a lumberyard in St. Louis [Missouri].  They, now, now, let me share this with you.  We didn't stay in Kinloch [Missouri].  When, when, once he, once my father was grown, we, we, we stayed in the city of St. Louis, and that's where we grew up at.  But most of the family that came from Arkansas settled in Kinloch, and they stayed in Kinloch.  So we would, we would have to go to Kinloch on the, on the weekends to visit the main part of the family.
Speaker 1: How, how do you spell Kinloch?
Speaker 2: Oh, geez, how's that, K-I-N-L-O-C-H, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, like a German name--(unclear)--Kinloch.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so--
Speaker 2: Actually, Kinloch was the, was probably the first black city--I don't know.  It, it says probably the first black city in, in, in, in the United States, yeah, where it had had, I mean, where it had its own mayor; it had its own police department; it had its own fire department.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is a black town then--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --right outside St. Louis--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now that's something.  Now do you have any idea when Kinloch was founded?
Speaker 2: No, that's--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that's another thing, but there is a book that you'll be getting that we're gon' make sure that you get that.  It wasn't the same lady who did it, but it was the same company that did the book on [HM] Marilyn's [McCoo]--when, when they grew up on, on, on, on Kinloch.  So we'll, we'll be getting that to you so you can--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is a part, part of that, that series of Hometown books that, that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --your shops and that sort--
Speaker 2: Yes, it's one on Kinloch.

Speaker 1: Now that's something--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I hadn't, I didn't know about the black towns in Missouri.  I knew about 'em in Kansas and Mississippi.  But I'm finding out that almost every state has, has some all-black towns.

Speaker 1: So your, your father [William Davis, Sr.] went, you know he went into business.  You're not sure where he went to school and that, or, or if he even finished or if he was--
Speaker 2: No, I'm not.  I never had heard him talk about it, even the school or the name of the schools, because we were always, I guess it was always business with us, you know.  When we grew up--(unclear)--my older brothers, two--it was seven of us, my two older brothers [Albert and Wilbert Tayes], who he raised, and my three sisters [Norzora Davis Mebane, Belura Davis White, Fedora Davis], and then myself, and my younger brother [Ronald Davis].  They were all working for the company.  I mean my sisters wasn't, but my, the boys would, you know.  We would have to work.  And then during the summer months when we wasn't in school, we would be in the, in there working with the trucks, or working with that in the woods, or doing something like that, you know.
Speaker 1: What do they call the company?  What was it?
Speaker 2: Davis Brothers (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, it's good to ask--
Speaker 2: What else, Davis Brothers (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Davis Brothers Lumber--
Speaker 2: Yea, lumber--
Speaker 1: --or just Davis Brothers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And now, now, even though, even though we would cut--we would, we would haul lumber from the, from the country to the, to the, to the mill, we still would, at the end of the, the, the wood yard, we would have coal there, too, for people that would come who had furnaces, had coal furnaces, and wood furnaces, and fireplaces, and things like that; that's the way they heated their homes.  And so we would sell baskets of wood and stuff like that out of the, out of the coal yard.  And there, there would be scraps and stuff that we got from, from the woods we would take to the, to the, to our lumberyard.
Speaker 1: Yeah, kindling was important--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, kin, it was very, very important.
Speaker 1: --for--
Speaker 2: That's what you need to started your fire.  Even if you had a, a coal furnace, you would start it with, with, with, with kindling and then put the coal on top of it, and, and bank it, you know.  You used to have to do all of that, bank it so it'll keep, stayed for the whole night, heat up the house, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, that's almost like a lost art now--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, they, they don't even talk like that no more, and I'm going way back, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, I, I was shoveling coal till I was ten, and then we got gas, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Sixty-five now, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I banked a many fire, had, had to go downstairs late at night and make sure that, that it was done.  We all did.  You know, you, you learn how to do all that stuff when you, when you grow up during those times, yeah.
Story_ID: 180603
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: How they met?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No, I don't, I think (laughter), I don't know if they met at a park or--all I know is that I remember the story about my father [William Davis, Sr.] seeing my mother [Norris Oldham Davis].  My mother was a nice-looking woman.  And he, he seen her and he, I don't if it was love at first sight, but I, I, I think he seen somebody, something he wanted.  And so, and like I was saying earlier, that he knew the Lovey, who's the father of the, her first two boys, and they were, they were friends.  And, and Lovey was the one who told her hey, 'cause he expressed his love for her, that how much he, he liked her.  And so that's when Lovey told him, say, well, why don't go on and, and try to, to get her because she's a, she's a beautiful woman, and she's lovely, and she's nice, and she needs somebody who could take care of her.  'Cause, Lovey was a, he, he knew the type of person he was, and not to say that he was raunchy or anything, but he just wasn't ready for that.  And so, but--
Speaker 1: But that's an interesting story--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes--
Speaker 1: --that, that, that, that would even happen that you'd have that kind of conversation, and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, and they, and they did, and, and we knew Lovey all the way through life, until he died, 'cause periodically he would come into the family, and we would all hang out and talk.  But the interesting thing about relationships like that is that my father raised them, but they call my father daddy, and they call their father Lovey.  And that's, and that's, it's, it's, it's amazing how they, how they--and they'll tell you, they'll you, say oh yeah, we know Lovey, but that's my daddy over there, you know.  And, and, and it was just a really beautiful--it's a whole beautiful love affair with their family, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, that's, that's an interesting story.  So, so your parents, now, now when did they get married?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I don't know (laughter).  That was in--
Speaker 1: This is in, in the--
Speaker 2: They, they--
Speaker 1: Are, are you the old--
Speaker 2: --there have been--
Speaker 1: Are, are--
Speaker 2: I'll tell you what, they have been married for sixty-eight years, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're not the oldest, right?  You're--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --one of the, one of, my half-brother.  His name is Arthur, Arthur Tayes [ph.].  He is eighty-five right now.
Speaker 1: But I'm--the, the children that your, your, your, your biological father and had, you know, you know, that, that--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --that were just theirs.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Then, then who's the oldest?
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--my sister, my sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I don't know when, when she was born.
Speaker 1: You were born in '38 [1938], right?
Speaker 2: I was born in '38 [1938].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had one sister born in--you know, I'm, I'm bad with ages, I mean--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--well, let's take it like, so somewhere I guess in the mid-thirties [1930s] you think they were married?
Speaker 2: I was born in '38 [1938].  I would say Fedora was born in around '40 [1940].  I'm just--and Velura was born about '42 [1942], so Norzora had to be born somewhere around '46 [1946].  So, if I back that up, if I back that up, then, then, then Fedora was born in around '36 [1936].
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's what I'm thinking about, the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the mid-'30s [1930s], around '35 [1935] or '36 [1936] when they--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --they get together.
Speaker 2: --so, somewhere in there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'll say that, that Norzora was probably born in '30 [1930].

Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' [Norris Oldham Davis and William Davis, Sr.] personalities, how they walk, talk, what they look like, their, their sense of humor, their talents, their frame of mind, I mean, who, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I'm, I'm a, I'm a splittin' image of both of 'em really to, to tell you the truth.  I guess I look like my father, and I look like my mother.  A lot of people will see me and say boy, you look just like Norris.  And, and some other people will say you look just like your daddy, you know.  And, but I, I think I act more like my mother than my father.  But then a lot of people say, you know, you, you act just like your father, so I, I, I don't, I don't know, you know.  But I do know that I have a lot of both of 'em in me, 'cause I can feel it.  Sometimes I can look in the mirror and see my father, you know, and I can look in the mirror and see my mother.  And it's, it's scary sometimes, and so I, but most of the times I don't worry about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, te, tell, tell us about 'em.  What were your parents like?
Speaker 2: They were, they were, they were, they were, they were very lovely, lovely people.  They would, they would--my father was like, I wouldn't say--my father was, was very gentle.  He was a gentleman, but, but he was, he, until you, if you made him made, you had to, you had, everybody had to get out, you know.  But, until then, he was very gentle.  He would, he was always there for you.  He was always ready to help you do something.  He would take you anywhere.  He would do things for you.  And he loved my mother, I mean, I mean to death.  And, and, and both of 'em together, they were just, they, they were like, they were like lovebirds, as, as far as we could see.  I'm not saying that they didn't have arguments--(unclear)--like every couple do, does, but, you know, that's, that's, that--I've, my family has always been a together family.  It's, it's, it's--we, we have family reunions still, still today, once every two years now.  We used to have 'em every year, years ago.  That's one of, that's one of the things that Fred and Sally started in Arkansas, and we have carried it on, carried on that tradition all the way till today.  And, but them, but my parents were married for sixty-eight years.  And you never heard 'em, heard 'em curse; they were just gentle people, and everybody loved 'em.
Story_ID: 180605
Speaker 1: Now can you name your siblings from the oldest to the, to the youngest, and put yourself in the order?  And tell us something about what they--a little bit about each one.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my, my, my, which is starting from my half-brothers?  Okay, his name is Arthur Tayes, and he's--what can I say about Arthur?  He's, he was a, he, he, I could say that I don't know how to, I don't how, how, how much schooling he had, but I know he did go to school.  And he ended up going to the, ended up going to the Army, and he was in the Army for a while.  And when he got out, he, he, he--Arthur was a worker, 'cause he got that from, from, from, from my father.  And his whole thing was making sure that he worked, making sure that he was there on time.  He was, he was the brother that was prompt, wanted to make sure that everything was done right, and, and that's the way he lived his life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now my brother under him, which his name, his name was Wilbert, Wilbert Tayes.  Now he was just the opposite.  He, he, he didn't go to school.  He didn't work.  He didn't wanna work.  He ended up hittin' the sauce and being one of those kind of guys, running the streets and, and, but it was still--but, you know, it's, it's so funny, having the kind of family that we have, he was lovable; everybody loved him.  He had a nickname, Skeezits [ph.], and everybody loves Skeezits.  And, but Skeezits was, I think his worst enemy was himself, you know, because what, the life that he chose and, and how he lived it.  And Skeezits ended up going into the Air Force.  And I don't really remember how long he stayed in the Air Force, because during the time I was in school and taking care--it was a big gap in between us because there are the three sisters in between us, you know, so.  And so when he got out, he got married and had some children.  So that's as much as I can remember about Skeezits.  And then there came the first girl, Norzora--
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: N-O-R-Z-O-R-A, Norzora Davis, and she ended up getting married.  She ended up going to the Air Force too, and she met her husband in the Air Force.  And she married a fellow by the name of Hardis (ph.) Mebane; it's spelled M-E-B-A-N-E, Mebane, they--(unclear)--they might say it like that.  And they, they stayed married.  They, they ended up with, with, with, with children, and they stayed married a long time.  In fact, they stayed married until he passed away.  And, and then there was Velura Davis, which is now Velura Davis White, and her name is spelled V-E-L-U-R-A, W-H-I-T-E.  And she's married to a man by the name of Charles White, and they have [pause] three children.  And then there was Fedora.  Her name is spelled F-E-D-O-R-A, Lois, L-O, L-O-I-S, Davis.  And she married--nah, Davis is, is Fedora McPherson, Fedora Lois McPherson, M-C-P-H-E, E-R-S-O-N, McPherson.  And she ended up with four girls, a set of twins, Roxanne and then Juanita, yeah.  So, and then myself, and then I have a brother under me.  His name is Ronald Davis, R-O-N-A-L-D.  And he ended up marrying a young lady by the name of Maxine, and they have two children.  So that was it.
Story_ID: 180606
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Earliest childhood memory?  Yeah, I remember when I was five years old singing.  The teacher called me up.  I was in the kindergarten, and the teacher called me up to, to sing a song, and I sung.  I sung a song.  I remember the song called 'O Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie.'  It was a cowboy song.  I was into cowboys at the time (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's right, cowboys were big in--
Speaker 2: Oh--(unclear)--Gene--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)-'50 [1950s]--
Speaker 2: Gene Autry in 'Hopalong Cassidy' and all those guys, and Fuzzy and you know (laughter).  All that stuff was, was, kept us on television watching them, you know.  And so I sung that song.  And at the time, I had one of--at five years old I had a little high voice.  And once I knew I could sing, I knew then that I could sing.  And I said wow, I've got a pretty voice too.  And it sounds like a little girl at that particular time, but, but that was all right.  I knew I could carry these notes.  And it's so funny because right then I knew that I wanted to sing, that, that I wanted to sing.  That was my key, that I knew I could hold these notes, and I could sing.
Speaker 1: Is that--(unclear)--with the teacher in--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Did, you think the teacher recognized that you had talent and--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --that's why she--
Speaker 2: --yes, that, that, that, they, they, they was, they, they were the ones--it, it was kind of my-oh they were making over me, you know.  And, and, and I knew then that, that I had something, you know.  And, and so then after, I started singing all through school, all through grade school, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now where did you start school?  What was the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: It was Cole School [later, Cole Elementary School, St. Louis, Missouri].  It was a block away from, from our house.  We lived on West Belle Boulevard, or wa, was it at--(unclear)--no, it wasn't a boulevard.  It was an avenue.  It was an avenue.  It was just West Belle.  It was a street.  And our school, my school was on Enright, which was the next block over.  And I was, I lived at 3919 A West Belle, and I think the, the, the school was in the 3900 of Enright, 'cause it took up the block, you know.  So, that's where we went to school.
Story_ID: 180607
Speaker 1: And what was your, what was your neighborhood called when you--did you live in the same neighborhood growing up, or did you move around a lot?
Speaker 2: No, yeah, no, we lived in the same neighborhood growing up--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: What, what was the name of it, or was there a name for it?
Speaker 2: Actually, there wasn't a name for it.  It was just, just, just West Belle Street, you know.  There, there wasn't a name.
Speaker 1: I mean was there a name for that part of town?
Speaker 2: Not that I can remember.
Speaker 1: Was it on north, south, east, west side?
Speaker 2: It was, it was in the, it--
Speaker 1: St. Louis [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: --basically in the center of town.  It was in St. Louis--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but it was in the center of town.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Actually, if you, you, you, you--we stayed right up from one of the main streets called Vandeventer.  And if you went south on Vandeventer, you'd run into Busch Brewery, you know, and, or, or Ralston, Purina Ralston [sic, Ralston Purina], you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Danforth--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Buster Brown shoes [Brown Shoe Company] and all those, all those major companies were, were in St. Louis.  And so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Buster Brown was big in those days.  They--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: --they sponsored television shows.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: The dog would--you look in the shoe, and the dog would bark at you--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah--
Speaker 1: --on the TV commercial--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And I, and I live in there too.
Speaker 1: --say that because people now don't--
Speaker 2: They don't--
Speaker 1: --don't, don't--
Speaker 2: --know.
Speaker 1: But Buster Brown's not that big, but it's like, it was like--
Speaker 2: Oh no.
Speaker 1: --Nike almost and in terms of--
Speaker 2: That's right, it was huge.
Speaker 1: --not in the same--
Speaker 2: It was huge.
Speaker 1: --vein of athletic shoes.  But, but for kids shoes, Buster Brown was a--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: --it was a big deal.
Speaker 2: And then not only that, another major company, there was Pevely Dairy, yeah, yeah.  And--(unclear)--as we keep going I'll tell you something about that, you know.  But so, basically, all the, the--there was no name for the (unclear)--for our area.  It's just where we stayed, you know.  And there was little, little spots of all, all over the city of different areas where it, it was, it was all mixed up, black, white, you know.  It's, you, you, you could go five blocks over and then run into a white area.  You go five blocks over this way and run into a black, black area.  You run ten blocks up this way and run into another, you know, it was that kind of, that, that kind of thing, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's--so, St. Louis, the black people were living in all over the but in pockets--
Speaker 2: In pockets, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But there weren't any names for the--were there any names for any of the pockets that you--
Speaker 2: Not that I can remember.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I know in Seattle [Washington] they call the, the area in near downtown where Jimmy Hendricks grew the CD, Central District, where it's mostly blacks.
Speaker 2: Oh, really, called the Central District?
Speaker 1: Yes, or they, or the CD, that's what they call it.  But I mean other towns they have names, but, okay.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: That's interesting--(unclear)--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, now, if you went farther east, like let's say from, from like Jefferson, the street of Jefferson on down you've got Grant Avenue, and one of the other major streets was Jefferson.  Now if you Jefferson down to 12th Street, in, in, in, in a certain areas it was, it was mainly black.  But that was a pocket, but they didn't, they call, they called it the, the Car Square Village, you know.
Speaker 1: Or the Ville.
Speaker 2: And, and the Ville with all the projects were down there, you know.  And, but, but if you go on down, you can go down to the levy.  But them between, between the projects and, and, and the, and the, and the levy, you had downtown.  You had all of the major stores, and that was the downtown of, of, of St. Louis, which is now where you have Busch Stadium.  And it's a lot of stadiums down there now and major hotels is where the Arc, the Arc is [Gateway] Arch--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --is built.  And it's, it's a major, major--they, they built all that up now.  And so that's, that's, that's, that's what we grew up with.  And it was, you knew, you knew exactly where you fit and where (laughter), you know, so that was it, yeah.
Story_ID: 180608
Speaker 1: I asked the same question of your wife [HM Marilyn McCoo], but what were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I would, I would say the, the, I, I, I would say smells of, you know, what, what, in St. Louis [Missouri], you, you know, we, we, we--it was a steel mill.  You could smell smokes, you know, the smells of, of steel burning.  And 'cause that's what, it was the Scullin Steel was one of the major places where, where a lot men would work, and you would, you could, you could smell it, you know.  And, and, and if you were fortunate enough to, to, to live in, in an area that, that wasn't deep in the city, that just had an area where there were trees, and, and, and, and, and, and, and birds, and, and, and the blue jays, and robins, and all those kind of birds, I mean cardinals.  That's where the St. Louis Cardinals came from.  (Unclear)--cardinal bird, you would see all of them in, in St. Louis, you know.  And, and sights, it was just, just, just trains and, and things like that, you know, trucks.  There was a lot of, lot of industry there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now was there, was there a lot of music in, in your home?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, it was a lot of music in the house.  I mean, my sisters and, and, and, and me, we would sing.  We would sing songs.  We would sing songs, get together and, and, and harmonize.  And I just, I know [HM] Marilyn [McCoo] talked about--we talked about it because we did the same thing in our family.  And it was, it was beautiful, beautiful to be able to get together and sing because during those years you didn't have a lot of things to entertain ourselves with, not like they do today.  But, but one, one--which I think is missing today because they need to be entertaining themselves with each other instead of with the, a lot of the stuff that they entertain themselves with.  But it's brought the family closer together.  We, we enjoyed each other.  We couldn't wait to get together and sing and show off in front of each other.  It was just, it was just a lot of fun.  And yeah, so there was always music in the house.  I remember listening to albums and old blues songs, you know, like I was, I was, I was a, I was a--[clearing throat]--excuse me--I was the type of kid that I loved all kind of music.  I want, I wanted to, to--once I knew I could sing, I wanted to sing everything.  And so I would get into, I would listen to jazz.  I would listen to blues and, and Jimmy Reed, Muddy Waters, and, and I would listen to all those kind of guys, Memphis, Memphis Slim.  And then, then on the other hand, I'd, I'd be listening to Snooky Lanson on the Lucky Strike Parade [Officially Your Hit Parade] and, and people like that.  And, and, and then I would, I, I would, I remember my mother would, would take us to the opera out at Forest Park.  And, and, and I remember the first time I went and experienced an opera.  It blew my mind.  You know, it was like wow, these people are on stage, and they're changing outfits.  And it's, they're painting a picture, they're paint a picture for us of life and how all these went, what used to be years ago.  I remember seeing the 'King and I' in the Forest Park on stage.
Speaker 1: So this is a big park in the middle of the city?
Speaker 2: In the, in the--Oak Forest--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --Park is one of your major, major parks in the United States.  I mean it's world-known.
Speaker 1: And beautiful park.
Speaker 2: And beautiful park, and plus it's got a world-known zoo, you know.  But they also had an opera house out there.  And we would go out there and my God, I was just, I mean, to see the opera, it, it, it fascinated me.  I mean I couldn't believe all this beauty and all this stuff--[clearing throat]--excuse me--was happening on stage.  And, and it was, it was just, it was just, it was just I knew then that, that, that where I wanted to be, 'cause I didn't know if I--but I enjoyed opera.  I still enjoy to this day, classical music.  I, I, I, I'll tell you, I listen to everything, but, and I enjoy it all.  But I never thought I would be an opera singer.
Speaker 1: Now St. Louis is one, but Houston [Texas]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --there's an opera in a park, and I can't think of too many other places that have an opera in the park.  In fact, I can't think of any right now, but they were like, what, the Mooney's Theater out there and all that, you know, so--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, during those years I didn't know, I, I didn't know it was an opera in the park until we--that my mother [Norris Oldham Davis] took us.  And once, once she took us out there, then I wanted to keep going because it interest me.  It was the music, you know.  And I don't what other parks had operas in 'em or, or nothin'.  I never thought about it after that.  But it's one of the things that stuck in my mind and my heart, that, that, that, that it was a part of the music that I would love, you know.  And so that was a good experience for me for, for preparation for, for what I wanted to do in my life.
Story_ID: 180609
Speaker 1: Was church a big factor in growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, in fact, we, we lived right next door, not to say right next door but maybe about two, two or three houses away from the church that we, we, that we attended.  It was called True Vine Spiritualist Church [St. Louis, Missouri].  And we used to, we used to go over there every Sunday and, and some, some of us would sing in the choir, and we would have choir rehearsals there.  And it's funny because during the, during those times, the pastor of the church was a woman, and that was unheard of.  When I used to tell people, I say well, yeah--I forget, I forget.  We called her Reverend Mother.  I forgot her name.  But anyway, she was the pastor of the church.  And, and the church was, was full of people, and she was well-respected, you know. An, and, and when I tell, tell people that, that we had a woman (laughter) who was a pastor, they look at me like I was crazy because that was unheard of, you know, but not for me because that's, that's what, that was my reality of, of, of church, you know.  And then after that, I left that and, and started following my sisters who they decided that they wanted to be Catholic.  So, me being the brother under them and my younger brother under me, we decided we'd follow them into being Catholics.  And so we went too and joined the Catholic Church and, and went to religiouses, religious instructions, instructions.  And, and, and, and we were baptized Catholic and confirmed.  And, and then after I got older, as, as I began to get older, one of the things I had a problem with in, in the Catholic church was, was, was confession, you know.  I was doing so much stuff, I didn't know if I wanted to confess all this stuff to a, to a priest.  And then, then, then one of the, the things that God gave us was our minds to think, and, and he's supposed to be the interceder.  You know, he intercedes for us and to send it up to, to, to the Lord.  And, and I was saying to myself, now, if I tell him all my sins and he dies before he can get 'em up to the Lord, I'm in, I got a problem, you know. So, why don't I just talk to the Lord myself, you know?  So, that wasn't working for me, you know, that and--so I decided then that I was, I was gonna, gonna leave the, the Catholic Church and, and, and, and join a Baptist church, you know.  So that's, that's what happened, and--
Speaker 1: This is a third, then, experience at the church, that--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So how old were you when you be--
Speaker 2: Oh, I was a teenager then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was a teenager then because I was singing with a group, with a group called the St. Gospel Singers out of St. Louis, Missouri.  Yeah, we, we sang gospel songs for four or five years.
Story_ID: 180610
Speaker 1: Now what, what was the music like at the spiritualist church?
Speaker 2: It was, it was hot.  It was like, it was like a Church of God in Christ [COGIC].  You know, it was, it was tambourines, and organs, and, and foot stumping and shouting.  And I mean it was, it was all of that, I mean, you know.
Speaker 1: So, so how did you, I mean, what was your feeling like in the Catholic [church] when you were going to Catholic--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It was totally different.  It was totally different, and, and you know, it was like, it was like going from, from one thing to another, just like it was like going, going, for me it was like going backwards, you know, because then I thought about it: why was I here?  And I was here because we were following my sister, my sisters, should I say.  And so the, the interest wasn't really in the church, I would say, as far as being--but our, our, our hearts was, was always for the Lord, but, but, but the church, we didn't--it was, it was just a church, you know.  And, but I think, I think the, I think the music and the--had a lot to do with, with, with, with, with where we come from.  You know, because during, during that time, you know, the Catholic Church, they, they were doing things like (singing), 'Ave Maria' you know, doing 'Ave Maria,' that kind of stuff.  And, and, and over at the spiritualist church they were singing Jesus gave me water, oh Jesus, you know.  And you're into another whole thing, you know, and said well, wait a minute, you know.  You kind of, you, 'cause you, you grew up with that one, so to leave it, is, is, was, was kind of crazy.  But I had to get back to that because that was what I knew, and we were all serving the same God.  So, so that's what I, I went back to.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you joined a third church, a Baptist church in, in, when you were in high school, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Especially since we were singing spirituals too, 'cause then, then when, once we started singing spirituals with a group called the St. Gospel Singers, then we started singing at different, different churches.  Sometimes we would sing in the Church of God in Christ; sometimes we would sing in a Baptist church; sometimes we would be in a spiritualist church but never a Catholic church, not at that particular time, because Catholic church wasn't, wasn't doing the kind of music that, that, that we were doing.  And--
Speaker 1: What was the name of that church, the Catholic Church?
Speaker 2: Holy--I know one of 'em was called St. Ann's, but that was the second one.  But this was called Holy--I can't remember now.
Speaker 1: That's okay, but what about the Baptist church?  Which one was that?
Speaker 2: That was called--I don't remember that one either.  It's been so long ago.
Speaker 1: All right, all right.
Speaker 2: It was on Grand Avenue, I, I remember that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, but you know, later, you know, the Catholic Church now is singing gospel music today, you know, which they wasn't years ago when I was going to Catholic, Catholic church, yep.
Speaker 1: So the people are basically changing the church?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I mean, you know, and that's what happens with time, you know.  Like they say, the only thing that's consistent in our life is change, you know, so they changed, you know.  But, and then they start--they not only changed the singing, they, they changed how they taught, how they're teaching now, because we, we have a fellow who sings with our praise team who is a--who, still goes to Catholic church.  And now he's teaching the way some of the other churches teach when he, when he goes to teach some of his students at the church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I've seen a big, I've seen a major change in that.
Story_ID: 180611
Speaker 1: Well, one of your earliest memories is at, at five years old singing in front of the class.  So did they have like a chorus in grade school or anything for you to participate in on a regular basis as a singer?
Speaker 2: No, no, not in grade school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, not in grade school.  Actually, most of the singing that I did in grade school I was, it was, it was I was just singing by myself for different functions and things like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now did, did you like school generally?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean I, yeah, I mean I, I, I, I enjoyed school.  I got along with, with everybody.  I--during the summer months, I mean we played ball on the school.  I mean the school was a place for us to, to really hang out, you know.  You--during, during the summer months we would play on the playground still.  That was open to us.  The swimming pools were open to us.  And when, when, when it was time to go back to school, we were right back in the same place.  And, and we, we, we truly enjoyed it.
Story_ID: 180612
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I've heard that you're a baseball fan, so--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --did you play a lot of baseball growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, I played baseball.  That's just one of the things that, that even during the summer months and, and we would play baseball on the schoolyards.  And, actually, we would play baseball on any yard where we--I mean there was a park like, you know, where we could play.  And it was, it was, it was a tough thing for me because I fell in love with baseball.  And, and I was a good baseball player, and I knew I was good.  And then I started wondering, geez, should I be a baseball player, or should I sing?  Then that, that was a tough one, because I was really that good with baseball.  And, and I said no, I don't think so; I, I, I think that I, what I really want to do is sing.  That was, singing was my heart; that was my passion.  I was good at baseball, but--
Speaker 1: Were you a fan of the St., St., St. Louis Cardinals?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, I was a fan.  In fact, I was thinking about getting, going with the--do, do you remember the Browns?
Speaker 1: St. Louis Browns?
Speaker 2: St. Louis Browns--
Speaker 1: Were, were they still playing when you were--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm going, am I going back too far (laughter)?
Speaker 1: I don't, you know, I'm, I'm trying to remember whether they actually stopped playing, 'cause I remember--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They stopped--
Speaker 1: --Brown--
Speaker 2: --yeah, they stopped, and I think they went to Cleveland.
Speaker 1: They became the Indians?
Speaker 2: No, the Cleveland Browns, wasn't it?
Speaker 1: No, Cleveland was--
Speaker 2: It--
Speaker 1: --football team, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the baseball team in Cleveland was--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: I know the Browns ended--
Speaker 1: --Indians.
Speaker 2: --up going to another, another--
Speaker 1: To a city and they became--
Speaker 2: --city, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did they become the Senators in Washington?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't know--
Speaker 1: Or--
Speaker 2: --but that's an interesting question.
Speaker 1: I know the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But I know, I know they became another--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --another team, yeah.  And then that, that just left the Cardinals, and so yes, I was a Cardinal fan.  You know, I used to just, just really watch 'em all the time because--
Speaker 1: I had a--
Speaker 2: --St. Louis is a big sport city, you know.
Speaker 1: Right, I, I got a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --note here that your--that [HM] [Lamonte] McLemore tried out for the Cardinals.
Speaker 2: He could have.
Speaker 1: You, okay, you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause I know he loved--Lamonte's still playing ball today, yeah.  I mean he's playing at it, you know (laughter), you know.  But I mean he still loves it that much to get out there and play, you know, and, and my hat's off to him.  I say hey, you know, he's always trying to get me to come up there and play with him, you know, but that's, that's just a wish (laughter).
Story_ID: 180613
Speaker 1: Did you know [HM] Lamonte McLemore growing up in St. Louis [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, sure.
Speaker 1: And when did you all meet, and can you tell us how you met him?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, we met when, when, when, when, wa, when Lamonte--ma, my sisters were going to Sumner High School.  That's one of the high schools in St. Louis.  And Lamonte was going to Sumner, and they started going together, my sister and Lamonte.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's, what, three years old than you or, or two, two or three years older than you--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: He might be four years older than--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, maybe about three, maybe about three.  And, and so he used to come by my house, you know, dating.  And, and then once we got to know him, then my sisters knew his sisters, you know, and then the, the families got, became very close.  And the next thing we know, we were in the drum and bugle corps together.  Lamonte played drums; I played drums.  And, and so we would march in the, in the bands, and so that's, we all, we grew up with that kind of music too.  And yeah, I knew Lamonte.  I know--we knew him, but never did, never did I know that one day we would be in a singing group together that was gon' become famous.  I never knew that.
Speaker 1: Now did you know [Ronald] Ron Townson as a, you know, as a, when you were in--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I knew Ron--
Speaker 1: He was much--
Speaker 2: --'cause Ron--
Speaker 1: --older I think by--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he, but Ron was--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was, he was in school with my sisters, with one of 'em--it was probably Velura--and, at, at Sumner.  And, but Ron's brother, his younger brother, Rodney, and I were in school together, so that's how, that's how I knew Ron and, and, and--I, I forgot the other brother's name, yeah.  Lloyd, yes, yeah, Lloyd, that's his name.  It was Ronald, Lloyd, and Rodney.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the brothers' name, Ronald's brothers.
Speaker 1: So Ron Townson, Lamonte McLemore, and, and you would all be members of The 5th Dimension--
Speaker 2: Would all end up being members of The 5th Dimension, right--
Speaker 1: --growing up--
Speaker 2: --growing up in St. Louis--
Speaker 1: --basically in St., St. Louis.
Speaker 2: --together, never dreamed, never knew that one day we would all meet in Los Angeles [California] and become The 5th Dimension.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you didn't go Los Angeles in the same car or anything or--
Speaker 2: No, we, we went in--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we all, we all went to Los Angeles at different times.  In fact, I was the last one to come out.  Ron was there, and Lamonte was there, and I came out seeking a recording career with, with Motown Records.
Speaker 1: Okay, now we're, we're gon' get--
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: --catch up to that.  I just wanted to establish that, that you all knew each other in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: In, in, in, St. Louis.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 180614
Speaker 1: When you were in school, did, I mean did you have a favorite subject in--
Speaker 2: A favorite subject?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, I, not, not really.  I just I enjoyed math and, and history because of what was and what, what used to be, and you know, and knowing where we come from, and to figure out where we're going, you know.  But--
Speaker 1: Were you really a focused student?  I mean did you really--
Speaker 2: For the most part, for the most part, but the only thing that would take my focus away from, from that would be singing, doing something with some group or something.  I just loved that.  You know, and there's a lot of groups that were started during, during that time of my life, you know, and just getting around harmonizing with, with different guys and, and singing.
Story_ID: 180615
Speaker 1: Now who did you, did you idolize any particular groups or individuals or singers in those days?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that was, that, that's what most of us do (laughter) when we wanna get in the business, yeah.  I don't know if you remember The Orioles.  You remember Sonny Til and The Orioles and out of New York [New York, New York], and, and the, The Dominoes and who became The Drifters.  And, and Nat, Nat King Cole, I mean, he was, he was the, the king of smooth singing and, and--but I, but, but, but, but Billy Eckstine and Arthur Prysock, they were, they had their own thing going on, you know.  And I was listening to all of them.  They didn't--I, I, I, I loved them, and then I was listening to Frankie Laine, you know--
Speaker 1: That's the singer of 'Rawhide'--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was list--
Speaker 1: --and, and other things.
Speaker 2: --I was, I was, I was listening to all of that stuff, and you know, and, and I enjoyed it.  You know, I, I, I wasn't the type that just stuck to one type of music and that was my music.  I enjoyed all of it, and so they were some of my favorites.  Like I told you, then I was listening to blues, Jimmy Reed and all those people.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--when, when you grew up, correct me if I'm wrong, in the most of the stations--I mean there, there weren't any black stations, were there in St. Louis [Missouri] when you were growing up, as such?  'Cause I, I don't think they, they really like started up until the--
Speaker 2: Well, no there, there, there wasn't until I got to be a teenager.  Now, if there was a black station, I didn't really listen to it during that time.  But when I got to be twelve and thirteen years old, there was KATZ.  There, there, there were some black stations coming in, and we would, we would be listening to them, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so during the early years you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you probably listened to the same popular music or a mixture of--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, a mixture--
Speaker 1: --everybody else was, yeah--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, exactly right, yeah.
Speaker 1: --the city listened to.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And they had, we had great--[cough]--great disc jockeys, Spider Burt [ph.], he was, he was one of 'em, and Rodney, Rodney--oh, geez, what was his name?  He ended up going to Chicago [Illinois], at WVON.
Speaker 1: Oh, Rodney--I know who you're talking about.  I can't think--
Speaker 2: Rod--
Speaker 1: --of his last, yeah.
Speaker 2: I knew him well too, but I can't think of his last name now, been so long ago--E. Rodney Jones, that's who I'm talk--E. Rodney Jones, yeah, right, right.  And so, so all of these, Dave Dixon and all these great disc jockeys were, were there in St. Louis.  And they had their own shows, and, and we, we would listen to them all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 180616
Speaker 1: I forgot to ask you the name of your middle school.  What, what was the name of your middle school?
Speaker 2: Middle school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Actually, we didn't have a middle school.
Speaker 1: Or a junior high school, you know--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No--
Speaker 2: We just went straight from--
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: --kindergarten straight to the eighth grade in the--
Speaker 1: So you were at Coles all the way through to high school?
Speaker 2: Say that again.
Speaker 1: You were at Coles?
Speaker 2: I was, I was at Cole School [Currently Cole Elementary St. Louis, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: C-O-L-E--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Cole--
Speaker 2: --Cole School all the way, all the way through the, to high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 180617
Speaker 1: When you were at Washington Technical High School [St. Louis, Missouri], you got with a band called the Emeralds, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was a senior--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --group called--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the Emeralds, right.  We, we sang all, all, all over, all over the place.  I mean we was (laughter), we were singing at all the dances and parties.  And, and actually, we were singing--I was telling you about Pevely Dairy.  There was a, there was a guy by the name of Russ Davis, who had a television show called 'The Pevely Hour.'  And he ended up putting The Emeralds on that show.  And that was one of our, our big debuts, as far as being on, on television.  That was--
Speaker 1: So this is local--
Speaker 2: --that was--
Speaker 1: --like a talent show sort--
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, no, no, no, it was, it was, it was called 'The Russ Davis Show.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was a major piano player.  I mean he was excellent.  And he, he wanted us on the show, and so he, he, he brought us on.  And we went on and sang a few numbers, and we--(unclear)--we, we, we became pretty hot around the, around in the city.
Speaker 1: Now, now did you help form the Emeralds, or did you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --join?  Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about that.  How did, how did you put, put it together?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's, it's you got a bunch of guys that, that was going to school with you.  And you knew these guys before you got to high school, you know.  And in fact, we'd, the group had started before we even got to high school.  We was in, in, in, in, in grade school, and what happened is that we started singing in some clubs.  And I'll never forget that we would sing in some clubs down at the, the, this burlesque houses.  You, you, you (laughter)--at the burlesque houses where I, I didn't, just too young to be in there.  But thank God I was just in there singing, you know.  And I'll, I'll never forget that, you know--(laughter).  On the first night when we went in there, and I didn't know what--all I knew was that there was some women in there changing clothes or doing whatever they were doing.  And we were standing there backstage ready to go on, to do our, to do our part of the show.  And when I looked on stage, I saw this woman doing her thing, and she didn't have on no clothes.  And so me being young, I was like, I couldn't believe my eyes.  What is this, you know?  And, and you know, in show business, you know, once you, you get used to it, that is what it is, you know.  And so, but that, that first night was exciting, you know.  And when she walked off stage, she walked right in front of me.  And I was like (laughter), I couldn't, I couldn't believe it.  What is this, you know?  But all she had on was this little g-string.  And that I know now, but I didn't know then, and so it was exciting for me.  But after about two days, it got old, you know, because Don was ready to sing, but that's, that's what I was there for, you know.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: And they could, they could dance around all night.  I was ready to do what I was there to do.
Speaker 1: Now what did your parents [Norris Oldham Davis and William Davis, Sr.] think about--I mean did they know?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: They--
Speaker 2: They didn't know I was out at, no.  In fact, if my mom had known I was out there, I probably wouldn't have been down there, you know, but no.  But my father, he, he didn't, he, my father was into what I wanted to do, you know, 'cause he knew I wanted to be a singer.  So he would let us go out, and he knew all of the guys were together.  And so that's, that's, that's, that's what we would do.  In fact, when we all got in high school and, and, and, and started singing with the Emeralds, my father as all, he was very supportive of everything that we did.  Even when we switched over from Saint, from being The Emeralds to the St. Gospel Singers, my father was with us then.  He managed us.  So--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --my father was always there with me supporting, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, who, who were the guys in The Emeralds?
Speaker 2: It was one, one guy was the name of Clyde Bradley, his brother, Roy Bradley, Elwood Beavers, Joe Humphreys, myself, a piano player was named Jack--I can't remember Jack's last name--and Lee Hawkins.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was, it was seven of us, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I, I read that you, you took up guitar in, in high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, well, I, I took up guitar because one of the reasons is that, you know, when you sing with a group, and you, your, your, your whole thing is, is, is--(unclear)--your dedication for what you're trying to do might not be someone else's.  And after you get tired of asking people to come to rehearsal, and, and, and, and, and, and you're sitting there waiting for 'em, and--[clearing throat]--and they show up an hour late, or, or you call one, and he's over at his girlfriend's house.  And then you, you know, after a while you start to say well, wait a minute.  I don't know how long I'm, I wanna deal with this.  So, what you do is I got a guitar, and I started learning the guitar.  And this would be my group, you know, so I could play the chords and sing with it, and so that's what happened.  That's how I learned how to play guitar, and, and, and found out--and I, and I used it to, I, I used the guitar after that to make money, and I started my own bands and everything.
Story_ID: 180618
Speaker 1: At seventeen you, you, you basically dropped out of high school [at Washington Technical High School, St. Louis, Missouri], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --how, how were things going in, in high school?  Was it because you were performing a lot, and you were focused on music, or, or what was, what was going on?
Speaker 2: No, well, I was performing. I was performing a lot even while I was in school, but that's not why I dropped out.  I dropped out of school because in, in the--my, my father [William Davis Sr.] and them were still in the lumber business.  And what happened, one day, my father, while I was in school, my father was in the woods.  And one of the workers was using a double-blade ax to cut down a tree, to finish it off.  They had sawed it.  They use those axes to finish it off to make the tree fall a certain way.  And a double-blade ax, he, he was swinging the ax, and when he swung it back this way, the ax came off.  And it was, it was going around like a, like a saucer.  And my dad was standing there, and the, and that, and the blade hit him in the top of the head.  And by it spinning, it, it spent around this way, and then spent around this way, and, and, and, and cut him, almost like scalped him.  And they had to take him to the hospital, and quite naturally, he had--I don't know--Eva said twenty-some stitches here and twenty stitches in the back, just and his head is swollen up, his head was swollen.  And, and when I, I came in and, and, and, 'cause I didn't come straight from school.  I always hung out, 'cause I still had, didn't know what had happened.  And when I came in, he was sitting at the table, and I saw him with this bandage on his head.  And I almost, I couldn't believe.  What happened, you know?  And they told me what had happened, you know.  And so, at that particular time, they were working, so he couldn't work.  And so my sister and them, my sisters wanted to go to college, you know.  So, I knew what I wanted to do in life, and thank God I'm able to do it, you know, because that's, it is my passion.  But I decided that I was gonna, you know, go out and work and get a, get a job and help my mother [Norris Oldham Davis]--'cause my father wasn't working--and, and, and to, to bring the money home to help my sister and them get what, their dream to go to college, and I could do what I, I wanted to do, 'cause I pretty well knew even at what I was doing, what I, what I wanted to do in life.  It was bas--it wasn't ball at that time.  My mind was made up on singing, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so, so you got a job outside of the fam, family business to help--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause at that particular time, once, once he got hit in the head, you know--I don't know--every started to slow down, you know, because his brother, wasn't really doing that much.  You know, so everything started to slow down, and, and I don't know what happened to the business 'cause I wasn't, wasn't, I wasn't thinking about wood business then.  I was thinking about show business, you know.  So, I don't, I don't know.  I think Ed, his brother must have closed the business down, or they, some kind of way they got together and, and, and dismantled it, you know.
Story_ID: 180619
Speaker 1: You dropped out of high school [Washington Technical High School, St. Louis, Missouri] in '55 [1955], right?

Speaker 2: Actually, I'm trying to think where did I work.  I, I worked downtown.  I know I worked downtown at a what you call it, metal, metal plating.  They, they, they plate it metal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know.  And I, I forgot how they, how they put it on.  It goes through some solution like that, you know, and then they take it out of the water and take it, put it in another solution and--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --and it just keeps--then you put these metal things down in the, in the tubs.  And the sa, this solution I think it, it's kind of--
Speaker 1: It's called metal plating or something--
Speaker 2: Metal plating, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And it, it, it, it, it transformed it onto the metal that, that you got in, inside the container.  And then you take it, rinse it off, and then you put it into something else, and it goes around and around, you, you know.  Next time it comes it's nice and shiny and chrome plated up, nickel plated, that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, now, you only did that for, well, I don't know how long you did it, but you and your father [William Davis, Sr.], it says here, bought the Havana Club.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: In '56 [1956].  This is just a year later.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE):  It's '58 [1958]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Fifty-eight [1958], yeah.
Speaker 1: It was '58 [1958], okay, all right.  So that corrects this.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: So, so you worked for the, the cleaning company for--
Speaker 2: For, for a couple of years, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how did this idea--so, so your father recovered from the ax wound?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he recovered.  He recovered from that and, and then not only that, then, then he had, had a little, little bout with arthritis.  So, you know, he was definitely looking for another career.  And he ended up, he ended up selling insurance just to, you know, to make some money.  And he did a good job at it, I have to say.  Then he decided--he knew he hit the ceiling at that particular time.  He knew I wanted the sing.  He knew that, that, that, that I had what it take, took to, to, to do something.  And so he, he, he decided to come, to get together with me, and we, we opened up the Havana Club.
Speaker 1: Now, the group, the Emeralds, the initial group, they morphed into, the changed their trajectory and became a gospel group--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --the St. Louis Gospel Sing[ers]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Singers, right.  And did you record any music?  Yeah, you did.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we recorded.  We made a, a, a record called 'I'm Saved.'
Speaker 1: Now were these new, new songs written by the group or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, one, one, one of the songs I've, I, I wrote called 'Lord I'm Satisfied.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and the other one was called 'I'm Saved.'
Speaker 1: Okay, so you wrote the songs for, for the group?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't write 'I'm Saved,' but I--
Speaker 1: Okay you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --wrote the other one.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, 'Lord I'm Satisfied.'
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Story_ID: 180620
Speaker 1: So by the time the club [Havana Club]--had, had you made a decis--'cause so many singers, you know, have--for instance, Sam Cooke, you know, had fame in both venues (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: As a gospel singer and as a--
Speaker 2: And then it was, then it's--
Speaker 1: Pop music, yeah.
Speaker 2: --got to do the pop music, right, right.
Speaker 1: Did--were you torn between which, which one you were gonna stick with--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in a way, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah.  I had, had, had grown to love gospel music, you know.  And so, but, but, but then, once the gospel groups, everybody started go to--they got older, and everybody started wanting to go their own separate ways.  And so, once we opened the club, then I formed another band.  'Cause see, now I'm playing guitar, and so I said okay, I got the club, let me form a band and put 'em in the club.  This is going to be my OJT.  'Cause see, my mind was always working toward where I was going, you know, so I knew that I had to learn stage presence.  I knew that I had to learn how to operate in front of--how, how to, how to, to work it, you know.  And so that's, that's what I did at, at the club.
Story_ID: 180621
Speaker 1: Did you have any particular mentors along the way?  I, I know your wife [HM Marilyn McCoo] talked about the fellow that helped her out, Eddie Beal I think it was.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But, but did you, did you have anybody that you, was helping--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It's always been me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was, and, and it was, it was always me and the encouragement of my father [William Davis Sr.] and my family, yeah, and that was it.  I never had a mentor.  I've had some people give me some advice but never a mentor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you, you really knew that you had to develop your stage presence and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the connection--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that, that's, that's one of the main reasons I wanted to, to do that, to, to, to have the club.
Speaker 1: So what was your repertoire in those days, you know, with your--
Speaker 2: What, with the guitar?
Speaker 1: Yeah, you and your guitar.
Speaker 2: Oh, I was singing, I was, I was singing the songs that I heard, like, at that particular time 'Thrill on the Hill' was, was, was big, you know: [singing] 'There's a thrill--
Speaker 1: Can you sing--
Speaker 2: --on the hill.
Speaker 1: Right, how it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: 'There's a thrill up on a hill, let's go, let's go, let's go, baum-baum, baum-baum.  There's a house party way 'cross town,' (laughter) that kind of thing, you know.
Speaker 1: Now this is, once again, this is an age when music is starting to change.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And rhythm and blues music--
Speaker 2: Rhythm and blues--
Speaker 1: Yeah, and what--
Speaker 2: --was coming in strong.
Speaker 1: --we, we, used to call rock 'n' roll before it became appropriated by the Rolling Stones and the rest of 'em.  It was--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: It wasn't with Chuck Berry and the people.
Speaker 2: Chuck Berry, (unclear) and Bert--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --all this, all these guys were coming out and was doing all that, doing all that music, you know, Johnnie Taylor, you know, you, you, you just--Chubby Checker, you know, just twist, the twist, all those, doing all those songs, you know.  We'd play the clubs.  We'd play the--so that's, that's the kind of music I was doing.  And then, plus I was doing some blues stuff in the club because that's another thing.  In the, in the club, people wanna hear blues too, you know.  So, all of that was happening, and plus we had a, we had a, in the, in the club we had a show.  We'd bring on a show.  We had dancers and, and comics, you know, come up and tell jokes and that kind of thing.  And it was, it was, it was, it was a real nightclub--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: So was it hard to get a deal on this nightclub?  I mean did, I mean how, how did you all manage to find it and, and, and, and acquire it?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, actually, it was already a club, but I think it was, it had gone out of business.  And see, when we, when we, when we saw and went and looked at it, we figure that this is as good a place as any, and it was in a great area, you know.  So that's, that's why we--then we took--(unclear)--(laughter), to decorate it we took a parachute, a, a regular parachute from a parachute and, and hung it in the, in the center of the dance, and it was beautiful, 'cause it, it, it was a beautiful color and just hung.  You know, we, the, the, the center of it we put up to the top, and it just hung all the way around, and it was really, really nice.  It, it blew my mind, but it was--that, that's, that's what it was and just showed the, what's going--that's where the stage was.  And that's where we would--the band sat be, behind that, and we just did shows, and, and we, we, we had a ball there.  And then that's when I got drafted.  I got drafted in the [U.S.] Army out of there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 180622
Speaker 1: So you got drafted, what, in '61 [1961]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so by this time, okay, so, did your father [William Davis, Sr.] maintain the club [Havana Club] after you--
Speaker 2: No, no, he didn't.  No, he, he let it go, you know, 'cause I was gone.  And he didn't want--he, he was, he just got in the way he didn't want to put up with all of that stuff, you know, so he let it go.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you got drafted, and you served in the U.S. Army, right--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for--and this is a time the Vietnam [War] is really not really going on yet.  So you, you, you're stationed--
Speaker 2: Right this is--
Speaker 1: --in Germany?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got, I got drafted during the Berlin Crisis.  You remember the Berlin Crisis when, yep.  And I remember they were, they were drafting all twenty-three-year-olds, whether you were married or married--single.  And I just happened to be married at the time with my first wife.  And (laughter) I, 'cause I was married and that I didn't, I didn't think--I thought I was gon' pass service.  I thought I'd gotten away from that because, 'cause I was married, you know.  And when they said that they were drafted twenty--all twenty-three-year-olds and regardless if you're married or single, that was me 'cause I was twenty-three years old at the time, and they, and they got me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you were able to--now you were stationed at Fort Chaffee in--
Speaker 2: Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --that's where I took my basic training.  You know, I did something very interesting in Fort Chaffee.  I have to pat myself on the back for this one.  I couldn't believe it, that I would take this, I would have the nerve to do something like this and I, and it was a fruit too, because (laughter) I, I, I was always one to see if I could try this.  You know, and, and in your platoon you have four, four companies, you know.  And, and each company, we, when we would march by the, the, the, the, the, the, the Grandstand, you would either salute or, or, or, or, or do something.  Well, I played the drums, 'cause I, I played the drums, and I, and I would march in the middle of the, of, of--there was one, two, me, and then one two.  And I taught each platoon how to sing a certain part of, of--what's that song--'My Country 'Tis of Thee.'  And, and, and, and, and I would go to each platoon and show 'em their parts, and we tried it.  And do you know when we marched by, we sung it; the whole company sung it, and I was playing the drums.  I couldn't believe.  I--it was a fluke, but it happened, you know.  I said look at this.  I said I'm going crazy (laughter), but it's happening, you know.  And, and, and the, and the, this, the captains, and the majors, and generals were standing back there.  They're looking at who is this coming through here singing?  And the guys were carrying their rifles and singing 'My Country 'Tis of Thee.'  I couldn't believe it.  And, and I said it could be done, and I did it, you know.  And then now, the, one of the things that happened out of that is that now, I had to play the drums for us to march (laughter).  I never wanted to do that.  But anyway, they got used to hearing the drum and carrying the beat, so that's what I ended up doing, playing the drums and, and, and--
Speaker 1: So your early--
Speaker 2: --marching--
Speaker 1: Your days of the drum and bugle corps paid off--
Speaker 2: Paid off (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 2: Right and, and knowing the harmonies, knowing how to sing harmony, is teaching the, teaching the guys.  I didn't even know if they could hold the notes, you know, 'cause most people can't hold a harmony note, you know, but they did.
Story_ID: 180623
Speaker 1: They took you Fort Knox [Kentucky], right, next, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, after, after, after I left Fort Chaffee [Arkansas], I went to Fort Knox.  They sent me to turret school.  I worked on tanks in the turret, you know, that goes around.
Speaker 1: Right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And, yeah, with the big gun in the middle, yeah, right, right, and the breechblock in behind.  And so, yeah, and I was there.  I forgot how long I was there.  But, then, then, then my next assignment was from there over to Germany--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --where I was stationed in Nuremberg, Germany, at Merrell Barracks.
Speaker 1: That's where they had the famous trials, right, of the Nazis--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Nuremberg, yeah.  Yeah, I was, I was right--(unclear)--in fact, I walked so, I walked guard at Soldier's Field.  That's where they had 'em, had it.  But they had the trials in Nuremberg, yeah.  And we were stationed in Merrell Barracks.  I don't know if you know the story about Merrell Barracks?  Merrell Barracks is where they taught--is where the SS [Schutzstaffel] troops were stationed, Hitler's SS troops.  And when they were fighting the war, there was, in, in at Merrell Barracks there's a tunnels that go from down below the barracks, all the way around the city, and come out at, at Soldier's Field, where you--where we walked guard, 'cause Soldier's Field was huge.  That's where they had all the major parades, and the tanks would come out.  And so when they fighting the, the war, when the Americans would come up to try to, to, to penetrate to get into the, their barracks, they would go underground, and come back around, and come behind the Americans and start firing on 'em from their back.  And at this particular time it wasn't called Merrell Barracks.  But this, their soldier, Merrell, it was a black solider, figured it out for 'em.  He figured out what had happened, even though he got killed.  That, that's, that's how they ended up taking it, because what happened, he figured out that these, these, these guys are doing something.  They coming back around behind us killing our men.  And so then the next time they laid for 'em.  And then when, when Merrell got killed, they named it at SS Kaserne Merrell Barracks.  That's how--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --that's how it ended up with his name, yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm glad you told that story.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: I've never heard that.
Speaker 2: --Merrell Barracks, yeah.  You don't hear about it that much, but that's, that's how it, that's how it happened.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I'll remember that one.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 180624
Speaker 1: So, now at some point there, you formed a, a band called the Kingsmen.
Speaker 2: The Kings--yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: I know, when I heard that name--
Speaker 2: I told you, I told you (laughter)--
Speaker 1: --I thought of 'Louie Louie,' but that, that's not, that's, that's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, no, no--
Speaker 1: --different Kingsmen, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: -no, no.  Yeah, I was always forming bands, you know.  And, and, and another great thing that happened for me, you know, is, is I have to say the Lord was working with me, you know, even though I was a bad actor, He was still working with me (laughter).  And because I was able to, I was able to, to have a band, work in special services, but not in special service where I had to TDY [temporary duty], away from my unit.  I was in special service and still was in my unit.  And so, but being in special service there at that, it enabled me to, to, to work during the day at, at my company, but I could also rehearse my, my, my.  And we could also play in the officer's clubs, the NCO [non-commissioned officer] clubs, and the EM, the Enlisted Men's club, EM clubs, and I played all of 'em--excuse me--and, and that which was great because now, with me being in special service, I could make some money.  I could make--they had to pay me from the officer's club to EM, NTO clubs and the EM clubs.  So I was making money there, and, and then plus, I would take my band on the Strauss and play some of the German clubs on the weekends when we had our all--when we had our passes, you know.  So, so it was, it was really nice.  And, and, and then they, they enabled me to be able to keep my guitar in my locker, which was unheard of because, you know, in the [U.S.] Army you don't get a chance to do that, you know, especially during those, those years.
Speaker 1: Now that seems like a pretty good tour--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I had, I had my, my guitar and my amplifier in my locker.  And I was a music maker.  I was like the pied piper.  I couldn't believe it, yeah.  All the soldiers would follow me and my band to all these places, to the clubs.  In fact, we played at one club in, in Furth [Germany], about twenty miles out of Nuremberg [Germany].  It, it, it, it was a, the hospital club.  And, and, and, and the hospital--(laughter)--when we come out there and started playing, well, they, they--it got to be so bad that the soldiers that was out there couldn't get in their club, because all of our people would come out there to hear us.  And by the time they got off from work, the club would be packed.  So they'd have, they had to stop that because so some of the guys could get in their own club.  You know, that, that was, that was, that was, that was really nice.  It was, it was a feather in my cap but creating all the problems, you know.
Story_ID: 180625
Speaker 1: So while you were there [Germany] did, were you making any connections stateside for when you came back, or, or, or were, were you thinking about what, what you were gonna, you were gonna do?
Speaker 2: Well, the only connection I made coming back home, and this is another great story, but there was one of the guys in, in, in, in my, in, in a company.  His name was Clayton [ph.].  And Clayton had a brother that stayed in White Plains, New York.  And he, Clayton was always telling me about his brother and his bands.  He got a band, you know, and but I want you to stop in New York and, and, and, and, and, and see my brother's band.  So, well, quite naturally, when we came back, we came back on the--(unclear)--across the Atlantic on a ship.  And when we got to New York, I had a couple of days there before I go back to St. Louis.  And I said okay, well, I'll go up to White Plains with you, and, and listen to your brother's band.  So we went--I went up to White Plain and--(unclear)--sounded pretty good.  And so I got another one of my old crazy ideas.  I said why don't we (laughter), I said why don't we--why don't I call the, the, the Apollo, you know, the Apollo Theater in New York [New York].  And, and, and tell 'em that I'm coming through.  I'm coming from Germany, and I wanted to stop in and see if about doing a selection, you know.  And, and I called in, and I said, I said this is Billy Davis, Jr.  I said I'm, I'm passing through.  I'm just coming from Germany, and I'd like to stop in and, and, and see about doing a couple of tunes.  Sure enough, they said well, can you bring your band down?  Can, when can you come down?  So, I knew I didn't have but a couple of days there, so I can say I, I can down tonight, you know.  So I told these guys--I went and rehearsed with them.  I went down, and, and I'll never forget they put us on at the Apollo.  This was one of my dreams, you know, to play the Apollo.  And I, and I sung a song called 'Personality,' you know, Lloyd--what's his name.
Speaker 1: Lloyd Price.
Speaker 2: Lloyd Price, yeah, it's--
Speaker 1: [Singing] Personality--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you've got personality walk with personality, that one.   And (laughter) I'll never forget we went out there and the people went crazy, you know.  So, I, I, when I got off stage, it was, I'll never forget it was a one-armed guy who was working there.  And he said now, now, now, Billy, how long can you stay?  I said well, I have to catch a train tomorrow.  I, I have to go back to St. Louis [Missouri] 'cause I, that's where I live, you know.  And he said, he said that's too bad, he say, because I could make some plans for you, you know.  I said well, I'm sorry I can't say, you know, because I, then I had to catch train 'cause I was already booked.  And, and, and, and Clayton's brother and them, they had to go back to White Plains [New York], you know.  So I didn't have a, anything together there to really work with, you know.  So, and it really wasn't a plan to stay there, so, so I came back.  But I, I, I, then I thought as I was on the train (laughter), I said boy, you done worked Apollo Theater.  (Laughter) I was, I was cracking myself up with all of these, these ideas and taking a chance.  It's all about taking a chance, you know, and, and it happened.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: Then when I got to--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --St. Louis I was kind of like, well, that's it.  I'm home now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this is like, you have a real entrepreneurial attitude towards--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --your art--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know what I mean, and you're, you're able to form these groups and then make 'em successful--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --even the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --even the platoon, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and I'm, I'm, I'm still doing the same thing today, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you go back, you're back in St. Louis [Missouri].  This is in '63 [1963].  This is in what, what month in, is, do you get back?
Speaker 2: I think I got back around, what, September.
Speaker 1: In the fall--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: In the fall.  I think it was somewhere in the fall, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, about--okay, okay.  '63 [1963] was a pivotal year in the history of this country with a lot of, you know, civil rights activity during the summer and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, the March on Washington and then the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a lot of stuff going on, yeah.
Speaker 1: The bombing in Birmingham [Alabama] in the church, the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --death, the assassination of John Kennedy [President John F. Kennedy].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: The Cuban Missile Crisis, I think--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: No, that was '60 [1960].  Was that 62 [1962]?
Speaker 2: --that was, that was, that was, yeah--
Speaker 1: That was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was, that was--
Speaker 1: '62--[1962], yeah, the summer before--I mean the, the fall before.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because it--yeah, that, that's, that's why I was there, you know--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --'cause all of that stuff was brewing--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, yeah.  And, but--
Speaker 1: '62 [1963] was the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: '63 [1963] was all that, that, John Kennedy and, and it was, it was, it was crazy.  I was in St. Louis, and you know, just watching things as they, as they, as they happened.  And then right behind that, I, I think I was, I, I think I was in California now, when the Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy]--
Story_ID: 180626
Speaker 1: Here, I have a note here that you and your father [William Davis, Sr.] opened a second nightclub.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the county [Missouri]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --called the Oriole.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Club Oriole, yeah.
Speaker 1: It reminds me of Rock'n Robin now.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, yeah, we opened that club, and, and it was, it was, it was, that, that club was, was, was a bigger club because it was, at first it was a theater.  And, and we made it into a, a nightclub, and I put my band out there and started, started--then I, then I got there and--
Speaker 1: Well, this is, this is a new band you, you, you put together once you got back to St. Louis [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2: Well, actually, myself and my cousin, 'cause I, my, I have people who, kinfolks that play, you know, one play bass, and, and the other played drums.  David Randy played drums.  I played the guitar.  Then we had some other people that I, I, I, that, that we got on--I think it was Benny Smith that I had playing guitar too.  And I forgot, I forgot who I had, who I had playing drums--I mean not drums, horn.  It wasn't Raymond.  It wasn't Raymond.  I forgot, I forgot, I forgot, but anyway--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --I said I'll just put the band together, you know, and, and, and we will work there.
Speaker 1: So what, what was the group called?  Did you have a name or it?
Speaker 2: It was just called Billy Davis, Jr. and the All-Stars, 'cause I call them All-Stars because they, they all were, were, they, they were all their own, they were all their own stars, you know.  And you, you put 'em together then, you know, nobody wanted to be--everybody wanted to be known, so you just put 'em together and let 'em do what they do.
Story_ID: 180627
Speaker 1: In '64 [1964], you separated from your first wife, right?  Was that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --that '64 [1964]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, yeah, we, we, we separated and because well, one of the things in--we, we got along.  We got along.  We didn't--we, we, but we separated because, you know, during those, during those times, you know, you know, if you wanted to be a, a performer, you know, you, you were always taking a chance, always, 'cause you never knew what was gonna happen.  But most of the performers that I knew, they would get out and get a job, and they would get married to the job.  And our biggest thing was she wanted me to get a job at the post office for security, which is normal, you know.  And that--
Speaker 1: By this time you, you had a GED [degree] from the arm, from--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: From the [U.S.] Army, yeah, right, right, right.
Speaker 1: --so you, you finished high school?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so that wasn't gelling with my, with my, with my, my life, you know, because my passion was still singing, you know, and, and she knew that.  And so we, we, we, we decided to break it off because it wasn't going--it, it, it wasn't gonna happen, you know.  I wasn't gonna be tied down to a job.  The only time I, I was tied down to a job was when I was in transition, you know, going from one thing to another one where I had to get a job, make enough money to do something to get back into business, back into show business, which happens to a lot of performers, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, this is a tension point in the life of a lot of artists.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you either get a good job or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, get a good job for security.
Speaker 1: --or, and get and stop--
Speaker 2: Yeah, or either--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --you got out here and starve and see what you're gonna do, yeah.  So I think a lot of it is, is how much do you believe in yourself, that, that you can do it, you know.  See, I've always believed; I've never stopped believing in myself to be able to do something.
Story_ID: 180628
Speaker 1: Now you left St. Louis [Missouri] in '65 [1965].  Now, did you, did you know your friends were out there, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --[HM] Lamonte [McLemore] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, well, Lamonte's brother, Donald, he was coming through St. Louis.  And I had talked to him, and I had, I had called Lamonte and asked him, you know, if he knew anybody at Motown Records on the West Coast, and he said yes.  He said I know the president on the, of the West Coast.  I said wow, that's great.  I said do you think you can get me a, a, an appointment with him.  I said I wanna go, I wanna meet him, so I go see about getting with the company.  Lamonte asked me, said well, can you sing?  I said, I said yeah, yeah.  I say, I said you get the appointment.  I'll do the rest, you know, and so he did.  And at that particular time, his brother was coming through St. Louis visiting some of the, his people.  So that was my ride out to Los Angeles [California].  So Dunk came through--Donald--
Speaker 1: He actually drove, he drove back from L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and was going back, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he drove--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --from L.A. coming to see his family.  And then we got--he picked me up now on the way back and, and drove back to California.  I drove with him--
Speaker 1: How, how--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: --how many hours is it from St. Louis to Los Angeles?
Speaker 2: Oh it's--
Speaker 1: Or how many days is it?
Speaker 2: It's about a day or so, or, or more.  It's according to how long you wanna stay on the road, you know, 'cause we stopped in Denver [Colorado] and stayed overnight in Denver.  And then we left Denver and came, came into L.A. the next day.  But what, what happened was a, a, a, a, a crazy story happened because the night before I left to come to L.A. [Los Angeles, California], I played in a club with another friend of mine.  His name is Jasper Thomas.  Jasper used to be the drummer for Chuck Berry.  So, so, but, but both of us were hitting the sauce at the time.  And so we, we, we, we played, and, and, and when we finished the job that night, I know I was going to be going out to California the next day.  So what happened is I had my guitar and my amp, and instead of--he, he packed his drums in the, in the trunk.  Usually, I would have put my guitar and amp in the trunk of the car, but I put 'em in the backseat.  And drinking, I, I didn't think about it.  And so on the way home we decided that we was gon' stop and get some barbecue.  So we stopped, and when we stopped somebody broke in the car and stole my amp and the, and, and, and my guitar that I was taking to California, 'cause that was gon' be my working tools.  And so, what happened was, I came out of the barbecue place, and they got me home.  And I opened the trunk, and I said hey, man, my guitar and my amp's not in (laughter)--so, it was, it was, in, it was in the car that we figured out, so.  Anyway, I came on out to California anyway.  But once I came out to California without a, without a, something to work with, I knew I had to get a job, you know.  So I got a job when I came out there.  And then once I got a job, I, I ended up buying another guitar and an amp, so, to start, to start--see, you buying what you need to get started again.  Then I started playing in some clubs, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then wasn't long after that that Lamonte and I sat down and started talking about starting a group.  But I, I, at the time, I didn't wanna start a group.  We talked about it.  I said Mack, I said you know, I'm out here looking for a contract.  I said now, if we wanna do this for a hobby, that's fine, you know.  I said 'cause I like group singing.  I've always done group singing.  I say but if anything happened with this, with, with this audition, you know, I'm gone, you know, so.
Story_ID: 180629
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-five [1965], Los Angeles, California, The Versatiles are formed.  And I think now you, Mr. Davis [HM Billy Davis, Jr.], you're involved in the, the conceptualization of The Versatiles.
Speaker 2: Right, right, actually, when I came in from St. Louis [Missouri] to California, I was staying with [HM] Lamonte [McLemore], because I, like I said, we, we knew each other when we were kids.  And so, as we were hanging out and moving around to different parties, I'm, I'm there waiting for my Motown connection, we started talking about group singing.  And he said well, what, what do you think about us getting together, you know, just having a group?  And I said well, Lamonte, I said I don't mind that because I love group singing.  I said but you know I came out here to, to, for an audition with Motown, and, and, and if anything happens, I'm, I'm gonna be gone, you know.  He said that's all right.  He said we're just gon' be a hobby.  I said well, hey, as a hobby, let's go for it.  And then he said well, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll check and, and on Marilyn [HM Marilyn McCoo], who used to sing with the Hi-Fi's, and, and Fritz [Baskett], and, and we'll use Ronald [Townson], 'cause Ronald had been coming around 'cause we had been talking.  You know, Ronald didn't know nothing about starting a group just that, but until we--
Speaker 1: This is [Ronald] Ron Townson, just to--
Speaker 2: Ron Townson--
Speaker 1: --those--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  And so we, we, we, we went for it, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, three brothers from St. Louis involved.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Marilyn McCoo, now, now what happened that Fritz didn't want to be part of--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Fritz, Fritz was doing some other things.  She was writing songs, and she had someone in her life who did not want her to be part of the group.  So she said no, she couldn't do it, so, so, all of us were together talking about we needed another woman because we knew the sound that we could get with three guys and two girls.  And so we decided to, to have an audition.  And so, there was a young woman by the name of Rose who auditioned and [HM] Florence LaRue.  And Rose was a friend of mine, and I was saying oh, I hope Rose can do it.  Oh, yeah, it'll be so much fun to be in the group with Rose.  And they sang, and it (laughter), there was no question (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Florence, you know, we, we knew that Florence was the one that could bring so much to the group.  And so, so we asked her, and she, she was, she wanted to do it.
Speaker 1: I think we, we said this on camera that, that Florence LaRue also won the talent competition in the Miss Bronze [California]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes, she did.  She, she won the Grand Talent Award the year after I did, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  So I already knew she could sing.  I just didn't know if Rose could sing.  And Rose was not really a singer, you know.
Speaker 1: Said something about the judges for the Miss Bronze competition too (laughter), that they know what they're doing I guess, so they--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  I think so.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Actually, I was there that year when Florence won.  And you know, it was, it was a, it was a good call.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you got--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --got five.  So, why five?  Was there--be, because of the parts, the vocal parts or what?
Speaker 2: Well, that's, that was one of the reasons.  And, and then the two girls and, and three guys looked good.  It's, it's a good combination, and, and plus, like you said, the vocal parts.  We, we, we--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --we, we, we could get the, the full chords--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah, musically--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --musically, there were so many possibilities that you can accomplish with, with five voices, with two women and, and three men vocals, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I know the, the, The Temptations are considered by many to be one of the better vocal groups of all time, male vocal groups.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 2: And there are five of them, you know.  And I just wondered if the number five what, what--in terms of, you know, musical possibilities.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes, it's absolute, absolutely opens up all kinds of possibilities.
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things you gotta have is, is, is the guys in, in all-male groups, you gotta have the guys who can, who can sing those high parts strong.  So, so, with, with, with ladies, I mean they just automatically sing up there, you know.  But with guys you gotta have somebody that's very strong so they can blend with the, with the bottom voices.
Story_ID: 180630
Speaker 1: This may be a good time to ask this question, but how would you two typify your voices?  I mean how, how would you, what, what kind of voice do you, would you describe that you have?  I mean how would you describe your voice and your, your singing styles, I mean individually and-
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Oh, wow.  Well, I am basically a pop singer.  I always have been.  But through the years, I have learned a lot from working with [HM] Billy [Davis, Jr.].  Billy has added a lot I think to, to my sound and to my approach so that I have been able to include more additional sounds that I was not able to do before I met him.
Speaker 1: For instance?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Like runs that I sing now that I couldn't sing before.  And he, he used to laugh at me because I would start practicing these runs, and I would hit them, and I would miss them, and, but he--but I never stopped trying, you know.
Speaker 1: Now what do you mean by runs, for those who don't know?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Like if you say (singing) hey [stretched out], you know, doing like, those kind of, I call them vocal calisthenics.  And you know, when I first started singing, I sang very straight.  But then I started listening to Billy and, and the interesting things that he did and the interesting things that other singers out there were doing.  Then Billy told me you could do them too.  You just have to work on them, and so I started working on them.
Speaker 1: Yet, today's gospel singers, it, it was some--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Amazing--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --maybe over do some of those runs.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, some of 'em go overboard.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, that's where style comes in.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  You know, some people will sing all kinds of runs just to impress you with how many runs they can sing.  What I tried to do was I tried to incorporate that technique into my interpretation of a song that I happen to be singing.  And, and sometimes, I always wanna make sure that the people know what the melody is supposed to be.  And that was where I differed from, you know, the other singers.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well, myself, like I said earlier, I, I'm used to singing all types of music, so, so that, that, that way I don't, I didn't even think that I had a style.  But I, but my, my voice is very recognizable.  But I can sing just about anything that I set my mind to, so I guess that, that comes from listening and rehearsing different types of music and just really appreciating all of the different styles of music, so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you, you have a powerful voice.  I think everybody would agree with that.  But you didn't have any formal training, right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Not, not form, but a little bit.  I've, I've, I've, I've studied, you know, but not, not ex, extensively, no.  But it was just, it was just a gift, you know.  And, and it's a gift, and it's just, it's, thank God it's still there, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, The Versatiles are formed.  Now what is the, what is the, I guess the importance of the name?  I mean does, does a name--did you, you all spend a lot of time thinking about what the name was gonna be and what--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  (Laughter) No.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) The reason that's so funny is, is when you say spent a lot of time.  I think we spent every bit of maybe--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Five minutes (laughter).
Speaker 2: --five minutes or a day or whatever just, just hanging, hanging out with it, because one of the, one of the things is that by it being different type voices in the group, we thought we could sing, we, we thought we could sing anything 'cause we were, it was so versatile.  We wasn't all like--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right.
Speaker 2: --type of singers.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  We didn't give it a lot of thought because this wasn't something that we were going to be doing on a serious level, you know.  Billy and I were both hoping for our own individual careers.  And The Versatiles were just a hobby.
Speaker 2: A hobby, that's right.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  It was an opportunity for us to get together with three more people who really loved music like we loved music.  And we had a lot of fun working on different harmonies and, and working on different approaches.
Story_ID: 180631
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now tell us about Rene DeKnight.  That was your first conductor, as such, a musical director, I guess.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, Rene came into our lives--who brought Rene into our--?
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  [HM] Lamonte [McLemore] (laughter).
Speaker 2: Lamonte, Lamonte, Lamonte was the key man with all these people.  But he came into our lives and he was listening to a group.  And he, and he said well, you know, I think you guys really have something on the ball.  I'd like to come in and, and kind of help work with you with, with some arrangements and some, and, and--'cause Rene sung with the--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  The Delta Rhythms.
Speaker 2: --The Delta Rhythms Boys.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so he said I can, I can, I can bring so much to you that you're gonna need during this particular times of, of your career, and, and he did.  He really did.  He had taught us so much, how to act, how to be on time, what, what to expect, what, on the road that we were on, and because he had been through it.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Rene was really a mentor for the group.
Speaker 2: Sure, yes.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Because Rene had, like you said, baby, you know, he came from the Delta Rhythm Boys.  He had been in the business a long time.  He understood how the business worked.  We came in loving music but not necessarily on the ball when it came to what was expected, you know, like being on time (laughter).  Like Rene used to tell us, when you get ready to do a TV show, do not come in there a half-hour late.  These people are spending their money, and they're not gonna look too kindly on the group if you all don't know how to be on time.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  If you wanna have opportunities, you have to be on time.  And he used to drum those things into us: come in ready to go; don't come in not knowing your parts; don't come in not knowing what you're supposed to do.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  I mean he taught us a lot of really important things that helped to make The 5th Dimension as highly re- respected as we were once we started getting to be known.
Speaker 2: So I, what I hear you saying in a lot of ways is talent is not enough.  I mean if--
Speaker 1: Oh no.
Speaker 2: --if you--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Talent is just the beginning.
Speaker 2: That's just the beginning.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean all the other, all the other things are just as important, 'cause I mean you can be one of the greatest singers in the world.  But if you come in there a half an hour late, and they got a show going, hey, I'm sorry, you know, 'cause it's another great singer standing outside waiting to come in and sing.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  That's on time.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's on time, yeah.
Speaker 1: You were, you were telling, just be, before we leave Rene DeKnight, you were telling us that he was married to Sally Blair off camera.  And you--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: This is someone that I think a lot of people had forgotten about.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  I wanted to say one more thing.  There's so much to say about Rene DeKnight--
Speaker 1: About Rene, yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --that I would really love to add that Rene taught us about how to put together an entertaining live show--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --because The 5th Dimension came along, and we started recording hits.  But one thing that really worked for us was that when people came to see us live, they left raving about the quality of live performance that we, that we gave them.  And that really worked so well for us.  And Rene, again, had learned all of that from his years with The Delta Rhythm Boys and his own gift, what he was able to bring to them and what he brought to us.  And he taught us about how to do all these different kinds of music and how to give them energy, how to give them drama.  He was just, he was a very important part of the success of the group.
Speaker 1: And one, one more thing about Rene, Rene would write arrangements for the group--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: --and write 'em out in, on, on, on the music paper, and we would have to read them.  And it, it was just, it was, it was all learning; it, it was a learning process for us.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So, so everybody in the group could, could read the, read music after they, they were trained by Rene.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, we could read better--
Speaker 2: Well, we could read better--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --than we did before (laughter).
Speaker 2: --yeah right, right, right, right, right.  I mean when you look at it long enough, you, you know.  If, if you had any kind of music training, you know, you'll, you'll know how to, how to deal with it, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: I know I've, I've interviewed people that had, that could not read.  I mean, you know, that, that were successful, but they couldn't read music.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: They couldn't do--(unclear)--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  I mean we--
Speaker 1: It's a lot--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --we didn't end up being--
Speaker 1: --out there that--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  We were crack readers.  I mean we just, we were able to do better after working with Rene than we had before.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, all right, so, oh, Sally--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Sally was an, an amazing singer, extremely talented.  She came along at the time of [HM] Diahann Carroll and Barbara McNair and just a wonderful talent.  Unfortunately, she never, she never had her moment like, like Barbara did and of course, like Diahann Carroll has had an amazing career.  But Sally was, she was a wonderful singer.
Speaker 2: Okay, she was married to--Rene.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  A very pretty woman.
Speaker 2: --Rene.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  She was married to Rene, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was married to Rene, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 180632
Speaker 1: So The Versatiles, what--did The Versatiles get--did they get the kind of break that The Hi-Fi's got in terms of catching on with some of the--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  You know, what happened with The Versatiles is that we ended up going up to Motown Records.  And you know, here we are, this was supposed to be a hobby now.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  But good old [HM] Lamonte [McLemore] (laughter), he's going up and saying Marc, you know, talking to Marc Gordon, who was the--
Speaker 1: Who he knew--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --who's running the West Coast office of Motown Records.  And Marc you need to hear our group.  And so, so then Lamonte comes and says, well, why don't we go in and, and record.  And we said Lamonte, this is supposed to be a hobby (laughter).  He said but yeah, but if, if we record something, and they like it, and they wanna release it, you know, are we gonna say no?  And so all of us said well, no, we wouldn't say no, not if they wanna release something we record.  So, anyway, so we went to Motown.
Speaker 2: Well, it, it gave us a chance to record.  That's, that's, that's what we were out there for.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: And like our parents [William Davis Sr. and Norris Oldham Davis] used to always teach us, you know, if you get something going, follow it through because you can never tell what's gonna happen.  And I always looked at, at, at, at opportunities as being able to build on 'em, and if something happened there, we could always build on that, you know, so.  And that's what happened.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  So what happened was we went into the studio.  We did record a few things.  The, the songs were sent back to the, the Motown offices in Detroit [Michigan] where they would have these listening sessions.  And they would decide whether or not they thought the songs were going to be a hit.  They never chose any of ours.  But what happened was that Marc, for whatever reason, ended up leaving Motown in Los Angeles and came to the group and said I believe in your guys, and I wanna manage you.  Well, I mean, here we are, talking to the guy that used--that was just the head of Motown in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and he wants to manage the group.  So we said well, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, okay.  We were ready.  We were, well, we were ready to go, you know.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And so, so Marc left, and, and he started trying to get us a deal.  And he ended up being approached by Johnny Rivers.  Johnny Rivers had a lot of hit songs, poor side of town 'Secret Agent Man.'
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  He, he had had a very--he was having a very successful--
Speaker 2: And he was--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --recording.
Speaker 2: --then--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  He was, he was with Liberty Records, and, and he was also a very smart businessman.  And so he convinced Liberty that they should give him a label deal.  And so, which meant that he could go in and start recording artists on his own record label, and so they agreed to do that.  And then Johnny approached Marc Gordon and said I have a label deal.  I wanna go in and record some stuff.  And I love R and B, and you have an R and B background.  Why don't we work together?  And so Marc said I have an act I want you to hear.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, so this is--
Speaker 1: That was the connection, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is still, this is like 1966 about now?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  This is 1966.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-six [1966], yeah.
Story_ID: 180633
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  So Johnny Rivers comes to us--well, comes to Marc [Gordon], and with a song, he says I think I have a song that's gonna be a big hit for the group.  It was a song that had been recorded on a Mamas and Papas album called 'Go Where You Wanna Go.'  So, Marc brought the song to us, and it was really, really pop.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when we heard it we said but this is just--I don't know if this is gon' be a great song, you know, because it was so pop it didn't sound like nothing we would ever do.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right it wasn't our style.
Speaker 2: No.  And, and Johnny kept saying this is gonna be a hit for you guys.  You know, and, and, and somebody who's having hits, they keep saying this is gonna be a hit for you guys, well, well, right away we're thinking: maybe we're not hearing it; maybe, maybe, maybe--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Maybe we're missing something here.
Speaker 2: --may, maybe we're missing, maybe it could be a hit.  But you know, Johnny was right.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  So we went in and recorded it.  And then they were getting ready to release it as our single, and so then they came back and said you gotta do something about that name.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  (Laughter) The Versatiles is kind of old-timey--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  You know, they're coming up with these new sounding, you know--
Speaker 2: These names that--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --names for groups.
Speaker 2: You know, this is kind of passe, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: This is an age where psychedelic--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right--
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --exactly.
Speaker 1: --were taking about, you know--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Mind expansion and--(unclear)--so.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  So we had a meeting, and everybody went home and came back with suggestions for, for a name for the group.  And Ron Townson and his wife, Bobbett (ph.), had put their heads together and had come up with an idea of calling the group The 5th Dimension.  Well, then we got a chance to vote, but after we heard the, the name The 5th Dimension, I mean it was like--
Speaker 2: It was like a--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --it was a done.
Speaker 2: --slam dunk.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, everybody knew, well, 5th Dimension, that's a great name, you know.  We're gonna--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  So we all put our--
Speaker 2: --and we all voted for that (laughter).
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --yeah, we all put our, our little papers in the hat, you know, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --and it was unanimous The 5th Dimension was the way to go.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, so, 5th Dimension is the title that you all--did the--
Speaker 1: Agreed to.
Speaker 2: --name of the group that you go forward with--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 2: --go where you want to go?
Speaker 1: Um-hum, um-hum.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And we ended up with a top twenty record.
Speaker 1: A top twenty record.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And it kind of--
Speaker 1: Which hit the pop charts.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that was the, the big, the big charts, you know, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, there's more money in the pop chart.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  I mean the R and B charts were, you know, where our minds were.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  But the pop charts were like you said, where the big money was.
Speaker 1: Right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And so that, that launched--that was the beginning--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --of The 5th Dimension.
Speaker 1: And it kind of makes you like a, I guess the shopworn phrase is cross-over group.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --exactly right, right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  We crossed over right away.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I know when I heard it on the radio, I wasn't sure who it was.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right or what it was (laughter).
Speaker 2: I mean I knew, I knew the song.  I'd heard it somewhere, but it sounded, it sounded good.  But I wasn't sure it was a black group.  I wasn't--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  No, no.
Speaker 2: Well, nobody, nobody knew, you know, until they saw the album cover.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  That wasn't the plan either.  The plan--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --was just to--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --go, go in and record the song and see if we could get a hit out of it.  Nobody was trying to fool the market.
Speaker 2: No.  And we tried to make it sound as hip as we could, you know, as, as, as the song would allow, you know.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: But Johnny was on the producing side.  He was, "No say it right there," you know.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And, and Marc too.
Speaker 2: And Marc, yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right.
Story_ID: 180634
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  So now we go back in to record the album.  And Johnny [Rivers] had said to Marc [Gordon] well, you know we need a new songwriter, somebody new, and fresh, and different.  And Marc said to Johnny well, you know there was a young man who used to hang out at the Motown offices all the time.  He's a young man from Oklahoma.  His name is Jimmy Webb.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  He said and he's a fine songwriter, and I think that we should put, put him and the group together, and he can come up with some good material for the group.  And Jimmy Webb came up with 'Up, Up and Away.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That, one of many, yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 2: Now Jimmy Webb, he, he's been describe as kind of like a, a person that doesn't really fit into any category, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --like--so, that accounted for people basically ignoring him for a long time, you know, until--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Until, until 'Up, Up and Away,' right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right, you know, and sometimes it takes--timing is everything.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And for Jimmy, the timing hit.
Speaker 1: Was right on for, with The 5th Dimension.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean he had been bouncing around Motown trying to peddle his songs.  And, and it just happened that when he, when he, when he came to Marc and Johnny Rivers that, that this whole thing clicked, clicked for him, and this was his time.  And he, he started producing with Marc and writing songs, and he--and actually, I think they, that Motown used one of his songs that Billy Eckstine called 'Didn't We.'
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'Didn't We,' he wrote that, and 'Up, Up and Away,' and he wrote just about everything on that, that first album.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, he wrote about, he wrote--well, Willie Hutch had some songs in there too.
Speaker 1: Willie Hutch, that's Willie Hutch, yeah--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --right, right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  So I'd say Jimmy wrote probably close to half of the songs on that--
Speaker 1: On the 'Up, Up and Away'--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --on our first album.
Speaker 1: --right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, that, it's interesting '67 [1967] on the Top 40 stations are playing Aretha Franklin, playing Sergio Mendes--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: --'Fool on the Hill,' 'The Look of Love,'--(unclear)--(unclear)--I mean it was interesting times 'cause they were also playing, playing like more, more of the, you know, Jim Morrison and--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh yeah, yeah, right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And the Doors.
Speaker 1: The Doors, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: The Turtles.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And the--yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were playing all of that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 2: Buffalo Springfield.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Un-huh.
Speaker 2: Right, right--
Story_ID: 180635
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO: 'For What It's Worth'.
Speaker 2: 'For What It's Worth.'
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah, that's what I was thinking about when I--yeah.  And so, there was a, quite a mixture of music out there.  And we really didn't think that 'Up, Up and Away' would ever be picked as a single.  We just liked the song.  It was a feel-good song.  It was like, 'Up, Up and Away' was to 1967 what 'Happy' is--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: --for 2014.  I mean 'Happy' is huge.  'Up, Up and Away' was huge.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And when you heard the song, it made you feel good.  You could be stuck in traffic, bumper--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --to bumper, and 'Up, Up and Away' would come on the radio--
Speaker 2: And you--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --and you'd forget about the traffic.
Speaker 2: You just coast on--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --with it, you know.
Speaker 1: I, I had the same thought when you said that.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: And I was thinking, it might seem crazy what I'm about to say (laughter)--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah, I've, I've been saying that ever since I heard 'Happy'--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --and saw how huge it is.  I said you know what, this is 2014's 'Up, Up and Away.'
Speaker 1: 'Up, Up and Away,' yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: It gives, puts people in another whole space, yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.  Okay, so up, up, and away in my beautiful balloon.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And then we ended up winning these, these Grammy Awards, and we didn't even know what Grammy was--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --because they weren't being televised yet.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And when, so when we found out that, I think 'Up, Up and Away' got six nominations: four for the group--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --two for the produ--oh, one for the producer--
Speaker 1: Producer, one for the writer.
Speaker 2: --one for the songwriter.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And every category that it was in it won.
Speaker 1: It won, yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And so everybody was excited, so we got excited (laughter).  We said well--
Speaker 1: You know to really show you--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --this must be big.
Speaker 1: --how big, how big that song was, that song was taken off of our album by the Johnny Mann Singers first.  And the Johnny Mann Singers had probably sold about 300,000 copies before we released our.  When Johnny, when Johnny heard that version on the charts, and he said wait a minute.  That sound like--isn't that our record?  And they said yes.  He said well, well, ours sound better than that.  Let's put ours out.  And they put ours out on top of Johnny Mann's, and it stopped his, and ours just kept going up the charts.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is a BMI's Top 100 Songs of the Century, 'Up, Up and Away,' places number forty three.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Wow--
Speaker 2: It's in the upper half--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --of the century?
Speaker 2: --of the top songs of the--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Of the century?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Wow.

Speaker 1: --'All I Know,' 'MacArthur Park'--
Speaker 2: That's right (laughter).
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--songs.
Speaker 2: It's just crazy (laughter).
Speaker 1: And so you all are (unclear).  You got a, you picked a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: We picked a real winner, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And then Jimmy also wrote ten out of the eleven songs on our second album.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He, yeah, he wrote everything but 'Ticket to Ride.'
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: 'Ticket to Ride' was The Beatles.
Story_ID: 180636
Speaker 1: The, the second album came, comes, comes out when on the--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  In '68 [1968, sic 1967] I think it was.
Speaker 1: Sixty-eight [1968], okay.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  I think.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think you're right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: I think it was '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Was this the one with 'Stoned Soul Picnic' and--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  No, that--
Speaker 2: No, that was the, the--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, maybe--no, it was called the word--it was called mag--
Speaker 2: "The Magic Garden"--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --"The Magic Garden."
Speaker 2: --"The Magic Garden" album.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And that one came out, well, maybe it was before '68 [1968], but I always thought of it as '60 [1960].  I, I may be off by a few months.  But it came out--
Speaker 1: 'Up, Up and Away' came out--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  We didn't have any--
Speaker 1: --in '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--you're right, right.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  We didn't have any big--
Speaker 2: The other one--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --hits from, from that album.  But it was an underground--it was a, it was a very well-received album in terms of for music lovers.  But, but as far as the hitting the top of the pop charts, for us it didn't happen.  But--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --we had a song on there called 'The Worst That Could Happen.'  And Billy sang the lead on that.  And there, there was talk about releasing that, but then they said the record company said no.  It's group; you know, the, The 5th Dimension is known as a group, and we wanna keep the group sound.  And so we're not gonna release it as a single.  So along came a group called the Brooklyn Bridge.
Speaker 2: And, and took it off--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And they did--
Speaker 2: --of my album.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --with the 'Worst That Could Happen' what we had done with 'Go Where You Wanna Go.'  And they released their version out of--
Speaker 2: Of the 'Worst That Could Happen'--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --'Worst that Could Happen.'
Speaker 2: --right, right.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And they ended up having the big hit.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were on top forty stations and Brooklyn Bridge, I know.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right.
Speaker 1: But I, I listened to your version.  And I mean it's really strong--(unclear)--I, you know--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: I think if they had released yours, it would have--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  It would have, oh, Billy would have had a huge hit--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --with it, yeah.
Speaker 1: --the whole thing is that, you know, we were riding around Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada], and, and the funny thing is that we were listening to the radio, and we heard it.  And Marilyn--I, I said baby, they, they, did they release 'The Worst That Could Happen?'  'Cause it sounds just like me--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, and I said huh, I thought it was me.  And Marilyn said no, that's not us.  There's no background on it. That's, that's--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the only way she knew--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right, we didn't have any background vocals on--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --on our version.  But the Brooklyn Bridge had added background vocals.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, so--(unclear)--"The Magic Garden"--(unclear).  And '68 [1968] is the, is the album with 'Stoned Soul Picnic,' 'Sweet Blindness.'  And it seems to me, I, I was looking at the, just the visual images of 1968.  It seems there was a some kind of throwback movement to the 1920s with the stripping outfits that you all had on and--(unclear)--was this--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well--
Speaker 2: --(unclear)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  We were working with a designer--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --our, our costume designer.  His name was Boyd Clopton.  And Boyd used to come up with wonderful concepts.  He would take a theme, whether it was a color theme or a design them, and he would, and he would do a variation of each of those looks for each one of our bodies, you know, since we, we had Ron, who was round; Lamonte was tall and thin; Billy was shorter and, and you know, buff; and Florence was small; and I was tall.  And he, and Boyd would do something interestingly different, keeping the same theme, with each one of our outfits.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And he did that with all of our clothes.  And I don't remember the look--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I don't, I don't, I don't remember the, the striped outfit--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Stencil technique.
Speaker 1: --for that, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is with a couple of 'em on--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --stripes and--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in fact, there's one where, where the, you all are kind of bunched together, and the stripes kind of go together in a way.  It's hard to--well, but you--
Speaker 2: What, what, what--
Speaker 1: --you'll get it.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Okay--
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll, we'll--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --yeah, we'll see it.
Speaker 1: --where, is it on YouTube?
Speaker 2: On YouTube, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, that might have been--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that might have been--we might have been singing the song in a different--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right.
Speaker 2: --outfit, you know.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 180637
Speaker 1: How did the relationship with Laura Nyro start?  Was that your mark?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, actually, Bones Howe was Laura--Bones Howe, who was, became our producer, starting with our third, second or third CD.
Speaker 1: I think it was the third.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  I should say album (laughter).
Speaker 1: Album-
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Now--
Speaker 1: --yeah, right, right--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --it took me so--
Speaker 1: --right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --long to start saying CDs, and now I can't--
Speaker 1: I think 'cause he was--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Was our second or third album?
Speaker 1: --engineering at first.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right.
Speaker 1: But I think that he started to produce--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes, well, he--
Speaker 1: --for the--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --and Jimmy [Webb] I think co-produced the second album--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, right--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --'Magic Garden,' yeah.
Speaker 1: --right, right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And then Bones took over producing The 5th Dimension's material.  And he found Laura Nyro through David Geffen, because David Geffen was representing Laura.  And David brought 'Stoned Soul Picnic' to Bones for the group.  And, and Bones brought the song to the group, and we liked it.  And it ended up becoming our first million-selling single.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And it, it, it was a top R and B single for us--
Speaker 1: Yes.  See--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --which was--
Speaker 1: --now that one crossed--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --which was--
Speaker 1: --back over.  It, it went up the pop charts, and then it turned around and went up the soul charts, you know.  So, it was, so we were on both sides now, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, now, now that song, when I heard that one, I was convinced it was a, I knew it was a black group when I heard it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right.
Speaker 2: Un-huh, right, right, right.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--know, I didn't--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I didn't have any doubts about it.  I wasn't sure who, yet, but 'cause I was trying--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: I was familiar with 5th, 5th, Dimension by then--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, right.
Speaker 1: --but, I wasn't, you know, when you hear a song, you say--(unclear)--who is, is, which one is it, you know.  (Unclear)--(unclear)--Oh, we mentioned the, the, the Friends of Distinction before (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --the part of the Hi-Fi's, or least one of 'em, and then the, the person that formed The 5th Dimension came out of Hi-Fi's, too.  They had a similar sound.  It wasn't exact, but it was a similar sound with that.  So did you, did you, did you ever discuss (laughter)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  No, what happened was after the, after the Hi-Fi's--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--yeah, or the Friends of Distinction.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Or--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--(unclear), yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --the Hi-Fi's, which became--you know, we never talked about the fact that we changed the name of the Hi-Fi's to The Vocals, but, but anyway, that's, that's just a minor thing.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Harry, after he saw what, what we were doing with The 5th Dimension, decided that he was gonna start a group.  And so he, and Floyd Butler, and, and Jessica Cleaves--
Speaker 1: Jessica and--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --and Barbara--
Speaker 1: Barbara Love.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --Love.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --formed another group.  And because of the strong influence of the music from both of our groups, you know, we ended up having a, a similar sound in many ways.  People could hear that, you know.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right, right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, so, I thought about another song called 'California Soul,' which we, which, which may be the definition of the sound.  I don't know.  You know, I don't that.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, that was a, that was in--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--that was Willie Hut.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  That was in Ashford and Simpson's song.
Speaker 1: Oh no, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was Ashford and Simpson [Nickolas Ashford and HM Valerie Simpson].  You're right--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right.
Speaker 1: --right, right, right, right, right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And so that was the first time we ever did anything with, with Nick and Val.  And I don't know, maybe, maybe that is an interesting way to describe it.
Story_ID: 180638
Speaker 1: So 'Stoned Soul Picnic' re- crosses back over, and so in, okay, so, in--so you all, by this time you're doing television shows.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  It might have been 'American Bandstand.'

Speaker 2: I think it--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: --right, be that.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  'American Bandstand' and then there was a, another, there were a couple of shows.  There was--
Speaker 1: A lot of them.

Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And The 5th Dimension ended up doing a number of those shows.  But I think 'American Bandstand' was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think was the first--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --was our first big national--
Speaker 2: --one yeah, right, right, right.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --national exposure.  And--
Speaker 2: It was another one.  I can't think of the name of it, but it, that, it, yeah, it's right on the tip of my tongue--

Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Um-hum, yeah, right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: I think on both shows--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, on 'Soul Train'--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 2: --too, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Does, does that, how does that, how does a performer feel about doing--do you actually, are you actually singing underneath a record when you're out there, or are you--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  It's better if you do.
Speaker 1: It's better if you sing, then that way you don't--[clearing throat]--to the audience you don't look off, you know--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because if you don't really just sing it the way you sung it, then you can look at your lips and everything is off, you know, and it looks, it doesn't look good.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, the energy's different.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the energy's different.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I know the, the clip I saw appeared as if you all were actually singing, and I know where you're syncing to--I'm here--(unclear)--to-
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right.
Speaker 2: --it looked like you all were singing.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: There's a certain amount of--you can tell when people are just faking, 'cause they don't look like they're winded at all (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, right, right.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Makes a big difference, yeah.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--posing, as they say, rather than--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --(unclear), but you all actually like--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --look like you were singing, so that's--I'm glad I asked that.  But so, so you did a Frank Sinatra TV special in '68 [1968]--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --right?
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And also we did some 'Ed Sullivan' in '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You did 'Sullivan?'
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: 'Ed Sullivan,' yeah.
Speaker 2: 'Ed Sullivan Show.'
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  We did some 'Ed Sullivan'--
Speaker 2: In fact--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --in '67 [1967]--
Speaker 2: --in fact, we did--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --which was really--
Speaker 2: --quite a bit of 'Ed Sullivan.'
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 2: We were on 'Ed Sullivan' quite a bit, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you even did a 'Woody Allen Special.'  I was surprised at that one.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Wow, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hum, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Woody Allen.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Some of those things I don't remember (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah. I don't either (laughter).
Story_ID: 180639
Speaker 1: You all did 'Workin' on a Groovy Thing,' 'Wedding Bell Blues' on the 'Woody Allen Special.'  'Ed Sullivan Show,' 'What the World Needs Now,' 'All You Need is Love,' and I guess in '60 [1960]--'69 [1969] a lot of people, you know, I mean associate The 5th Dimension with "The Age of Aquarius"--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --rather than the 'Hair' album ['Hair: Original Soundtrack Recording'] (laughter)--(unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Exactly right, right, right.  Well, you know--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, you know--
Speaker 2: --because that, one of the reasons is because of our production of, of 'Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In' ['Medley: Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In (The Flesh Failures)']. And once our, once, our record was a major hit--that's the biggest hit that we ever had--then, then they had to change their song to fit what everybody's ears were, were listening--
Speaker 1: So did they--
Speaker 2: --were hearing.
Speaker 1: --they do that in the Broadway production, to change the song a little bit to sound like you?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  They did it in--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --'The Revival' recently--
Speaker 1: --in 'The Revival'--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  When they brought the--when 'Hair' came back a couple of years ago, they, they presented it in a different way.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  In the original 'Hair' 'Aquarius' happened at the end of the first act, and 'Let the Sunshine In' was part of a song called 'The Flesh Failures.'
Speaker 1: 'Flesh Failures,' right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And that was toward the end of the second act.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  But Bones Howe put the idea together of, of doing 'Aquarius' and 'Let the Sunshine In' because the group wanted to record the song so badly.  And we just really believed like we were gonna have a big hit with it.  But the song had already been released two or three times, which we didn't know.  We just knew that--we said--
Speaker 1: We knew we wanted--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --but The 5th Dimension didn't sing it.
Speaker 1: --to do it, right, right, right--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  They think we should sing it--
Speaker 1: --right, right, right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --you know, so Bones came back, and he said okay, this is what we're gonna do: we're gonna do 'Aquarius,' and then we're gonna put 'Let the Sunshine In' at the end.  And so we went into the studio and recorded it that way.  And, and, and then after we sang 'Let the Sunshine In,' then Bones said okay, Billy, now go on in there and, and take it home, put in the gospel influence.
Speaker 1: He did too.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  He did, yeah.
Speaker 1: He, he did, he did it too.  Everybody's that has heard that, you know, knows that he really put it in there.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And so, now, this is unique, 'cause I can't think of another hit song that was a combination of two songs--
Speaker 2: Like a medley, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Or one that took the two original songs and made something new out of it and actually influenced the original.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah, it's not--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --that is interesting, isn't it?
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: I, I was nineteen years old in '69 [1969].  I bought a copy of the album, the 'Hair' album, and I was profoundly disappointed--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that it did not sound like--
Speaker 2: Like The 5th Dimension.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Like the record.
Speaker 2: --The 5th Dimension record.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Of the, of the two songs.  They, they, they were like, uhh, they were all right, but they weren't (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So.
Story_ID: 180640
Speaker 1: You know, it's an interesting story how we, how we ended up with the song ['Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In (The Flesh Failures)'].  I, I meant how we, how we, we were, The 5th Dimensions were working at the Americana Hotel at, at, at, in the, at the, in the royal box at the performing room and was--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  In new, in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: --it was in new, in New York, and it was right during prom time.  And we were staying at the hotel.  And I went out to shop, and when I got in the cab coming back home, my, my, some kind of way my wallet got left in the cab.  And so I, I went on upstairs, and when I got up I discovered that my wallet was gone.  And I told Marilyn, I said baby, you know, my wallet is gone.  I said I don't know what happened to it.  And Marilyn said well, you can forget it.  This is New York.  It's lost, you know.  I said yeah, but I got all my card, cards in there.  So about, maybe about an hour later, the phone rings, and it's this guy.  He says is this Billy Davis?  I said yes.  He said well, I got your wallet.  I mean it was like that, you know.  I said well, well, hold on.  I said wait a minute.  I said where are you at?  I'll come and get it, you know.  And he gave me his address and everything, so I went over and picked up my wallet.  And when I was over there I told him, I said well, listen, I would like to, I, I wanna thank you.  I offered him some money.  He didn't want the money.  And I said well, I, I, I'd like to invite to the Americana Hotel so you can get, on me, so you can get the chance to see us perform.  And so that night he came over, and we performed.  And after the show, he came backstage.  He said Billy, is it--you know, this is great.  He said I really enjoyed the show.  Thanks for inviting me.  He said but since you were so nice to invite me and my wife to the show, I'd like to invite you to our show.  I said well, what show is that?  He said--come to find out, he was one of the producers of 'Hair.'  His name was Ed Gifford.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so we had been trying to get in to see 'Hair' ever since we'd been in New York.  We'd had our agents and everybody trying to get us in to see 'Hair.'  It's sold out--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --no seats.  But Ed found us some seats, even though we wasn't sitting together, but he found us some seats.
Speaker 2: Now, now was it Ronnie Dyson that sang the, the original--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Ronnie Dyson--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  That's right.
Speaker 1: --was the one who sang 'Aquarius.'
Speaker 2: --'Age of Aquarius,' yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Beautiful voice.
Speaker 2: You're right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean--
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: --when we, when we heard it, it just rang through the whole auditorium.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Beautiful, yeah.
Speaker 1: But despite the beauty of his voice, the, whatever The 5th Dimension arrangement was, it was the one that captured everybody.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  It just--
Speaker 2: Ron is actually--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --it just all clicked.
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous)--be a big star, you know, as (unclear)--but, you know, she--yeah, so, and this is a big hit then--would this be the, is this the most popular song that you produ--I mean--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  That was the biggest success that we had, yeah.
Speaker 2: That was the biggest success that we had, yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And of course, we won two more Grammy Awards with that song.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 180641
Speaker 1: You all got married in 1969.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Now, when, when you met, I mean was it, was it love at first sight?  I mean was it, what, what was it like?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  No.
Speaker 1: I mean we didn't--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  No.
Speaker 1: --even, we, we were--
Speaker 2: You met in '65 [1965], right?
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: --right.  And we were friends.  I mean, you know, we, we--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  We became friends.
Speaker 1: We became friends.  We kind of just hung out together.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  'Cause I had never met him before [HM] Lamonte [McLemore]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --introduced me to him.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And then the group started.  And there was, there was no, no chemistry, no energy there, you know.
Speaker 1: No, no
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  But we started talking to each other around, about our love of music--
Speaker 1: And yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --and started just sharing our lives with each other, and--
Speaker 1: And, and basically sharing life--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: --what, what, what, what everything was about--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --where we wanted to go in our lives, what, what, how we would--you know, all this kind of stuff, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, so--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And it, and it evolved from, from this friendship into falling in love.
Speaker 2: Right, and I was reading in the books something about you leaning on him in the limousine and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  That's Billy's story (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's what it read.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's not my story.  You know, you know exactly that's what happened, you know.  I was in the limousine.  All of a sudden it went [leaning towards her shoulder].  I, I said--
Speaker 2: Did you go around the corner, they would have--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 2: --momentum, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then it'll go this way, she'd lean over (laughter).  I said uh-oh (laughter).  This can't be happening, you know, yeah.  I sound like, I sounded like--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Something's happening here.
Speaker 1: --[John] McEnroe: "You can't be serious" (laughter), no.
Speaker 2: But this is--well, let me say this, that there are so many people we've interviewed that are entertainers, either active musicians that are on the road, and they talk about how lonely it is to be on the road, that, you know, if only they had someone with them that they, you know, were close to.  And all their loved ones are at home.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  What we, we, we saw Ronald [Townson] go through that.  You know, Ronald was married at the time and had a couple of kids, two boys.  And he would miss his wife.  When we left, he had to leave them, you know.  Every once in a while he could bring 'em out, you know, but that was seldom, you know.  And, and, and he, he would get lonesome, yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, I take it you started off lonesome, but (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Who, who, the two of us?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --actually--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --actually our, our relationship started before all of the heavy--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --traveling started.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  So, it wasn't, it wasn't brought about by loneliness on the road.  It was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --it actually, it actually came, came into being just because of the friendship.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so the group, that, that, that raises another issue to that.  The group was probably together--well, how long before your first hit record came out?  I mean rehearsals and--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  About a year and a half.
Speaker 2: About a year and a half.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Just a year and a half, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause it came out, what, in '66 [1966]--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  It happened very quickly.
Speaker 2: --didn't it?
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: A year and a half is a, is a period of time, though.  It's not like you, the group was just forming and then you got a big hit--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  No, but most of the time when you find groups that find, that finally hit, they--it, it can take anywhere, I mean--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --it can be five years--
Speaker 2: Five, six years before they--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --ten years--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --for some people, but for us it was like that, it was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yep.
Story_ID: 180642
Speaker 1: There are just a, a number of appearances during the '70s [1970s] on television and that sort of thing.  You, you, you all did something called--you had your own special called 'The 5th Dimension: An Odyssey in the Cosmic Universe of Peter Max'.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Oh yes.
Speaker 1: You re- you remember Peter Max?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: Peter Max, yeah, he's an artist for--
Speaker 1: That's, yeah.
Speaker 2: --The Beatles' albums, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: "Yellow Submarine" and--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --Peter Max, right.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Actually, that was, that was latter '60s [1960s] that we did that, that--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --special.  And it was, it was, it came off really well.  We were--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --very pleased with it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And it was produced by the Ed Sullivan--
Speaker 2: Production.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --Production Company.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ed Sullivan Productions, yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And yeah, we had a very good relationship with Ed Sullivan.  And his, his son-in-law, Bob Precht was the one who produced it.
Speaker 2: Whose idea--what, was his idea to, to, to put The 5th Dimension with Peter Max or (unclear)?
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  I don't remember where that came from.
Speaker 2: I don't remember whose idea it was.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: But whose ever idea it was, we were glad--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  It was a wonderful idea.
Speaker 2: --we were glad it happened because it was a good special, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what, did they like, com, combine your music with the artwork of Peter Max?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hum--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes--
Speaker 1: --that's what it did, yeah, right, right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --with the set decorations and all the different, wonderful effects.  It was, it was funny.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Glen Campbell was on it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, Glen, yeah, Glen was on it (laughter).
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: [HM] Dionne Warwick too, wasn't she?
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Was Dionne on that one--
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --or was she on the second one?  I thought she was on the second one.  The danstra [ph.]--the dancer was on the--oh, gosh, I can't remember her name.
Speaker 2: Jodie--
Speaker 1: Lola Falana or--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  No.
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, no.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  She's a little blond dancer who, who she was--
Speaker 1: I don't think--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --very hot at the time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  I can't remember her name right now.
Speaker 1: I know, I know who you're talking about.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Jodie, I think it was something like, like that.  The one that was with us in London [England]?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  No.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  No, no, you're thinking of Juliette Prowse.
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no, no, no, I was thinking--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  No, she was a little dancer.
Speaker 1: --about the young, the younger one.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Story_ID: 180643
Speaker 1: It's 1970.  'One Less Bell [to Answer]' comes out.  And now this is a song, and I confess, you know, makes me sorrowful even though I'm not a woman missing a guy--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --the way you sing it is just, and you hit the right notes--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Oh, thank you.
Speaker 1: --feeling, you know.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Thank you.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  That, that was a Burt Bacharach/Hal David song.  And when Bones [Howe Bones] brought it to us, and he said Marilyn, would you like to sing this song?  I said yeah.  I said it's, it's a, it's a torch song.  I love torch songs 'cause it's sad.  And, and they said it was written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David.  And we said well, how is it that [HM] Dionne [Warwick] didn't record this song (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Then we thought well, you don't look a gift horse in the mouth, you know.  So, we were ver--I, I was very happy to record it.  And, and Billy worked with me on the song and, and you know, to come up with the good phrasing technique that would--
Speaker 1: What, did he go out the door and slam it real hard or something?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  No, no, he came up with the idea of saying [singing] one less bell to answer instead of [singing] one less, which is the obvious way.  And he said why don't you think about it like you, you haven't slept all night.  And you say [singing] one less bell to answer.  And it seemed like that approach is what really helped to make that song work.
Speaker 1: He's a real talent for that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  He does, he really does.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean he paid attention--(unclear)--he's talking about teaching himself this in the club.  He seen that--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right, yes.
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--who's mentoring you?  (Unclear)--and he's like you're self-consciously aware of this--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --phrasing and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --stage presence and--
Speaker 2: I mean, in my mind I, I hear, I, I could hear things and you know, I know how it should flow, you know, just like what we did for our Christmas thing, '[Little] Drummer Boy.'
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Um-hum, yes.
Speaker 2: And I just showing the musicians how to, how to make it effective.  And, and they followed it--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And it worked very well.
Speaker 2: --and, and it worked very well.  It's probably one of the hottest numbers in our Christmas show, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  One of the other songs was 'Love's Line, Angles, and Rhymes'-- MARILYN MCCOO:  Oh yes.
Speaker 2: --which I could only remember the geometric songs--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  (Laughter) But I knew what you were talking about, didn't I?  Yeah, that was written by Dorothea Joyce, and it was a song that I, I never knew if it would ever be a hit or whatever.  Again, it was a song that Bones Howe brought to the group with the idea of me recording it.  And I just loved the song.  I, I just loved the, the fact that, I mean, the lyrics were very strange in a way you, you're, you're say--you're listening to them and saying what is she trying to communicate here?  And so to me the challenge was taking those convoluted lyrics and putting them to, putting them together in such a way that, that it would affect the listener in an, in an emotional way.  That was my challenge.
Speaker 2: Can, can you give us a little bit of it, just to, you know--
Speaker 1: You remember it (laughter)?
Speaker 2: --(Unclear)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Are you serious?
Speaker 2: It seems like--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  You, really?
Speaker 2: --don't remember.  I don't know if it is or--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  I remember [singing]--Love leads the lines of love in circles and angles.  Love runs deep like a tunnel with a pendulum beat.  I'm not gonna try to--I, I think I pitched it too high, so I'm not going for--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I think--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --the next notes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's--(unclear)--cause it sounds--you nose sound good.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah, um-hum.
Speaker 2: That's one of the reasons why I had you do that, is because it's a song that people probably if they just saw the title, they said ah, I don't, I don't know how that go.  But, but after hearing just that--(unclear)--everybody remembers that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, you know, when you say love leads the lines of love in circles and angles, it, it's just to me it says that love is very complicated and convoluted.  And so that was what I was trying to communicate.
Story_ID: 180644
Speaker 1: Now, I skipped over 'Wedding Bell Blues.'
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Oh yes.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry I did that, but that was a '69 [1969] song.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: That was a Laura Nyro song.  And that, that was, that was recorded the year you married a man--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  That we actually--
Speaker 1: --named Bill.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --got married, yes.
Speaker 1: You actually married a man named Bill.  And--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  That's right.
Speaker 1: Um-hum, that's right, yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  You know, again, Bones Howe, our producer, brought us that song.  It was a, another Laura Nyro song, after we had done 'Stoned Soul Picnic' and 'Sweet Blindness.'  And Billy and I were going together--
Speaker 1: We were going, and Bones knew that, you know, so that's why he brought the song to us, yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And he thought it would be fun; plus, Laura had released it already as a single.  It hadn't done well across the country.  It was a big hit in California.  And we thought well, why are we gonna do this--why are we gonna cover this big hit?  And Bones said well, it was a hit in California, but the other 49 states don't know about it.  So, and he said and you guys are going together.  So we said okay, let's do it.  And it ended up being released as a single, and it ended up being a big hit for the group, which we were surprised about.  But I think Bones knew all along, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but they, they, they were, they were shooting for it, you know, which is great, you know--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --'cause it sure did good for us, I mean, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a big hit in Ohio.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Was it a big hit in Ohio?
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--and you could find Laura Nyro albums in the record stores.  There was no airplay for Laura Nyro--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Um-um, no, her, no, you're right, you're right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Interesting.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: She had like a almost an occult following--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes--
Speaker 2: Exactly right.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --yes she did.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--play probably in a lot, lot of other states, but, but people didn't really, I mean the general public didn't hear 'em--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --music on the radio.
Speaker 2: And you can, you can imagine how many Bills I've met.  I mean every, every time we go somewhere: hey, man, my name is Bill, man.  Yeah, I've in love with your wife (laughter).  I said oh, really (laughter)?
Speaker 1: I know a couple that, that got married, and the, the groom was Bill.  But he's, he was a good friend.  Both of them are good friends of mine.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: They got married in 1970, you know, and, but it was a--I always think of them when I think of this song.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we, we have people even today come to our show who, who, who got married, and his name was Bill, and they wanna hear that song, you know.  So I'm--this is, this was great, you know.
Speaker 2: You, you ever get tired of reprising songs for people, or do you, you say well, oh, you know, I'm tired of doing--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  You know what's really cool--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --is that after you've been in the business a long time, you, you know, you go through a period where you've sung the songs so many times.  But after you've been in the business for a while, and you see the joy on the faces of the audience when they hear those songs that have such special meanings to them, they have special memories, they--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --they come to your show to hear those songs.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And you're glad that they're coming to your show to hear (laughter) those songs.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  No, you don't, you don't get tired of them.
Speaker 2: You know, it's like, it's like what we used to say, you know, wonder if they get tired of 'em.  Then we had to put it in perspective, because a lot of times the songs that we love, when we go hear other groups, we sitting there waiting for them: I, I sure hope the sing 'My Girl,' or--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 2: --or 'How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You),' you know what I meant, and, and, and when they sing it, you: yeah.  I mean the joy we get is the same way they get when we, when we're singing their favorite songs.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.

Speaker 2: Well, actually, we, I think it was pretty good, because even now, you know, we going over the--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 2: --contracts, and they said we had one of the best deals--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 2: --of, of any artists, of a lot of artists that was out there, especially during our time.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, yeah, I, I think we had a real, really good contract.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know where, there's a scene in 'Ray,' the movie, where Jamie Foxx is playing Ray Charles.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: He negotiates a record contract, and he, Ray, is really on it.  And he's, you know, he rocks the, the record company but basically with his--he demands things that he can actually get, and he gets 'em--(simultaneous)--

Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Story_ID: 180646
Speaker 1: All right, we were talking about the traveling--'[The] 5th Dimension Travelling Sunshine Show.'  Do you remember much about that, that TV special?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  You know what I remember about that TV special?  We were in Canada shooting it.  And one of the, one of the writers was backstage, and he had swallowed a piece of chocolate, and it had gone down windpipe.  And he was back there choking to death.  And Rene DeKnight--
Speaker 1: And Rene--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --happened to be walking by him and saw him up there choking to death.  And Rene didn't know what to do, so he hauled off and he punched him in the stomach, and the chocolate came flying out of his mouth.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And Rene saved that guy's life that day.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  I mean it was, it was a wonderful special.
Speaker 1: That's the Rene remover.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  But I remember--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Rene, yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  But, but when we talk about that--
Speaker 1: Bam! (Laughter).
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --when we talk about that, that special, I remember about Rene saving that guy's life.  But it was a good special.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember what's the name of the song that I did?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  'Rainmaker.'
Speaker 1: 'Rainmaker.'
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did a song called 'Rainmaker,' which is totally out of, out of the stuff that I sing, but it, but I can sing it, you know.   And it, it fit, it fit what the special was about, which was, was so great, yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so in '74 [1974], Bell Records is reorganized and becomes Arista.
Speaker 2: Arista.
Speaker 1: Arista--(unclear)--okay.  And so, did this affect your, your career in any way?
Speaker 2: Not, not really.  (Unclear)--do you think so?
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, what happened when that happened was that we're not with a record company that hadn't necessarily chosen us to be there.  And--
Speaker 2: That--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --so that made things a little awkward, in addition to which The 5th Dimension was not selling as well as we had sold in the past.  And so it, it did, it changed things a bit, because when you're with a record company that didn't necessarily bring you in, it can get a little awkward.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And it did.
Speaker 2: What they, they ended up, Arista ended up buying--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the, the catalog of The 5th Dimension.  That's how we ended up over there, right?
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  They bought the, they, but they bought the record company.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I mean.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, so in terms of the economics of the business, did you make like most of your income through appearance and TV shows or, or through record sales?
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  It, both.
Speaker 2: Both, yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Both.
Speaker 2: Yeah we made--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but we did do very well--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --with appearances, you know.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  But when, but when your record sales are not as, as, going as well as they have, you know, it, it does change things, I mean, but we, we weren't suffering.  We weren't suffering.  We were still doing fine.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, 'cause usually it's a, there's a lull somewhere when--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, there was a lull, I mean in that we, because our sales were not what they had been.  But you know, that's going to happen in any career.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  You, you expect that.  I mean you don't expect it because you're hoping that you, it won't happen to you.  But there has not been an artist yet that it hasn't happened to.  So you know that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --that, as is life, you know, so hap--and so is that, that situation.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you all went to ABC Records in '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so did you have, do you think you had a better deal with ABC or, or what was it?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, ABC was being--the president of ABC, we had a very good relationship with.  So we felt that, that it would be a good place to be.
Story_ID: 180647
Speaker 1: So, oh, but you all actually left The 5th Dimension in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  At the end of '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: In '70--at the end of '75 [1975], right, right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Interest--I wanted to mention something that in, in 1975 the last project that we did with the group was called--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  'Earthbound.'  And it reunited The 5th Dimension with Jimmy Webb.  We hadn't worked on a project with him for a number of years.  And so, we got back together again and worked on 'Earthbound,' and it was released.  It didn't do as well as the other projects had done, but it's been released this year.  And at the time that we were, at the time that we were working on 'Earthbound,' there was a lot of emotional stuff going on--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --in the group.
Speaker 1: --a lot of tension, yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And so, by the time the project was finished, Billy and I listened to it once.  When it was finished, we were really not happy with it, and we felt that the time had come that maybe we should reevaluate our, our relationship with the group.  And this year, as they were getting ready to re-release it on CD, Billy and I sat down and re-listened to that project.  We--you know, after so many years being away from it and, and the emotional part being removed from it--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --we were very, very proud of that project.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And we're so sorry that it took us this long to realize--
Speaker 1: --realize, yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --what a good project it realize was--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --and what it is, you know.
Speaker 1: --what happened, I think what happened is that emotionally we wasn't ready to listen to that album, we didn't hear it the way the album really was because of the emotions that we had from what was going on.  And so, we didn't pay it any attention.  We just, we just said well, it's something we can't deal those feelings, and we didn't wanna deal with it.  And, and now when we hear it now, after, what, thirty years?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Of thirty years and not able to--we ain't even heard it.  And they re-released it, and it's probably one of the best things that we've done.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  It's a really good project, so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you would think that, you know, with The 5th Dimension working with Jim Webb after he had other experiences and you too--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: It would be a great--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --album.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But, you know--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so I was--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  It didn't--
Speaker 1: And it, it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --it didn't stand a chance at that time, not with--
Speaker 1: No, because, because--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --not with every else that was happening.
Speaker 1: --Everything was happening, wasn't no, no, no promotion on it.  I mean, you know, they just--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --put it out there because it was The 5th Dimension.  They didn't, it wasn't follow-up, 'cause the group was, we were leaving, and all kind of things--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was happening so.
Story_ID: 180648
Speaker 1: After listening to it ['Earthbound'] again, is there a particular song that you like, I mean that you think is--what do you think is gonna happen now?  I mean--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  We have no idea--
Speaker 1: We have no idea, no.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --what's gonna happen with it.  All we, all we know is we really like it.  The first time we listened to it, after all those years, we were both in tears--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --saying oh my God, this was really, really a good project.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we, we don't--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And we missed it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  We missed it.
Speaker 1: We, you know, there were songs on that--I mean the, the oldest song was, which is one of my, I just love it--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was, who the--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  'Be Here Now.'
Speaker 1: 'Be Here Now.'
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: It was just, it was just like, it was just like coming back. I mean--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: --where, where we, we've, we've finally landed on, on, on earth, you know.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And it just--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Who wrote 'Be Here Now?'  Was it John [Lennon]?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Jimmy [Webb].  Oh, no, no, no, no--
Speaker 1: No, no--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: --no, no, no, no, it was--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  No, you're right, George Harrison.
Speaker 1: --George Harrison wrote it.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  George Harrison--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --wrote, wrote that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Interesting, 'cause music is taking another kind of a turn these day, where people are going back and listening to things that--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: --I mean songs that were produced and albums that were produce in (unclear)--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --they, you know, they have a chance to become popular (laughter)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--worth--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  The, the, the meaning--
Speaker 1: The digital--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --the meaning is just powerful.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, people shop for music in a different way--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, they--
Speaker 2: --on the computer you have access to so many sounds.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Have, have, have, have there been, has it been a particular song or album or something that, that is, you know, really picked up on the web, you know, through iMusic [itunes] or something or, or some other, you know--and I just wondered because I, you know, as somebody, I, I dabble sometimes and pull down songs, you know, that, from artists that I like, but I didn't know about that song--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --encountered that a song becoming popular after, after its, I mean long after its release?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  You mean one of ours?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Nothing that stands out at this point.
Speaker 1: So do people come up and approach you and tell you about music that, that their listening to that you--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, people tell us, people come and tell us about favorites that they have.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  We get a lot of that on Facebook.
Speaker 1: --we get a lot of that, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And it's just, it's always interesting to hear--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --what people like.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: There are so many, I think I would guess there, there are, there are many songs that were produced that took just as much time as, as 'Wedding Bell Blues' or, or, or 'Up, Up and Away'--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 2: --the mix.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 2: --but didn't really sell--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah, I mean, the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --the guts, it's always--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --that way--
Speaker 2: It's always, yeah--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --you know.
Speaker 2: --'cause you have so many, so many songs on a CD or, or an album that, that they're really good songs, but they just don't get the attention because they can only give one song so much attention.  And by the, by the, by the time that one goes up the charts and comes down they've got something else.  You know, they, they, they're done with that album.  They're looking for something else, you know, somebody else's--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --somebody else's album.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  That's what's so cool about, about the way things are now, that, that people can still hear the music.  They don't have to wait for the radio station--
Speaker 2: Right, right--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --to play it for them.
Speaker 2: --exactly right, yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  They can find it; they can, they can discover it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --on their own.
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And that's why we do have so many cuts out there, you know, that, that do well, that all of a sudden come out of nowhere and, and get 10 million plays or whatever.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  It's amazing.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I was thinking of like a prepared person waiting for an opportunity--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous)--longer.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, right, right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: --right, right, right.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--his song that took a lot of time to produce--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and a lot of talent poured into it.  And it's sitting there waiting for somebody to, that, that--for its time.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  That's the way I feel about 'Earthbound.'  We'll, we'll see; you know, we'll see what happens with it.
Story_ID: 180649
Speaker 1: So you two go out as a duo now.  So you're like in '76 [1976].

Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --on that--

Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --on that cut.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And it, it also ended up going to number one--

Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --we were going to be doing, you know.
Speaker 1: --working on our career now, and--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And they were, you know, they were trying to figure out what, where they were going.  And we were trying to figure out where we were going.  So, there was a period of time there where we were not in touch with each other.
Speaker 1: Now, in, in '77 [1977], you did a, a summer show for CBS--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right, yes.
Speaker 1: --called 'Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis, Jr. Show.'
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: And so, tell us about that, that experience, who was on your show and how did you all do.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, Jay Leno was a regular on our show--
Speaker 1: Jay Leno was a regular (laughter).
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --and Tim Reid.
Speaker 1: Tim Reid and--
Speaker 2: He was a regular on your show.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Lewis Arquette.
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--Jay Leno's a regular on your show?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  On our show, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, right, right.
Speaker 2: This is before he--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Oh, he was a very--he was a young--
Speaker 2: This was before he was a young, young--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --that was coming up, you know.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --before he became--
Speaker 2: Yeah, his was black.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --a super duper--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes, and his hair was still black.
Speaker 2: --his hair was black (laughter).
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Then--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  But--
Speaker 2: But it, it was fun.  And, and we had, who was the partner with Tim?
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Lewis Arquette.
Speaker 2: Lewis Arquette--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, and what's his name?
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Don't--
Speaker 2: --Ballantine.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --don't test me anymore (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, [Carl] Ballantine the comedian?
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Like I said, don't test me--
Speaker 2: Oh, oh--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --anymore.
Speaker 2: --okay, oh (laughter), okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This ran during the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  So we were on, we were on for six weeks.  And during that time, we realized that we really--doing weekly television was not the way that we wanted to go.  Because it was--
Speaker 1: Well, one--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --because every week we were, we were--
Speaker 1: Learning new songs--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Learning new songs, and singing new songs, and, and didn't have enough time to really spend time with them like you do when you're going into the recording studio.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And so you're, you're learning a song in three days and putting it up there for people to hear you do it, for millions of people to hear you sing.  And we said this isn't the way we wanna--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --do this.
Speaker 1: 'Cause we, we like to make sure that--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the song is presented well, you know, and--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you can't do that in three days with a--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --song; it's too new.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's new to you so, you know, it's hard to present.  You can sing it--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and make it sound nice, but you can get so much more out of it if you spend more time with it.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so just producing a weekly show was a really--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  It's a grind.
Speaker 1: It's a grind, yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  It's a grind.  I mean you have to have the--you have to write--you have to have the right people doing that, and we just were--and, and I don't mean the right production people.  I meant, I mean the right performers doing it too.  It just wasn't, it wasn't right for us.
Speaker 1: Okay, but it a--(unclear)--like CBS gave you an opportunity to do that.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Oh, we loved having the opportunity--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --yes.
Speaker 1: It said something about what they thought of your stage presence--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: --ability to relate to an audience, you know.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  We were thankful--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --to have the opportunity.
Speaker 1: --oh yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 180650
Speaker 1: You released an album in '78 [1978], 'Marilyn and Billy.'
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  That was our third album.
Speaker 1: That was the third album.
Speaker 2: Third album, okay.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah, we, we released our second--
Speaker 2: We had one in the middle of that was called 'The Two of Us.'
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.  And also during that period, we went to Japan and participated in the Tokyo Music Festival [Tokyo Japan].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And, and we won that grand prize of, at the Tokyo Music Festival.  A lot of good things were going on.
Speaker 2: That was in 1977.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What, what was your re, reception like overseas?  I mean did--I don't know, to this point, did The 5th Dimension tour over, do, do overseas tour at all or--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  We did.  We were there; we went to Japan in 1970--
Speaker 1: In 1970.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --for Expo '70 [1970].  And we did some touring in Europe, but we had hoped to do more.  But, but it didn't happen until later.  The group did start touring in Europe and going to Australia, but it was after we were gone.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you too, now did you--how, how was your music re, received abroad, you know?  I mean did people like it--(unclear)--because it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I mean--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah, well, we, well, 'You Don't Have To Be A Star [(To Be in My Show)]'--
Speaker 2: Star was, was--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --like--
Speaker 2: --wa a pretty big record in, in, in Europe and in Japan.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah, well, we ended up--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --earning a gold record for 'You Don't Have to Be a Star' from Japan.  And, and we had another song that was big in Japan called 'My Love for You Will Always Be the Same.'  So you know, it, it depends upon each project.  And 'Shine On Silver Moon,' which was--
Speaker 2: Which was--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --one of our, our, our foray into, into disco music.
Speaker 2: Disco, yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  It got some very nice response.
Story_ID: 180651
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, in '81 [1981], Ms. McCoo [HM Marilyn McCoo] becomes a host of 'Solid Gold.'
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right.
Speaker 1: All right, and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, actually, in '81 [1981] I--[HM] Dionne Warwick had started with--she and Glen Campbell I think did the--
Speaker 1: The pilot.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --did the pilot.  And then when it became a, a regular series then Dionne took over.  I don't, I don't what happened with Glen.  I don't know if he didn't want to be part of it, or they decided that they liked Dionne better or what, what the story was.  But Dionne was on it for the first year.  And then the second year they decided that they wanted to go in a new direction.  And they decided that they wanted Andy Gibb, who was the youngest brother of the Bee Gees [Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb], to be the host.  But they thought that they wanted to have a combination of Andy with, with a black female host, and so I auditioned for it.  And Gladys Knight and a young woman, a, a British woman--I, I'm blanking on her name right now--she auditioned for it.  And anyway, long story short, they decided that they liked our chemistry.  And so I was, co-hosted the first year with, with Andy Gibb.  And then the second year Andy was no longer part of the show, and Rex Smith came on, and we co-hosted together.  And then the next three years--no, I'm sorry.  Then the next year I did it by myself.  The third year I did it by myself.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what I have here, that you are the host for n--you, you were, you were a host from '81 [1981] to '84 [1984].
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right.
Speaker 1: And then from '86 [1986] to '88 [1988]--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right, '86 [1986] and '87 [1987] I did the, I came back and hosted again.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what happened in '85 [1985] that you--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, what happened was they decided that they wanted to, that they wanted a younger, a younger look.  And they decided to go with Rick Dees for the, for the host, because Rick Dees was very popular, was a very popular DJ here in Los Angeles.  And so they thought that Rick Dees was, was the image that they wanted.  So, they brought him in, and that lasted for one year.  They felt like that was not quite the way they wanted to go, so then Dionne [Warwick] came back for a year.  And then, then they asked me to come back for the last two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, this was a popular show.  I know--(unclear)--in my household it was on every week.  My ex-wife kept up with music--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --better than I do, so she was--(unclear)--I saw, I saw every week.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:   Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, now, now you released an album, a solo album called 'Solid Gold' with--(unclear).  Is that true?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah, well, what was happening was that on 'Solid Gold' I was doing a lot of covers of songs that were hits at the time.  And people liked that segment on the show, so they decided to follow up with, with me doing an album of covers, and that was the whole idea for that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 180652
Speaker 1: What were you doing, Mr. Davis [HM Billy Davis, Jr.], at the same time (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I was trying to get on 'Solid Gold' (laughter).
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  (Laughter) Well, actually, you were, you were, you recorded with James Cleveland.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --I, I, I, I, no, I was trying to be crazy.  But anyway, no, I, I, I, I wanted, I'd always wanted to record a, a gospel album.  And so, by knowing James Cleveland, who I'd always admired, I, I knew he was, he was in Los Angeles [California], and I knew he was recording for Savoy.  And I said well, let me go talk to him and see if his song was, that he would be interested in the both of us working together, 'cause I knew James when he was working with The Caravans out of, out of Chicago.  And so, I talked to him, and, and, and he went to Savoy, and Savoy okayed it.  And so we recorded a gospel project and that, that was produced by James and myself called 'Let Me Have a Dream.'  And so I was doing that and, and, then at the same time I was going on 'Solid Gold' with Marilyn, 'cause every once in a while I was an opportunity to be seen there, so that which was good.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, and something else--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And you were going out, you were going out and--
Speaker 2: I, I was, I was going out and working.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And doing solo projects, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was doing some solo projects, yeah--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --right.  So I was, I was working, but it, but it wasn't like the two of us working.  But I was out there doing something.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 180653
Speaker 1: Now, meanwhile, back to Ms. McCoo [HM Marilyn McCoo].  You were, you were on a soap opera in '86 [1986], 'The Days of Our Lives' [sic., 'Days of Our Lives'].
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  How did this opportunity come about?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  They asked me to come in and read for a part, and I did.  And you know, I'd always wanted to explore my acting opportunities, and I had, I'd done some things before that.  And so this was an opportunity for me to be on a soap opera.  And we figured, why not?  And we were able to fit the schedule in between when I was taping for 'Solid Gold.'  So, so I did that for, for ten months.
Speaker 1: What was that experience like?  Is, I mean was, was it what you imagined it to be?  I mean, you know, a lot of people see the soap operas, but that's every day.  I mean do you, do you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, mine wasn't every day because, first, first of all, because I wasn't available every day.  And the reason why it seemed like it would work well as because the character that they had me playing was not supposed to be on every day.  And so, I would go in usually once or twice a week.  On the weeks when I wasn't doing 'Solid Gold,' I might go in two or three days a week.  It was, it was an interesting experience (laughter).  It was, I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed it, and, but I was, I was tired (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now did you play a good guy or a bad guy?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  No, I was a good guy--I was a good girl.
Speaker 1: A good girl.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah, I was a good girl.
Speaker 1: All right, all right, all right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  But I was always, I always had some kind of little something that was coming out about--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --my past, you know, which they always do with every character.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: That's what keeps 'em watching.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Oh, of course.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: A new spin every day.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 180654
Speaker 1: Eighty-seven [1987], you two sing for the pope [Pope Saint John Paul II].
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: This is--so explain what hap- what happened?
Speaker 2: That was a beautiful experience, yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, Pope John Paul, II came to the United States.  And he was, he, he performed in, I mean he, he did a, a mass in Los Angeles [California].  He did a, a mass in, in San Antonio [Texas].
Speaker 2: San Antonio, yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  He, oh gosh, I don't remember what, how many places.
Speaker 2: Well, I know that was, that was, that was two of 'em because--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --we went to San Antonio--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right.
Speaker 2: --to perform for the pope.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 2: --and this was one of the, the, the masses was the, was for the, what, for the workers?
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  For the Catholic workers.
Speaker 2: For the Catholic workers.  It must have been about six hundred to--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  No, it was about three thousand.
Speaker 2: --about--was it that many?
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: About, about three thousand people out there.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  It was about three thousand, yeah.
Speaker 2: And I'll never forget, but--(unclear)--when we were performance 'cause when we performed, we performed gospel.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, and the pope was, was listening.  And, and we sung a couple of songs off of my, my gospel album that I did with, with James Cleveland.  And I'll, I'll never forget when they said well, okay, now, if the pope calls you over, then, then, then he wants to talk to you.  But if he doesn't, just, just stay where you're at, and then, then we'll, we'll, we'll come get you and take you back.  And so when we finished, we were standing there.  And the pope said you know, he called us over.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  He beckoned us over, yeah.
Speaker 2: And we went over, and, and we, and we were talking to him, and he blessed us, he blessed us, and he, he gave us both rose, rosaries, which were the ones that the pope carries.  You know, it's not the regular roses that they--rosary that you get in a, in a, in a package but, but the ones that he carry.  And it came in special box, and we still have 'em till today, just beautiful, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, now you also performed in '89 [1989] at the inaugural gala ball, or one of the balls for President George H. W. Bush, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes, yes--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)-- MARILYN MCCOO:  --senior, yeah.

Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  That, that came as a result of our relationship with the Children's Miracle Network [Children's Miracle Network Hospitals]--
Speaker 1: Network, yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --that we were involved with, raising money for children's hospitals around the country.  And the, the people who were, the people who put together the Children's Miracle Network Telethon called and asked us if we would like to perform at one of the inaugural, at one of the pre-inaugural event.  And we said sure--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --sure.
Speaker 1: It's the president, you know, so--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --yes.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  We were happy to do it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, did the, do you have any idea if the president, you know, appreciated your music, I mean as such?  I mean was he--you, you, were you a favorite of, of the first President Bush?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, Barbara Bush ended up writing a book a few years later, and she mentioned my name in her book as being one of her favorite singers, which I was very flattered about.  And we also had the opportunity of performing at one of the Christmas tree lighting ceremonies--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --when the first President Bush was, was in office.  And we were invited to the White House and, and got a chance to spend some time with them up at the, in the, in the private area where they lived--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --along with--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --Tommy Tune and, and--
Speaker 2: Tommy Tune.  And what's the country singer's name?
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Loretta--
Speaker 2: Loretta--
Speaker 1: Lynn.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Loretta Lynn.
Speaker 1: Lynn, yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  It was a, it was a--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --it was quite an honor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Story_ID: 180655
Speaker 1: Now, in 1990, 5th Dimension reunites for--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: --a reunion tour, right?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: So tell us how did this come about, I mean that, well, what--whose idea was it?  Was it [HM] Lamonte [McLemore] who did--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Actually, no, not this time.
Speaker 1: No, no, no, not, not, not Lamonte this time, no.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  This is time--
Speaker 1: This was--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --it was Jason Winters' idea, our, our manager.
Speaker 1: Yeah. MARILYN MCCOO:  And he was, he was working--he was representing the, the group, and he was also representing us.  And you know, people were starting to do reunion tours.  And Jason had really wanted us to, to have an opportunity to get back together again.  And we were all getting along very well.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And the first rehearsal--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --that we had together, as we were starting to put this reunion tour together, we were all in there, in the room together.  We hadn't sung together in seventeen years.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And so it was like well, well, what do we wanna start with?  And so it was like well, let's start with 'Up, Up and Away' because 'Up, Up and Away' doesn't have any harmonies.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  You know, you don't have to worry about whether or not you're hitting the right notes and everything.  And we started singing it, and it sounded just like--
Speaker 2: Just like--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --it did in the beginning.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it, it was just like, it's, and we, we, when we finished we looked at each other.  We couldn't believe--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  I know.
Speaker 2: --how it sounded so much like the record, like, like--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --just like that we never left each other.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  It was a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --very special--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --moment.
Speaker 2: --moment, yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Everybody in the room felt it.  And we were all--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --kind of looking at each other and saying oh my God, this amazing.  And that was the beginning of that.  And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --so for--you know, we went out and did the reunion tour.  And then for the next few years we would, from time to time when people would request wanting the original 5th Dimension for, for different dates--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --we would get together and do it.
Speaker 2: Especially since we had now, we had charts again together--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 2: --for the, for the tour.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: So we, if we got some private dates or some business dates or something like that--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right.
Speaker 2: --they would want the original 5th Dimension, which brought all of us together, and we would go out and do the gate--do, do the date together, yeah.
Speaker 1: I think, I'm thinking here.  I, I can't imagine a basketball team getting together seventeen years later and playing like they did seventeen years--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well--
Speaker 1: I don't, I don't--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --I mean that's some--
Speaker 1: --I don't think, I don't--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --that is a little different.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I don't think so.  That's pretty physical, you know, the--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--I mean I--
Speaker 2: --these bones are probably--
Speaker 1: --I can't imagine any other, any other--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --group activity, other than music, where you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Where you do that, yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's true, yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, that, this one was a very, very special moment.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't even imagine actors, you know, hitting their marks and in a play seventeen later like they did seventeen years earlier.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, we only did one song, (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, right, right, right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  If we had started trying to do 'Stoned Soul Picnic' and--
Speaker 1: Well, then--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --some of the other songs that had more--
Speaker 1: --then we had to, then we had to dig into rehearsal--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, because a lot of us forgotten certain--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Relearn the harmonies, yeah.
Speaker 1: --relearn the harmonies.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, but, but we had been, we had been seeing each other, you know, through the years.  And so it wasn't like all of the tension was there like when we, when we left the group, you know.  But, so we were, we were all good friends, so when we getting--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --started doing our shows together, it was, it was good.
Speaker 2: Do you think it's inevitable that a successful group is going to experience some tension at some point that strains the, the--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, anybody that's--
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --ever been married (laughter) knows that if two people--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --who love each other dearly are going to feel some tension, you know, in, in the time that their together, it's, five people have to have that happen.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  It happens with most groups.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just it's, it's a, it's a thing where when there's a group the stage gets small, because as you continue to grow, everybody wants to be more.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Wants to do more.
Speaker 1: And you can only do so much in an hour show or an hour and a half show.  Everybody can't do everything, you know, and it still come off as a great show, you know.  So that's, those, those are some of the things that happen.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So, so then you all, the, The 5th Dimension goes on tour, and where did you go, where'd you go?  Was it just, just, you know, the major cities of the U.S.?
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And it was fun being out there.

Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --a publicity--
Speaker 1: Right, I think--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --opportunity.
Speaker 1: --I think our managers had a lot--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to do with that.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  They certainly had a lot to do--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, to, to--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --with helping to make sure it happened.
Speaker 1: --making sure they're contacting the people and seeing that, that they deserve a, a, a star on the Walk of Fame, and--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right.
Speaker 1: --and so--I don't know, however they put it together.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  It's proposed--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --and then, and then people have to make a decision as to whether or not they feel that it's merited.  And if they feel like it's merited, then, then you get it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.

Speaker 1: Okay, Ms. McCoo [HM Marilyn McCoo] releases a gospel album in '91 [1991], the same year 'The Me Nobody Knows.'
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And so, so you basically joined with your husband [HM Billy Davis, Jr.] an enthusiasm for gospel music I guess around the same time.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, you know, our--you know, we became more, we, we started becoming more connected as far as what, where our spiritual lives were--
Speaker 1: Yeah, we became believers.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --because we, we--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --you know, that was an area in our lives that, that we had not addressed earlier.  And it happened way before 1991.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Back in, back in 1980, '81 [1981] we had, we had become Christians.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know most people who would say they're Christians, you know, it, you know, I guess, as a general rule in the United States, most people would say their Christians.  But when you say you became Christians--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  We meant that we, that we gave--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --our, that we--
Speaker 1: We accepted Christ.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --we accepted Jesus--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --Christ as our Lord and savior.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Most people--
Speaker 1: --right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --when they say Christians, they, they say that they're Christians, meaning that they, they're good people.
Speaker 1: Good people, yeah, right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  But we mean it in the actual faith-based sense.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, was this, so it was in a formal process in a church that you, you did, you did a formal--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  It's a prayer.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  No, it's not like--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --it's not like--
Speaker 2: No, you don't have to join a--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  No, it's just--
Speaker 2: --a church.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --it's just a prayer where you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --where you ask the Lord to, to come--
Speaker 2: --to come into your life.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --into your life and be your, your lord and your savior and to direct your, your life, direct your path.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, did you have a, was there, did you have any kind of a guide for this, a reverend or a--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes, we did.  Yeah, we had a couple of dear friends, Frank and Bunny Wilson, who started to talk to us about God's plan for our lives.  And at that time, I was really, I was really feeling that with all of the wonderful accomplishments that I had enjoyed, that Billy and I had enjoyed together, that I had enjoyed as a member of The 5th Dimension, all of these things had been very, very special in my life.  But I still felt like something was missing.  And I started thinking that there was something wrong with me, that if I was accomplishing all of those goals that I had always wanted in my life, how could I be feeling like something was missing, and especially I was married to my best friend.  And so I just kind of tucked that away, and I thought there's, there's something wrong with you, kiddo.  You'd better figure it out (laughter), you know.  So, so I just kind of left it to myself, and then one day I was talking to my friend, Bunny.  And she said if you ever feel like there's something missing in your life, like there's a void in your life, which is what I called it, and it shocked me when she used that word, "void."  And I'm thinking (intake breath), how does she know what I'm feeling?  I haven't told anybody.  And she said if you ever feel like there's a void in your life, that's because the Lord is telling you that you need him.

Speaker 1: In '92 [1992], Ms. McCoo [HM Marilyn McCoo] received a Grammy Award for participating in [HM] Quincy Jones' album, 'Handel's Messiah: A Soulful Celebration.'

Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Did, did the group ever come back together again for anything else?
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah, we, we continued to--
Speaker 2: We continued work, yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --to do performances from time to time.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, so--
Speaker 1: What, what you--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.

Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --for special dates.
Speaker 1: --things like that, you know.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  Now that's something that was opening up that wasn't available--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Exactly right, the corporate dates, yeah.  And they were sweet dates too because it, one, one didn't have to worry about drawing the crowds.  You know, they had the crowd there for you already, and they would, sometimes, a lot of times when you come in you'll be the surprise.  And then they would, they would go crazy 'cause you, you know, that kind of thing.  And it was, it was, it was very good.
Speaker 1: They have your money too--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the dough was there, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  You didn't have to follow them--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, they didn't follow 'em around--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --with your pistol, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, so you were surprised at your, that, that your record was in 'Forrest Gump,' or did you know--how--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, we had given them permission to use it--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --which, which we did have the--
Speaker 2: No, one of, one of the things--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that, that was so great about that whole concept was then when, then, then they took it, and they--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  They remixed it, yeah.
Speaker 2: --remixed it, a disco remix seven ways on that, on that CD.  If you hear it, it's, it's going all kind of ways.  It's, it's, it's ways you wouldn't even think about.  I couldn't believe, but they did it--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now and meanwhile, Ms. McCoo is appearing on stage, in stage productions, you were in the production 'Show Boat' in '95 [1995] through 1996, right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes, I had a chance to be on Broadway in 1995, which was just an amazing experience, and to have a chance to, to do the role of a lifetime, the role of Julie [La Verne], which, you know, up until, up until this production, I, if I'm  not mistaken, every actress that had played Julie in the past had, even Julie was a mulatto, but they had always chosen to go with a white Julie as opposed to an African American Julie and until, until Lonette McKee.  And then Lonette was in the Broadway production, and I had the opportunity to step in and replace her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  It was, it was just incredible.  It was the, it was the dream of a lifetime.
Speaker 1: Okay, had, had you seen 'Show Boat' before, I mean when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, I had seen the movie.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And Ava Gardner played Julie in the film.  And then I got a chance to see Lonette play it on Broadway, as I was, you know, right before I stepped in.
Speaker 1: Yeah, considered the first modern Broadway musical, 'Show Boat.'
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right.
Speaker 1: They--you also did 'Man of La Mancha,' 'Anything Goes,' 'My Name Is Alice.'
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  'A... My Name Is Alice,' right, I did those before, before--
Speaker 1: 'Show Boat.'
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --before Show Boat,' yes.  I had been doing some, some musical theater, which I really enjoy doing.  And so it, you, you know, it, again, it was a continued exploration of all of the, the performing opportunities that are out there.
Story_ID: 180659
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me about 'Hit Me With a Hot Note![-The Duke Ellington Songbook]' That's a Duke Ellington--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  That's a, that's a project that Billy [HM Billy Davis, Jr.] and I worked on together, where we--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --celebrated the centennial of Duke Ellington's music, of his--it was, it was a fun three-month tour.  And it was, you know, performing his music was just amazing.  It was fun.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I want--let's face it, Duke wrote some great stuff, you know.  And we got a chance to dig into, and, and be a part of it, and, and to celebrate that--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that time, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And during this period of time--this is 1999--you also appear in guest shots on the 'The Jamie Foxx Show'--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  (Laughter) Yes--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --right, right.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --as Fancy's parents, yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Garcelle Beauvais was Fancy, and you're her parents.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, that's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Was that, was that fun to do?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  You know, performing--Jamie Foxx had a really good group of people that were putting his, that had put his show together.  The producers, the directors, they were very organized.  They were a delight to work with.  We had a good time.  Working with Jamie was fun.  He's so creative, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  He would, he would stand up there and create songs on the spot.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, he's--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  He's an amazing talent.
Speaker 1: Jamie's a real talent.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, when you saw him on living in, 'In Living Color,' I mean you, you--'cause he--it, it was kind of silly sometimes, you know.  But you, if, if you really pay attention, you would notice that, that this guy has got something special.  And then, once he started, started moving out from that and started being hisself with what he, what, what he can really do, you start to recognize how much talent he--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --really has, yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  They had just scratched the surface--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah that, that, that's right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --with 'In Living Color,' yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, they just--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Story_ID: 180660
Speaker 1: Now, also in 1999, now this is a--I know you all have written about this.  Mr. Davis [HM Billy Davis, Jr.] contracted cancer, and you had to have an operation.  And there was--tell, tell us about this experience.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, just like, like anybody else, you know, I ended up with prostate cancer, and 'cause I--one never knows when they, when they get until you get checked.  And so it was a, it was a little scary when, when the doctor told me that I had prostate cancer, you know.  So I think the scariest part was when I had to tell my wife: yeah, hey, babe, you know, I, I think I got--the doctor told me I got prostate cancer.  So right away Marilyn [HM Marilyn McCoo] goes to work: yeah, well, we're gonna, we're gonna check it out; we're gonna do this.  And I was right there with her, okay, you know.  So, just, you know, I, I never really got into the why me.  I'm not a why me person, because why me, why not me, you know.  They said at that, that particular time, they said seven out of every ten men would end up with, with prostate cancer, and so, so I was one of the seven, you know.  So, so then I was gonna just figure out what I could do about it.  And, and so we went, started checking every, all the different ways to be treated, and, and, and to make a long story shart--short, I opted to have the operation.  And a little--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  It's been fifteen years now.
Speaker 2: It's been fifteen years now.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  You know, it's an interesting thing when you hear, when you first hear the term cancer, you know, of course, everybody gets terrified, because you think that cancer means death.  And I remember when Billy first told me about I was, I was, I was thinking, oh my God, I'm gonna lose my husband.  And then it was like, well, we have to find out what we're dealing with and find out what our options are.  And so that's what we did.  We started getting into finding out exactly what, what was going on.  And then we found out that there's different ways to, to measure it, and the, and the question is how aggressive is it?  Is it, is it really aggressive, or is it less aggressive?  And so now when you find out, oh, okay, well, that doesn't mean just automatically you're gonna die tomorrow.  So we started learning about all those things and then finding out what the different treatments were that were available.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And after, after Billy made the decision which way he wanted to go, and he had it done, then we decided that we wanted to start making young men--making not young--men in general--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --aware--
Speaker 2: Of how to, how, how, how to check themselves, you know, and, and why they had to be checked.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Right.
Speaker 2: I know Marilyn was, was worried about me dying, but I wasn't planning on going nowhere.  I was planning on being here, and, and here I am, thank God, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And so, and so we wanted to, we just wanted to tell men don't be afraid of it, because the fear is what can kill you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  What you need to know is check yourself, and stay on top of it.  And so, we got involved with campaigns to, to hopefully alert men to what it is and what it isn't.  And Billy has talked to a lot of guys since then.
Speaker 2: I've talked to a lot of guys about, about prostate cancer, which, which is sad, you know.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, the thing about it, it affects African-American men at a higher rate.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  At a higher rate.
Speaker 2: At a higher rate.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Absolutely.
Speaker 2: At a higher--(unclear)--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: yeah, right, right, that's right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Absolutely.  Yeah, I think a lot of it has to do to with fear and, and, and unwillingness--
Speaker 1: To be checked.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --to go in and get--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --checked and find out what to do about it.  And if you, if you approach it that way, a lot more lives can be saved.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 180661
Speaker 1: When did you get the idea to write the book, and how long did it take for it to, you know, be published?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, we, we, we didn't get--we, we, we didn't, we wasn't the one who came up with the idea to write the book.  Our manager, Jason Winters and, and Eric Sterling, they were, they were the ones that, that, that thought about, well, you know, you guys ought to write a book.  And we said about what?  You know, and he said about what?  He said you've been married for thirty-five years.  People need to know what, how, how you doing it, you know.  What, what is it about?  How y'all stayed together and all the, the experiences through the thirty-five years.  So we thought about it.  We say hey, man, you got something there, you know.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: So we decided that we would, we would try it.
Speaker 1: So how did you approach it?  Did you put a tape recorder on the table and start talking first, or how did you do it?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, we up--
Speaker 1: No--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --working with a guy by the name of Mike Yorkey, who was, who was a, a writer who's worked with other people.  And, and actually, that's basically what we did.  We, you know, we spent time together, and he put a, he put the tape recorder up there, and we started talking.  And as he watched the way that we communicate--you know, we go back and forth--he said you know, let's, I think we should do the book that way, because it gives people a feeling that they're actually sitting down in conversation with you.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And that's how we did it.  And we said, we talked about what did we want to, what did we want to share with people.  And we felt like, let's tell them--you know, he said well, of course they're gonna wanna know about your careers and everything, and, and of course we wanted them to know that.  But we also wanted them to gain something, hopefully, from reading our book.  If we could kind of encourage people in their relationships--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --to, to hang in there and work through their problems together and to realize that, that, you know, when you're married and you think that your problems are so uniquely your own--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --and that nobody else has ever been through what you're going through, it helps to find out that every married couple goes through that or something very similar to it.
Speaker 1: We, we didn't, we didn't wanna write a book just to be writing a book--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, because anybody can do that.  If it wasn't gonna help somebody then it didn't make sense for us, because the stuff that we wanted to put in the book was stuff that we had to, we had to bring the stuff out of us.  And some of it wasn't that, wasn't--you, you didn't wanna relive all that stuff again, you know, 'cause some of that stuff you wanted to, to fade away.  But in order to help somebody, you had to bring it back out so they can--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you can take 'em through those ex- experiences, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So the title of the book is--
Speaker 1: 'Up, Up and Away: How We Found Love, Faith, and Lasting Marriage in the Entertainment World.'
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now it's, it's rare to find love, faith, and lasting marriage in the regular world.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Thank you.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Anywhere.
Speaker 1: Yeah, anywhere, right, right.
Speaker 2: Especially--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And in the entertainment world--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know it's even worse, you know, because, I mean, to be married three weeks in the entertainment business is, is--I mean this--I'm not being funny, but it, sometimes that's the way it happens, you know.  You get to two years, you think you got a long marriage, you know, so I said well, maybe it can happen.
Story_ID: 180662
Speaker 1: In 2006, it says here that [HM] Lamonte McLemore retired from The 5th Dimension.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This is significant 'cause he basically is the person that pulled it together.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, yeah, I think Lamonte got a little tired of hitting the road.  And--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and he was ready to, to, to kind of kick back.  And you can understand that after so many years, because when we left, I mean he stayed with the group all the way until then, and they were still traveling.  So, I'm quite sure he decided that he was about ready to, to cut it a loose and just work on his photography.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  We're still in touch with him too.
Speaker 1: Oh, sure, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, he's multifaceted.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes, he is.
Speaker 2: Always has been.  Did, did you--I didn't ask this before, but did you ever meet--did, did they ever bring someone in to replace you and you?  I mean you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Oh, sure.
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: --Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Sure.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He did that when we first left.
Speaker 1: Did they look like you?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: No (laughter).
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  No, they didn't look anything like us, but I--but we never--
Speaker 1: Were they as talented?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --we never knew--oh yeah, they brought in some very talented people (laughter).  But we never knew what they were--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I didn't, no, I didn't say no.  I, I (laughter)--it looked like I was saying no.  No, I was kidding (laughter).  I can't help myself.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  We never knew what they--
Speaker 2: I'm still crazy (laughter).
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --you know, what they were looking for, what they were going for, if they were looking for a new direction or whatever.  But they, they certainly brought in some talented people.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, I thought I have to ask that.  So you produced in 2008 'Many Faces of Love.'
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Oh yes.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, you know what, in 2008 Billy and I were celebrating our fortieth wedding anniversary.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And we wanted, we wanted to do it in a different way.  And we decided to release a CD that would celebrate our relationship.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And so, what we did was we decided to find, to select some of our favorite love songs from our era, from the music, from the '60s [1960s], the '70s [1970s], the '80s [1980s].  And, and we worked with two producers that we liked very much.  Scott Smith did most of the songs, and then Nathan Armor produced--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --the other two cuts.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And we were very, very pleased with it.  It's still, it's still out there selling.
Speaker 2: One of the great things about the way we, we, we laid it out, we laid it out with, with, with, with a concept like, you know, how you--when you first meet how you fall--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in love with, with, with songs like 'You Are So Beautiful' and then 'You're My Shining Star,' that kind of stuff.  And then after you've been married for awhile you get into, you know, just once can't we figure out how we, what we've been doing wrong, and you know, those kind of songs and just, just taking you on a little trip.  And after so many years, at the end of the CD we go into 'How Do You Keep The Music Playing'--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, something where all these years you're still there, you know, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you spend the whole fabric of the love life--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Of the love life.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 2: Right, it's, it's trying to thread a, a, a, a, a concept right through the whole CD, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  You know, kind of dealing with the ups and downs of, of--
Speaker 1: Of marriage.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --of relationships.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you lost Marc Gordon in 2010, right, he passed away?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah he passed away.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: In 2011, you worked Sir Cliff Richard of the UK [United Kingdom].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah, that was fun.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  That was a lot of fun.
Speaker 2: That was a good tour.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The project was called--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Soulicious.
Speaker 1: Soulicious (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes, to go along with the, the recording project that he had done.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, now he's a mix artist you can't--and I, I, when I saw his name, I swear I didn't not know it was real.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah, but--
Speaker 2: Well, he was, he was--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --but did you hear some of his hits?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Did you recognize them?
Speaker 2: --on YouTube.  Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --I did, I did.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Okay.  Yeah, he's, he's had some hits over there.
Speaker 2: He's the, he's the Elvis Presley of, of, of Lon--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  England and--
Speaker 2: --like, like Elvis Presley was over here.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: I mean he's huge, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did recognize--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Now Cliff had done--Cliff had, Cliff came on 'Solid Gold'--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --and actually we did a duet together when he was on the show.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what are you working on now?  I, I know you're still performing together.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Well, we released a new CD.  We ended up, you, we said we waited until this long in our lives (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) To, to do another live--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  To go into, to go into record production.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  You know it's like--
Speaker 1: Right, right, right--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --oh my God--
Speaker 1: --right, right, right, right--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --this is not what we wanted to do.  But you know, if you wanna have product out on yourself, sometimes you have to do it yourself.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And so, in today's market it's, you know, you feel forced or encouraged--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --to do, you know, to do things like this.  So, we had not done a live project since--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --since The 5th Dimension--
Speaker 1: Since The 5th Dimension--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --days.
Speaker 1: --right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And we, we had been performing a show that we felt really good about.  And the response was really good, and we decided to, to record it.  So we recorded it and to see what we thought about it and see if we wanted to clean it up and make it available for, for sale, and that's what we did.
Story_ID: 180663
Speaker 1: And when you look back today on your entire body of work, everything you've--all of your records, all your performances, and, and your acting, you know, opportunities, what today would you consider to be your legacy as a, as a, you know, as, as performance?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Wow.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  What is our legacy?
Speaker 1: Well, I think a lot of, I think a lot of people look at us like a role model, as far as togetherness.  You know, they, they, they, they, they, they love our music, and they love the things that we've done through the years.  But, but we hear that you guys are still together, and that's, that's just wonderful.  We patterned our lives after you guys, you know.  We, if you can do it, we can do it.  And that, it's like, we weren't even, we're not even trying to do that.  We're just, we're trying to hold on to each other, you know, and it's, and it's, and it's doing its own thing out there, you know.  So that, I know that's, that's, that's one of 'em, but our music and, and--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  We do, we, we feel that we want to encourage people that relationships do work.  You know, people are trying to say that marriage is passe today--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --that it's, there's no room for it in today's world, but yet, everything, everything we see indicates otherwise.  People get married three and four times, trying to find that one person who's going--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --to love them, love them for all of their faults, all of their weirdness'.  And the more you get married, the harder it is to find--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --that person, because their, their looking for something that comes over a period of time--
Speaker 1: That's right, you gotta work at it.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --understanding and caring about one another and looking at your relationship as a, a covenant as opposed to just a temporary commitment.  And--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --we like to encourage people that relationships can work, but you have to work at them to make them work.  And we do that through our music as well as our working together.
Speaker 1: One of the things that, that, that you don't realize in the beginning of your marriage is that it gets better and better as you, as, as time goes on.  We, you don't know that until you experience it.  But as, as you experience it and, and the years go by and the closer--each year that goes by you get closer and closer.  And you can't, it's no words that can, that, that you can describe that closeness.  It's, it's just something that happens to a couple, you know, and it's, and it's really a beautiful thing.  And I, I, I would encourage most people to, to, to try to get to that feeling. MARILYN MCCOO:  And you know, we've been working together for a very long time.  We've been working together longer than we've been married.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And we still enjoy working together.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And we're still, we still look for new projects and projects that, that work for us, that fit us.  It's exciting to us when we meet young people today who are discovering us, and, and liking what we do, liking our music, because the young people today are, are enjoying all phases of music, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  --not just what's out there, you know, selling ten million units.  But, but they, they enjoy all different forms of music, and, and we like that a lot.  And that inspires us to continue to do the things that we're doing.
Speaker 2: And one, one more thing I just wanna add to that is, is, is a lot of people (laughter), a lot of people always ask us, say what, what, you know, how do you guys, how can y'all stay together all the time?  I mean, I mean don't y'all get tired of each other?  And I mean I couldn't live with my life--my wife all day every day and you know.  You know, that's, that's your thing, you know, but our lives started off like that.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean we don't know how not to be together.  You, you know, when, when, when one is missing, we're just like I'm not here, you know.  We don't, we--the farthest we're away from each is somebody go upstairs, and I go downstairs.  And we might be there for a while, but if we're there too long, we're gon' end up coming back to, to, to each other some kind of way.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And that's the formula that works for us.
Speaker 2: Yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  But we always wanna encourage people to find your own formula.
Speaker 2: Formula, yeah.

Speaker 1: Once again, if you look back over your career, are there any major things that you would change if you could or go back and redo?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah, I mean--
Speaker 1: I'm quite sure there are some things that you would, that we would like to change, but--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah, but you can't.
Speaker 1: --you can't, you know, we, we can't (laughter).  You, you know, it's like you can't go back, you know (laughter).
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: You're here, this is it, you know, so--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  There are some things that came up that, that I wish I had handled in a different way, but like Billy [HM Billy Davis, Jr.] said, you know, it's done.  So you, you live with the, you live with your mistakes and hope that you've learned from them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I wish I hadn't drank all that alcohol when I first started off, but I can't take it back, you know.  But I'm, but I'm still here.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  But you cleaned up pretty well.
Speaker 2: I cleaned it up, yes, twenty-seven years ago, yeah.
Story_ID: 180665
Speaker 1: Well now, we, we always ask this question, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO: I--
Speaker 1: Well, what--go ahead.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  I'd like to see, I'd like to see a unity that I know we're still struggling towards.  I'd like to see us respecting each other more, caring about each other more, taking responsibility--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --for one another, to help try to make a difference in one another's lives.  I think sometimes we, we embrace the wrong things.  I think the basic things are still very important: caring about one another, loving one another, reaching out to help one another to make, to help somebody who's trying to do something in their lives.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, I would, I would, I would like to see, I would like to see our black men take a, take, take more responsibility for, for, for their, their lives, for their families, their jobs, just, just the whole thing of, of living.  I mean and, and, and, and, and, and, and putting our women on a pedestal where they should be.  You know, they, they, they've been treated not, not with the respect that they're do.  And I'd like to see our, our men lead, lead the way.  We are supposed to be leaders.  And if we're leaders, we have to lead.  We, we can't follow.  You know, and I think that's what happening.  And, and leading means responsibility, and I think that that's what I, that's what I'd like to see.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And I'd like to see our young women have more respect for themselves.  I wish, I'd, I'd like to find a way that I can communicate to them and let these young women know that they are very special, and that they have a lot to offer, and that they don't have to put up with being mistreated or being or feeling like they have to do something in, in order to be loved because they, they are lovable; they're worth loving, and they shouldn't feel like they're forced to do something that they don't wanna do in order to "be loved," because that doesn't happen.  It doesn't accomplish what they think it's going to accomplish.  And we find so many of our young in, in situations now where they, they don't know how to get out of them.  I, I marvel at some of these young women that I see that have maybe made a mistake or two in their lives, but they end up getting that strength and saying, I'm gonna bring this together.  I've made these mistakes, but I'm gonna better my life, and I'm gonna make my life better for myself and my children that they may have.  And I've seen some incredible stories where I just really applaud those women and the, the change that they make in their lives.  And, and you watch them do better and feel so much better about themselves.

Speaker 1: Mr. Davis [HM Billy Davis, Jr.], tell us about your, some of your theatrical experiences I've neglected to ask you about?
Speaker 2: Well, I had an opportunity to perform in the, in the, the, the hit play 'Dreamgirls.'  I played James Thunder Early for a couple of weeks in North Carolina in one of the auditoriums there.  In fact, Marilyn and me both were in that production, and it, and it, and it turned out very well.  I, I really enjoyed it.  And then after that, I went and acted in 'Blues in the Night,' which is a, a, a musical theater--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego [California].  And it, it, I was the only male in the, in the, in the production, 'cause I--with, with three other women, and I was--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  I wasn't thrilled about that one (laughter).
Speaker 2: --I was the, I was, I was the rooster in the hen house, you know, but, but the whole thing was it, it was a good run.  And it was at a very prestigious theater, and it was at the Old Globe, and I enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And you did a wonderful job too.
Speaker 2: I enjoyed it, thank you.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: I enjoyed it, yeah.

Speaker 2: (Unclear)--from my first--Marilyn [HM Marilyn McCoo]--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  And--
Speaker 2: --Marilyn helped raise him--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Oh yes.
Speaker 2: --you know, 'cause he came to live with us when he--well, he first came out when he was five for a visit.  And then he came back out at seven to, to live with us, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from Detroit [Michigan], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how's he doing now?
Speaker 2: He's doing fine.  He's--
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  He's doing all right.
Speaker 2: --he's an old man now.  I mean, oh yeah, the--(laughter)--(unclear)--yeah, he's doing fine.  He's, he's, he works with us with our ministry, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us about the ministry.
Speaker 2: Well, we have a ministry called Soldiers for the Second Coming.  And what we do is it's a praise ministry.  It's a--we, we have singers; we have musicians.  And we go and, and perform at--different churches that ask us to come in and, and give a program and, and give testimony about what the Lord is doing in our lives.  And what we do is we build each other's faith and, and, and encourage one another to, to stay on the road that we, that we're on.

Speaker 1: Are you involved in community projects in, in the Los Angeles [California] area?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes, I'm, I'm on the board of the Los Angeles Mission.  And, and they're doing wonderful work.  We do wonderful work just trying to help people, a lot of people who are coming through drug struggles, some trying to get them back on their feet, trying to get women back and back on their feet and connecting with their children again, trying to help men get back on their feet.  We have programs to, to help, help clean them and then get them prepared to go out and, and seek work.  And we're very pleased with the--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --with what we're doing.  And of course, we always need more, more finances to, to help, help us with the work because there are more homeless people out there than, than ever before.  And they all come out to Los Angeles because the weather is good out here.  And you know, in the, in the winter months they don't have to try to sleep in the snow.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  It gets cold out here--
Speaker 1: Right, right, but--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  But at least--
Speaker 1: --they can, they can get--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --it's a lot more humane than it is back east, when, you know, when it's really freezing.
Speaker 1: You can get a few blankets out here and, and--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --stay warm.  Where back east, a few blankets ain't just, it's not gonna do the job.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, I didn't ask you a lot about [HM] Florence LaRue.  Now she had--she's still touring with the group, a 5th Dimension group, right?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Florence is still out there with--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  --The 5th Dimension, and she's got four more people, and they go out and they work.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And she's a hard worker.
Speaker 1: And she's doing a wonderful job--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --too, yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And we see Florence.  We're in touch with Florence.  And you know, after we left The 5th Dimension, there was a lot of pain and a lot of difficulty for those first couple of years.  But after that, you know, time, like they say, time heals all wounds.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And you know, as, as we continued to live, we realized this is ridiculous.  These are people that we have had the most amazing experiences with.  Our lives were changed by the things that we accomplished together.  And it was insanity not to be in touch with one another.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And that worked its way through, and we are in touch with one another.  And we speak with Bobbett Townson, Ron's [Ronald Townson] widow, from time to time to see how she's doing.
Speaker 1: And we might go to--
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  And things are good.
Speaker 1: --to each other's shows.
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  Yes.
Speaker 1: She'll come to our show.  We'll go to hers.  She, she'll, she'll come to our praise outreach.  You know, I mean we, we, we, we, we're still very close, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, now is there anything else I haven't asked you about that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  No (laughter), I don't, I don't think so.
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't, I think you, we covered quite a bit, you know.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: Yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 1: MARILYN MCCOO:  Okay.
Story_ID: 180670
Speaker 1: Ma'am, sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: MARILYN MCCOO:  I, I'd like to be remembered as a person whose word stood for who she was and that if I, if I gave you my word, you could depend upon me to follow through with it. I think that's really important, that we need to let our yays be yay and our nays be nay.
Speaker 1: I think I, I would like to be remembered as a, as a person who, who's always, always got work in progress, you know, that I've, I've, I've never really made it, you know, and I'm, I'm, I'm still striving for, to, to do something better, and that people will see, see me in that light, you know, as Billy was always trying to, to make it better and not only in my professional life but in my personal life.  If I can be that kind of a person, and people could remember me for that, I'll be grateful.
