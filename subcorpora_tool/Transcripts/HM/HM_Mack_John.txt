Speaker 1: A person that we're going to be interviewing for The HistoryMakers this afternoon is [HistoryMaker] John W. Mack, and I'm going to begin by asking you, first of all, welcome Mr. Mack to this HistoryMakers interview.  And I'm going to begin by asking you to give us your full name and to spell each part for us.
Speaker 2: Sure.  And thank you very much for having me as a part of the African American HistoryMakers series.  My name is John, J-O-H-N, W, or my middle name is Wesley, W-E-S-L-E-Y, M-A-C-K, Mack.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I'm going to ask you where are we--you don't have to give us an address--but where are we today?
Speaker 2: We're, we're in, in an area of Los Angeles [California] called Lafayette Square.  This is where my family and I have lived since we moved to Los Angeles close to forty years ago.  It is a very, it's in the, the, the mid-Wilshire district of Los Angeles.  A, a neighborhood of, that's very well established as an African American middle class community.  And--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --frankly, a number of HistoryMakers live in this community such as, I know Leo Branton [HistoryMaker Leo Branton, Jr.] was one of your HistoryMakers, he lives in this community.  The late Paul Williams--
Speaker 1: Architect.
Speaker 2: --the, the, the famous architect.  For many years, he, he lived just a block, he and his family from our home, and he has a daughter who lives a couple of doors, and the list goes on and on and on.  But it's, it's a, and in Los Angeles, one of the things that I've always liked about it is that you can, to the extent you can get anywhere in a few minutes in Los Angeles we're fairly centrally located.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Just about a half hour from downtown or the Westside [Los Angeles, California] or out into South Los Angeles [Los Angeles, California], so, you know, it's centrally located but well established neighborhood, predominantly African American.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And finally I'm going to ask you a question that most people get wrong, so don't feel bad--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --if you get it wrong.  It's a very hard question, difficult question.  What is today's date?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Today's date is April 15, 2007.
Speaker 1: You're one of the few to get it right (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I guess, I remember because today there's so much focus on the celebration of the sixtieth anniversary of Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier in baseball.

Speaker 1: How far back can you take us on your mother's [Ruth Alford Mack] side? I mean, stories you may have heard her tell or some of her siblings tell.
Speaker 2: Well, first of all my mother came from a, a large family.  She had--there were eight brothers and sisters in the family.  And now actually all of them are deceased.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the family was from South Carolina.

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the, my, well, and let me just back up one moment.  I was born in Kingstree, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father [Abraham Mack] was a Methodist minister and my mother was a school teacher.  And I was, when I was born in Kingstree, my parents relocated when I was a baby, just about a year old, and then we spent a few years on the farm, the family farm in Clio, but I really grew up in Darlington, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And my mother--

And she, you know, has a number of children live in that area and I have a number of cousins in that area.  Then there was Uncle Walter Alford.  Uncle Walter lived in South Carolina for a while but then he relocated to Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's, that became his, his home base.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then there was Uncle John [John Alford].  Now, Uncle John remained in the Carolinas, part of the time in South Carolina, then North Carolina.  By the way, Uncle Walter I should point out was, was a minister.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uncle John was a farmer, and Uncle John also liked to booze it up (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a, he, he had an interesting and colorful life.  And then there was Aunt Matt [Mattie Alford].

Speaker 2: Aunt Matt--
Speaker 1: M-A-T-T.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She lived in Washington, D.C. for most of her adult life.  Then there was aunt--
Speaker 1: If you remember, Aunt Matt, what was her profession or what did--
Speaker 2: Aunt, Aunt Matt really basically was pretty much a homemaker.
Speaker 1: Homemaker, that's fine.

Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --even before I was born and, you know, I just have a--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I just have a vague memory.  But these, these are the ones that, that--
Speaker 1: Let me go back on one, Aunt Sarah--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --who lived most of her life in Trenton, New Jersey.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you remember was she a homemaker or was--
Speaker 2: She was a homemaker for the most part, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 622182
Speaker 1: Back on your mother's [Ruth Alford Mack] side, did she ever talk about her mother, grand- father, or, then the grandfather?  How far back can, can you take us?
Speaker 2: They, the, a little bit about--now our, my, her, her father [Thomas Alford], my grandfather was a farmer.  And again, and, and in, in the, this gets back to Clio [South Carolina].  I mean, this was where my grandfather and grandmother [Fannie Alford] farmed and where they raised their children.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: For the most part, where the children were born and, and, and raised and they're just, were hardworking, you know, decent people.  And, and as I recall, we, we had some Indian [Native American] blood in the (unclear) going back to our grandfather and he was a tall, stately man.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I remember, I vaguely remember a picture was at that that family home, you know, he was standing very tall by his horse, and, you know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --very--
Speaker 1: You don't remember what tribe, Indian tribe it was (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that I do not remember, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  That's fine.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And your mother's mother?  Do you remember that which would be--
Speaker 2: Very--
Speaker 1: --your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  Now, very little.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See both, both of my grandparents actually had passed before I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I didn't really have a, you know, that much of, well, no direct--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --interaction, and just only occasionally hear--
Speaker 1: That's fine.
Speaker 2: --them talk about--
Story_ID: 622183
Speaker 1: Let's go to your father's [Abraham Mack] side.  How far back can you take us there?
Speaker 2: Now, there I'm even frankly, more vague because--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I really never got to know my father's side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I just know that he was from the--South Carolina, from the Hartsville area.  But we, and, and I never met any of his, you know, his, his siblings.  I don't think he had very many siblings either.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And certainly, and his parents had, had, you know, expired before I was born.
Speaker 1: Right.  Let's, let's go to your siblings (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, he was, I will say this much, my father though was, as I might have mentioned, was a, a Methodist minister in--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --South Carolina and moved around different areas there.
Story_ID: 622184
Speaker 1: Let's go to your siblings, starting with the oldest one.  You were the--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --middle child, am I correct?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm the middle and my brother is the oldest, Thomas Abraham Mack [Thomas Mack].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he's seventy-five, he's five years older than I am.  And he lives in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Has for many, many years, he's a, he's a dentist, and has, has practiced dentistry in Charlotte--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for many years.  And I sort of followed my brother off, he did his undergraduate work at North Carolina A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] and I, he was one of the--
Speaker 1: Followed him.
Speaker 2: --he was one of the key reasons why (laughter) I went to A and T and then he, he earned his dental degree from Howard University [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  The--you were the middle child.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And the youngest?
Speaker 2: Youngest is Ruth Gray [Ruth Mack Gray].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, Ruth lives in Los Angeles [California], and actually, Ruth came to live with my family and me when I was, when I headed the Urban League [Urban League of Flint] in Flint, Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So in that period of time my mother [Ruth Alford Mack] had become ill and, you know, she was in declining health and so my brother and I discussed it, and Ruth at that time was a, a youngster, I mean, she was just in, in about middle high school age.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And as my brother and I discussed it we, we, we agreed that we would share the responsibility, so my brother basically assumed responsibility for mother, you know.  She had moved, he, he, he moved her from Darlington, South Carolina, to Charlotte.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, and stayed with him and his family and then she had to be hospitalized for an extensive period of time.  And, and I, my wife [Harriett Hicks Johnson Mack] and I discussed it, we agreed, we assumed responsibility, so Ruth while she was my sister almost became like another child, if you will and she--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --she lived with us in, in Flint.  And she attended Michigan State University [East Lansing, Michigan].  She didn't complete her degree there but she did attend.  And then whenever we moved to Los Angeles with our, our three children--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --she moved with us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and now, of course, she's an adult in her own right and Ruth, now, she manages an apartment complex in the Hollywood area of Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: Good.  One of the things I did forget to get and that is, Thomas Mack, his date of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh, that, May 5, 1932.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Ruth Mack, her, her date of birth?
Speaker 2: Ruth's date of birth is February 5th, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she is, she was born in 1950.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Good.
Speaker 2: 'Cause she's thirteen years younger than me.
Story_ID: 622185
Speaker 1: We're going to move right along and ask you about your earliest memories.  Again, you were born in 1936, January 6, 1937 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Thirty-seven [1937], '37 [1937], um-hm.
Speaker 1: Right.  And what are your earliest memories?  The family, you were born in Clio [South Carolina] and then--
Speaker 2: I was born in Kingstree [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: In Kingstree?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's right.  But are your earliest memories in Clio or--
Speaker 2: And in--
Speaker 1: --Darlington [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Well, well, in, in, in Clio, my, my, the earliest and probably lasting memory as again, again, now we were on the family farm--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and I was out playing one day, and, you know, I must have been no more than five or six years old at the time--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we're talking about '42 [1942]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, some, somewhere--
Speaker 1: --or '40 [1940], '41 [1941], '42 [1942].
Speaker 2: --around there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And one of the people working on the farm was backing the wagon up, they had a couple of mules sitting and pulling the wagon, they were backing toward a barn, you know, with that, it was gonna unload some hay and stuff.  And I, being a little one and also at that stage of the game not being very smart about it, got behind this wagon as it was coming back toward the barn and is backing into the barn, and I started yelling and I put my hands up, you know, to protect myself, and it broke my arm.
Speaker 1: Whoa.
Speaker 2: So that I remember, you know, I had this--
Speaker 1: Very clear.
Speaker 2: --this left arm broken and, and, and, of course, had to get a, then they took me in to town to see the doctor and the doctor checked it out and, you know, and eventually, I'm okay.  But that, that was, that was a memory that I'll, that I'll always remember (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You'll never forget.
Speaker 2: I, I learned a lesson from that.  Another one that I remember where I learned a lesson (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --my, my mother [Ruth Alford Mack] was cooking, we had one of these big old fashioned wooden stoves and--
Speaker 1: Is this about the same period?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --about the same period, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and, you know, my, my mama was cooking dinner, family dinner, and I was sneaking in, let me see, she was, I'm trying to remember what it was she was cooking, it was one, one of my favorite dishes, though, and I pulled the oven door open and reached in to grab it and, and that door (laughter) caught my stomach and, and, and burned me there and I have a, a scar, you know, (laughter) that has--
Speaker 1: To this day.
Speaker 2: --to this day.  But that also taught me a lesson to leave those hot stoves alone (laughter) and leave those oven, oven doors alone, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, on that first incident was Thomas [Thomas Mack] there at that time?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was, he was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, 'cause, yeah, 'cause we were--
Speaker 1: Do you remember what Thomas' reaction was to his younger brother (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, he was, oh, yeah, oh, he was, he was very concerned and upset, he, you know, came to, you know, see how I was doing and he was one of the first ones there to, to help, help out his, you know, his baby brother.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: Yes, no, no, 'cause we were--
Speaker 1: And how about the second incident, was Thomas there?
Speaker 2: No, second incident my, my mother was around.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, of course she, she gave it to me.  I mean, she told me, "Don't ever touch that stove again (laughter)."
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And gave me a good tongue lashing, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --about that.
Story_ID: 622186
Speaker 1: Now, your father [Abraham Mack] was a minister?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And are there any early memories of your going to hear any of his sermons or anything about his church (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, yes, yes.  And, and, and actually my father when we moved from the family farm from Clio [South Carolina] to Darlington [South Carolina], now this gets into an interesting, early part of my history too, my father was selected as pastor of the St. James Methodist Church [St. James United Methodist Church] in Darlington.  And keep in mind we're talking about the segregated South and specifically segregated Darlington, South Carolina.  St. James Methodist Church, you know, which was a, you know, an, it was a, an African American congregation.  The church, the parsonage, and there was a, a black doctor and his family, lived on the white side of, we were on the white side of town.  It was, it was, you know, one of the main streets there, we were just one block from the local Coca-Cola [The Coca-Cola Company] bottling plant.  We'd go down there and, you know, get free Coca-Cola.  And our--and an early age in, some of my playmates were white.  If you can just kind of keep this in mind and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and, and we, we were little kids playing and we would have our little skirmishes, you know, pushing each other around what have you, but at that point at that state, the game was not based upon race, it's just little kids out playing.  And we, and I think it probably was one of the things that formed some of my early thinking and thought process.  On the other hand, we had the sobering reality of, as black people in Darlington, South Carolina, we could only go to the movie theater on Saturdays and had to sit upstairs to watch the Westerns.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we, the people, no- nobody bothered us particularly though.  I mean, it wasn't like people coming, threatening to move us out of the neighborhood.  And, and, and as I'd mentioned there was a, the only, at that time the only black doctor in town, Dr. Robinson, [ph.] and his family who lived a, a couple doors away.  So those were some of the early years.  And then, of course, you talk about church, needless to say as the children of a minister we spent a lot of time in church (laughter).  My father was a man of, he, he was a deeply religious man but he was a, also a man of, of, of dignity.  His message was, you know, it was a positive message.  He was, you know, he was a respected leader in, in, in town.  He had a very strong, dedicated congregation.  He pastored there for about five years.  And then he was selected to pastor another church down, going toward, it wasn't in Kingstree [South Carolina], but down around, it was a more rural located--location.  And we--kind of near Lake View [South Carolina] and, and Dillon [South Carolina] but it, but in the process my parents had decided they wanted to remain in Darlington, keep that as our residence.  Obviously, whenever he was no longer pastor of St. James, well, then, you know, we had to move out but my parents then bought a home on the colored side of town.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Of Darlington?
Speaker 2: Of, of Darlington, we were on the other side of the tracks.  And I lived on Avenue D [D Avenue].  And that, that's when we really, you know, all of our, we, we were completely immersed in the, the black world of Darlington.
Story_ID: 622187
Speaker 1: I attended Mayo High School [Mayo High School for Math, Science, and Technology, Darlington, South Carolina].  Of course, at that time, you know, the schools, elementary, middle school, and high school all were one school.
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).
Speaker 1: And we, our, our neighbor just a couple of doors down, Mrs. Connie Allston [Constance Allston], who was a third grade teacher.  And Mrs. Allston by the way, who is the grandmother of Carolyn Lewis [Carolyn Allston-Wright Lewis], married to Ed Lewis [HistoryMaker Edward Lewis], and we grew up, you know, together as, as, as kids, Carolyn and I did.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And Carolyn's parents, the, the Allstons, Allard Allston [Allard A. Allston], lived not too far away in another part of town.  And Mrs. Connie Allston was a tough teacher.  I had no choice but to learn from Miss Allston.  Then there were, there, there were some other teachers, a Mr. Allsbrook [ph.], who was our history teacher and a very positive, strong influence in my life.  And we, I played a little football in high school and was a running back, and, and played a little basketball.  Then we, out on the street, we would just, my brother [Thomas Mack] and our neighbors, you know, we played baseball, but we played frequently with sticks and rocks (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --out there.  But those, those early years were, were some very important formative years because one of the things that, that as I reflect back now and can appreciate, the fact that while, yes, Mayo High School was a segregated school but there were teachers there who were committed to making sure that all of us learned and prepared ourselves for the future.  And, of course, my parents, my mother [Ruth Alford Mack] being a teacher, and my father [Abraham Mack] a minister, they also had a very strong and positive influence and, upon, upon me and my brother and later on my sister [Ruth Mack Gray].
Story_ID: 622188
Speaker 1: Those years that you are describing, they are in Darlington [South Carolina] even though your father [Abraham Mack] now was teaching at a, I'm sorry, preaching at another church.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You just, the family stayed in Darlington?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And what are some of the sights and sounds or if there are any, that that you remember from that period growing up there in Darlington?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess--
Speaker 1: You talked about the Coca-Cola [The Coca-Cola Company]---
Speaker 2: Right, there was a Coca-Cola plant.  And then actually my father and mother [Ruth Alford Mack] opened a little store right next to our home too.  And, of course, a little neighborhood store, and people would come in, you know, to buy their bread and the, and the soda and, and just that kind of thing.  And that was another, a little neighborhood center, if you will, and it, you know, that people would, would come to.  And, and my parents being the kind of people they were, extended credit to most of them, the people would come in and, you know, they may not have the money to pay cash and so they would let them have whatever it was and pay them whenever they could.
Speaker 1: Right. Now, this period, and I'm sorry to interrupt.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: But this period that we're talking about, we're, we're into 1942, '43 [1943]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we're, we're in the mid, we're in the mid-'40 [1940], mid--
Speaker 1: Mid-'40s [1940s].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Then, then I also recall this, I mean, to say we lived on Avenue D [D Avenue] about a block up there on Main Street there, there, there was the, the local funeral home, the, the, the one black funeral home where, you know, they buried every, everybody from our community.  And then there was a, a little, we sometimes as kids we would, we would go there but we, we weren't sure if were a little scared (laughter) or a little nervous but we knew that that, what it was about.  Then there was a, a, a block or two in another direction.  I mentioned the, the first doctor, Dr. Robinson [ph.] but he had passed after a while and then we had another African American, Dr. Sparks [ph.], who was the doctor to everybody and got to know his, his, his children, his kids.  And I, I remember learning something about hard work in a hurry too.  During the summers, I would, my parents would, knowing a lot of people in the farm, in the farming world and what have you, I picked cotton in that hot, hot, humid weather.  And, you know, having these sacks and putting that cotton in, that was another incentive for me to want to (laughter) achieve and to, and to figure out another way to spend the rest of my life.  But it also, but you learned important lessons about the importance of hard work, responsibility, and even teamwork because we'd, we'd, we'd have a group of us would go out and, you know, pick cotton and we'd get our breaks and we'd end the day and we'd go out early in the morning and then come in.  So, so, you know, you, you as I, in, in, in retrospect, I can, I can see some life lessons even learned in that situation.
Story_ID: 622189
Speaker 1: Then another hard reality in terms of (gesture) bringing us face to face with rigid segregation, I talked about the railroad tracks.  The railroad tracks, both physically and symbolically separated the white and black worlds in Darlington [South Carolina].  And at the railroad track there was a, a greasy spoon hotdog stand where the white patrons could go in and sit down on a stool and order their hotdogs and but we had to order through a window.  And so again that was something that as a youngster growing up I knew this was, something was wrong and this is something needed to be, needed to be changed.
Speaker 2: All these years you've remembered that window.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, I have remembered that window, yes, it--what it symbolized and what it represented.
Speaker 2: Let me ask you this, it was not uncommon during those days, especially in the South, for the various plantations to pull kids out of school to pick cotton, depriving them of an education.  Did that happen to you or do you know--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --people there in Darlington, kids--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --that that happened too?
Speaker 1: No, that that did not happen to me because that's something my, my parents [Ruth Alford Mack and Abraham Mack], especially my father would not have allowed.  We would, we would go, we'd pick cotton during the summer, you know, when school was out.  And that was, that tended to be the general, the general, of course, I mean, I have no doubt about it, I've, I've heard of, of people, you know, youngsters being pulled out of school and what have you but I, I, that did not happen with me or my brother [Thomas Mack] and I do not recall that it happened with, with other people.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: But I just, you know, just as, as I reflect back another one of those vivid memories.  The Ku Klux Klan [KKK] announced that they were gonna come to town and they were going, you know, any black person I'm, you know, they didn't, they didn't call us black or colored they called us something else.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, they were gonna, they were making their move and, you know, they were, they were gonna put these colored people back in their place and all kinds of language that is very derogatory.  And something that really, really struck me was the way our community and other people responded in the city.  A group of men got together--
Speaker 2: Black men?
Speaker 1: Black men.  With their guns and they got, they, and they went and positioned themselves at the city limit line and whenever the, the, the Klan folk came and were approaching they saw these men, they turned around and went back.  So they said, "This will not happen in our town, this little place called Darlington, South Carolina."  And that said a lot to me about strength, about courage, about (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Can you remember what year or approximately what year we're talking about that happening?
Speaker 1: This would have been, I would guess maybe around the very late '40s [1940s] so, maybe around 1950.  'Cause it was before, I mean, I was a teenager.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Or, or beginning, you know, about to become a teenager and it was before I went to college, before I went to A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But yeah, yeah, no, and that was, that that was a powerful, powerful act of courage and an important message that those, those black men sent out (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.  Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 622190
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this--
Speaker 2: And by the--excuse me.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: And I'm sort of rambling a little but--
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, there--
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: --there, there were some other, as I think about memories and people.  I had mentioned briefly, you know, Buddy Johnson.  At the time Buddy Johnson had a big band--
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: --and it was really one of the popular bands.  Dizzy Gillespie from Cheraw, South Carolina, just a few miles away, about thirty something miles, you know, that's where Dizzy was from.  But Buddy, once a year Buddy Johnson would come back to Darlington [South Carolina] and he would play, there, there was, I mean, the, it was a barn where he would play (laughter).
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: It wasn't a fancy city, you know, it, it wasn't the Kodak Theatre [Dolby Theatre, Los Angeles, California] (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --or the Shrine Auditorium [Los Angeles, California] (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And everybody, you know, he would come back, and he would do this and, you know, no, no charges, do it free and all of the local people, you know--
Speaker 1: He was giving back to his--
Speaker 2: He was giving back to his community.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And that was a real highlight every year we'd get so excited, yeah, and Buddy Johnson was coming to town.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 622191
Speaker 1: Now, your school, what was the motivation as you grew into puberty and was doing very well in high school scholastically, what was the motivation for you, personally, and maybe some of your friends, to go on to college?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all it was instilled in us at home.  Our parents [Ruth Alford Mack and Abraham Mack], both, both of my parents went to college, went to Claflin [Claflin University] in Orangeburg, South Carolina.  And my father had also attended and completed his theological degree at the Gammon, then Gammon Theological Seminary, now the Interdenominational Theological seminary [Interdenominational Theological Center] in Atlanta, Georgia.  So, you know, so my, my parents were educated.  And, you know, they had always instilled in us, my brother [Thomas Mack] and me and later on my daughter, no, not my daughter, I'm sorry, my sister [Ruth Mack Gray]--
Speaker 1: Sister (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) that, you know, education was an important, a very important thing and certainly as African Americans, if, if, if we were going to be able to pursue our dreams and, and our hopes and aspirations and achieve in life, that we really need to prepare ourselves.  So that that was where it began.  But equally as important as I mentioned several, there were some teachers at Mayo High School [Mayo High School for Math, Science, and Technology, Darlington, South Carolina] who also just pounded into us the value of education.  Again Miss, Miss Connie Allston [Constance Allston], Mr. Allsbrook [ph.], Miss Smalls [ph.] the English teacher.  You know, these, you know, these, these were people who were committed to making sure that all of us had that kind of vision.  Now, not everybody went to college, you know, clearly, but that, you know, that was a foundation that was laid.  And then I had my older brother--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --who had already gone on to A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina].  And then he, then, then he joined the [U.S.] Army.  And I, you know, I, I just, I just wanted to go, I wanted to go to college and try to improve myself but also, you know, I went to A and T because that's where my brother (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --went.
Story_ID: 622192
Speaker 1: And by the way, a very, very close friend of my brother, someone who you knew very well, and they grew up together, the late Thomas Gibson, Dr. Thomas Gibson [sic. William Gibson].  My--the, the two of them were, were youngsters together who grew up together, who ran around together, then went, went away to, to school [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], you know.  So, I mean, they had a, a, a long, long friendship as youngsters.  And Gip as we called him, Gip and, and my brother Tom [Thomas Mack] were, you know, were, you know, they were in that sense, they were both role models for me in terms of going on to improve, improve myself.  And before I got to college, let me just, let me just digress for a moment.  There was my brother and Gip and a bunch of others, at that point in time these were guys who were advancing themselves educationally, they would go away during the summer to Wildwood, New Jersey and work in restaurants.  Some went to Atlantic City [New Jersey].  I, I, I followed, (laughter) followed my brother up, up to Wildwood as well and worked, started out as a busboy, then got promoted.  There was this Jewish American delites- delicatessen, where I worked in Wildwood and called Impoles Restaurant [ph.].  And, and after working as a busboy for a period of time, I mean, they, impressed with me that I was a promoted to a sandwich boy (laughter) so, I made the, in the deli, in the deli I made these sandwiches.  And, and, you know, to make some money but also it was a broadening experience to discover the world beyond Darlington [South Carolina].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Which was--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, important and broad exposure.  And--
Speaker 2: Just for our audience--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you wanna tell us where Gip or Dr. Gibson ended up?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, yeah, yeah, so Dr. Thomas Gibson yes, who also went on to become a dentist.  I mean, he, he earned his, my, my brother and his dental degree at Howard [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.] and then, and Gip earned his degree at Meharry [Meharry Medical College School of Dentistry, Nashville, Tennessee].  But Tom, Thomas Gibson went on to later on--Willie Gibson, I'm sorry, I'm getting--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, William.
Speaker 1: He, he became the national board chairman of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] for a number of years and was very, very active leader, nationally with the NAACP.
Story_ID: 622193
Speaker 1: You had a lot of motivation--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --there, and eventually came a time where you graduated.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Anything memorable about that graduation from Mayo High School [Mayo High School for Math, Science, and Technology, Darlington, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, glad to get out of there (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: No, we, we had a class of, you know, some talented people who--and, of course, it was a great accomplishment and was very excited about it.  And at that stage of the game it was, you know, it was daunting from the standpoint of exploring that next world, you know, the--exploring the unknown is always a bit frightening and--
Speaker 1: Yes, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and unnerving.  Not sure of what was gonna happen, what was awaiting me out there but also excited over the accomplishment.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: At least of having completed work at high school.  Then, of course, the other thing is having, you know, leaving friends behind.  Up to that point this was my world.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: In terms of people who were important to me, family, friends and that, as I say, you know, that was you, you have this, or this, these range of emotions.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But for the most part excited about it and looking forward to the next chapter.
Speaker 1: Now, with that graduation, that fall, that was followed by your entering North Carolina A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A and T, yes.
Speaker 1: That must have been really daunting (laughter) for you.
Speaker 2: That was, that was, absolutely.  And, and, you know, that was another important chapter in my life I might point out.  For, I'll always remember the first, when I first went to enroll my, my parents [Ruth Alford Mack and Abraham Mack] drove, you know, drove me up to Greensboro, North Carolina, and, and, you know, and enrolled me.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what year that was?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-four [1954].
Speaker 1: Nine--
Speaker 2: Yep, 1954, September of 1954.
Speaker 1: That was an important year.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.  And that's, I'm gonna get to that in a moment, yes, some very, very important history because that was the year of the [U.S.] Supreme Court decision, Brown versus Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  You know, Thurgood Marshall and, and those other great, great leaders who successfully argued that that case on behalf of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  And it was very much on our minds as youngsters, as students.  When I first went to A and T, you know, being away from home for the first time, I went a little wild, initially (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Didn't study as seriously as I should have.  But, you know, got, got on track.  Became very much involved in, in, in several different ways.  One, one thing that, that stands out, you know, that there was a Supreme Court decision and then we were having some work done or dormitories being constructed on the campus of A and T.  And they had these temporary outhouses segregated, one saying white, one saying colored, right on the campus.  And some of us said, you know, we're not gonna stand for this.  So we, a small group of us, one evening after the, the work had been done for that given day, you know, how had, how they have these little lamps and lights with the oil in, so we, we went out and we took them, we doused them with the oil and set fire to them.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And as we were out there, a number of our dormitory mates were all glued, looking out the windows and a big cheer went up.  And the fire department was called after the, you know, whenever they found embers (laughter), were going.  And, of course, the administration, Dr. Bluford [Ferdinand D. Bluford] the president at the time said, you know, they're gonna find out who did this, and, you know, they were going to take action but that was one time when nobody talked.  They never, no one ever reported who the, reported the students and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --identified them.  But I guess that was one of those beginning indicators of, I guess, the social activism that was gonna become so much a part of my life.
Story_ID: 622194
Speaker 1: Also, I was one of the young people who helped to organize an NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] campus youth group, that never--A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] had never had one before.  And again that, you know, that incident and, you know, and, and, of course, the, the [U.S.] Supreme Court decision [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] and other things bubbling, the and, of course, the leadership of the NAACP, you know, was expanding, wanting to expand to incorporate more young people and what have you, so we, a group of us, organized that, the NAACP youth chapter--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --on the campus of A and T.  Now, let me get to another important development during those years at A and T.  By the way, I had joined the, the school choir and glee club and, you know, we had a good one and we'd travel around.  I gave up the football though because those guys were too big and rowdy (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: We had a pretty good football team, (laughter) we, we went up against Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and, you know, some, then Morgan State [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] and some, some other schools that were, had, had, we had some great, and, and, of course, North Carolina Central [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] and Winston-Salem Teachers College [Winston-Salem State University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina].  So we had some, some rivalries going both in football and basketball.  Cal Irvin, the late Cal Irvin, Monte Irvin's brother, came down to become the basketball coach.  And he put together a great team.  We had some tremendous rivalries.  We had a fellow named Joe Howell and Vince Miller.  Vince Miller played with Wilt Chamberlain in high school.  And Joe Howell and, and a couple of others came from the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Jersey [New Jersey] area.  And we would, we would have some great, great games playing North C- Sad Sam Jones played with North Carolina Central.  Earl "The Pearl" Monroe [Earl Monroe] with Winston-Salem Teachers College.  Dick "Skull" Barnett [Dick Barnett], Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], so I mean really, this--
Speaker 2: All of them went to, to have illustrious pro careers.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Right?
Speaker 1: And here I am, I'm talking play- yeah, players who went on to become outstanding professionals, yes.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, and, and then, you know, they were products of these, these schools.  But anyway that, that, that I got away from the point I was about to make.  In terms of the activism and the significance, in terms of removing another important barrier, we've already dealt with the Supreme Court decision but then also there was 1955.  Mrs. Rosa Parks sat down on that bus and refused to get up.  And, of course, that, you know, launched, that boycott [Montgomery Bus Boycott] it just was like a firestorm throughout the South and, and launched Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And it impacted me in a very personal kind of way because--
Speaker 2: Were you heading up the NAACP youth at that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was, I was, yes, I was a, yes, I was a leader in that group, yes.  And also I, I mentioned my, my parents [Ruth Alford Mack and Abraham Mack] initially drove me from Darlington [South Carolina] to A and T to enroll but routinely after that for holidays, Christmas, Thanksgiving, I was traveling by bus.  Rosa Parks took that courageous and heroic action and stand.  As a result of that the Interstate Commerce Commission outlawed segregated bus, you know, transportation, interstate basis.  I was traveling from South Carolina to North Carolina and frequently I was the only black face on that bus but because of Rosa Parks, I always made a point of sitting, if not in the very front seat, but in the front of the bus because of that lady's action.
Speaker 2: And her courage.
Speaker 1: And her courage.  And if looks could kill I would have been dead many times over, I mean you could cut the hatred and the bitterness with a knife.  I mean, there were people who, and yes, I guess, one part of me was certainly a little scared and nervous but that was my personal, my personal stand that grew out of these, you know, these various important developments from a civil rights standpoint and, and certainly that was beginning to lay that foundation for a commitment to, to activism and a commitment to justice and equality.
Story_ID: 622195
Speaker 1: Now, did you continue this into your sophomore year and beyond?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, yes, we, yeah, yeah.  We, we continued to remain active with NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] campus youth group.  And, you know, and, and then through our other, you know.  I mean, this--and then remember also, well, I, I maybe jumping ahead of myself now because I don't, we're, we are not in Atlanta [Georgia] yet, but I will, I will just make this comment.  A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], everyone should remember, is the place where those students sat in.  Now I, I had just, I graduated in 1958, so I had, you know, had just, had moved on but that, that's where those students refused to, you, you know, they sat down at a lunch counter and refused to get up.
Speaker 1: We're talking about the Jesse Jacksons [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] and--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, we, yep.
Speaker 1: --a number of them.
Speaker 2: And, you know--
Speaker 1: Who--
Speaker 2: --A, A and T has some, has some people who've really made an important mark.  I mean, certainly Jesse Jackson is a product of A and T.  And then the, and the other students who, you know, who participated in, in the sit-ins there.  I'll tell you who, who, who was a, a classmate of mine, Congressman Ed Towns [Edolphus Towns] out of Brooklyn [New York].  Towns and I were at A and T together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So those, those, those were some, some, some very significant years.
Story_ID: 622196
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And that's also really where I met, where I was first introduced to Whitney Young.
Speaker 2: All right.  There at A, at A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Tell us about that meeting.
Speaker 1: The, I'll tell you it was my senior year, and by the way I had become, at that point I was, I was elected president of my senior class.  But there was Dr. William Robinson [sic. Leonard H. Robinson], we called him Buddha Robinson, he and Whitney, he headed our sociology department at A and T.  And he had invited Whitney Young to come to address the senior class in sociology.  And, of course, Whitney Young was, was recruiting students for the Atlanta University School of Social Work [Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia].  This was in the, you know, spring of the year when we were nearing our commencement.  And Whitney came and just mesmerizes, I mean he came and he talked about the university, about the School of Social Work, about the Atlanta, that great, you know, intellectual bastion there.  And, and what a, a tremendous place for young people who wanted to continue to prepare themselves professionally and, and, you know, academically.  And so after, and he, you know, he, he, he was just so impressive and so influential.  After he completed his presentation he waited, he, he, he didn't rush off, he waited around and took some time talking with us individually as students and having an opportunity, you know, to get to know some of us as well.  And so, you know, he and I, you know, engaged in a conversation.  And, and, you know, I always remember I said, "Mr. Young, I really was very, very impressed with what you had to say and you have sold me on Atlanta University is the place to go.  I have a slight problem, I don't have any money," (laughter), "to, to afford the institution."  So we kind of laughed and, and talked a little bit more.  And he said, his last words, he said, "You know, I'll, I'll, I'll get back with you."  And within no more than two to three weeks, I received a letter from Whitney Young indicating that he would like for me to enroll in the university and he had arranged a scholarship for me--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --to attend the university (laughter).  And that was really, really just so exciting and that, that made that important link, you know, to the next critical period of my life--
Speaker 2: Of your life.
Speaker 1: --which was the defining period in so many ways, Atlanta [Georgia].
Story_ID: 622197
Speaker 1: During that period, your activist period there as a student at North Carolina A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], a tragedy did happen at home.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  My, my father [Abraham Mack] passed while I was a student at A and T.  And I, you know, one of my, one of my real regrets, I mean, he passed, this would've been my junior year at A and T and, you know, I really regretted he did not have the, didn't live to see me graduate--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --from A and T, first of all, and then, of course, he didn't, he did not have the opportunity to, to see me experience what my years in Atlanta [Georgia] and then, of course, later on with the Urban League.  So that--
Speaker 1: How did, how did you get the news?  I mean, how did the news come to you on campus?
Speaker 2: You know, my mother [Ruth Alford Mack] called and, you know, and, and told me.  And, I mean, needless to say it was a very, very sad, sad period for all of us because, you know, I loved my father very much and as I've already indicated I mean he, he, he too was an important role model.  He was a man of great dignity and, and he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can you describe for us what happened or is that--?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, it, my father was not a young man when he passed, he was in his seventies.  And, of course, at that point in time to live to age seventy was a, a long, long life.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Of course, today that's a (laughter) relatively, you know, you, we live much longer.  So it's a common, just due to a combination of physical ailments but as much as anything just age caught up with him and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --various health issues, got the best of him.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so.
Speaker 1: And that was traumatic for you?
Speaker 2: Yes, it, it was, it was, it was very, very, it was very traumatic.  And as I say he, he, he meant a lot to me and, and, it, it hurt.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I also knew that he would, he would want me to continue to pursue my education and to prepare myself for, for life.  And, you know, it's interesting, I think he, my father, I'm sure would have liked for me to have become a minister, but if he had lived long enough to, to see what I did, I'd like to think that he would have been satisfied and would have felt rewarded as, as a number of my clergy friends over the years in Los Angeles [California] said to me that what I ended up doing was a form of ministry.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: So, I'd, I'd like to think that he's looked down and smiled up on me.
Speaker 1: And he saw the route you were going because you had become an activist on campus--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: --while he was still living and so forth (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, so at least he had seen the beginning, yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He had seen the beginning.
Story_ID: 622198
Speaker 1: Now a part of that activism was a very important figure coming to campus, the Reverend Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah, and I've, you know, talked, of course, about Mrs. Parks [Rosa Parks] and, and her courageous action on that bus in Montgomery [Alabama] which as, you know, really launched Dr. King as the head of the movement to carry on.  And during that time throughout, especially the South, but, you know, also I'm sure throughout the nation but as Dr., Dr. King was beginning initially to establish himself, to reach out, to try to mobilize support for the, for their cause in Montgomery.  And I'll always remember the first time that I was exposed to him.  He, he was invited to speak at Bennett College [Greensboro, North Carolina] and it was jam packed, I mean, Bennett students, A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] students, as well as, you know, people from the community.  And, and he gave his, one of his incredible, profound, inspiring speeches that just reinforced for me the need for, for all of us, especially young black people at that point and time, and, and I felt even more keenly young people who were preparing ourselves educationally, you know, to provide leadership to, you know, to commit ourselves to not only to support as best as we could the Montgomery Bus Boycott but being, you know, students 'cause a lot of 'em weren't able to do too much from a long distance except to provide moral support.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But equally important was to help spread that message of justice and, and to address injustice where we were.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I think that was the powerful impact that Dr. King had upon me and had upon, you know, our other students at that point in time.  Of course, later on as you well know we were talking about it, I had a more direct kind of relationship with him in Atlanta [Georgia], but yeah, that, but that was my first exposure to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that--
Speaker 1: And it was electrifying.
Speaker 2: And it was electrifying, it was electrifying.

Speaker 1: Now, Whitney Young, you told him you would love to attend Atlanta University but you did not have--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the funds to pay for tuition.  And then about three weeks after that you're about to graduate and you hear from Whitney Young--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --who was down at Atlanta University.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us about what he says and what that experience was that drew you to Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Well that that was an incredible, profound experience.  I did not realize it then, but that was the--my transition to the next phase in my life that was going to truly, truly impact me forever and become really the defining period in my life and to help lay the groundwork for what I would subsequently do over a professional career.  He--first, he, he wrote me this, you know, very, it's a very positive letter, a good letter, I mean, I was, first of all, I was, I was surprised to hear from him so quickly (laughter).  And I was flattered and, and overwhelmed that he wanted me to enroll in the university.  And--
Speaker 1: As a graduate student?
Speaker 2: As a graduate student, yes, at Atlanta University School of Social Work [Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia] which at that point in time was the top school of social work in America, bar none.  And--
Speaker 1: When you say bar none, you mean, white or black?
Speaker 2: White or black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, of course, the other important thing he did was to find a way to, you know, provide the financial resource.  But no, no, and see what Whitney  had done, well, before he came to the university he had, you know, he had been with the Urban League [National Urban League] and in St. Paul, Minnesota, Omaha, Nebraska.  Whitney caused that, you know, the school of social work and the university to become an activist institution.  He, he was preparing social workers as he used to put it, not to just help people adjust to their misery in life, but preparing people to change society to become, he, he was preparing us as change agents.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And his vision, his influence, and his focus was always there.  Whitney was what I choose to call a pragmatic idealist.  He, yes, he, he, he dreamed the impossible dream.  He, he shared the idealism of others of our great leaders.  But also he at a very practical level he was a, a leader who really knew how to effectively bring about solutions to issues and problems.  And that was one of the, you know, important influences that he had upon me.  And I know when we first, my classmates and I first enrolled and attended he, you know, gave a very inspiring and, and uplifting speech just kind of laying out his vision and the university's vision and what hoped to accomplish and, and it was highly motivating.  Whitney became my, my mentor in, in many ways, my hero.
Story_ID: 622200
Speaker 1: And, of course, the Atlanta [Georgia] experience was, was one in which I both gained an important professional degree that prepared me academically for my life's work, but equally as important it was during, it was important history, being a part of the Atlanta student civil rights movement [Atlanta Student Movement].
Speaker 2: So, let's, let's set that scene.  We're talking about now '56 [1956], fifty--
Speaker 1: Fifty-eight [1958], yeah.
Speaker 2: So, '58 [1958]?
Speaker 1: Fifty-eight [1958], yes, '58 [1958] to '60 [1960] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, and here we have Whitney Young heading up the Atlanta University School of Social Work [Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia].  Let's name some of the people on the scene during those years.
Speaker 1: Now, it, it, it was--
Speaker 2: A phenomenal--
Speaker 1: --a powerful scene.  I mean, just, just, you know, leaders of, of great, great vision, great import.  You have Whitney Young, Atlanta University School of Social Work.  Dr. Benjamin Mays, the legendary president of Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] was on the scene.  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had just returned from Montgomery [Alabama] to co-pastor Ebenezer Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia] along with Dr. Martin Luther King, Sr. [sic. Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.], his father--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --where my, my wife, Harriett [Harriett Hicks Johnson Mack] and I courted where, you know, we courted and attended service there.  Then we had Carl Holman [M. Carl Holman] who was at the time over at Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  Then let me see, then out on the, on the local Atlanta scene, then you had Reverend William Holmes Borders another one of those powerful legendary ministers, pastor of Wheat Street Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia].  Jesse Hill, Atlanta Life [Atlanta Life Insurance Company; Atlanta Life Financial Group, Atlanta, Georgia], who was one of the strong business leaders and our support.  Don Hollowell [Donald Hollowell], one of the, you talk about unsung heroes, the late Don Hollowell who was a brilliant civil rights lawyer who really was on a, on a pro bono basis, I mean, he, he, he just, as we're planning our student demonstrations he was the one who would always bail us out and, and provide the legal, and provide the, the legal support.  And I might add in that connection, later on this, I mean, I had left the scene but Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] had joined Donald Hollowell's staff, when Vernon walked with [HistoryMaker] Charlayne Hunter-Gault and Hamilton Holmes when they opened up the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia].  So, you had, you know, so, so, you have these, these were our advisors, these were our mentors, these were our role models.
Story_ID: 622201
Speaker 1: Then on, then our student group was, was comprised of an incredible group of people too.  We formed this group called the student appeal on human rights [Committee on Appeal for Human Rights].  Keep in mind this was 1960, just after the students at A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] had, you know, had sat down at a lunch counter, and when, when the whole student civil rights movement just spread like wildfire throughout the South.  I mean, there was the, you know, the, the, the action that launched it at A and T but then you, they, they had, the in Nashville [Tennessee] you had a group of activist students there, Atlanta [Atlanta Student Movement], you know, just throughout, where you had major African American colleges and universities [HBCUs].  And we came up with the unique approach, since we had these outstanding academic institutions, there was Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] the graduate institution, had Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia], the Interdenominational Theological seminary [Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia], and we came together and people used to joke and say maybe it was the first time we all came together for anything (laughter).  But we agreed that we would have, each institution would have three student representatives per institution to come together to establish this group called the student appeal on human rights, which really was the forerunner to SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: That, that's another important part of history (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Part of history.
Speaker 1: --that not everybody understands and recognizes.  Now I had, I, I left in 1960 so, you know, I, I left just before, you know, [HistoryMaker] John Lewis and the others came in but it formed, and, and, you know, get that next phase going.  But in any event, in our group, Lonnie, there was a fellow named Lonnie King [Lonnie C. King, Jr.] who was a student at Morehouse.  Lonnie was elected the chair, chairperson of our group.  I was elected the vice chairperson of the group.  We had representatives, some of the other representatives from the various institutions, [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond from Morehouse, [HistoryMaker] Marian Wright Edelman from Spelman, Otis Moss [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Otis Moss, Jr.], now a very prominent minister in Cleveland, Ohio, and chairman of the board of Morehouse now.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Ben, the late Ben Brown [Benjamin D. Brown], used to be, he, he later went on to become a very active person in the Democratic Party.  Ben was from Clark.  Johnny Parham [Johnny E. Parham, Jr.] one of my classmates and, and friends from, from the university.
Story_ID: 622202
Speaker 1: There were some newspaper publishers that in- was influencing you maybe at that time too, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, we, yes.  I'll tell you, we that, again, it was another one of these things that underscored for me and I think for all of us that you don't--hatred and bitterness and, and, and is not gonna get it and also to just write all white people off as being evil or, or, or being racist is just so wrong.  We had a, a Ralph McGill who was the publisher of the Atlanta Constitution [Atlanta Journal-Constitution] was one of our biggest champions and he encountered a lot of hostility and a lot of resentment and a lot of name calling because he, he used his very powerful position as the publisher of the Atlanta Constitution to support us.  I mean, the paper, under his leadership--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --was a strong supporter--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --of not just the students but of the, you know, civil rights and the importance of creating that level playing field and justice.  And then we had the late William Hartsfield [William B. Hartsfield] who was mayor, who, who, who coined the slogan Atlanta [Georgia], the city too busy to hate.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Hartsfield was the mayor.  The chief, the police chief was Herbert Jenkins [Herbert T. Jenkins, Sr.].  Of course, now he wasn't too thrilled what we were up to.  And but yes, we, we--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we had that kind of environment.
Speaker 1: And how about those in the black press?  Were there any prominent names?
Speaker 2: Well, I have to you, (laughter) I, I don't want to be too negative here but frankly, we didn't get the support at that point in time from the Atlanta Daily World.  The late C.A. Scott was the publisher and he was not sympathetic toward our cause.  He--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --he felt we were rabblerousers and we should leave well enough alone.  But now the, the Atlanta Inquirer was born out of the civil rights--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the student civil rights movement [Atlanta Student Movement].  Julian became the first publisher of that paper.
Speaker 1: Okay.  [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond--
Speaker 2: Yes, Julian Bond.
Speaker 1: --the current chairman--
Speaker 2: Current chairman of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That's, yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Because and frankly we, that was one of the decisions that we made that we needed to establish our own paper, our own voice, because quite frankly, we were getting more support from the Constitution, the white paper, than we were from our own.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, to be kind and fair, of course, we were talking about 1960.  Mr. Scott is no longer around.  The Atlanta Daily World is still there, and, and I'm sure that over the years it has become, obviously much more supportive--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, of, of the, of the cause.  But the, but no, that, that paper and, and John, the current publisher, John--
Speaker 1: Ware?
Speaker 2: --Williams.
Speaker 1: Williams [ph.].
Speaker 2: Yes, is the current, and but no, that that that was one of the things happened. Because I, I always remembered we [Committee on Appeal for Human Rights], we were planning to hold a big protest meeting, a big rally.  We were gonna do it at the Wheat Street Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia], Dr. Borders' [William Holmes Borders] church.  And we were not only preparing flyers to try to get a big turnout, but frankly because of the financial support we had gotten from people like Jesse Hill and some of the other prominent African American business leaders and community leaders, we wanted to buy some advertising space to promote the event in the Atlanta Daily World but Mr. Scott refused to even accept our money to run the ad, so it got, that was--now that that that led toward the, you know, I don't wanna, I'm not bitter about it but, but it was, it was something that was a wakeup call for us, we recognized that not all of our people were always on board with what we were trying to get done.
Speaker 1: So there was sort of a split between what was some of the older people called the young rebels.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --then the older community that had perhaps was more willing to put up with--
Speaker 2: Yeah, to put up with things--
Speaker 1: --current conditions.
Speaker 2: --they were, had reached a certain point in life they felt comfortable and content.  But in fairness though these other people I've mentioned, I mean, there were, there were some, I mean, we had some very, you know, prominent, Atlanta has always had a fairly strong African American business community and we had, you know, some black business leaders who were there with us, I wanna be fair toward them.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then, you know, and then, of course, as I mentioned there was Reverend Borders, Dr. Martin Luther King, Sr. [sic. Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.], and, and others who were clearly with us.  So but, but you're right I mean there, there were, we did have this, this, this issue here of, of something of a dichotomy there.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And some of 'em figure, "Well, those young students out there, you know," (laughter), "they ought to stay on campus and study and leave," (laughter), "leave well enough alone."
Speaker 1: And, and, during this period you were at Atlanta University [Atlanta University School of Social Work; Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and that's where you received your master's degree?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  I did.
Speaker 1: From there you stayed in Atlanta but you went on to Clark?
Speaker 2: Well, moved from there to California.
Story_ID: 622203
Speaker 1: But let me just share (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --let me just share a little more about--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --some of our experiences though that were standout in, in, in mind.  We, this organization I talked about, the student appeal on human rights [Committee on Appeal for Human Rights], we planned various demonstrations.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And where we were attacking segregation and discrimination in various levels, the local, state, and the federal levels.  And again this is where the powerful influence of people like Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Whitney Young became so significant.  We, our group, sometimes as a group, and sometimes maybe just several of us on behalf of the group, I mean, spent literally hours, with Dr. King, hours with Whitney Young, where we were sharing with them our thoughts and our plans and they're providing, you know, valuable--
Speaker 2: Guidance (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) insights to us.  For example, the whole idea, I mean, Dr.--I remember some of our discussions with Dr. King when we were trying to figure out targets, you know, and he'd, you know, and he'd made the point that it's very important to select the right target both because you wanna make sure that it's a target that is truly unjust and truly segregating our people, but also one in which you can mobilize, have the ability to mobilize public opinion in your favor and be able to, to gain some victories.  In that regard, Rich's Department Store [Atlanta, Georgia] was a target.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Rich's was the, the big department store.  You know, they would take people's money by selling their merchandise to them, but weren't hiring our folk and, of course, they had a little lunch counter too.  And symbolically we knew if we could--his, his point was if you take on Rich's and you're successful there, that's gonna send out a message.
Speaker 2: Now, you're saying that was Dr. King's idea or--
Speaker 1: No, well, I'm well, yeah, he--
Speaker 2: --Whitney?
Speaker 1: --he was influencing, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He started out by saying, you know, be, his point was select the right targets.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, you know, think about the ones that symbolize on the Atlanta [Georgia] scene, you know, the most, the ones that have the greatest influence and the ones if you, if you can hit this one, and, and gain a victory well, then that's gonna cause some others to fall in line.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So as I, as a result of that kind of conversation then we, we agreed that Rich's was a logical target.
Speaker 2: Prime target.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Right.  I got you.
Speaker 1: And we went and we, you know, we, we had, you know, we held demonstration against them and we were able to successfully change their policies and practices.  We in a similar, a similar vein we, the old A, A and P supermarkets [The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company] were big down in the South in Atlanta.  And there, there was an A and P supermarket in a predominantly black neighborhood that wasn't hiring our people.  So again, we, you know, we went after A and P and we were able to break their backs.  And we, and let me back, let me just, and I wanna talk about one, the one that was probably the most creative where simultaneously in one day, several of us led demonstrations against targets that were both at the local level, state, and federal.
Story_ID: 622204
Speaker 1: But before I get to that, let, let me just, share this, this, this insight.  Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], he and some of his colleagues literally worked with us to make sure that we, that we bought into and understood the power of nonviolent resistance.  Because let's face it, we were young students--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --angry, wanting to change things, and we were not as patient as (laughter) older folk, and some of us would have been more inclined to not, to not be nonviolent.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, literally, I mean, there were actual sessions in which we, you know, we were trained into the tactics of nonviolent resistance--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --at, you know, in, in, in proceeding with our demonstrations.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And we sometimes would have to, in discussion with some of our colleagues who were not inclined to be nonviolent, we would have to say, "We understand that, we respect you, we aren't gonna put you down, but maybe you can help the cause in another way.  You can lick some stamps," (laughter), "or, or pass out some flyers.  But if you, if you're gonna get out here and engage in behavior that's gonna be counterproductive in its way, well, then it may be better for you to sit this out."  So it was about different people assuming different roles.  And this was, you know, and this was the kind of thought press, process that not only Dr. King but Whitney [Whitney Young] also were very, very good.  I mean, I spent many hours and days since Whitney was my dean at the, at the dean's residence there and his wife, Margaret [Margaret Buckner Young], would cook food and, (laughter) and, you know, help get past those missed meal cramps--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --and as we were, as we would talk about not only the movement but also in the case of Whitney, you know, just life and, and, and preparing for life.
Story_ID: 622205
Speaker 1: Wanted to just go back a little because I remembered that I wanted to cover an important part of your life.  You, your roommate there at North Carolina A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] played an important role in your marital status today.  Tell us about that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --roommate, how close he was, and then later when you met your, your current wife, Harriett [Harriett Hicks Johnson Mack] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Actually, it was my roommate at Atlanta University [Atlanta University School of Social Work; Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Atlanta University, right.
Speaker 2: Yes, 'cause he actually graduated from Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and then we were--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --my room, you're talking about Henry Johnson who is now my brother-in-law (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: At the time we were roommates and classmates at the, Atlanta University.  And right away we, we became fast friends.  Hank was just a very outgoing, gregarious fellow, and Hank, Hank had a twin sister named Harriett.  I said Hank went to Morehouse and Harriett went to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And Harriett was teaching in Monroe, Georgia, a little town about forty miles north [sic. east] of Atlanta [Georgia].  And its big claim to fame was that they had, had, had hung more African Americans, I mean, that, you know, that, that was lynched, lynched, I should say.  So it was a place where they really felt black folk ought to stay in their place.  Harriett would come up to Atlanta from time to time, you know, wanting to hang out with, with her brother.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And her brother was, was, you know, really (laughter) not interested in hanging out so much with his sister (laughter) but--'cause he had another lady in his life.  So Hank introduced the two of us.  And, you know, he, he, he mentioned that, "You know, my sister lives and works in Monroe, Georgia, and, and she's gonna be coming up this weekend to visit, and if you don't mind I'd like to introduce you to her."  So I said, "Okay, fine."  At the time I, I had no other, no, no other romantic involvement.  I should say no other serious romantic involvement.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so, you know, we, we did, the three of us met and had, you know, went out and, and we had a bite to eat and what have you and, and so we, as, as we talked we, we warmed up to each other.  I think she liked me and I liked her, I guess, the saying goes it was probably love at first sight (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So that evening, of course, was a three way get together but then we agreed that we would, that we would wanna see each other again.  And then from that point forward, we, we exchanged information so I contacted her and then on her, you know, she planned a subsequent visit to Atlanta and, you know, we, and then the relationship began.
Speaker 1: Grew.
Speaker 2: And, and there was another very important person in her life 'cause she would stay with an aunt who lived in Atlanta, Aunt Bit [ph.] we called her, and her husband when she would come, you know, to visit.  So and, and Aunt Bit was very close to her and so she would talk with Aunt Bit and Aunt Bit would give advice.  And, and then she at a, at a certain point in time I was introduced to Aunt Bit and so she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Which was formal in those days.
Speaker 2: Right, yes--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --so she could give me the once over (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And either, you know, give her blessings or not (laughter).  So, so Aunt Bit gave her blessings.  And, and we would and, and she would, she would come not every weekend but, you know, from whenever she could arrange it.  And we would, as I mentioned earlier, we would frequently attend Ebenezer Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia] as a part of our courtship and, and, you know, hear Dr. King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and, and, Sr. [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] preach.  And Aunt Bit by the way sang in the, in the Ebenezer choir.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that was another important part of it.
Story_ID: 622206
Speaker 1: No, that that's, that was the beginning of, of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of, of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How long between that period, when you two were courting and you decided to get married?  And how did that come about?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, actually, it was, it was not a long courtship.  We, we, we courted each other for about six months.  And then we decided this was by the way in 1950, we, we married actually in the summer of 1959.  We were introduced, you know, earlier that year by, by Hank [Henry Johnson], my brother-in-law.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And it was the summer.  And in the meantime I should point out too at another point in time I was introduced to, to Henry and Harriett's [Harriett Hicks Johnson Mack] mother, Mrs. Hattie Mae Johnson [Hattie Mae Dye Johnson].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The father had, had passed.
Speaker 2: They lived, lived in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They lived, no, they lived in Elberton, Georgia.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Actually, Harriett and Hank were born in Atlanta [Georgia] but they grew up in Elberton--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Georgia.  So we, I had gone down at one point and Mrs., Mrs. Hattie Mae Johnson was a pretty stern lady she was--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --(laughter) not easy to, to--
Speaker 2: You had to pass that test.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, you had to pass that, that that was a, a tough test (laughter).  But I was finally able to pass the test with Mrs. Hattie Mae Johnson.  And we were married in her, her home--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in, in Elberton, Georgia, in the family home I should say.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That summer.  And since, you know, we were, I was, I was a student and, and she was just beginning, well, we didn't have a big elaborate honeymoon or anything, we--we honeymooned the weekend at Waluhaje [Waluhaje Apartments, Atlanta, Georgia], that's, it's a, it's a (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Tell us where Waluhaje--
Speaker 1: In, in, in Atlanta there used to be, Wala- Waluhaje used to be one of the, the big popular kind of, it was a small hotel in Atlanta and it had a club there and--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --it, it was a real gathering place for, you know, for, and they had entertainment there, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause that was one of the hot spots in the community.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Waluhaje hotel.  And, of course, Paschal's Restaurant--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was another, one of those important spots in Atlanta.
Speaker 2: Paschal's Restaurant was where Julian [HistoryMaker Julian Bond] used to talk about all of the people--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, Paschal's, that, that's where they had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's where the leadership met.
Speaker 1: --that was the gathering, that's, that's where the black leadership gathered, yes.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Paschal's.  That's where, you know, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Julian and, yeah, just, that, that was the gathering place.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: At Paschal's, yeah.  But no, it's been a wonderful, wonderful marriage.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And today you're, you two are still married.
Speaker 1: --and we're, we're still married and we have three wonderful adult children.  So, now that, so clearly that's another important part of the Atlanta experience in my life.  It's, it's, very (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Quite a milestone too.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, important milestone where I met my wife and, and, and we fell in love and just had a great, great, we've had a great marriage.
Story_ID: 622207
Speaker 1: So we're gonna come forward again to where you are there at Atlanta [Georgia].  You're one of the leaders in the demonstrations that are going on, your mentoring and guidance is coming from Whitney Young and Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and other leaders who are involved in this (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right, right.
Speaker 1: And there came a time when you decided let's take Rich's Department Store [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Rich's Department Store, yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Give us that, those details.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Rich's, Rich's Department Store was the, as I said, it was the, the largest department store in Atlanta.  It was, you know, a major business there.  I mean, everybody shopped at Rich's across all kinds of racial lines and what have you, professionals, business people, and students, to the extent that we could afford it.
Speaker 1: Even though they weren't treated equally.
Speaker 2: Even though we weren't treated, we were not, even though, at that point in time, they were not hiring black people.  And they had a, Rich's had a, a little dining area and they were not serving.  So--
Speaker 1: And they did not allow, I know, the women to try on hats there, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, yeah, woman couldn't try on hats and certain clothing.  So, yeah, just, it was, I mean, just, just funky, bad treatment (laughter), any way you cut it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, we said enough is enough of, a combination of the advice by, you know, Dr. King and his target selecting, select a target that clearly, I mean, where, where it's very obvious to the public that they're engaging in discriminatory, racist behavior against black people so that there's, there's nothing vague about it on the one hand but also a target that, if you're successful and effective in winning that victory, that's gonna set the tone for others and the others, some others may just fall into line.  So we, we, after quite a bit of discussion back and forth, we, we, we selected Rich's Department Store and, and held demonstrations there.  First the management was, you know, resistant or trying to ignore us but we didn't go away.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We were there day after day and, of course, we planned and had people.  You know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's--
Speaker 2: --had groups on assignment, you know, and just--
Speaker 1: Give us some examples of, of things that you might do there at Rich's.
Speaker 2: Well, we, we, we were marching, you know, on, on, on the streets out in front of Rich's.  And, you know, we, we had again, we, we, we as a part of our planning, I talked a little earlier about the non- we were very dissident as a nonviolent, peaceful resistance.  And we also, in our recruitment strategy, we recruited people so that on certain days a certain group of, of student protesters would go, would go out there so that we wouldn't have the same people out every day because that was not possible, you know, due to--
Speaker 1: School (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) commitments and school and what have you.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So that we, we, we had a schedule of, of days that certain ones of us would be out.  And then from the leadership perspective various ones of us would take turns, you know, leading these demonstrations.
Story_ID: 622208
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, even though you were not--you were nonviolent, how did Rich's [Rich's Department Store, Atlanta, Georgia] and their management and security people respond?
Speaker 2: Well, they, they tried to ignore us at first but as we were continuing the demonstrations, and keep in mind back to my point that I made about Ralph McGill and the Atlanta Constitution [Atlanta Journal-Constitution], we were receiving strong, you know, coverage and support from, and the Atlanta Constitution was the major newspaper in town.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So that helped a lot.  And we began to build momentum.  And after a while it became apparent and that that these things needed to change.  And even though initially Chief Herbert Jenkins [Herbert T. Jenkins, Sr.] and even Mayor Hartsfield [William B. Hartsfield] were not too keen on our getting out there they, when they saw that how well coordinated we were and how focused we were, then some of the powers that be began to talk to the Rich's management and they finally, you know, changed their policies and, and practices.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, after we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Without incident.
Speaker 2: Without incident.  Now, having said that, that we would sometimes have counterdemonstrations from the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Where they would call us all kinds of names and spit on us and threaten, threaten our physical safety, and that's where our discipline became important--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because it was important that we not retaliate or, or respond in kind.  And even though the police chief, Jenkins, was not too enthusiastic about demonstrations, at least we had a police presence and the police did, they were there to make sure that there were no incidents or at least that that we, our right to demonstrate, our right to protest was protected.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were the Klans there in uniform or did they come as plainclothes Klans?
Speaker 2: Both ways.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Both ways.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And just hurling all kinds of epithets and just, you know, just garbage that I'm not gonna repeat.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But, but I'm sure that, you know, and, and your viewers will, can only imagine but that.  And as I said literally spitting on us and literally, you know.
Speaker 1: But the police formed a line--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to keep it from becoming physical (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, to, to keep, to keep it, yes, right, to keep it from becoming physical and keep them under control.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So that, that part helped.
Story_ID: 622209
Speaker 1: But the demonstration of all demonstrations, we had--this was in the spring of 1960.  We wanted to attack segregation at the local level, state level, and federal level.  And three of us headed, Lonnie King [Lonnie C. King, Jr.] headed one group, I headed another group, and I'm trying to recall who had--I think it was Johnny Parham [Johnny E. Parham, Jr.] maybe who headed a third group.  One was on the Fulton County Courthouse [Atlanta, Georgia] that was to attack at the state, the, the, I mean, at the county, local level.  Another group went to the state capitol [Georgia State Capitol, Atlanta, Georgia].  So then I led the group that demonstrated at the Peachtree cafeteria [ph.].  Peachtree cafeteria was a federal--it was, it was occupied by the federal government but it was leased from a local entrepreneur.  And that was the focus of, of my group was to go at the, the federal government for, for being a party to discrimination and segregation.  And we, the way we strategized it, all three demonstrations occurred at the same time, high noon, on the same day (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And just, and needless to say it just, it created all kinds of media attention.  And at this stage of the game we had really gained a lot of momentum and there was tremendous community support for, you know, for what we were doing.  And the--and while our administrators had to be careful they didn't endorse us or, you know, just being out of school and that kind of thing but certainly, I mean, Whitney [Whitney Young] was there with us and Carl Holman [M. Carl Holman] and people like that were supportive of us.  And--
Speaker 2: And what was Carl Holman's role there?
Speaker 1: Carl, Carl was, at that time he was an instructor at, at Spelman [sic. Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And but he too was, you know, very supportive of what we were doing.  And, and, and one of the advisors, one of the people who, who was very closely aligned with the students and what we were, and he was a part of those adult advisors there with us.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And who were there to support us but also there to help us strategize and think through our, our, our plans.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, and, of course, he went on to head the National Urban Coalition, I think as--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --many would, of your viewers would know.
Speaker 2: Right.  And [HistoryMaker] Marian Wright Edelman.
Speaker 1: And Marian Wright Edelman.  Marian was a student at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And she was, you know, a part of the, the group.  We--
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond at that time.
Speaker 1: Julian Bond, Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] yep.
Speaker 2: He was a student at More--
Speaker 1: He was a student Morehouse, yep.
Speaker 2: At that time.
Speaker 1: And part of the group, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And the, you know, they were both members, very dedicated and committed members.  And, and Julian has great writing skills and he would write, he would do quite a bit of our journalistic, you know--
Speaker 2: Work.
Speaker 1: --work.  As I mentioned before, he went on to actually, once the, our group subsequently decided we needed to establish our own newspaper, Julian became the first editor of that newspaper.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: The Inquirer [Atlanta Inquirer].
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, right.
Story_ID: 622210
Speaker 1: And we, Don Hollowell [Donald Hollowell] was, was the lawyer to (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And we planned, we knew that a number of us would, would go to jail on this, on this occasion and we planned all that, had, with, with, you know, with Don Hollowell on the one hand from a legal perspective and some of the businesspeople, you know, the Jesse Hills and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and there was another, Quentin [Q.V. Williamson], I'm trying to think at this time of his last name, he was a very successful real estate man, he went on to become a member in our city council would support, these men contributed money, you know, to cover, you know, to, to, to bail us out and that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: As did Jesse Hill would (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And Jesse Hill, yes.  Clearly, Jesse was one of the important leaders and supporters in that regard.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And a funny thing happened (laughter) in, in, in my case, the, a warrant was issued for my arrest, but the warrant (laughter) was, they got the name confused and the warrant was issued in the name of Ted Mack.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And so, they were running around trying to find Ted Mack (laughter) and the student were all laughing, saying, "Well, the last time we saw him he was on 'The Amateur Hour' ['The Original Amateur Hour']," (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So, so they, so they, they got that one wrong (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.  So, was that an effective strategy, the three strikes?
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, yes, absolutely.  I mean--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --it, it highlighted, it brought tremendous media attention and really helped to impact and influence some, you know, some significant policy changes--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --ultimately.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, no, it, it, it had an effect (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So did that that cafeteria [Peachtree Cafeteria (ph.)] located on federal property--
Speaker 1: They, they, they changed their, the federal government changed that that policy and practice.  I mean, they, they broke the lease from that particular establishment that had, you know, that had the, the record of discrimination.  So, yes, it, it, we were, we were, we accomplished our, our goals and objective.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So you were very, you guys were very, very successful.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Story_ID: 622211
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There's another part of this experience that was important that I, I, I should also mention.  We, as we moved along and, and as our student movement as the momentum grew and the awareness, the public awareness became much more well known and well established, we had some white students who became allies from Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia], Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia], Georgia State University [Georgia State College; Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia], who joined with us--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and in, in very, very--support (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And frequently that story is not told.
Speaker 1: That and that, and that's why I wanna mention it because that part of the story is frequently not told.  I mean, and they were just as dedicated and committed.  And that was another powerful indication that not all white people wished us, wished us ill.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That there were people who, who shared our vision and our dream of an Atlanta [Georgia] and of America in which African Americans would be able to pursue their dreams and we would be able to have a true equal shot, an equal opportunity in life.  And they, they shared our hopes, our aspirations, and, and they were, you know, very, and were willing to put it out there on the line, some of them at great considerable risk.  I'll, I'll, I'll always recall one young man, I'm pretty sure he was a student at Emory, who had become just very, very committed and very active.  And we were, a delegation from our group, there were, I think about six or eight of us, Lonnie King [Lonnie C. King, Jr.], Johnny Coch- oh, Johnny Parham [Johnny E. Parham, Jr.], Julian [HistoryMaker Julian Bond], myself and I, I can't recall who, but we were invited to address the [U.S.] National Student Association, it was meeting in Washington, D.C.  That's when, you know, the, the student civil rights movement had spread all over the place.  And, and from a national perspective there was growing interest from young people as well as not so young people.  And this white student from, I'm, I'm pretty sure it was Emory, he was from North Carolina and we had, you know, rented a, a, a station wagon to drive up 'cause we couldn't afford to fly up.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they didn't send us tickets (laughter), airplane tickets.  So, you know, so we, we drove from Atlanta up to Washington.  And, of course, you know, you stop along the way when you're on a long drive like that for rest breaks and restroom breaks and what have you.  And when we stopped for such a break in Los Angeles [California]--I mean, in, in North Carolina, you know, he was so excited and so pumped up and so very much into what we were doing he, he got on the telephone, yeah, he used a public telephone to call home to tell his parents with all kinds of excitement and enthusiasm, you know, he was with this group of, of black students who were on our way to Washington to tell the story, you know.  And the response he got was, "Don't come back home."  It was just, he was--devastating, it, it was devastating to him and devastating to us but it, but it showed the, where we were and again a generational gap.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: This young student who really, really shared the, the conviction, the idealism and what have you but his parents from another generation--
Speaker 2: Were disowning him.
Speaker 1: Disowning him, I mean, just flat out, I mean, that that hurt, you know, had to hurt--
Speaker 2: Right.  Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --very deeply.  But, but he--
Speaker 2: Did he try, try to turn back or did he continue?
Speaker 1: No, he, no, he, he, he continued with us.
Speaker 2: He was dedicated.
Speaker 1: He was dedicated.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Do you remember his name?
Speaker 1: I do not.  I, I--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I, I regret I, I, I do not recall his name because, you know, we didn't keep in touch over the years, but he continued, no, he was very dedicated and committed.  So, you know, there are all of these kinds of, of, of complicated elements to, to this whole issue of race--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in America and racism.  And, you know, which still is, is the, you know, the, the, the, it, it, it is the unfinished agenda item--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --even though we have made considerable progress.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Story_ID: 622212
Speaker 1: I can think of other experiences.  We were, let me see, Johnny Parham [Jonny E. Parham, Jr.] and myself, there were three or four of us, Lonnie [Lonnie C. King, Jr.], I'm sure, went to, we were invited to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], that was the first time I had flown on an airplane (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --by a group of students from Duquesne [Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], to come and, you know, and speak to them, to share with them our experiences and what have you.  And, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This was still the late '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 1: This, no, no, this, this is 1960.
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty [1960] now?
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty [1960] I'm talking about.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And, and they, now they were able to, they had enough of a budget they could send us airplane tickets (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So we flew up, this was the first time, it was Capital Airlines, the first time I had ever been on an airplane in life and very, very scared (laughter) and, and frightened by that whole experience.  But we went up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But they wanted to hear the story.
Speaker 1: They wanna hear, they wanted to hear the story of, of the Atlanta students civil rights movement [Atlanta Student Movement].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They wanted to hear our story.  You know, they had heard about it but they wanted us to firsthand share with them the experiences and the, the challenges of the struggle.
Speaker 2: Because now the media (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Had begun to--
Speaker 2: --was spreading the story.
Speaker 1: Now, now the media, it had become a national story.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now the media had picked up on it, the major networks were covering, you know, major newspapers around the, the, the country, and, you know, were, were beginning to, to, to cover it.
Story_ID: 622213
Speaker 1: Now you have been invited to Duquesne University up in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], you're taking--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --your first air trip.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The, and a group there at Duquesne have invited you up.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so the student leadership group--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --on the Duquesne campus.
Speaker 1: Because now the phenomena in the South and particularly Atlanta [Georgia] is beginning to go nationwide--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and receive publicity.
Speaker 2: Yes, the, the word is spread.  I mean, the, the, the national media has now kicked (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Locked in.
Speaker 2: --locked in, picked up on the story and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --providing extensive coverage of, of, you know, our, our student demonstration and activities and, you know, the student movement throughout the South but I think ours in Atlanta in particular gained a lot of attention both because of the level of activity and some of the creativity and the impact, I mean, we were getting some results.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And then add on to that, add on to that, the fact that you have, you know, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] there and--
Speaker 1: And Whitney [Whitney Young].
Speaker 2: --Whitney and, you know, these other emerging giants--
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: --within the Civil Rights Movement.  I think, just Atlanta became a focal point.  So the student leadership group there wanted, invited us up so we could tell our story and we spoke before a large group, you know, of, of, of not just students, but students and faculty and other interested parties.
Speaker 1: Any interesting highlights from that trip that we should know about?
Speaker 2: Well, I think generally speaking it, it, it went well for the most, you know, for the most part.  There was a, a lot of, a tremendous amount of support, you know, among the Duquesne, you know, student body for our movement, for our efforts.  The, the--and, and generally speaking the, as I recall, the adult population, and there were, there, there were a few faculty members, who, a few dissenters who were not, you know, with the, with the program.  Speaking of the national press the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier] for example gave us excellent coverage.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, one of the--
Speaker 1: One of the courageous (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) one of the courageous and--
Speaker 1: --and black--
Speaker 2: --outstanding black newspapers in this country for many years.  For us, we were, we were encouraged and really enthusiastic because we realized we're not alone.  It's no longer just limited to Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The support for our cause is growing.  That had a tremendous amount of, of meaning and significance for us and it, it provided us with optimism that we would ultimately succeed.
Speaker 1: Success was on the horizon.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, absolutely.
Story_ID: 622214
Speaker 1: You were receiving this recognition nationally, but how about in the local region, Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, any recognition by major outlets or schools or anything (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 1: --in the southern states?
Speaker 2: No, and, and actually, I, I think probably the, the reason why in the, the South, keep in mind when you talk about historically black colleges [HBCUs] they're in the South, you know, by and large.  So, the student, while we in Atlanta [Georgia] may not have--we, we, we were getting some limited attention but for example Florida, Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] had its own student movement.  Nashville [Tennessee], you know, Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University], Fisk [Fisk University], they, they had it.  So, you know, the, what, what we had was a trend.  I think, there was increased attention and publicity and support but as far as a broader student civil rights movement and, and in specific locales in that region, it would be for those institutions and those student movements in those communities.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they did their thing locally?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But there was no lack of activity?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The activities in those spots--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --were growing?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: What, what, what other things were being done there because I know other civil rights individuals, that was growing?
Speaker 2: By the way yes, and, and this I, I'm glad you raised that because what we also had developing and, and happening, you know, there, there was this burst of, of activity and progressive movement that in many ways was being inspired, you know, or had been ignited by the student civil rights movement in Atlanta [Atlanta Student Movement] and Greensboro [North Carolina] and other places.  But we also had the emergence of, the, the, the--we were beginning to get support from the established civil rights organizations, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] leadership, for example--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --began to weigh in.
Speaker 1: Now, Roy Wilkins was--
Speaker 2: Roy Wilkins was at the time, yeah, Roy Wilkins was then the national head of NAACP at, at that point in time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you know, Roy and the NAA, and then Jim Farmer [James Farmer] and CORE [Congress of Racial Equality]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --were also strong supporters.  Matter of fact CORE was a very active supporter especially around some of the, you know, helping us with some of the, student organizational activities and what have you.  NAACP was weighing in certainly from a legal perspective as well as Roy Wilkins speaking out, you know, in support.  Farmer, and, you know, the, so the, well, later on I don't wanna get too far ahead of the game but, you know, the so called Big Six, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --A. Philip Randolph, and, and others.
Speaker 1: Hold on, hold on.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  We're, we're good.
Speaker 1: We're good?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, did that--
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was just--
Speaker 2: Right and your telephone, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: So, so, you know, so, so that was beginning to emerge too which was adding greater impact, greater significance, you know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to our effort.
Story_ID: 622215
Speaker 1: Now the organization that you had been a part of starting, the student (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Student appeal on human rights [Committee on Appeal for Human Rights].
Speaker 1: --on human rights, was that still called that or had SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, no, it was still called that.  When, when I, I, I graduated in June of 1960--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from Atlanta University [Atlanta University School of Social Work; Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia], and we were still, that was still our, the name of our organization.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was not until, after I had left the Atlanta [Georgia] scene that the, that SNCC, you know, it became, you know, the entity that.  And but some of the same people, I mean, Julian [HistoryMaker Julian Bond] was still around obviously 'cause he was still a student at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And then [HistoryMaker] John Lewis came on the Atlanta scene and, you know, and various others and they were the ones who--
Speaker 1: These were all, this was all after you had left?
Speaker 2: Yeah, after I had, I had left, yes.
Speaker 1: So let's, let's go back to, let's say the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] at that time.  You had been a leader of the NAACP in starting the youth chapter.
Speaker 2: The youth, um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was the activity of the NAACP in Atlanta during that period when you, you were there and at Atlanta University?
Speaker 2: Well, certainly helping to mobilize community support.  See, where an organization like the NAACP played a crucial role, and then this fellow named Clarence Coleman [Clarence D. Coleman] who was with the Urban League [National Urban League] at a regional office there, and, and Mahlon Puryear [HistoryMaker Mahlon T. Puryear], and leaders of, of the NAACP and the Urban League and some of our leading ministers played a key role in bridging the gap between the students on campus and the broader community, the broader Atlanta adult community.  And that was a crucial role, because keep in mind when we initially began, remember we were students who had come from all over the, you know, the, the place, the, the country.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And we were not native Atlantans, you know.  I mean, I say that with some exceptions obviously.  I mean, Johnny Parham [Johnny E. Parham, Jr.] for example one of our, I mean, Johnny was from Atlanta but, you know, most, I mean, I came from, from South Carolina by way of A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, different.  So, we didn't have that connection, there was like a disconnect between the adult community, the broader adult Atlanta community and the student.  'Cause, and this is, was not, I don't think it was necessarily unique to Atlanta, but, you, you know, typically, universities and colleges in their environments, they're, they're kind of isolated--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, from.  So, this is where in my opinion, civil rights organizations and, and, and, you know, and religious leaders played a keep role in helping to bridge that gap and helping to make that connection.  And to, as a result, one, mobilize broader support for our cause.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Two, help provide resources that we needed, you know, to sustain our efforts.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And three, to help interpret to not only the, the Atlanta black community but to the broader community what it was that we were about, what we were trying to accomplish.
Story_ID: 622216
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, did the churches play, and I know some of them did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, some, some--
Speaker 1: --but I mean, did a majority of the churches--
Speaker 2: Well, well, I, I would say a number of them did.  I mean, certainly the ones that, that clearly were very much understanding with us toe to toe.  Obviously Dr., the two Dr. Kings [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr. and Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Ebenezer Baptist [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] and Wheat Street Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia].  And, and there were several others that that were really there actively engaged with us and supportive of us.  Others were, were maybe, I mean, the, the support was, was marginal, a, a tacit, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --kind of thing.  But in terms of helping to mobilize troops and really help us bridge that that gap, you know, it was a--as these things go, and as I learned in life, where you have leadership at the churches of social activism that's where we had the churches there with us.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Where you had ministers who were just totally, pretty much concerned about what was happening inside of the ivory stained walls, you know, who were just concerned about people going to heaven and get in the great beyond and, you know, there was little or no involvement.
Story_ID: 622217
Speaker 1: As you well know, there's the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and then there's the NAACP Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And at that time, Thurgood Marshall was over at the Legal Defense--
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: --Fund.  Did both of those, NAACP and the Legal Defense Fund get involved in the Atlanta [Georgia] movement, we'll call it that?
Speaker 2: It was, it was, I think, more of the, the NAACP--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that was more directly in, involved in the Atlanta student effort [Atlanta Student Movement].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Of course, we all, we obviously admired Thurgood, you know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Marshall and, and the, LD, the Legal Defense Fund and what they had done in the courts and what have you.  But actually keep in mind the Legal Defense Fund was more, was not as broad based as the NAACP in terms of having branches of, you know, and chapters--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, throughout the, the South and, and around the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And we, what, what, what we now have is a blossoming youth movement in Atlanta supported by the Atlanta NAACP and the national NAACP, and--
Speaker 2: And, and CORE [Congress of Racial Equality].
Speaker 1: --and CORE.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was CORE like in, in those days?
Speaker 2: In those days CORE was very active and very, keep in mind, Jim Farmer [James Farmer] was a very progressive and, and outstanding leader.  During those years CORE was a very, very crucial organization, especially as well as because under Jim Farmer's leadership, CORE had really had a strong mission and had a very activist approach to its efforts.  And CORE had some strong chapters in the South--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --during that period of time that worked closely with us, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, were those student chapters or adult?
Speaker 2: No, they, they, they were adults, but I'm, they tend, people who tend to be, you know, activists in, in the, you know, the local community.  And, and, and frankly, it was an opportunity for them to gain some additional (laughter) members and support including, you know, from the ranks of the students.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, and, and that happened, and that was, and that was fine, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But no, no, CORE was, I, as I think about it, probably the, you know, the NAACP and CORE were most active in, from a, from a community or civil rights perspective.  And, of course, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was beginning, and the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] was beginning to get off the ground at that point in time as well.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Okay.  So these groups were growing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --and in support and you were having a number of successes.  And as whites began to join in and lend their support this became more of a national--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --thing.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 622218
Speaker 1: You had been at Atlanta University [Atlanta University School of Social Work; Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia] and--but you graduated from Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] is that it?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: Let me get that straight.
Speaker 2: No, I graduated from A and, North Carolina A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], that's where I got my undergraduate work (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no, right.
Speaker 2: But I graduated from Atlanta University.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  I'm--
Speaker 2: I mean, it's now called Clark Atlanta University.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But at the time it was Atlanta University.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Good enough.  I, I wanted to get, get that part straight, straightened out.  So you graduated in '60 [1960]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And now, and you're a family man (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Did you have any children?
Speaker 2: We just married, just married, we didn't--
Speaker 1: Have--
Speaker 2: --we didn't have any children then--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we were just married.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you, you got an offer to--was, what, had, had Whitney Young left Atlanta University?
Speaker 2: No, I was in Whitney's last class.
Speaker 1: In his last class.
Speaker 2: He, you know, we left together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And he went on to, to New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was selected, Whitney was approached by the National Urban League board to become their next national executive director succeeding Lester Granger.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And the arrangement was that he, he was, he took a one year leave of absence from the university.  And actually, for a year he, he was at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] just, you know, doing some advance work there, some advanced studies and at the same time, obviously, getting to establish some very critical and important relationships as well.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And Whitney called me in, in the spring of that year to his office to share his plans and, you know, inform me that he had been selected by the National Urban League to become the national, the next national executive director.  And he, you know, indicated to me that, you know, he had, you know, become, as he's gotten to know me and certainly throughout this experience both as my dean and as, and, and a mentor and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --advisor in the student movement [Atlanta Student Movement] that, you know, he'd like very much for me to consider, you know, joining him, joining the, the Urban League.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: At that time I didn't know a lot about the Urban League and I wasn't sure if the Urban League was ready for me (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But, but I believed deeply in Whitney and had tremendous admiration and respect for him.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: However, the scholarship that he had arranged for me, while it wasn't a legal commitment, but an ethical, kind of a moral commitment to do some, some social work.  And recruiters from the State of California came down to Atlanta [Georgia] to the university as California was seeking to recruit more African Americans and become more diversified in various areas.  So, they had examiners there or recruiters who--
Speaker 1: Now, when you say California was trying to--
Speaker 2: The State of California (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The state of--
Speaker 2: Through the personnel department.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, they, they came to the campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were trying to recruit people to go to work for California.
Speaker 1: The state.
Speaker 2: The state.  And I took a test on one Saturday morning.  And I had never been to California--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --and to think about going to California is like thinking about going to China (laughter) or some far away land.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: My whole exposure had been on the East Coast--
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: --primarily the South but also, you know, having worked some summers up in Wildwood, New Jersey, and, and, and one summer in New York.  I went just sort of out of a lark, took the test and then passed it.  And at that point in time Harriett [Harriett Hicks Johnson Mack] and I had married.  And so, and got a little excited about that, I said well, what do you think?  At that point, it's just the two of us.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We, we, we thought if we're going to, if we're gonna do it, now is the time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Because we, we don't have, you know, children or have other obligations.  So that was, that was the beginning of the sojourn to California initially, not with the Urban League but working for the State of California.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 622219
Speaker 1: One, but I'll tell you, one very important and frankly very special privilege that I had as like a final responsibility, if you will, as a member of the Atlanta student civil rights movement [Atlanta Student Movement].  Remember this is 1960, the Democratic Convention [1960 Democratic National Convention] is being held in Los Angeles [California]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --where John F. Kennedy [John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was even- subsequently nominated.  The Democratic Party, again, invited a representative from our Atlanta student civil rights movement to come and make a statement, to testify before the platform committee.  And keep in mind as students we had no money and so by coincidence by, I was gonna say by default but at least, because I had just been hired to, (laughter) to go to work for the State of California, my colleagues selected me to be the spokesperson on behalf of the Atlanta student appeal on human rights [Committee on Appeal for Human Rights] at the Democratic Convention.  And needless to say that was a heady experience and an awesome experience.  I mean, because that was an environment at a whole 'nother level.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Here I'm still, a relatively young man who's just graduating from graduate school [Atlanta University School of Social Work; Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia].  While I'd had some bigger than life experiences and opportunities as a result of my action in the, in the student civil rights movement, to walk into that, to the Biltmore Hotel [Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel; Millennium Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, California] for the first time in life, and to walk into that setting to see national, prominent national political leaders I had only seen on television, to see people like Chet Huntley and, and Walter Cronkite just sort of standing around, I mean, you know, (laughter) just observing.  But to have the privilege to again tell our story to the or before the Democratic National Committee, or the national convention platform committee was a very, very unique and memorable experience that I will, you know, always, always recall and cherish.
Speaker 2: You know, I can remember the date of July 12, 1960 [sic. July 15, 1960], when John F. Kennedy accepted the nomination but this would have been a few days before--
Speaker 1: Yes, a few days before, you know, leading up to, yes--
Speaker 2: To, to--
Speaker 1: --leading up to, you know, how, how the, how the conventions operate, I mean, they, it's the platform committee hearings are held usually a week, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --prior to, leading up to, yes.
Speaker 2: Right.  So the--do, do you remember the exact date of that presentation to the platform committee?
Speaker 1: You know, I, it would have been, it, it would have been days before, I don't remember the exact--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: --date.  But it was clearly, you know, early July.
Speaker 2: And so now, now this student movement had reached national proportions.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, clearly a national (unclear).
Speaker 2: Clearly (laughter).
Speaker 1: And again, one of the major political parties was, had, and the invitation had come from, from the--
Speaker 2: From--
Speaker 1: --the, the party.
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean, it wasn't something that we, you know, that, that we lobbied for or even requested.
Story_ID: 622220
Speaker 1: Do you remember any highlights during your presentation that you may have been surprised or, or particularly pleased--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --that they accepted?
Speaker 2: Well, I, first of all it was such an awesome experience (laughter).  I was, you know, I was just over--it was an overwhelming experience.  But in retrospect I think I got through it.  I mean, I, I think I made an effective presentation, certainly there was a positive response, you know, generally speaking from the members of the committee [at the 1960 Democratic National Convention, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, they were very complimentary of, of the, of our efforts in Atlanta [Georgia] and, you know, and appreciative.  And, of course, various people, and frankly, you know, at a time like that in my life, some of this is a blur (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --to be honest about it.  But some of the--I think that the, the presentation, that helped to at least begin to shape some of the thinking in terms of the, you know, some policy recommendations in terms of the whole civil rights effort and the whole desegregation effort.  But that that was such a, such a heady experience.  I, I, I was, you know, I, I was, it was just a great privilege, a great privilege.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this question, given the fact that in 1960, still the majority of Democrats were southerners, Dixiecrats prior to--
Speaker 2: Yep, yeah.
Speaker 1: --or prior to the, where it became, coming popular.  But certainly they were not liberal progressives.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Support, the majority of them supportive of the Civil Rights--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Movement.  Have you ever thought back as to how that faction, that one faction that must have been--
Speaker 2: It was--
Speaker 1: --that decided that we need to hear from this movement when it was not popular--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --with the majority?
Speaker 2: --no, you know, that was, I, I, I guess it was, it was, it was something they couldn't duck if they were gonna claim to, if the Democratic Party was gonna claim to have any concern about its African American constituency, and if they were gonna do more than just give lip service to civil rights.  And keep in mind, the major focus of the student demonstration and the student civil rights movement, not only in Atlanta [Atlanta Student Movement] but throughout the South of America, was on public accommodations.  And while the broader civil rights issue was much more controversial and the, you know, the, that that strong southern wing, even though clearly, (unclear) but we had gained enough momentum that it was rather difficult at this point in time to be against serving somebody a hot dog or a hamburger at a lunch counter.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, so, you know, I think from that standpoint unless the party was going to come off as being completely hypocritical, they had to, they had to at least be receptive.  And so without, without being a party to discussions, I mean, it would, it would, I think that would have to be the basis upon which, it would have been hard even for southern Dixiecrats--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --or conservative Democrats to say, "No, we're not going to listen to these young people," because really we were just, at that point in time, it really, the focus was on public accommodations.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  So the, the party was just gonna disregard the Strom Thurmonds, who was a Democrat--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: --at that time--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: --and who said, "Segregation now, segregation forever," [sic.], so (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Segregation forever, right, yeah, yeah, yeah, but they, they--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, they, they had to, they couldn't go with Strom on that one, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And now if we were, if, and, and I would submit that it was because of that narrow focus.  And keep in mind John F. Kennedy [John Fitzgerald Kennedy] who was about to become the nominee, you know, was concerned about broadening his base of support certainly, you know, among African Americans, among others.  And, you know, how those things go, certainly the, the party nominee is going to have a major say so--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in terms of these kinds of issues and what have you.  So, I, I suspect that all of those elements went into it but that coupled with the narrow focus on public accommodation.  I think, if we had been talking about some other broader civil rights issues, then it probably would have been a different--
Speaker 1: I think that's a good--
Speaker 2: --result.
Speaker 1: --a good point.
Story_ID: 622221
Speaker 1: We've got about one minute left on this tape, but I did want to hear: you were now leaving your old comrades there in a movement [Atlanta Student Movement] and moving to California.  Any regrets that you felt, that you may--that you can express in about a minute?
Speaker 2: I to, to, to leave the Atlanta [Georgia] scene clearly was, I had many mixed emotions, many of it, because I knew that our work was unfinished there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And had formed such close and intense relationships.  And to move, and to begin now my professional life and my wife, Harriett [Harriett Hicks Johnson Mack], and I were gonna begin our, begin as a family.  From the standpoint of beginning as a family it was probably something I was looking forward to.  But I was really--the fire within my belly was still there.
Speaker 1: I would imagine it would be.
Speaker 2: And that part was not easy to, to give up and to walk away from and but I knew in my heart of hearts and my mind that this was just gonna be a temporary, a temporary arrangement.
Speaker 1: And indeed it was.

Speaker 2: Yes, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 622223
Speaker 1: When we left off, you were the, you were the cofounder and vice chairman of the commission on appeal for human rights [Committee on Appeal for Human Rights] in Atlanta [Georgia], student organization that united the student forces of all the black colleges [historically black colleges and universities] in Atlanta--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for civil rights.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I was a student at, at Atlanta University now known as Clark Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia], and we had organized ourselves in such a way that we had three representatives from the, the various African American colleges and universities, Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], a, Atlanta University, the Interdenominational Theological seminary [Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia], and Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And a fellow named Lonnie King [Lonnie C. King, Jr.] was the chairperson of our organization and he was a student at Morehouse and I was the vice chairperson.  And some of our other members included people such as [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond, [HistoryMaker] Marian Wright Edelman, Reverend Otis Moss [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Otis Moss, Jr.], and a list of very committed and visionary leaders who went on to make a powerful impact.  And we, we were the nucleus--
Speaker 1: Who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) we were the organizers of the student, Atlanta Student Movement during the 1960 Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And well, well tell us what, just kind of summarize what happened (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, we--now that, that that was a, a very significant period in my life.  As a matter of fact it was the defining period of my life because our organization came together to, to plan and strategize the protests, you know, protesting segregated lunch counters in Atlanta where we couldn't even buy a hotdog or a hamburger.  Segregated employment opportunities for people.  Like there was a big department store, Rich's [Rich's Department Store, Atlanta, Georgia], where black people couldn't even try on the clothes that they wanted to buy.  And so just, just basic oppression against black people.  And so we, and our close advisors were people like Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] who had just returned to Atlanta from Montgomery [Alabama] to co-pastor Ebenezer Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia] with his father [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.]; Whitney Young who at the time was the, the dean of the Atlanta University School of Social Work [Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia]; and Dr. Benjamin Mays was, of course, president of, of Morehouse College; and other giants, really people who were visionaries and who, who went on to change America.  And, and Dr. King and Whitney Young in particular were close advisors to our group.  We spent many hours and days and they would listen to us, they would counsel us and provide us in a very, advise us in a very strategic kind of way.  And really Whitney Young, I was in his last class before he left Atlanta University to, to go on and head the National Urban League, and we had formed a very close relation, personal relationship, both as dean of the, my dean, but also an advisor to our organization.  And Whitney Young is the reason why I joined the Urban League movement.  Frankly, as a youngster I didn't know a lot about the Urban League.  I was one of these young, angry black people who wanted to change the world in a day and didn't wanna take a lot of time to do it.  And, you know, I, that that, these organizations that wanted to move along a slower track were not appealing to me as a young person but I believed in Whitney Young and he is the reason why I, I joined the league.  And initially, by the way I met my wife [Harriett Hicks Johnson Mack] while there my, my brother-in-law [Henry Johnson] who was a roommate and classmate at the university introduced me to his sister, his twin sister, my wife.  And we courted, attending Ebenezer Baptist Church.  The, the Cal- the state of California was seeking to diversify its employment at a state level, and they sent some representatives of the personnel department down to Atlanta.  And so I took a test, you know, not really thinking about it because thinking about going to California was like thinking about going to (audiovisual disturbance) (laughter) some far removed place because born and raised in the South, my whole focus had been in the South and on the East Coast but took the test and passed it and was offered a job.  In the meantime, Whitney Young had told me that he was going to be heading the Urban League and invited me to consider joining the league.  But because he had arranged a scholarship for me in the field of social work, I, I felt a, a moral obligation to, to take this job.  Which, so my wife and I, just freshly married, no children, so we thought, well why not?  So I went to work here in Oxnard, California, at, at a place called Camarillo State Hospital [Camarillo State Mental Hospital, Camarillo, California] for three years.  Then there was the 1963 March on Washington.
Story_ID: 622224
Speaker 1: Now, before we get there, I, I just wanna--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --go back a little bit, just make sure we--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, sure.
Speaker 1: So you graduated with a master's degree in, in social work?
Speaker 2: In social work, from--yes, from--
Speaker 1: From--
Speaker 2: --Atlanta University.
Speaker 1: Clark Atlanta [Atlanta University School of Social Work; Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and then I wanted you to try to, this, this is in 1960, and kind of explain what the--a lot of people hear the name Urban League but they don't know the difference between the Urban League and the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What is the difference, what, what strategy or, or, or range of activities does the Urban League do that sets it apart?  What, what is the Urban League (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the, the Urban League's major focus--first of all the Urban League, we have a national organization, we have ninety-seven affiliates located throughout America, mainly in major urban areas.  And the Urban League's focus is on the economic empowerment of African Americans.  One of the things that distinguishes the Urban League from other organizations working in the civil rights arena and the social service arena, we hire professional staffs in each of our local affiliates, people who, who are professionals, who, who are trained, who can provide job counseling and they place people in jobs.  We have a wide range of educational services that are carried out by professionals.  For example, for a number, number of years, you know, we had a, a job training center here [Los Angeles Urban League, Los Angeles, California] and most local Urban Leagues do that.  So I would say that one of the distinguishing things that the Urban League has focused on the economic empowerment of African Americans mainly through job training, job placement, minority businesses, and that array of services.  But by the same token--and this can be largely attributed to the impact of Whitney Young--in addition to providing these range of professional services, the Urban League is also then an advocate on behalf of African Americans whether you're talking about opening doors of opportunity in Corporate America which is one of the, one of the, the outstanding attributes of Whitney Young.  I mean, he, he opened many, many doors dealing with corporate CEOs and high level people.  And the local level, local Urban League leaders do a similar kind of thing.  And so, you know, we, we're, we're both activists on the one hand but we also provide professional services that impact thousands and thousands of African Americans.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this can, the Urban League was founded in--
Speaker 2: In 1910, the National Urban League was founded in 1910.
Story_ID: 622225
Speaker 1: I know Whitney Young was considered during the civil rights days as one of the Big Six.
Speaker 2: Whitney Young, yes, Whitney Young was one of the Big Six along with, you know, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], Roy Wilkins, Jim, James Farmer, [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Height, and--
Speaker 1: A. Philip (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) [HistoryMaker] John Lewis.
Speaker 1: I think, A., A. Philip Randolph.
Speaker 2: And A., and A. Philip Randolph, yes, yes.  The--and, and one of the outstanding attributes of that group was each of these individuals were trailblazers.  While they had their own ideas, their own priorities, they came together, and they worked together.  You know, for example around the, the March on Washington: while A. Philip Randolph was sort of the architect in many ways of the March on Washington and obviously Dr. King, you know, and his historic speech [I Have a Dream] had such a powerful impact but, but these leaders came together working with several presidents of the United States, bringing individual and collective power, and the power to change and make a, a difference.  And Whitney Young, again, was one--a critical player in that that whole operation.  I mean, he, he was, he was like a, a glue who helped keep sometimes maybe fragile relationships from falling apart.  And frankly, he was also a great fundraiser who brought a lot of resources to the table that made a difference both at the March on Washington and, and in many other ways.
Story_ID: 622226
Speaker 1: Now, March on Washington, you were getting ready to tell us about that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was, I was, as I said had accepted this, this job.  My wife [Harriett Hicks Johnson Mack] and I had moved out here to California, lived in Oxnard, California, I was working at Camarillo [Camarillo State Mental Hospital, Camarillo, California], but in the meantime Whitney Young and I kept in touch.  And what I was doing was okay but it was not, it wasn't grabbing me in, in the way that my action, my, my prior involvement in Atlanta [Georgia] had.  I--because I really felt the need as a result of that experience to--
Speaker 1: You probably should pause a second (background noise).
Speaker 2: Sorry about that this is Los Angeles [California] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, nobody can ignore that.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: But okay.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But I couldn't get it out of my heart and soul, because I always felt that as an African American, and one who had been fortunate to receive an education and to be in a position to make a difference on behalf of my people, if I was not prepared to make that commitment, how could I ask someone else to do it.  And that was always lingering.  And, and Whitney Young and I stayed in touch.  In the meantime, he had left the university [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and was now heading the National Urban League.  Nineteen sixty-three [1963] also happened to be the first time that the National Urban League had held its national conference on the West Coast, here in Los Angeles.  And leading up to the conference and then, of course, the March on Washington was gonna be August 23rd, the conference was in July, that really got my juices flowing and so I, I contacted Whitney Young, I, I wrote him a, a note and said, "Whitney I'm ready to join you."  And so when he and his team came out here, we chatted and he put me in touch with one of his--members of his administration.  And I initially joined the Urban League in Flint, Michigan [Urban League of Flint], of all places.  And that was during the time, frankly, when Flint, Michigan, and General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] were thriving.  You know, GM was riding high.  C.S. Mott [Charles Stewart Mott], one of the founders of GM was still walking around.  We were--there were jobs available.  We would fight, of course, to make sure that African Americans got our share of the jobs.  Fair housing was another battle that we fought.  Interestingly enough, just this one brief but significant period for me, during the Flint experience.  I was director of housing, health, and welfare.  Fair housing was a big issue then.  There were lines of demarcations, neighborhoods, and communities that openly discriminated against black people in terms of the housing, even, even people who could afford the housing.  And, and we pushed very hard for fair housing, initially at the local level in Flint but ultimately and interestingly enough the late George Romney [George W. Romney] who was the governor of the State of Michigan, we were able to, to persuade George Romney to provide leadership that resulted in a statewide fair housing law that opened up neighborhoods throughout the state of Michigan to people--all people of color.  At the--during the Flint experience, again, Whitney Young and another leader within the Urban League, [HistoryMaker] Sterling Tucker, who headed the Washington Urban League [Greater Washington Urban League, Washington, D.C.] started a, a new initiative called the New Thrust.  Frankly, when Whitney Young came into the Urban League he really wanted to shake this organization up.  This was the height of the Civil Rights Movement, and he was concerned that maybe the league had not been as aggressive as it ought to be in challenging the white establishment to open up doors of opportunities for, for black people.  So I was brought in to Washington [D.C.] to head up a program called the New Thrust working with Sterling Tucker throughout the, and impacting local Urban Leagues throughout the nation.  And six, spent six months in that position in Washington and then was selected to head the Los Angeles Urban League [Los Angeles, California] in 1969.

Speaker 1: Now, I thought you were gonna tell us a story about the march in, in a way but did you go to the March on Washington?
Speaker 2: No, no, unfortunately I, I was not able to, not able to go 'cause I had just, you know, I had just moved out here, poor young guy, and, frankly, couldn't afford to go to the march.  But I, but I, but I'll tell you that there was another significant highlight in my life in, in making the transition from Atlanta [Georgia] out here.  Back to the, the student, the Atlanta Student Movement: 1960 was also the year that the Democratic convention [1960 Democratic National Convention] that nominated John F. Kennedy [John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was held here in Los Angeles [California].  The leadership of the Democratic Party and specifically the platform committee because of all of the activity, the actions of the student civil rights movement that, frankly, had spread throughout the South and had really awakened this nation in so many ways, so we were--our Atlanta student group was invited to send a representative to, to testify before the platform committee during the convention here in Los Angeles.  Again, our student movement didn't have a whole lot of money, it so happened that I was accepting this new job out here so my colleagues selected me to testify before the Democratic National Convention to tell our story, all of the battles that we had been fighting, all the issues that we were confronted with and black people are confronted with in, in Atlanta and throughout the South.  And needless to say that was a, a very special privilege for me and, and a high honor.  And also the fact that that was the convention that elected--nominated John F. Kennedy, was, was another high moment in, in my life.  And to see people like Walter Cronkite walking around and David- Chet Huntley and David Brinkley and these media giants as well as the political giants, it was a, a very awesome experience.
Speaker 1: Right.  Hubert Humphrey and Lyndon Johnson [Lyndon Baines Johnson].
Speaker 2: Right, yes, yeah, Hubert Humphrey, Lyndon Johnson.  And, of course, the, you know, the excitement of John F. Kennedy so, it was a, for, for this, this young fellow from, from down home, I mean, this was a heady experience.  But I didn't forget the reason why I was there 'cause one of the things that, one of the lessons I learned from Whitney Young when he said, "No matter where you are, if you're in corporate boardrooms or you deal with the, the powerful, don't forget who you are or why you were there, or from whence you came."  So I was focused on making sure that I told our story as young black people who were fighting for an important cause on behalf of our people.
Speaker 1: Now, now that's important because of, now I know I've been in some situations and seen people who are overwhelmed by the situation and forget their purpose for--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --for being there.  It's a heady experience being in the, with all that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --going on.
Speaker 2: It is heady but you, but you have to, you can't let it overwhelm you.  And that's, that's again, it gets back to my Atlanta experience and I have to attribute so much of that to both Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and to Whitney Young.  I mean, you have to be focused and disciplined and, and not get--let other things get in the way of your, your mission.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and, and then I think that to me that's an important leadership requirement if you're gonna really be a, a leader, you can't be there for yourself, you have to be there for your people.
Story_ID: 622228
Speaker 1: Before we, we get you to Los Angeles [California] as the president of the Los Angeles Urban League, 1968 was your last year in, at Flint, I mean, in, in Flint, and this is the year that Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did, did that cause a--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, yes, that that, yeah, the, the--1968 I was still in Flint, Michigan [at the Urban League of Flint], and, and, and the assassination of Dr. King.  It was just devastating because he, he embodied, you know, the ideals that all of us aspired to, you know, to achieve and, you know, he was our hero.  He was the, he, he was the, the Prince of Peace.  He was--yes, the civil rights leader on behalf of our people, but he was, at this point, an international leader.  And, frankly, at that point, you know, I, I felt that our, our world was, was falling apart.  And needless to say, different people react in different ways.  I remember we--a group of us gathered at the Flint City Hall [Flint, Michigan], you know, to, to, frankly, just, just, just mourn and to, and to just collectively embrace one another and, and try to figure out where we're gonna go from here.  And also, at another level, there were other folk who were mad, angry, and frustrated and, frankly, we in Detroit [Michigan], in Flint, you know, we, we, we had civil disobedience, there were people out in the streets, tearing up things.  And, and I'll always remember myself being out there in the street trying to help keep the peace as best as we could and having people understand that this was not going to solve our problems, understanding the hurt, the pain, the frustration, and the anger that, that so many of our people, especially our young people were feeling but trying to help them recognize that this really would hand the opposition an issue on a silver platter, you know.  This, this would play right into their hands.  And so I spent some nights literally on the streets of Flint, Michigan, along with others, some of our local, you know, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] leadership, some of the local ministers, along with, with the Flint police, really, really trying to, and we were able to work it out so that we had some damage, some looting, but it was not as widespread as it was, you know, in, in some other places like Detroit at that point in time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So I just wanted to mention that before we move on--
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: --to Los Angeles.
Story_ID: 622229
Speaker 1: Now who was the president in Los Angeles [California] before you were?
Speaker 2: The immediate president of the Urban League in Los Angeles was a fellow named Frank Stanley [Frank L. Stanley, Jr.] who had served on the National Urban League board.  And his father [Frank L. Stanley, Sr.] was the publisher of the Louisville, Louisville Defender, one of the black newspapers.  For many years it was an important publication.  Frank was there for a short period of time, things didn't work out to well for him.  Before Frank Stanley, Wesley Brazier who had served for many years, well over twenty years had, had also--was the person who had had the longest standing tenure before my selection by the board of the Los Angeles Urban League [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know at one time we were mentioning Mahlon Puryear [HistoryMaker Mahlon T. Puryear] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now Mahlon, Mahlon Puryear, again, goes back to the Atlanta [Georgia] connection.  He was, Mahlon Puryear was active with the Urban League in Atlanta when I was a student in Atlanta at the university [Atlanta University School of Social Work; Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia] and active in the student protest movement.  And, and Mahlon Puryear also was one of the, one of those senior advisors.  And then he went on to join Whitney Young as a member of his leadership team with the National Urban League.  And for many, many years Mahlon Puryear was a giant on the staff of the National Urban League and had a strong impact upon so many of us younger leaders within the Urban League movement.
Story_ID: 622230
Speaker 1: So, what were some of the issues here in Los Angeles [California]?  I, I imagine they were the same as the rest of the country but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, some of the same issues.  I mean, a few that that that particularly stand out to me.  In Los Angeles, we were fighting for, for, for jobs, trying to get more African Americans, you know, into job opportunities throughout the corporate world as well as the, the public sector.  One of the early battles that I became engaged in along with others was in education.  We, we were fighting to desegregate the Los Angeles school system [Los Angeles Unified School District].  We ran into bitter opposition.  And there was an organization called Bus Stop [Bus Stop, Inc.], people like Bobbi Wein- Weintraub [sic. Bobbi Fiedler] or Roberta Weintraub and several others who were out in the Valley [San Fernando Valley, California] and, I mean, they were just staunch, staunch opponents and--
Speaker 1: Of, of, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Of, of, of school desegregation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and, and of, of busing.  That was during an era when, you know, busing was a big issue, not only here in Los Angeles but frankly throughout America in a number of major cities.  And, of course, Los Angeles is spread out and, and the idea of students having to travel long distances, a lot of people opposed.  But on the other hand, we were concerned because young African American students were receiving a second rate education in the neighborhood schools.  So we were working very hard, putting pressure on the local school board and on the, the various superintendents of school, you know, making appearances before them, protesting.  And, and I was a part of group that formed, an organization called the Black Leadership Coalition on Education.  The, it was comprised of leaders from the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], Urban League, SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference], a number of our leading ministers.  And we would, for a number of years we would meet seven o'clock a.m. at the Los Angeles Urban League [Los Angeles, California] each week, and then we did it on a monthly basis, planning and strategizing to try to change the school system here in Los Angeles.  Unfortunately, we didn't desegregate the school system; it became more segregated as middle class whites, you know, took their children out of the public school system, put them into private schools, so that became a, a pattern, an issue.  But we were able to at least begin then focusing on improving the quality of education for our youth.  And that organization I talked about that we founded, the leadership revolved around myself as president of the Urban League and then the president of the NAACP and the, and the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.  We were the ones who were the, the driving forces with, working along with Diane Watson [HistoryMaker Diane E. Watson], who was the first African American member of our local board of education and some civil rights attorneys.  And Diane Watson went on to become a, a congressman, a congresswoman from Los Angeles.  So that was a big battle.  I'll, I'll, I have to admit that we didn't achieve too many victories, they were very limited and even that's continuing, the quality of education continues to be a challenge.  But another area where I devoted so much of my personal commitment and leadership and time to was LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department].
Story_ID: 622231
Speaker 1: The police department.  Now what, what were some of the issues?
Speaker 2: LAPD on, on the advocacy side this is where I spent more of my time than any place else.  You know, other than running programs, you know, job training, education programs, and that kind of activity.  We still had those programs going but, but the Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Police Department for decades had the, the, you know, the, was recognized as probably the most racist, brutal, police department in America.  And, of course, the late Daryl Gates, he epitomized the worst.  I mean, he wasn't the only one, but he was, he was the one where so many of my battles and, and my colleagues battled him tooth and nail.  We--as I, as I reflect back, we had an incident, a, a woman named Eula Love, a black woman, who owned a, who owed a gas bill for around twenty-five dollars that she had not paid.  And for some weird reason, which doesn't even make sense as you think about it, after the gas company tried to collect the money, and she didn't pay it because she wasn't able to pay it, they said cops went to her home and demanded payment.  She didn't pay it, 'cause she didn't have the money, and they end up shooting and killing the woman.  And, you know, that needless to say, was just the, the, it was a mind boggler.  It made no sense in so, in so many different levels.  I mean, but it was an example of how it was open season on black people.  LAPD operated for several decades like an occupation force in the African American community.  Now, it was user friendly in the white communities so it was hard for white residents of Los Angeles [California] to even begin to understand and appreciate the, the, the fact that this department was just, had no regard for the civil rights of the, or, or, or frankly, the, the basic worth--you talk about respect, there was no respect, and especially among young black men.  Then we had the chokehold incident, where you had twenty-one young African American men who died as a result of the application of the chokehold, and Daryl Gates had the gall to say it was because there was something medically and physically wrong with us that made us more susceptible to dying from the application of the chokehold.  In that instance, the late Johnnie Cochran, who we worked very closely together with, Johnnie Cochran at the time was serving on the Urban League board [Los Angeles Urban League, Los Angeles, California].  There was another African American, Dr. Madison Richardson, a very prominent physician who chaired the board, and we held a press conference at the Urban League.  And Johnnie Cochran attacked LAPD and Gates, you know, from a legal standpoint, Dr. Madison Richardson from a medical standpoint, just dissected and totally, totally destroyed Gates' argument and rationale, and I from a community and civil rights perspective.  And we went on to make demands before the police commission [Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners], the city council [Los Angeles City Council], the mayor at the time Tom Bradley, and we were able to ultimately, ultimately as a result of the pressure cause LAPD's policy to change in terms of how the chokehold was applied.
Story_ID: 622232
Speaker 1: Then, of course, we had the Rodney King incident.
Speaker 2: So this is taking us to the '90s [1990s] this is like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --around '91 [1991].
Speaker 1: And I mean that that that was, you know, the Rodney King incident which probably in so many ways laid the--represented the, the, the foundation of the beginning of the turning point in, both in terms of our mobilizing from a community perspective and also being able to lay the foundation for some systemic change.  The, the King incident was, you know, internationally covered by the news media.  Where Rodney King was just savagely beaten by these three L.A. police officers [Laurence Powell, Timothy Wind and Theodore Briseno] while the, the training officer, the sergeant [Stacey Koon] who was on the scene is supposed to be the training officer just stood around and watched and didn't stop it.  There was a, a reporter who, who was a friend of mine named Larry McCormick, anchor for local television channel, KTLA [KTLA-TV, Los Angles, California].  And Larry--our families were very close friends, our children grew up together, our wives were friends but he was a very ethical person and he never tried to influence me or, or, or--he didn't, he didn't do things that were unethical as a professional news media.  But it was a Sunday evening here at home, and this was the first time this has ever happened, Larry McCormick gave me a call.  It was gonna be the ten o'clock news and he said, he said, "I've never done this before but I'm calling you because I would strongly suggest that you watch the ten o'clock news on KTLA.  There's a story that I'm pretty sure that you and the Urban League [Los Angeles Urban League, Los Angeles, California] would be very interested in."  And Larry McCormick and KTLA news, broke the story, exposed that video, that video that became, you know, that was shown around the world, showing these cops beating Rodney King.  And I might point out that three or four other television stations had refused to air the video, refused to air it; they didn't think it was newsworthy.  But to the credit of Larry and his producers they did air it and that set off a chain of events over a period of a good nine months at least.
Speaker 2: Now, now was, was Larry an African American?
Speaker 1: Yes, Larry was an African American.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: I just wanna make sure we--
Speaker 1: Yes, right, African American.  Highly respected news anchor, one of the most highly respected in Los Angeles [California] and just a, just a, an outstanding human being.  And I joined with others, leaders, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference], people like Danny Bakewell [HistoryMaker Danny Bakewell, Sr.], who at the time was heading the Brotherhood Crusade [Los Angeles, California], you know, Johnnie Cochran, and the list goes on and on, leaders from ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union].  And we just mobilized consistently and, and some of our leading ministers.  And some of us made a pact, a few of us, we said, you know, "This time let's, let's fake 'em out.  They think that you're gonna have a bunch of mad, angry black folk hold a press conference, you know, and, and just get stuff all off our chests and then go back to business as usual.  This time we're not going back to business as usual."  We mounted a consistent mobilization, a campaign where we had a wide range of strategies consistently protesting before the police commission [Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners], demanding that Daryl Gates be fired, put pressure on then Mayor Tom Bradley.  And Bradley appointed Warren Christopher and the Christopher Commission which did this thorough, thorough comprehensive review of the LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department], its policies, its practices, and, and came forth with a number of far reaching recommendations.  One was that no future police chief after Gates would serve more than a maximum of ten years, two five year terms.  Also demanding that Gates be fired, creating the--strengthening the police commission, which I had the privilege of serving on for eight years, by creating office of inspector general that would, that would report directly to the police commission.  And we were able to lay the foundation for tho- a wide range of those changes.
Story_ID: 622233
Speaker 1: Then also we had a few years later the Rampart scandal.
Speaker 2: Now before we go into Rampart, I, I just wanted to make sure that people understand that Tom Bradley, you had a black mayor, a former police officer, right?  And some--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --many, many people would ask around the country and say why didn't he do something about Daryl Gates?  And but--
Speaker 1: Well, well, well there's an important reason why Gates could, Bradley could not unilaterally fire Daryl Gates.  It was a charter issue.  By the way, Daryl Gates and Tom Bradley hated each other.  They, they, they did, they hardly talked.  You know, which, frankly, one could argue that's, the mayor and the police chief, I mean, that was irresponsible on both (laughter) their parts.  But, but they just personally, Tom Bradley had spent twenty-one years on, on LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department].  He left because he had been told that that he would never be--that he would never go further than he had gone as a lieutenant, that's when he left.  He, he went to law school [Southwestern Law School, Los Angeles, California] and he, he, and he ran for political office.  But Gates and Bradley just had personal animosity.  But the, the old charter before the Christopher Commission charter amendments were ultimately approved by the voters, and I would point out that I was privileged to, I was not a member of the, of the Christopher Commission but provided testimony along with a lot of other people, but then there was a, a, an organization called Charter Amendment F.  That was the political entity that was, that came together to convince the voters of Los Angeles [California] to approve these charter minutes and I served on the executive committee along with Warren Christopher and others and we were able to persuade 70 percent of the voters of Los Angeles to implement these charter amendment changes.  One, a very important one being removing the civil service protection that Gates and his predecessors had previously had, which made him untouchable.  He was like a J. Edgar Hoover at the local level, could thumb his nose at everybody, and, and, and the mayor was impotent, frankly, to do anything about it.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But the, the new charter amendments that we were able to get implemented from the Christopher Commission recommendation now set up, up a, a new system.  As I mentioned, no future police chief could serve more than a maximum of ten years, two five year terms.  And empowering the police commission [Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners] to do an evaluation--as a matter of fact we do an annual evaluation--but at the end of the five year period, the police commission does an evaluation of the chief of police performance and then the police commission will decide and recommend to the mayor whether or not the police chief has performed satisfactorily and should be retained or should be fired.  So all of this was the important charter changes, you know, and, and, and answers that question.  Now future mayors, I, I mean, those mayors who followed Tom Bradley, had this kind of, of change authority.  And even when the police chief now--and I was up, during my, my watch on the police commission assignment when I was serving as president of the police commission, one of the, the, the charter now stipulates that candidates for the, for the police commission, the, for the police department, now the police commission interviews the candidates.  We vet the candidates.  And when Bill Bratton [William Bratton] who was the chief when I was initially appointed, and by the way did a phenomenal job of, frankly, turning this department around, whenever he resigned, then the police commission under, under, under my leadership surveyed nationally.  We, we reached out throughout the nation seeking the best candidates.  As it, as it happened we had a couple of outstanding candidates from within the department, but we recommended, we interviewed or considered I should say, at least fifteen or twenty potential candidates.  Then we narrowed it down and the charter stipulates that the police commission recommends the three top candidates to the mayor, and from those candidates the mayor selects the, the police chief.
Story_ID: 622234
Speaker 1: And let me go on to just, just say this, I mean, there--I was about to say we had the Rampart scandal which a combination of the King [Rodney King] incident and the Rampart scandal led to the City of Los Angeles [California] and the police department and the commission [Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners] entering into a consent decree, a federal consent decree because the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice] had threatened to sue LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department] and the, there was a court ordered consent decree that this department was under for close to ten years.  And on my watch, as a member of the police commission and, and, and then our five, it's a five member volunteer group.  We were the ones who successfully provided the oversight responsibility and with the enlightened leadership of former Chief Bill Bratton [William Bratton] and now current Chief Charlie Beck, we were able to successfully comply with the consent decree.  And the relationship today in Los Angeles between LAPD and the African American community, the Latino community, is a much, much better relationship than it was, you know, over the years going back to the Gates [Daryl Gates] era, strong focus on community policing.  I just recently attended an event and, and, frankly, and this is something that's done annually now, in addition to the police doing its normal kind of business and, and, and let's face it, we, we can't be naive, there's a lot of crime, there, there are bad actors out there, some people who need to be in jail, but it's how you police a community and our focus was on policing the African American community with respect and not assuming that every young African American male out there is a gangbanger, you know.  And we think that we've made a lot of progress.  That message has finally gotten through.  And there's increased focus now on the prevention side.  I was, I was just about to say, I just attended an event at USC Galen Center [Los Angeles, California] where USC [University of Southern California] plays basketball.  And there's a program called the cadet program where we had ten thousand people show up, five hundred young people, primarily young Latino and African American males and females, where the police are working with them to help them develop leadership skills and develop positive kinds of values.  We, we now have a program within LAPD where intervention workers, former gang members who now are working with the police, not snitching on people but working to help keep the peace.  And, you know, during the old LAPD era gang members, former gang members and, and cops hated each other, they didn't, you couldn't get 'em in the same room to talk.  And now you have this kind of constructive collaboration that's taking place.  And, you know, and so, these are things that are, frankly, revolutionary and things that that over the years, things that so many of us fought tooth and nail for were just beyond our wildest dreams.  So, you know, that that focus around the whole issue with LAPD and the criminal justice system--
Story_ID: 622235
Speaker 1: I'm not suggesting that's it's a perfect department.  When you have ten thousand people in a police department, who, you know, who come from all kinds of backgrounds, bring all kinds of attitudes, despite the training, despite the policies, you're gonna have some people who are not gone get it.  But that's where the, the leadership of the, the department, the chief, and the strong oversight of the commission [Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners] kicks in.  For example, the commission meets every, every week, every Tuesday.  We have public sessions where we have all kinds of reports and audits and what have you, but then private, go into closed session dealing with officer involved shootings, whenever there's any shooting involving a police officer and a, and a citizen, that's reviewed.  They, the, the chief has to, and, and, and his staff have to present their case, you know.  And, and there's a, there's the, a group that does an independent review.  And then we have our inspector general who, independent of LAPD, also presents an analysis and their recommendation.  And then the commission decides whether the shooting was in policy, out of policy, or the categorical use of force was in policy or out of policy.  So all of these, these kinds of significant changes have made for a--that's one area, you know, there's a lot of doom and gloom out here and there are a lot of places where we've not, where we're not where we need to be like, I mean, frankly, LAUSD [Los Angeles Unified School District] is still a disaster area.  I mean, I'm still very, very unhappy with the, the lack of, of progress that, that is being made in education.  We need to properly educate our young people.  Jobs still a big issue.  But if there's one shining example of positive movement it has been within the Los Angeles Police Department, and I'm, I'm proud to have, you know, played a small role both in my role with the Urban League [Los Angeles Urban League, Los Angeles, California] but also with the police commission.
Story_ID: 622236
Speaker 1: Now, when, when you were police commissioner did you have to step down from your role at the Urban League?
Speaker 2: No.  Actually the way, the timing worked out, frankly, quite well.  I retired--well, let me say this.  First of all, if I had--I could not have personally, I would have not served on the police commission when I was president of the Urban League, because I was an advocate, you know, and it would have just been a conflict of interest.  Not to mention the fact that I wouldn't have had the time to do it.  But as it worked out, I retired as president of the L.A. Urban League [Los Angeles Urban League, Los Angeles, California] in 2005, June of 2005.  Mayor Villa- Antonio Villaraigosa, the immediate past mayor was elected mayor effective July 1, 2005.  The mayor and I had developed a close relationship and he appointed me to the police commission in August of 2005, where I served for eight years.  So it worked out well.  So I, I had, I was no longer president of the Urban League.  So, you know, I was able to assume this position.  And, and, frankly, the mayor when he--it's kind of an interesting experience here and I, I don't wanna sound like I'm ego tripping here but after Mayor Villaraigosa was elected mayor, before he even assumed office, he had a, he put together a team, a transition team, and I was a member of that team.  And various ones of us had different assignments of key city commissions where we were to identify potential leaders of those commissions.  As it so happened, there was another fellow named Stewart Kwoh and myself who were assigned the responsibility for identifying potential leaders for the police commission, final.  And, you know, we were just very busy trying to think of people.  And we were sitting around a table in the mayor's office, there were about twenty of us one day, and one of his people's up on the chalk- chalkboard and I started throwing out names of people who I thought would be great leaders for the police commission given the history and all.  The mayor is sitting at a table and then he got up, he said, "I want you to head the Los Angeles police commission [Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners], because you bring the credibility, you've, you know, this department, your civil rights background, you, you've been a constant critic of this department, and if we're gonna change we need to have that kind of leadership."  I said, "Hey, wait a minute, I gotta think about this.  I, I, I don't mind helping you but I'm not so sure I wanna do this," (laughter).  But as, as it were, as it developed, I did agree, and, and it certainly was an extremely rewarding experience, and, and a unique experience because having on the one hand, having been one of the severe critics of the department for its brutality and for its racist policies, you know, that that provided credibility in certain communities.  Quite frankly, I was not welcomed with opened arms initially by a lot of the cops (laughter), because they felt, hey, this, this guy, you know, he's anti police and he doesn't like us and all of that.  But over the years I had a number of police officers come to me, both at the command staff level as well as patrol officers, and say, "You know, I wasn't sure about you when the mayor first appointed you but I found you to be a fair person, and you, you just wanna do the right thing, you want cops to do the right thing, and when we do, you'll support us but when we don't, we're gonna be held accountable."  And I said, "That's all I've ever wanted," you know.  Some of them were basing their impressions and their opinions upon a snippet maybe, you know, they may have seen me on television blasting LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department] or there may have been a quote in the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times] or the Sentinel [Los Angeles Sentinel] or, you know, (laughter) where I was taking on the department.  And, and, of course, internally during the Gates [Daryl Gates] era in particular, he--any one of us who would criticize the department he would turn that around say we were anti police, anti cop, you know.  Not that we were wanting justice for our people (laughter).
Story_ID: 622237
Speaker 1: So this, that experience was, was very rewarding in a lot of ways, most importantly because, frankly, there has been institutional change.  At one time there may have been some individual change, but I think now the institution and its leadership has been reformed and they get it and they understand that, you know, you, that good policing is not necessarily beating somebody over the head, not necessarily--a quote, matter of fact the chief, Chief Beck [Charlie Beck] made recently said, good policing is not just, just about handcuffs.  It's about relationships.  It's about establishing, you know, community, you know, bonds between the department and the community.  And so I think we've come a long way in, in, in that regard.  And as I say that's one of the real positive accomplishments that, that, that I really feel good about.  And it wasn't just me, a whole bunch of people, I mean, collectively, my colleagues from the civil rights community, ministers, community activists, you know, of course, and, and, and people across the board.  At one time, it was more an us against them in terms of the African American community and, and the LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department], but that has changed now, you know, so that a broader group of people sort of came together.  And back to the King [Rodney King] beating and that video, as horrible as the beating was, and as vivid as the video was, it opened up the eyes and the minds of a number of white people who didn't believe us before when we would talk about the brutality that was taking place in our community, but that video exposed it.  And, and a lot of people had to step back and say, "Hey, maybe these, it wasn't just about these black folk wanting to get on television or wanting to get our names in the newspaper or, or wanting some cause to justify their existence, I mean, there was a real injustice taking place here."
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And that helped in terms of changing public opinion.
Speaker 2: It's similar to the Birmingham [Alabama] demonstrations on television for the first time--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --in '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 2: And, and someone pointed out that they expanded the news in '63 [1963] from fifteen minutes to a half an hour and that made the difference in coverage.
Speaker 1: Yes, absolutely, yeah.
Speaker 2: For the first time network news went from fifteen minutes to a half hour.
Speaker 1: Right, you're right, from, you're right, I mean, (laughter) fifteen minutes, it wasn't really covering fifteen minutes, yeah.  And no question about it when, when, when people saw those beatings down in Birmingham, you know, Bloody Sunday, you know, that brought it home to a lot of people who were suspicious and who just didn't believe, you know, that this kind of injustice was taking place, and some who didn't wanna believe it, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Story_ID: 622238
Speaker 1: You didn't mention [HistoryMaker] Bernard Parks at all.  Is, and how, how does he fit into this history (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it's kind of interesting because we, we had a, a period when--well, after Gates [Daryl Gates] we had Willie Williams [Willie L. Williams].  Again, this is, this is still on the Bradley [Tom Bradley] watch, he was the first African American police chief here in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: And how, how did that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, and, and Willie Williams came in from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  He was focused on community policing but he was never accepted as an outsider, I mean, you know, there was that mindset.  And among some cops and among others, he was never accepted because he was black.  And unfortunately, Willie Williams and Bernard Parks did not get along personally.  I think a part of it, Parks, Parks wanted the job, you know, he didn't get it, and so there was a lot of friction there.  Now, and, and Williams, again, I talked about the charter change, you know, in terms of the, the, the two, the five year term and then the reappointment.  Willie Williams became the first chief who was subjected to the new charter changes, so that after his five year period he was not renewed by the police commission [Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners] and by the mayor who had succeeded Tom Bradley, Dick Riordan [Richard Riordan].  Riordan then appointed Bernard Parks, you know, as the next chief based upon the recommendation of the police commission.  Bernard Parks had been a career officer with LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department], very smart, very sharp individual.  In the, in the opinion of some of us, Bernard Parks kind of hung on to some of the old LAPD values.  He--now on the positive side, he was very strong on disciplining officers who did things that were wrong.  That's something we all applauded at least from, from our community, we, we thought it good, he was getting rid of some bad cops.  But that also created a lot of problems for him with the police union [Los Angeles Police Protective League].  And also there were some--and, and, and Bernard Parks actually resisted the consent decree, he and former Mayor Riordan fought the consent decree which baffled some of us.  Parks' tenure was, was, was effective in a lot of ways but then he and the next mayor, Jim Hahn [James Hahn] did not see eye to eye.  Hahn, again, this was, again, based upon the new charter arrangement, the police commission, that police commission and Mayor Hahn decided that Parks should not be renewed for a second five year term.  That created a big storm in the community.  A number of us, people like Danny Bakewell [HistoryMaker Danny Bakewell, Sr.], myself, Mark Ridley-Thomas, who, who at the time was SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] but now who's an elected official, county board of supervisors [Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors], others of us really, really came to Parks' defense.  We really, and, and a number of the ministers like Reverend Cecil Murray [HistoryMaker Reverend Cecil L. "Chip" Murray], Bishop Blake [Charles E. Blake, Sr.], and we fought very hard to get Parks reappointed.
Story_ID: 622239
Speaker 1: So there were huge, huge demands and pressure on our part to really, really--we tried to, to pressure Mayor Hahn [James Hahn], former Mayor Hahn, into reappointing [HistoryMaker] Bernard Parks.  As a matter of fact, several others had had a meeting and, you know, there were some issues that that the mayor had with then Chief Parks and, and we were requested to discuss these issues with Chief Parks if he did and, you know, and we, we indicated to him that these were some, some serious matters like the consent decree and some others that the mayor had a problem with was with then Chief Parks' position regarding the matters, and, and we basically indicated to him that if he wanted to continue to be chief that, you know, these were some issues that, that he was gonna need to address.  And so, after a couple of meetings with, with the chief, you know, he finally reluctantly said okay.  In the meantime, we were to have these discussions with, with the, the chief then go back, meet with the mayor, share with him the results of our conversations and then a decision would be made.  It's interesting and that was another example of how the political game gets played.  First of all, after we had our meetings, we had a difficult time getting the mayor's attention to have that follow up meeting.  We--he attended--there was a Super Bowl [Super Bowl XXXVI] down in New Orleans [Louisiana], we, we got a call that the mayor is gonna be returning from New Orleans that Monday after the Super Bowl and would be, you know, prepared to meet with us.  A group of us, there were about twenty of us, you know, across the board, key political leaders, people like Yvonne Burke [HistoryMaker Yvonne Brathwaite Burke], [HistoryMaker] Maxine Waters, you know, Danny Bakewell [HistoryMaker Danny Bakewell, Sr.], and Reverend Cecil Murray [HistoryMaker Reverend Cecil L. "Chip" Murray] and the list goes on.  We, we met over in Earvin Magic Johnson's office.  We thought he was gonna come to hear us out.  He came in and informed us that he was gonna hold a press conference the next day to announce that he was not gonna renew Bernie Parks as mayor [sic.], which stunned us.  We said, "But this, this was not our understanding with you Mr. Mayor.  This was not the agreement we thought we had with you."  "I made up my mind, I'm sorry, I'm gonna do it."  You know, like I say just really blew us away.  So based upon that act by Jim Hahn, we went to work, a group of us had a subsequent meeting, I'll always remember over at Bishop Charles Blake's [Charles E. Blake, Sr.] office, and he said, "All right, we got mad, let's get even."  We mobilized and helped play the key role in taking Jim Hahn out as mayor in his reelection.  Initially, he was a sound, he was resoundingly elected with a whooping majority because there was so much goodwill.  His father [Kenneth Hahn] who was a long time member of the L.A. County Board of Supervisors [Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors], widely admired and highly respected in our community, even though he was white, he really, really was, you know, clued into our issues.  He was the man responsible for the Martin Luther King Hospital [Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Hospital, Willowbrook, California] and just a whole lot of other very important things in the community.  So a lot of folk voted for him the first time because of his daddy and not really because of him.  But the second time around--and by the way and Villaraigosa, Antonio Villaraigosa was his opponent.  And we flipped it, 'cause the first time he, he swamped Villaraigosa and our community, played a key role in electing him.  We flipped that around so that the next time around, Villaraigosa won a majority of the vote in our community by over 70 percent, as well as, you know, doing, running well in the, in the Valley [San Fernando Valley, California] and the Latino community and what have you.  So that--and, and, and frankly that whole experience, you know, Bernard Parks went on to be elected to the city council [Los Angeles City Council], he became a very influential member of the city council.  But he, I, I, I think he never quite got over, you know, the, the fact that he was removed as chief by Hahn.  One thing that certainly bothered some of us who really fought so hard in his defense, he, he, he seemingly--because some of us decided that we were not gonna hold his successor Bill Bratton [William Bratton], who came in as a change agent responsible for his, his removal, it was really Hahn.  But that kind of created some, some tension that, that, you know, really ended up with relationships stopped being, with some of us, and, and Chief Parks, or former Chief Parks so as good as it might be after it had been a very close relationship over the years.
Story_ID: 622240
Speaker 1: Rampart, the Rampart scandal, (clears throat) you know, just in terms of sequence, remember this, there was the King beating, then a few years later the Rampart scandal where this was a case where some cops in the Rampart Division of the LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department] were just bad actors.  I mean, they were planting drugs on, on, on people.  I mean, they were, they were--it was an example where they were fighting gang members and you had some bad actors, but they crossed the line.  They started violating the law and doing stuff that was just as wrong as, you know, the gang members.  And ended up with a couple of 'em, Rafael Perez, the former police officer going to prison, being indicted.  And that coupled with the King beating really laid the groundwork for the consent decree, that federal consent decree that I talked about that the LAPD and the, and the city, and the police commission entered into.  But it just exposed some ugliness, just corruption at its worst.  And unfortunately, this was also on [HistoryMaker] Bernard Parks' watch, I mean he was chief when this took place which obviously didn't, didn't help his, his case, you know, in the minds, I'm sure, of some people.  You know--
Speaker 2: Some were suggesting that he was too close to the officers involved, I mean, involved were too close to the culture (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes and yeah, and to, and I mean, there, there was kind of a, there was a resistance to really a full scale, pulling the covers away, you know, and really conducting a kind of strong, strong internal review.  By contrast, when, when, when Bratton [William Bratton] was chief and we had the May Day, this big incident in MacArthur Park [Los Angeles, California] when some cops went out there, you know, operating, doing some, some, some wrong stuff, jacking people around, beating up on 'em, there were some cops who were held accountable and, and, the chief didn't take the position that his guys were all right and, and, and the people, the demonstrators, these immigrants and Latinos who were, you know, demonstrating for immigrant rights and what have you, that they were all wrong.  And then going back to the Gates [Daryl Gates] and the, and the King incident when, you know, when, when those cops beat Rodney King, Darryl Gates called a press conference trying to defend the indefensible, you know, trying to--Rodney King, trying to make Rodney King the issue.  And we didn't claim that Rodney King was a choir boy, you know, but the reality--what--it didn't matter that he may have had some, some problems in, in his history in his past. The fact of the matter was that he didn't deserve that beating.  And in a similar fashion, those Rampart cops themselves had violated the law and crossed the line and should, should have been held accountable and that was one of the other points that put the nail in the ground in terms of the consent decree and made for ultimate change and success.
Story_ID: 622241
Speaker 1: So you basically described like two different strands in your career, one where it's still a, kind of a quagmire, I mean, the whole busing and the integration of schools and the condition of schools, we're still slugging that out.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: But at the other one where you think you actually made some substantive (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --change, really--
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: --as, as, as being commissioner of police [for the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, and that, that's one of the things that's been so rewarding.  But also going back to my early years, born and raised in the South and having that experience in Atlanta [Georgia], I mean, I know change is not easy and you, you can't be--you can't throw in the towel just because you don't win every victory.  One of the things, points that I have constantly made over the years in, in my speeches whether it's internally to my employees or to volunteers or to the general public, we need some, some marathon runners for justice, some marathon runners for equality, and marathon runners for excellence.  And, you know, the marathon runner knows that the, the one mile run won't get it; the five mile run won't get it.  The, the marathon runner has a plan; the marathon runner is persistent, is disciplined, is gonna, gonna know that you, you need to keep running, the five miles, the ten miles, 'til you cross that finish line.  And that was one of the things that, I guess, I came to appreciate.  Yes, when I was younger, when I was a young student, we wanted to change the world in a day but over a period of time you understand that that's not necessarily, necessarily gonna happen, but you can't give up.  You can't quit.  You're gonna win some battles; you go back to the drawing board, come with a new set of strategies.  I mean, I mean, you're gonna lose some battles and you go back to the drawing board and come up with a different set of strategies, and then you're gonna win some.  But that's, that, that's been, I mean, I think that's a lesson that any of us in a leadership position has to understand and we have to most importantly keep our eyes on the prize.
Story_ID: 622242
Speaker 1: So are you still associated with the Urban League then?
Speaker 2: Yes, I am.  As a matter, of fact I serve on the National Urban League board of trustees under the leadership of Marc Morial [HistoryMaker Marc H. Morial].  And, and locally while I have no official relationship the, the new CEO, a fellow named Nolan Rollins [Nolan V. Rollins], I mean, he and I, you know, really very closely and communicate and I've tried to be helpful to him.  He--very dynamic young leader, committed to creating a level playing field on behalf of our people and committed to the Urban League.  He did a phenomenal job when he was--he came here from New Orleans [Louisiana], was, was appointed shortly after to head the Urban League in New Orleans [sic.] after, shortly after Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] and just totally turned things around there.  So we work very, we communicate very closely together and I'm trying to be supportive.  But yes, I'm, as the saying goes within the organization, "Once an Urban Leaguer always an Urban Leaguer."  I'm--my--it's been such a rewarding experience in so many ways.  And I'm, I'm eternally grateful to have this opportunity to maybe make an impact and make a difference.  You know, we, I haven't, I haven't talked about some of the programs that we were able to operate here in Los Angeles [California] that frankly were very significant.  Shortly after the civil unrest after, after the King [Rodney King] beating, the L.A. Urban League [Los Angeles Urban League, Los Angeles, California] and Toyota [Toyota Motor North America, Inc.] entered into a major partnership in which we established an automotive training center in the Crenshaw [Los Angeles, California] community where we trained and placed several thousand previously unemployed residents of South L.A. [South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  And, and it was a situation, it has automotive trai- automotive mechanics and we placed them both with Toyota as well as other automotive repair shops and, and that was just such a meaningful and significant program.  We had our Milken youth training and literacy center [Milken Family Literacy and Youth Training Center, Los Angeles, California] where we had young people coming in after school--elementary, middle, and high school level--and we would put, have tutors who would help them improve their reading by one grade level in a three month period of time, their math by two grade levels in a similar period of time, providing them with positive role models.  And that was a program that, you know, really, really, meant a, meant a lot and had a, a powerful impact in turning the lives of some, some people around.
Story_ID: 622243
Speaker 1: And something else that is very special to me, there was an event that we established, the Whitney Young Dinner [Whitney M. Young, Jr. Awards Dinner], one of the early events.  You know, Whitney Young tragically died in 1971 in Lagos, Nigeria while swimming.  And that was, needless to say, a very devastating experience, certainly for the organization but also for me personally given our history, you know, going back to the Atlanta [Georgia] experience and then subsequently with the Urban League.  But a couple of years later, 1973, we established the Whitney Young Dinner here in Los Angeles [California], because I thought it was important for people to, to keep Whitney Young's name alive.  As we discussed earlier, yes, he was a member of the Big Six.  In a lot of ways I, I really felt that Whitney maybe-and I had no, certainly I'm a deep, deep believer in Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and others but in some respects that Whitney was kind of overshadowed, and I thought that it was important for us to make sure that generations to come would get to know something about Whitney Young and his role in the whole civil rights struggle and as leader of the Urban League [National Urban League].  And at the same time using that event as a major fundraiser to support the various programs of the organization that I just talked about.  And the first one was so special and significant.  In 1973, the Los Angeles Urban League [Los Angeles, California] held its first Whitney Young Dinner at the Beverly Hilton hotel [Beverly Hills, California], twelve thousand people, sold, in the sold out international ballroom.  We were honoring the legendary basketball coach John Wooden who was much more than a coach.  He was a teacher, and one who had such a powerful influence on so many of, of our African American athletes who played for him, teaching them life lessons, how to really become men in, in, in the whole sense of the word, word.  But it just so happened, and this is a case where sometimes it's good to be good, and good to be lucky in terms of timing.  Tom Bradley, in his second run for mayor, was elected mayor the Tuesday of that week.  The Urban League's Whitney Young Dinner was held on Thursday of that week.  Our event was the first major public event where Tom Bradley appeared as the newly elected mayor of the City of Los Angeles.  The electricity, the hope, the excitement in that room was just so powerful and that was just such a historical, historical moment in the history of the L.A. Urban League and the City of Los Angeles, and I'm just so proud to have been a, a part of that very, very special.  So, as I reflect upon my thirty-seven years here, yes, we, we may have had some, some things we wanted get done and we didn't, but I'm extremely proud and honored and fortunate and privileged to have, to have shared some of those watershed moments in the history of this organization in this city.
Story_ID: 622244
Speaker 1: Now, let me just ask you for some reflections on Whitney Young and then, and, and then on Tom Bradley too.  Whitney Young was from what I understand, now he was from Kentucky, from the Louisville area, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And his father [Whitney Young, Sr.] had been an educator and founded a school?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, that's right.  Whitney Young was from Louisville, Kentucky.  And his father, yes, was the founder and principal of a school for African Americans down in Kentucky [Lincoln Institute, Lincoln Ridge, Kentucky].  And that's where Whitney Young, you know, got his, his values imposed upon him.  Whitney went to the--served in the [U.S.] Army, and that was, and that was during the period of the segregated Army.  And even in that experience Whitney played the role sometimes of mediator in trying to bring people together and trying to address some of the issues that, (cough) excuse me, black soldiers were experiencing.  And that was a strong influence upon him after he left the Army to join the Urban League.  He, he began his career with the Urban League in St. Paul, Minnesota [St. Paul Urban League].  He also was the executive director of the Urban League in Omaha, Nebraska [Omaha Urban League; Urban League of Nebraska].  He was selected, you know, to head the Atlanta University School of Social Work [Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia].  Then from that, that catapulted him to become the National Urban League's president.  Whitney Young was a, a bridge builder.  He, he was what I would call a pragmatic idealist.  He saw the big picture.  He was a great visionary but also he was a, a doer, a person who knew how to bring people together, and, you know, and get things done.  I'll always remember one, one story that he used to tell during some of his speeches, he lived, the National Urban League's headquarters is, is in New York [New York] and the time when he was there it was in Manhattan.  He lived in New Rochelle, New York, and he would take the train in from his home to his office.  And he said sometimes, and, you know, within that period of well there's militancy you had the Black Power movement and then the Civil Rights Movement and sometimes, you know, there was some tensions and that kind of thing, and he said, "You know, when I'm on this train," he said, "I thought about it, I could get off at 125th Street and get on the street corner with the brothers and sisters and cuss out white folk, or I could go on downtown and meet with a corporate CEO and, and convince him that he ought to be hiring some black folk, hiring some of these people; I choose to do the latter.  I mean, there's a role for that at a certain point in time, but also there's a role to get things done."
Story_ID: 622245
Speaker 1: Tom Bradley was what I would describe as the first crossover mayor in the history of this nation.  Now, we had a number of African American mayors of cities where black folk were in, in the majority, you know.  Washington, the Marion Barrys [HistoryMaker Marion Barry] in Washington, D.C., you know, the Carl Stokes and, and, of course, Atlanta [Georgia] where you had, you know, Maynard Jackson, and, and Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] and others.  But when Tom Bradley was elected mayor, African American voters represented 10 percent of the voting population.  That meant that he had to appeal to a broader group of people, not abandoning his community, not recognizing some of the needs.  You know, in his own quiet way, he placed a lot of people in very powerful positions and did some important things.  But, but just not being a single issue politician as unfortunately and tragically we have too much of, in my opinion, in this day and age.  There was, there, there was an experience that I think in so many ways may summarize Tom Bradley's legacy on a lot of different levels.  I'll always remember shortly after Nelson Mandela, after he had been released from prison and was elected president, Franklin Sonn, who was Mandela's first South African ambassador to the United States, shortly after his assuming that role, you know, based, you know, back in, in Washington, Tom Bradley was no longer mayor, but there was a reception hosted at a very nice club, a place, the City Club [Los Angeles, California].  Johnnie Cochran and a lady named Maureen Kindel [Maureen A. Kindel]--Maureen Kindel had been a, a close member of Tom Bradley's inner circle as had Cochran and myself.  Johnnie Cochran and Maureen Kindel hosted this reception for the new ambassador, Franklin Sonn from South Africa.  And there were a group of us, I, I don't know, probably may, maybe, maybe a hundred people; it wasn't a huge, huge group in this club overlooking the city.  Tom Bradley was there.  And during Franklin Sonn's remarks, and, of course, he expressed appreciation to America and to all, so many people, you know, so many levels who had fought apartheid and, you know, who had been supporters of, of the whole struggle there.  By the way, that's another story where I was involved in, I'll get away; I'll make a point.  At one point during his remarks Franklin Sonn looked at Tom Bradley, he said, "Mayor Bradley, I am so honored that you are here."  He said, "You don't know but during the years when we were in prison you were a, a source of inspiration to us.  You helped us keep strong and know that our struggle was right.  And you were a symbol of the kind of progress that was being made here in Los Angeles [California] and here in America and the kind of thing that helped us keep our dream alive and our hope."  I thought that was powerful.  That said, for people who said that Tom Bradley's, you know, election as mayor was insignificant, I mean, to have that kind of influence on a worldwide basis, not to talk about all of the young people, the young black people in Los Angeles and throughout America.  And over the years, there were a number of young African American politicians, a few of them I would hear say directly and hear about who, who also would share similar stories of how Tom, "Mr. Mayor, you were the reason why I ran for mayor or ran for this office because I figured it could be done.  And you did it in such a classy way and in such a positive way that it inspired me."  So, you know, Tom Bradley, in my opinion, will really go down as one of the noble, great elected officials not only in the City of Los Angeles but frankly in the history of this country.
Story_ID: 622246
Speaker 1: One of the questions I thought about and I think we're on the same page on this, is, is the risk that you take when you were, when you served as police commissioner as president of the police commission [Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners].  I mean, as someone advocating for change in a, in a very stolid, set department, you know.  Even though you had the federal government on your side on some level, as in a lot of cases the federal government is not on the ground with you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know.  You know, like a cloud above it but not really on it.  So, so what, what kind of risk did you encounter by doing, doing this job?
Speaker 2: Well, the department, actually there, there are two, two examples I'll give you.  One, goes back to my years with the Urban League [Los Angeles Urban League, Los Angeles, California] when I was, you know, a strong advocate, challenged--severely challenging LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department].  And then, then, of course, when I served as a member of the police commission, as president of the police commission, very different kinds of risks.  I--I'll first talk about the, my years with the Urban League when, when, when a group of us were really, really out there, seriously challenging LAPD, its practices and its policies and its leadership.  People such as Reverend Cecil Murray [HistoryMaker Reverend Cecil L. "Chip" Murray] who was the pastor of the First A.M.E. Church [First African Methodist Episcopal Church, Los Angeles, California], who is really one of the giants among our leaders.  Danny Bakewell [HistoryMaker Danny Bakewell, Sr.] who at the time chaired the Brotherhood Crusade [Los Angeles, California], real active community activist.  Now Danny has gone on to become a very successful entrepreneur including owning the L.A. Sentinel [Los Angeles Sentinel] now.  When we were out there taking on Daryl Gates and the LAPD, around the whole Rodney King beating incident, needless to say we went through this period as I, as I had mentioned before months and months where we were just focused on this issue and on just challenging, you know, the, the brutality and the racism within the department.  And these, that and constantly in the news, almost on a daily basis at certain points in time because this was a, a controversial issue obviously and the King beating had gained such notoriety.  I--there were a couple of inci- interesting experiences.  One, a group of us who had been serving as advisors to--there was a committee that was supposed to be an advisory committee to Daryl Gates, we concluded that it was a waste of time.  And we had this, a meeting and really it was a final meeting with Daryl Gates.  It was at the office of a fellow named Bill Shearer [William Shearer] who at the time owned the, he was African American, owned a radio station in town, KGFJ [KGFJ Radio; KYPA Radio, Los Angeles, California].  And we were meeting there not to go on the air but just to have this final discussion with Gates, and when we told him that we saw no point in continuing to meet with him because it, it was a waste of time.  And a few (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can you just, I, I, I'm, I'm just tempted to ask you like what, you know, after hearing his press conferences on 'Nightline' and so forth, what kind of meetings could those be?  I mean, now what, what were they--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --what were they like?
Speaker 2: Well, well, frankly (laughter) they, they were hot and heavy frequently.  Gates was, Daryl Gates was so arrogant and so pompous, you know, we, we would attempt to raise issues on behalf of our community which he would just basically discount.  You know I mean, it was just not--frankly it was a community advisory board that he set up so he could create the impression that he was concerned about the black community.  You know, it was one of those kind of, one of those kind of deals.  And, I mean, in retrospect, we were being used.  So we finally concluded that we were tired of being used because the discussions were fruitless, going nowhere, and we, so we had this come to Jesus meeting with Gates, and basically told him that, and I was one of the more vocal people in the meeting.

Speaker 1: A week or so later, an LAPD police detective rang the doorbell at my home.  I was still heading the Urban League [Los Angeles Urban League, Los Angeles, California] at the time and I was at my office at work.  My wife answered the door and the officer asked her, "Is this the residence of John Mack [HistoryMaker John W. Mack]?"  She said, "Yes."  And she says, "Yes."  He asked, "Is she in--he in?"  My wife said, "No," she said, you know, this, this was like about nine or ten o'clock in the morning, she said, "He's at work," you know.  "Did he--was he involved in a campaign event in support of Mayor Tom Bradley?"  She said, "You have to talk with him about that."  So she gave him the, you know, my number and all.  So we, so I was contacted and asked, you know, did I attend an event in support of Tom Bradley's run, you know, for mayor, et cetera?  I said, "Yes."  By the way, the event was one that Johnnie Cochran had hosted at his home. It was a fundraiser.  And what they were gone, the, the angle of it, trying to, to, they were gonna try to tie the Urban League, you know, me misusing or using Urban League funds, you know, or, you know, for a political campaign.  But that was one thing I was always careful about and smart enough to know not to be dumb enough to do that.  I had written a check but it was a personal check (laughter) off the checking account of John and Harriett Mack [Harriett Hicks Johnson Mack].  It was not, you know, it was not from the Urban League.  You see where I'm going?  The point was, it was intimidation, an attempt to scare me away or back me down from challenging Daryl Gates and the LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department].  And, you know, I answered the questions in a straightforward way but my colleagues (unclear), you know, they were saying, "Look you, you know, you, you don't have to, we understand it if, if you don't want to continue this fight."  I said, "I'm not gonna be intimidated by anybody and certainly not by Daryl Gates.  This just makes me more determined to, first of all, it reinforces my belief that I'm right," (laughter), "and makes me more determined to challenge the, the, the brutal racist practices of this institution."  So we just went on and that, you know, that, that, that was just another chapter, another blip on the screen.
Story_ID: 622248
Speaker 1: A more serious issue arose though during this volatile period.  I received on another occasion, you know, when we were in this all out confrontation on a, you know, collective basis, I received a call from the special agent in charge of the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] here in Los Angeles [California], a personal call from this special agent to inform me that there were several of us, Reverend Cecil Murray [HistoryMaker Reverend Cecil L. "Chip" Murray], Danny Bakewell [HistoryMaker Danny Bakewell, Sr.], and myself, on a hit list of a group of skinheads, a cell operating out in Southern California.  The FBI had infiltrated this group, so it was based upon their firsthand knowledge from an agent of the FBI.  And their plan was to assassinate each of us because of our involvement and our, our action.  The, they wanna kick it off in the most dramatic fashion by, on Sunday morning at eleven o'clock service at First A.M.E. Church [First African Methodist Episcopal Church, Los Angeles, California], which was pastored at the time by Reverend Cecil Murray, to bomb the place where you would have several thousand people worshipping.  And then, you know, that, you know, their point was to get attention and then they were gonna systematically come with a strategy to get me next and then to get Danny Bakewell.  That's certainly a sobering kind of experience.  But one of the things I learned in life, you can't be intimidated by people.  Again, I, I go back to my years as a, as, as a student activist in Atlanta [Georgia].  When we would conduct our demonstrations, we were on one side of the street, we got the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] on the other side spitting at us, calling us everything, every name but a child of God, and threatening to do the same thing to us, so I've been there, done that, you know.  Yes, you think about your family, you know, a wife [Harriett Hicks Johnson Mack] and three children so, you know, you--yeah, that's, that's the one thing that that, you know, you really think about.  But I made up my mind a long time ago that there were, there are some things in life, especially in this struggle for civil rights and equal justice for my people, there ought a be one or two things that you're prepared to die for.  There are a whole lot of other things that may be gray that you may wanna negotiate and it's not worth it.  But I think if you, if you're really serious about this, and if you possess true principles and commitment, then you're prepared to pay the ultimate commitment.  And I'm sure that--and I'm certainly not trying to put myself on his level--but I'm sure that that's the way Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] felt.  That's the way Whitney Young felt.  That's the way, when you look at all of our leaders, especially from that generation, you know, we were committed to the cause, I mean, deeply committed.  So you--yes, you're human and, of course, during that period of time, I mean, I had, it's kind of interesting, I had this battle going on with LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department], but I had police protection.  And--
Speaker 2: So did squads sit out in front of your house or (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There, you know, there, there had to be patrols, stepped up patrols, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: So, you know, the, that was probably, those two experiences and certainly the one, the skinhead experience was obviously, ultimately the most critical and the most dangerous.  The other, you know, the incident with Gates and the business of trying to jam me up politically, I mean that, you know, I, I had done nothing wrong so, you know, there, there was nothing there.
Speaker 2: Well, that, these are, well threats are threats but, you know, I expected a lot, you know, worse from, you know, from Daryl Gates' police department, I mean, in a way.
Speaker 1: Well, well, the, I was (unclear) say that that's, that's the worst that I had directly then, you, you know, from, from directly from Gates and the LAPD, you know, that, trying to jam me up politically.
Story_ID: 622249
Speaker 1: But the experience was very, very different on the police, my years of police commission [Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners], my eight years there.  The, first of all, (clears throat) I had the opportunity to work with two very enlightened police chiefs, number one Bill Bratton [William Bratton] who was a real, came in a real change agent, you know.  And, (clears throat) excuse me, we shared a similar vision.  He came in understanding that LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department] needed to change.  He was a, he was a part of the independent court appointed monitoring organization that had--that was aware of so many of the issues and problems confronting LAPD.  And his successor, Charlie Beck, you know, became a, he came from inside the LAPD but he's an example of a, of a police officer and a police leader who can change.  Because he, he admits that once upon a time, he had a different view of LAPD and policing than he does today.  And he understands that, you know, if, if they're, if they're gonna be successful, they have to develop partnerships with the community.  You know, Beck for example was a deputy chief out in South Bureau and established very good working relationships with the, you know, residents of the community and activists, what have you, and working closely with those intervention workers and Connie Rice [HistoryMaker Constance Rice], who's a civil rights advocate.  So, you know, that, so the whole tone is, is different.  And, you know, I'd like to think that as I mentioned earlier the, you know, the police officers today, and I'm not suggesting, I don't kid myself when you got ten thousand people, you know, I'm sure there are some of 'em who probably don't think very highly of John Mack [HistoryMaker John W. Mack], who are not, you know, there's not a love affair going on with but I'd like to think the majority of them, you know, have come to the conclusion that I mentioned earlier where, you know, just see me as just being fair and gonna treat them, gonna support them when they deserve to be supported and take 'em on when they need to be held accountable.  And there's something else that's happened too.  To, today's LAPD, there's been 75 percent turnover; 75 percent of the cops today were not on the police force when Daryl Gates was there, so they don't bring the baggage and the history.  So, you know, so, so, that there are a lot of things that that are different, you know, today and were different during my tenure as the police commissioner than those earlier years in my role with the Urban League [Los Angeles Urban League, Los Angeles, California], you know, when you had the, the previous regime, regime particularly the whole Gates era.
Story_ID: 622250
Speaker 1: In the '90s [1990s] before you were police commissioner [on the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners], did the O.J. Simpson verdict, I guess, that was a--
Speaker 2: That was another.
Speaker 1: Was, was that an example of a, of, of a, another drama out of that tension between the black community and the police?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.  Interesting you, you mention that.  Frankly, I was in the middle of that one too.  Yeah, the O.J. Simpson trial, you know, murder trial clearly, the dividing lines along black and white were strong and sharp.  The, you know, that was not (unclear)--I mean while LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department], I mean was involved but that was more just on a broader, across the broad public, you know, where people were drawing, drawing lines.  Most African Americans felt O.J. was innocent.  And, of course, you know, Johnnie Cochran became the bigger than life lawyer.  See I knew Johnnie Cochran before the world knew him (laughter), you know Johnnie--
Speaker 1: What was he like?  What was your personal reflections of Johnnie Cochran?
Speaker 2: Johnnie, Johnnie was just a, he was a great human being, he was a great lawyer.  When, excuse me, when, Johnnie was very personable, easy to get to know but smart.  And in that courtroom he was the best (laughter).  I'll, I'll share a, I'll share a story, it gets back to the O.J. Simpson case [People of the State of California v. Orenthal James Simpson, 1995].  After the, you know, the, the incident occurred and I convened a meeting at the Urban League [Los Angeles Urban League, Los Angeles, California] with then District Attorney Gil Garcetti, who by the way today his son Eric Garcetti is the, is the, the new mayor of the City of Los Angeles [California], and about twenty, twenty or so, you know, key leaders, you know, well and Johnnie Cochran was one of the participants in the meeting, you know, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] and, you know, some of our key ministers and what have you.  And, you know, to discuss with Garcetti--at the time that there were a couple of issues that were out there from a legal perspective.  One was the defense wanted to, I'm sorry not, not the defense but the, there was, there was a push being made by some of Garcetti's people to change the venue from downtown L.A. where there would be a jury that would be much more diversified if, you know, they moved it out to some outer area, you know.  And, and the theory was you move it where you'd have a predominantly white jury rather than a jury where you'd have some, you'd have whites, you'd have some African Americans, and possibly some Latinos.  So that was issue number one.
Story_ID: 622251
Speaker 1: And the meeting was around where we were pushing and urging Garcetti [Gil Garcetti] not to go for the venue change.  And the second, and really from O.J.'s [O.J. Simpson] perspective most importantly, to take the death penalty off the table.  So we had this long meeting and, you know, all of us weighing in, and we, I guess, the meeting must have lasted for about two hours at least.  And after it was over we came down from the conference room upstairs at the Urban League [Los Angeles Urban League, Los Angeles, California] and then held a press conference that Garcetti and myself and several others.  And he, Garcetti, agreed to do both, which unfortunately and, you know, he was not reelected and we think the whole Simpson case was one of the important reasons why and I'm sure that was one contributing element, I'm sure because it just angered and outraged the white majority, you know, residents.  And at that time Johnnie had not become involved in the case [People of the State of California v. Orenthal James Simpson, 1995].  So, I called D.A. Garcetti and said, you know, I just wanna have a follow up breakfast with you, this meeting.  And, you know, it was just a one on one, just the two of us, we had a breakfast at a downtown location.  And at that point in time we're trying to figure out, the, the, the legal strategies and who, who the, the players were gonna be 'cause he had not at that point in time assigned Marcia Clark and--
Speaker 2: Darden, right?
Speaker 1: And, and Chris Darden [Christopher Darden]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Chris Darden.
Speaker 1: --to the case.  And I was just urged him, you know, you need to, you need to make sure you get a couple of your top, top people, you know, on your side.  But then I asked him, "Gil, what, what are your worst fears about this, this case, this whole situation?"  Without hesitation he looked at me, he said, "My worst fear is that Johnnie Cochran will take this case," (laughter).  And, and his worst fear became a reality.  Soon after that Johnnie, Johnnie took the case and, of course, the rest is history.
Story_ID: 622252
Speaker 1: But no, Johnnie was smooth and, of course, he was, he was renowned for, I mean, he, he Johnnie was a sharp brother, I mean, he, he, he would dress to the, you know, he'd wear these, these, (laughter) these expensive suits and, and he was clean, (laughter) clean as a, as a cucumber.  And he drove his Bentley, you know.  So he, he was, he was flashy but Johnnie was good, I mean, he was, I would, I would hold him up with any lawyer.  And my instructions to my, my wife [Harriett Hicks Johnson Mack], my family, were, if I ever get in trouble, the first call you make is to Johnnie Cochran.
Speaker 2: He's the only lawyer I know that that, he's got the, it's the Johnnie Cochran law firm [The Cochran Firm], that, you know, he's not alive, it's still there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, right, yes.  Yeah, they're still, still there.  And but the other thing about Johnnie Cochran that I think it's important to point out, yes, he had that, you know, the, the Simpson case [People of the State of California v. Orenthal James Simpson, 1995] and he had, you know, high profile cases but long before that, Johnnie Cochran took on cases of people who had no money.  There was a young fellow, Ron Settles, a young brother, the football player out in, out near Long Beach [California], you know, and there was a, an incident he died in a jail cell and there was a whole question thing about a chokehold, and what have you, and Johnnie took on that case and, you know, not because he's going to get filthy rich, 'cause he didn't get no money out of that.  And there were other kinds of cases where he represented people, especially dealing with, with, with police and with the criminal justice system.  That was sort of his M.O. [modus operandi].  Yes, he--and I'm proud of the fact that he became very successful and internationally known and, and, and, you know, very, very financially (unclear).  But Johnnie, Johnnie was a brother for heart too.  He, he was there any time any of us needed him or called upon him.
Story_ID: 622253
Speaker 1: When Bill Bratton [William Bratton] who was being considered as chief of police for City of L.A. [Los Angeles, California], he had, Bratton gave me a call, he said several people had strongly suggested that that, you know, we get acquainted and that he come over and talk with me.  So he, he came over to my office at the Urban League [Los Angeles Urban League, Los Angeles, California] and we, he said,, "I just wanna, I, I just wanna find you--your impression of the L.A. Police Department [Los Angeles Police Department], it's history, you know, all of the things that you think is, that the department has done wrong, et cetera.  And the politics of the city and all that."  So we, we talked for two hours and I was candid with him, I said, "Listen," I said, "first of all you got a big mountain to climb, to climb because there are a lot of angry black people behind the way, Bernie Parks [HistoryMaker Bernard Parks] was, was treated by Jim Hahn [James Hahn].  So you got a lot of folks who wanna hold that against you, so understand that coming in."  And, and we talked about a lot of other things.  But also, as a part of my due diligence to check Bratton out, because I wasn't just gonna take it just based upon the fact that he told he, he, he was a good guy.  I called my counterparts who had, who at the time headed the Urban League in New York [New York Urban League] and, you know, got a reading from him and he said, "Yeah, he said this is a guy that you can work with, he's solid in all the ways he should--," but I also called Johnnie Cochran because now at that point Johnnie was bicoastal, he spent a lot of time in New York [New York], he had an office there and he was on Court TV [TruTV] and all that and, and I called him and, and, and Johnnie said, "Look, John [HistoryMaker John W. Mack]," he said, "Bratton is, he's, he's all right, he's, he's somebody who, who will turn that department around and who, who will really work with, with, with you and with, with the community," and what have you.  And, and his, his, you know, his advice as, as well as that from others, I mean, proved to be very true.
Story_ID: 622254
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, I, I just hope that we can reach a point and, and, and I hope this is not to naive given the political climate we're in, that the, we don't have to refight the same old battles over and over again.  You know, I think about the, the recent Supreme Court decision [Shelby County v. Holder, 2013] all around the Voting Rights Act [Voting Rights Act of 1965], you know, gutting important parts or sections of the Voting Rights Act.  You know, we're constantly battling affirmative, affirmative action battles whether it's in education or in jobs.  I mean, and, you know, having a very conservative [U.S.] Supreme Court majority, you know.  Once upon a time, the court was the place that we really looked to for justice.  You know, even when the [U.S.] Congress didn't do the right thing or even some presidents, you know.  But I, so, so, so I'm, I'm hoping that we can--that in spite of that, that we can, once we make a significant advance that it can remain a permanent kind of advance.  And I also hope that, that African Americans, that our leaders of the future will be people who will possess a, a true commitment to change and a, and a, and a true commitment to service, you know, to not be about themselves, not be self promoters, you know, but to really, really see the big picture.  You know, just a little bit of the, you know, the, the, the spirit of the, of the King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] era and the, and the, and the Whitney Young era, you know, that, that kind of commitment.  Our younger people it's--in my opinion, all too often, the we, we have not made the best connection from generation to generation, having them understand the sense of history where we have been, having them understand that nobody makes it on their own, you know, we've all moved forward on the shoulders of somebody else.
Story_ID: 622255
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back at everything you've done to this point in your life, is there anything major that you would do differently if you could go back and change something?
Speaker 2: Probably, maybe I would, institutionally, as I think about the organization [Los Angeles Urban League, Los Angeles, California], I probably would have at a faster stage maybe, make sure that I--that I had a great team by and large over the years but make sure that I would move a little faster on people who were really not with the program.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I--in terms of the big picture, I don't have any real regrets.  I mean, you know, I, I feel very fortunate about what I've been able to accomplish except the one. I talked about the education, I mean, I, I still am extremely troubled by the dysfunctional public education system here in Los Angeles [California] and frankly, from what I understand, throughout America that's really miseducating and failing so many of our young people and potentially condemning them to a, a life of a, a second rate education, and rather than preparing them for the 21st century job market, or preparing them for higher education.  So, I guess, that's, that's, that's the one thing that, that gnaws away at me.
Story_ID: 622256
Speaker 1: Now, likewise if you look back at your life again, at this stage in your life what would you consider at this point to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: I think, one, just a person who led with integrity, and a person who was not, not out to, to, to advance my personal agenda but to advance the, the community's agenda.  And just in terms of, of a specific as, it may come as no surprise, the whole LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department] thing.  I, I really, really am extremely proud of, of what I was able to help get done both during my years as president of the Urban League [Los Angeles Urban League, Los Angeles, California] and also my years as a, a leader of the police commission [Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners].
Story_ID: 622257
Speaker 1: Now, over the years have you been, been able to mentor young people along in, you know, in terms of advocacy and social change roles in, in their careers?
Speaker 2: Yes, in, in, in a sense.  We, we, within the National Urban League structure, there's--we have an organization called the Young Professionals.  And the organization really was established when [HistoryMaker] Hugh Price was our national president, nationally.  But locally we also have Young Professionals.  And the idea was to have young people, thirty-five years or younger, get them involved in the organization, committed as volunteers to public service, and committed to trying to make a difference in the African American community, young people who are themselves being successful but who are willing to reach back and help others and in that regard I, I had a very active group here.  And, and as a matter of fact, the, the young man whom I was referring to Nolan Rollins [Nolan V. Rollins], who is the current president of the Los Angeles Urban League [Los Angeles, California], is one of my mentees.  We, we go back quite a few years and, and I, you know, see him as, as someone who I, I think respects me.  And, and just recently, another one of our young professionals, a fellow named Kevin Hooks [Kevin E. Hooks], who is now the president of the Las Vegas, Nevada Urban League [Las Vegas Urban League] is a young man that I think I've had some influence upon.  So, you know, that, I'm extremely proud of, and, and I felt that was a part of my leadership responsibility over the years.  You know, we had several staff members who went on to either head other Urban League affiliates or to assume other kinds of, you know, roles in, in the community.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you, you think the Urban League has a better sense of intergenerational transmission now than it did, I mean, you were mentored by Whitney Young himself (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, right, yes.  And, and, and I do, I mean, I think that this Young Professionals organization is really--because the idea and even when Whitney, during the Whitney Young era, on our national board well there, there are some, some positions that are available therefore again, young people who are thirty-five or younger because the idea is to bring in fresh blood and new blood and not just have the organization die of old, just have a lot of old folks with old ideas, you know.  But to bring in young people who can bring in fresh perspectives and stimulate.  And, and, and also they can be mentored by and can learn from the older generation.  I, I think that, I really give the Urban League credit in that regard, you know, as being committed to the notion that we need to prepare that next generation.  Have we reached enough young people?  No.  But at least, I, I think we're moving in the right direction.  At least there's, there's a policy commitment and a leadership commitment by the, by our--at the national level now by Marc Morial [HistoryMaker Marc H. Morial], and, and at the local level by other affiliate leaders.
Story_ID: 622258
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us something about your family.  You, you--now you've told us how you met your wife [Harriett Hicks Johnson Mack].  Do you have children?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  We have three children.  A son who is the oldest and two daughters and proud of each of them.  It's to say, and, and each has kind of pursued different paths.  My son is an entrepreneur, he's currently a Denny's franchisee; he owns a, a Denny's restaurant out near the L.A. airport [Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles, California].  And he's also pursuing some other, you know, similar kinds of entrepreneurial opportunities.  He's, he's married to a wonderful young lady and we have three great--named Teresa [Teresa Mack]--and three great grandchildren, (cough) excuse me, two boys and a girl.  And one, one's in high school and one's in middle school or, or two are in middle school.  And our oldest is gonna be looking around pretty soon for college.  Our middle child, our daughter--well, my son by the way is named Anthony Mack.  Our middle child is, is Deborah Mack and she lives back in the D.C. [Washington, D.C.] area.  She works on Capitol Hill.  She works on the House Homeland Security Committee [U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security] for the ranking Democrat, Bennie Thompson.  And our youngest [Andria Mack], after having worked with a nonprofit environmental organization just recently went to work for a, one of the hot new movie leaders, Legendary films [Legendary Entertainment] and headed by a man who is considered one of the rising stars in the, the whole Hollywood business as a personal assistant to him.  So they, they have each carved out different paths in life but they're, they're wonderful young people.  And the thing about it, my wife and I are very fortunate that we've, contrary to, you know, the challenges some of our friends have had to deal with, we, we, we've never had any major, major problems with our, our kids.  And so they're, they're, they're good and have the right value system and I'm extremely proud of them.
Story_ID: 622259
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, I know there's something but I don't--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'll (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Later.  But well the, the last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as, as someone who, who was compassionate and deeply committed to the creation of a level playing field for my people.  And someone who would like to see an America in which, and a Los Angeles [California], in which in this beautiful mosaic of diversity, everybody has, has an equal chance to develop to the fullest of his or her potential.  Nobody guaranteed success in life but everybody guaranteed an equal opportunity to have that success.  And I, I, I just think that I would like to be remembered as someone who worked as a bridge builder across all lines, racial, ethnic, economic, to make our city and our nation a better place for every individual.
