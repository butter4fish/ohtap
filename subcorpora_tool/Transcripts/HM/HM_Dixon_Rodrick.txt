Speaker 1: All right.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we always ask as sort of a warm up--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --and they only require a short answer.  First one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Not really, (laughter) just healthy food.  Yeah, just healthy food, probably more than anything I love fruit.

Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 115548
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna about your mother's side of the family--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and your father's side but separately, and then we'll put 'em together.  So first of all, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Dorothy Jean Black Dixon, D-O-R-O-T-H-Y, Jean, J-E-A-N, Dixon, D-I-X-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Dorothy Jean Black.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh, my mother's date of birth, I have to look that up.  My mother was born September 18 [sic, September 19, 1946], I have to look that up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Her date of birth.  Have to look it up.
Speaker 1: 1930s, I think [sic, 1946].  Is that, that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's in my, my sheet I wrote it down.  That's not, it's not something I'm gonna recall quickly, the date of birth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: My mother was born in Shreveport, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family, and first of all how far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: As far as I know, my mother's side of the family, as I said she was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, just very talented.  Her mother [Gertrude Black] and father [Roy Black] were singers.  All her brothers and sisters were singers for the most part.  And my early years as a child, when I would travel with her and my father back to Shreveport for family gatherings, I remember just Shreveport and the church that she attended in Shreveport, and I just remember them, us eating, attending church, and singing.  And that's what I remember, a lot, a lot of music.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: A lot of music.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was, what did her father do for a living, your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Her, my grandfather, Roy T. Black, was actually a mechanic.  He was a very good mechanic.  He worked on tractor trailers, and, and as far I know he was just excellent, very good craftsman.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your grandmother?
Speaker 2: My grandmother, Gertrude Black, my grandmother was a homemaker.  She had eight children.  My mother was one of the oldest daughters.  And what I remember, my grandmother she died when I was young.  I had to be no more than maybe at best maybe nine, eight years old.  But she loved to dress up, and she loved to have big family gatherings, and she would put, bring out her, her china, her, her beautiful china, and cook big, wonderful dinners and host the family over.  And I just remember those Thanksgivings and Christmas at their home in Queens, New York [New York City, New York].  And that's what I remember about my grandmother.  And she was also, very, very strong, strong in terms of just being a grandmother and loving.  But I just remember her also preparing and dressing up and cooking those big, beautiful dinners and having the family over.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, I just found a note here, was, does 1946 seem like your mother's birthdate?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.  So that's it.  So she was born in '46 [1946]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In Shreveport.  And is there story about the family like moving to Queens?
Speaker 2: About my parents, what I remember is that my grandfather, Roy T.  Black, and J.V. Black married Gertrude Black and Gennie Black the two sisters, the two brothers married the two sisters and they both had eight children a piece.  And my understanding was that my grandfather, Roy T. Black, and my grandmother, Gertrude Black, moved to Queens with their eight children.  And then his brother, J.V. Black and Gennie Black with their children moved to, to Queens with them, and they then had their own separate homes.  That's my understanding moving from Shreveport, Louisiana to New York City.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So do you have a sense of how old your mother was when the move was made?  She was born in '46 [1946] would that be--
Speaker 2: I would have to assume that, and it's just an assumption I don't have the pure facts on this, but maybe the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: '50s [1950s].  Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 115549
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Dorothy Jean Black Dixon] say about growing up?  Did she, did she, does she have any stories about growing up?
Speaker 2: She didn't have any stories about growing up except that as an adult when I performed in Shreveport, Louisiana, about six or seven years ago, she did say some things about a house that I performed in, in Shreveport that, about blacks having to stay upstairs and watch performances while whites had the opportunity of being downstairs, and I actually played that house and that was something she mentioned and I, that caught my ear.
Speaker 1: Now by house you mean a, a theater, right?
Speaker 2: Theater.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, theater, right downtown.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous) yeah.
Speaker 2: And it's right because when we say house as musicians, we're thinking in terms of theaters, not necessarily in terms of homes.  And she mentioned that and that was the first time I ever heard her articulate just a thought about Shreveport in that regard.  But there was something else she said in the last twenty years or so or the last twenty-five years or so that I didn't know when we were growing up that she wanted to be an opera singer.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And I didn't know that while we were growing up.  And my uncle talked about her actually being courted by one of, and I think, one of the historical black colleges wanted to give her a scholarship to sing.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And that is the story I was told by him.  But those are the snippets of conversation that my ears picked up in that process and they stuck with me.  That one, she wanted to be an opera singer; two, she articulated the theater house in Louisiana about the color line; and three, just growing up in Queens, New York and hearing her sing.  And--
Speaker 1: Do you know, which, HCB--
Speaker 2: HBCU?
Speaker 1: Yeah, HBCU courted her?
Speaker 2: I, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Uh.
Speaker 2: At this moment but there certain I could have, you know, certainly find out.  But--
Speaker 1: And there's such a strong tradition in Louisiana with Southern University [Southern University and A&M College in Baton Rouge, Louisiana], you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Xavier [Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans, Louisiana], you know, I don't know, I just.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I don't know which one it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One of them had made overtures about her coming and, and he said it, as Robert Black he said, you know, "Dot," that was her nickname, "your mother could sho nuff sing" and they, they, they talked about how great her voice was.  And, and its, and one of the schools were courting her for a scholarship to come sing and, and she just didn't make that decision.
Story_ID: 115550
Speaker 1: Okay.  But she [Dorothy Jean Black Dixon] did, she finished high school, was able to go on to college?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: My mother finished high school.  She went to Queens College [Queens College, City University of New York, in Flushing, New York].  She got her degree in psychology and she minored in child, early childhood education.  And, you know, she raised all five of us, myself, Andrea Dixon, my sister, Leroy Dixon, Elijah Dixon, and Jeanette Dixon.  And she's a great mother, and she's just a, an, an unbelievable artist with an extraordinary instrument, vocal instrument.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So your mother basically focuses on gospel music, is that true?
Speaker 2: That was what I heard her sing.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: But it's interesting, what I took away from her singing was as, was an extraordinary gift in her sound that transferred over to some operatic sounds, when she would sing gospel music.  They were just, they were there in her vocal signature of her sound.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: And I think partly because of my father [Samuel Edward Dixon] being classically trained and we did hymns and anthems in church so that operatic sound would come out when she would sing those soprano solo parts.  So I heard gospel music but, but my church, liturgical setting of our church music for the service itself was very eclectic, and so her voice was able to crossover, interestingly enough, that's interesting, I hadn't thought about, crossover within a church service because of all the different kinds of sacred music from long metered hymns, gospel music, hymns, anthems, and also other tangents of the gospel music tradition.  And her voice was able to work in all those different tangents.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your mother play any classical music at home (unclear)?
Speaker 2: My father and her, I just remember one time I was a little child and there was a big upright piano and he came home and there were some musicians who came over and they played some jazz, I remember hearing that.  But I grew up with classical music in the home between two of them because that's all my father would listen to in the car--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --was classical music.  And then at home I would let, listen to the [George Frideric] Handel's "Messiah" with him, I remember hearing that and him playing oratorios or cantatas, and every once in a blue moon he would play C.L. Franklin and have Aretha Franklin also singing on the, so between the two of them, that's what I was exposed to.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was really, you know, trying to find out what she was focused on or what her favorites might be since she wanted to be an opera singer at one, one time.  And it seems that this kind of surprised you that she did, I mean or, or did it?  I mean--
Speaker 2: It surprised me because I didn't find out until my late twenties that she wanted to be one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I guess, and not to speak for her, but this is just my observation, I guess when you're first lady of a church and you have five children to tend to, and, and you have all those responsibilities, singing opera in terms of a conversation didn't come out of her mouth but somehow it transferred to me because that's what I ended up doing.  It, it, I still picked up because I ended up doing it.  I don't know how it had happened like that but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 115551
Speaker 1: All right.  So, well, let me, go to your father, then we'll put 'em together, so.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Samuel Dixon, S-A-M-U-E-L, Dixon, D-I-X-O-N.
Speaker 1: Is there a middle name at all?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't hear my father use his middle name at all, not at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is his date of birth?
Speaker 2: He would, his middle name would be Edward, now that I think about it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place, place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh, I have to look that up to (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, let me, let me tell you.  Let me give you a--
Speaker 2: Give it to me.
Speaker 1: And see, see if you think this is right.  We, we have it here July 7th, '38 [1938]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  All right.  (Unclear) all right.  7/7/'38.  And he was born in Florida but I--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, born in Florida from what I remember.
Speaker 1: Do, do you know where in Florida?
Speaker 2: I don't have the place, I heard it once.  It's interesting enough, I heard it once but I just don't remember the name of the place.  He talked about the sand being a certain kind of sand.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: But I don't remember (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: So it was near the, the, the water?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He talked about this special kind of sand that's in Florida, just that's unique and I can't remember the name of the place but he did mention to me where he was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just can't pull it right now.
Speaker 1: So, was your father raised in Florida or did he, was he raised elsewhere?
Speaker 2: He was raised in New Jersey, from what I understand.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Raised in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Now the same question here, how far back, I mean, can you trace your father's side?  Can you go all the way back to Emancipation or can you do anything like that on his side?
Speaker 2: Quite, yeah, recently we discovered, my father was telling me this story that Brsteol Blue [cannot verify] came over on the slave ship, apparently had to be the 18th Century, late 18th Century, and he landed, I think something about the Suwannee River, landed there and he, that's all they know and from him we have a chart of how the family began, starting from him--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as a slave.
Speaker 1: From Brsteol Blue--
Speaker 2: Brsteol Blue in--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the late 18th Century (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Is that, is that B-R-S-T-E-O-L?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Brsteol Blue.
Speaker 1: The Suwannee River now, that's in, is that Georgia or South Carolina?
Speaker 2: Through Florida, through Georgia.
Speaker 1: Georgia, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right in that area here and that's the story.  And recently I found out from my brother, Sam Dixon, that they discovered Brsteol Blue's papers from the Civil War, his discharge papers.  So he, he apparently fought for the South and was discharged after the Civil War.
Speaker 1: Well, that--there's is a problem there, there were no, black soldiers actually enrolled officially in the Southern--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of the Confederacy.  So if he had discharge papers they're probably from the Union Army?
Speaker 2: Well, probably, so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, okay.  I, I stand corrected.
Speaker 1: Even though he might have been a Southerner because of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --conscripted.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: Black folks fought on the side of the Union (unclear)
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.  But this is current information I just found out just recently so I don't have the specifics but my understanding that they came across paperwork of him in the Army during the Civil War and they found his name and so they're trying to track that information down now, and I found this out from my brother within the last couple of weeks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Thank you for that correction.
Speaker 1: Right.  That's, that's interesting though.  So, I mean, to have the name of an ancestor that came over--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --from Africa to the United States and actually fought in the Civil War, that's something a lot of people don't have, so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that's my understanding.  And as far as the Dixon name is concerned, I understand that it's a Scottish name but in terms of, of how we acquired that name, I'm not sure but I do know that my father's father, Henderson Dixon's, grandfather, his mother was in Orange County, Virginia on the Smith Plantation, and she had a child but she had to keep her maiden name, Dixon, but it should have been Smith.  And so that's how, from her, Alzina, which is my grandmother on my father's side, not my grandmother on my father not, but Alzina is a descendant from Brsteol Blue.  And how that, you know, that worked out but that's a, it's a, it's just all rather fresh to me 'cause they're trying to explain it and I'm trying to figure it out but that's my understanding about the Dixon name and then connected to the Smith name but in Orange County, Virginia with the Smith Plantation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well that's good 'cause people in your family will be able to follow up on it, if they--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --they listen to this.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Orange County, Virginia.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 115552
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so your father [Samuel Edward Dixon] though was born in--is there a story about how the family wound up in, I mean, how he was born in Florida?
Speaker 2: Well, my understanding he was raised by his aunt and his mother [Alzina Williams] was involved, that's all I know.  And I just remember New-- going, taking trips to New Jersey to visit his family and that's all I know at this point.  I have a couple of trips in my memory of visiting them and I don't have too much (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: In, in New Jersey, though; right?
Speaker 2: In New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So dad was born in Florida, at some point in childhood he's, he moved to New Jersey with his aunt?
Speaker 2: Correct, I mean, I would say, I don't know whether it was with his aunt or not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I just know he ended up primarily with his mother and aunt in the same picture together in New Jersey raising him and his brothers and sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now did your, your father have any stories about growing up?
Speaker 2: No, I kind of came across his life in ways.  I, I do remember that he used to train as a boxer.  I remember him talking about working as an, a mechanic on airplanes.  He also was a police officer.
Speaker 1: In, in, in what jurisdiction now?
Speaker 2: I think the jurisdiction, looks to me like from a photograph that it had to be New Jersey.
Speaker 1: So where, where, where in New Jersey did, would it be?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.  I don't remember at the moment.  It probably--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --will come back to me.
Speaker 1: Well, well so was he raised in, so do you know the town he was raised in in New Jersey?
Speaker 2: That's what I'm trying to remember at the moment.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, he, he was a police officer in that same town?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: I've seen the pictures of him as a police officer with his uniform on and, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, he certainly seems like he had a lot of adventures to talk about, being a boxer--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --airline, airplane mechanic, and a policeman.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Those are three--
Speaker 2: And the service and all of that, yeah.
Speaker 1: And as what we, I mean he was a classical trained musician too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He went to college and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --he went to, he got his Bachelors of Arts, his Masters in Religious Studies and he has credits towards his Ph.D.  I know he attended the New York Theological Seminary [New York City, New York].  And he played for churches as an organist.  And so as far I could remember, you know, he was always writing his sermons out for Sunday morning services and playing for choir rehearsals and I would imitate him and go to the piano and play and try to do what he did on the piano.  And, and big discussions at home about world economy, politics, sociology, psychology.  A lot of discussions about theology.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Our home was full of discussions, full of books.  And he was also a piano tuner (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 115553
Speaker 1: Now this is a, let me try to, I don't know how we can, I just wanna kind of construct chronologically what he [Samuel Edward Dixon] did first, second, third--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: --until he, 'cause this is a very talented man we're talking about.  And I even have a note here that he, he played baseball and had a chance to become a pro baseball player.
Speaker 2: That would be me (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's you?  Oh, okay. That's you instead, okay.
Speaker 2: That would be I (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Oh, that's you, okay.
Speaker 2: That's, that's me--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was the guy who loved the--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --leather--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --and the hard ball.  Oh, yeah that'd be me, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so now he's born just before the beginning of World War II [1938] so he's not--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in that but he, he comes along and so did he go to college right out, after high school or did he--
Speaker 2: I don't have that particular information about how he managed to go to school, all I know is when I came along he was attending school.  And apparently he must have gotten his degrees much earlier on.  I know he had a stint in Washington, D.C.  He was married once before and had two children which are my older brothers and sisters.  And somewhere between New Jersey and D.C. he managed to get his degrees.  And then my mother [Dorothy Jean Black Dixon] and him were together after he divorced from his first wife.  And all I ever knew was books, piano tunings, classical music in the car, church every Sunday, and between the two of them they managed to stay in school and get their degrees and pastor and, and raise a family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do, do you know where he went college initially to get his bachelor's?
Speaker 2: I don't know exactly where he went, York College [York College, City University of New York, in Jamaica, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  York College in Queens, New York.  That's coming back to me now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  York College in Queens.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I remember he had, he was over the gospel chorus there and he was at York College.
Speaker 1: And you said he--
Speaker 2: I think he may gotten his B.A.--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --may have been from York.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what about his master's degree?  Do you know--
Speaker 2: Master's Degree Religious Studies might have been from, it could have been York or New York Theological Seminary.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sounds like--
Speaker 2: I think it's the let, Theological Seminary.  Then he's, put his credits towards his Ph.D.  I think that's kind of (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Okay.  That makes sense.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It makes sense.
Speaker 1: That's makes sense, may not be exactly right but it makes sense, so.  And what denomination was he ordained under?
Speaker 2: My understanding, I think Baptist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All right.  So, so he's a Baptist minister?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Did he pastor his own church?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He's been pastoring since 1971.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: First Freedom Baptist Church in Queens, New York.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He started the church right in South Ozone Park, at Ms. Porter's [ph.] house.  I remember that now, in the front part of the house there you go, yeah, Ms. Porter.  It's been a long time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 115554
Speaker 1: So now is there a story that's told about how your parents [Dorothy Jean Black Dixon and Samuel Edward Dixon] met?
Speaker 2: No, I just remember a photograph of the wedding and she putting cake in his mouth and what, how they were dressed it was a photograph of the wedding.  And they were married in Queens [New York City, New York].  And, and appears to me they were married in someone's home.  And that's all I remember at the moment, yeah--
Story_ID: 115555
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, off-camera we were saying that you think, think it was Union Church in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Queens [New York City, New York] where they [Dixon's parents, Dorothy Jean Black Dixon and Samuel Edward Dixon] met, right?
Speaker 2: In Queens.  It was certainly in the church because I remember my mother was in the choir and he was the organist of the, of, of the church.  And so they apparently met there and then apparently I was born and that's where I attended church as a, my sister [Andrea Dixon] and I attended church, we were born a year from each other, so it was myself, Ann, and Leroy [Dixon].  And I remember us running up and down the church basement for, so I, it was at that church.  And I, I think it's, certainly a church in Queens, I can't remember whether the name is correct or not but I wanna say Union [ph.] but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 115556
Speaker 1: All right.  So, now when you think about your parents [Dorothy Jean Black Dixon and Samuel Edward Dixon], and it's, it's almost obvious that when you think about their talents and gifts and, and, you know, that, that you take after both of them in a lot of ways but--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --but when you think about all the, all the traits they have, their attitudes, their habits, how they walk, talk, looked, who, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I would say that I think I'm even on both sides of the ship there.  When it comes to being observant and watching how things transpire with other people, they both have great ability to do that.  As far as my gifts in terms of music, I think it's 50/50 because I can explain it in musical terms.  I, I have the core sound of my mother vocally, the power and height of her voice in terms of how high I can sing, and I also have the color from her voice but I also have the height of my father's voice too.  And he's at the, he's a high tenor, and the musicality of the two, of both of them in that regard.  Personality wise, I'm probably more like my father when it comes to being athletic because of his athletic backdrop, but at times I can be very, I can be full of energy and passionate about what it is that I'm interested in but at the same time I can be very reserved like my mother and be extremely quiet in a lot of ways.  So there's not really one dominant figure or the other over me in terms of my makeup but I will say parts of them come out of me depending on the circumstances that I find myself in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now one thing they both have in common is the love of singing apparently?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Just--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And that's something I must have heard in her womb between the two of them at church and just the music, the love of music.
Story_ID: 115557
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you list your siblings for us beginning with the oldest and, you know, place yourself in the, in the order and name them?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother, Dorothy [Jean] Dixon, had myself, Rodrick Dixon, Andrea Dixon, Leroy Dixon, Elijah Dixon, and Jeanette Dixon.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are your siblings musically inclined as well?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My sister can sing as well.  My brother, Leroy, Andrea Dixon can sing.  Leroy can carry a tune (laughter).  Elijah is a great songster, he's a great artist in his own right.  He actually went to Mannes College of Music [now The Mannes School of Music at The New School, New York City, New York] for jazz.  And my little sister, Jeanette [Dixon], has an extraordinary voice as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So one can carry a tune and the rest of 'em are really--
Speaker 2: Pretty good singers.
Speaker 1: --gifted.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my brother could probably carry more than, Leroy can carry more than just a tune, he just, it's not his thing, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He'll sing in the church choir but it's not his real thing.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 115558
Speaker 1: All right.  Now so, now did you, so you grew up in Queens [New York City, New York]--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: --and did, did you grow up in the same household, house the whole time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And is there a name for the neighborhood that you grew up in?
Speaker 2: South Ozone Park, Queens, New York.
Speaker 1: What was that, slow down now, what was that?
Speaker 2: South Ozone Park--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --Queens, New York.
Speaker 1: South Ozone--
Speaker 2: Between the Van Wyck Expressway and Aqueduct Racetrack on Rockaway Boulevard, right in that pocket, right there.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: And what, what kind of house did you live in?  And was it a big house or a little house or?
Speaker 2: It was a medium size house.  It was an attached house.  It was a row of brick houses that were, they're all attached.  And two bedrooms upstairs, bathroom, and a basement, of course, dining and living room and the kitchen.  A standard medium-size house.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what were the demographics of South Ozone Park then, when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Predominantly white--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --at that time when we first moved there.  Predominantly white.  I don't know the cultural group that was there in that area but I remember the five and dime store, Woolworth's.  I remember the butcher, the barbershop on Rockaway Boulevard, you know, those kinds of small businesses.
Story_ID: 115559
Speaker 1: Okay.  We always ask this question.  Now, what were some of the sights, and sounds, and the smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, clearly it would be grass because I played so much baseball.  The, the smell of grass in the spring, when I knew it was time to go to practice at Baisley Park [Baisley Pond Park], Queens, New York which was about three miles from our home.  And the other smell would be, you know, flowers because that meant I get to play baseball.  And then, of course, sights would be church, Sunday mornings, you know, sun coming out, everybody's getting ready to go to church.  And that's the other thing, just church, getting ready to go to church, Saturday rehearsals, Friday night, I mean Wednesday prayer service, being at the church, the sounds that go along with that.  And then snippets of classical music from my father's [Samuel Edward Dixon] car to and fro, whether I go to school during the week or on our way to church or some kind of event, just snippets of that.  And then, you know, television, my friends, what kids do on, in the neighborhood.  You know, the sound of the bat hitting a hard ball.  The ball breaking the glass of a window of someone's home.  Those kinds of things.  That was my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So--
Speaker 2: Oh, I forgot one more, the most important thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Is that I began to play the piano somewhere around four.
Story_ID: 115560
Speaker 1: Now it's highly unusual in the African American community to have a father that plays classical music in the car all the time.
Speaker 2: All the time.
Speaker 1: So this is, so now I believe you, and this is, did, did he [Samuel Edward Dixon] have favorites that he played that you--
Speaker 2: He, he just liked the composers, he loved [Johann Sebastian] Bach, liked [George Frideric] Handel.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Especially for the Handel's "Messiah" he loved that.  We used to try to sing excerpts of the Handel's "Messiah" at church services every Christmas, the anthems, the hymns.  But that was his thing.  And to this day, he listens to classical music in the car, (laughter) you know.
Speaker 1: Now this is something that's probably, I just thought, is probably unusual for most fathers in America, be they black or white to play--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --classical music all the time in the car, you know.  Somebody listens to it but it's, it's probably rarer in the black community.  But this is a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it's an interesting upbringing, every time you get in the car you hear class, the classical--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's his thing.
Speaker 1: --music.  So did you have, did he have like favorite artists that he would listen to?
Speaker 2: He knew, he would always bring up the masters, you know, he would bring up you know like I said Bach, Handel--
Speaker 1: But I mean in terms of the performers?
Speaker 2: Oh, performances, performers?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He liked Robert Shaw.  He would say to me, "You know, I like what Robert Shaw," you think Robert Shaw's Handel's Messiah recordings were, were extraordinary.  He would comment on performances of, of certain choruses when it comes to classical oratorio presentations.  And I don't, and I don't remember the titles but I just remember his comments I, I think "I like what Robert Shaw did, I didn't like what this other conductor did with the same work, you know, I didn't, I thought the choruses were lacking something."  He would always refer to the "divine intervention" in the work.  That something had to happen while the performance was taking place that would lift it into another realm spiritually where people could really taste the moment as opposed to just being entertained by the music but there had to be something human in the performance, beset, and besides it being mechanical.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.   So he made the link between the spiritual and, and the musical, I guess--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the sense of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah.  So much of classical music is, does have a theological content, has a, you know, is--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --is praise music.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Sacred music and it allows the mind to, to actually think, to process life.  Classical music's interesting in that regard and they talk about playing classical music for children but I, I, I do wanna say that for him, I think classical music was a place to allow his mind to escape, that's why I think he played it all the time in his cars.  Although I will say this, it was my mother's [Dorothy Jean Black Dixon] beautiful singing of those anthems and solos in church that I first became aware of the beauty of, of sound, of a woman's sound.  I don't think I've ever heard my mother sing a bad note.  I don't think I've ever heard her sing a bad note.  And until this very moment, I hadn't processed the influence of the two of them in that regard.  She doesn't sing a bad note, and every he does is extremely artistic and they're both artistic in terms of how they function in the world of music, in the world of music I was exposed to.  So I, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm having an epiphany right now in that regard.
Speaker 1: I think I hear you saying also that you didn't really appreciate as, I mean, fully the classics until you heard your mother sing some of the, those classical--
Speaker 2: Well, I--
Speaker 1: --pieces.
Speaker 2: --I'll put it this way, I processed the information that I received with classical music ever before me because my father kept playing it.  But I made the link between it being here in the ears and exposed to it, to my mother actually being able to do it in person.  And I didn't see any difference between the person on the radio singing a classical piece and my mother's sound singing an anthem piece in church, she could sing just as beautiful as the person on the radio, so I never knew there was a difference.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: There was, there, there actually could be bad music performances.  I guess I was exposed to great performances by my parents in terms of exposure to music and classical music, and also in terms of delivery between the two of them on a regular basis in church.  They are both phenomenal singers but I never saw, I never noticed a difference that there could be bad music because they were both extraordinary in what it is they were doing on a regular basis because it was normal to them.  Just like when you say you were normally gifted, well they were normally gifted, it seemed normal to me.  And I hadn't processed it that way until this conversation.
Story_ID: 115561
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I, I would just have to guess that your church was unusual in the fact that your father [Samuel Edward Dixon] was a classically trained musician and your mother [Dorothy Jean Black Dixon] had such an extraordinary voice, you know, in, in Union (ph.), well not, not Union Baptist (ph.) at this point but at First Freedom--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: First Freedom, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, First Freedom Baptist [Church] in Queens [New York City, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and, you know, we had a Hammond organ, we had a, a baby grand piano, like I said, he was a piano tuner and all I ever knew was good singing, good music.  That's all I was ever exposed to.  I didn't know how good it was at the time 'cause I'm, I'm a young child.  But as an adult who's trained and, and sings professionally now that I look back at the environment, it was extraordinary because I was exposed to classical music in a way that had nothing to do with being exposed to European sensibility.  I was just exposed to a black household that had a very eclectic musical life.
Speaker 1: So in some ways you could take excellence for granted in some ways (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yes, you can--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --because it's normal.  It was, I'm not bragging I'm just saying that was really the truth.  I didn't realize the extraordinary environment I was blessed to be raised in until I processed our conversation in this context that, that exposure didn't necessarily happen later on as I thought it did when I went to elementary school.  The exposure happened between the time I came out of her womb and for the first five years this was my environment before I went to elementary school.
Story_ID: 115562
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did, did your parents [Samuel Edward Dixon and Dorothy Jean Black Dixon] discuss the black classical musicians as, I mean, the, the stars of vocal classical music in those days like Marian Anderson.  I know he was, she, she was really--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --popular and in the news when your father was growing up, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I would hear the names, you know, Marian Anderson, Duke Ellington, and matter of fact Duke Ellington was in Queens [New York City, New York], he had a house.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: You know, because of the jazz side of him I heard, you know, names like Dizzy [Gillespie], you know.  And so I came across those names for myself in terms of paying attention to them when I went to school to study.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: In terms of elementary school [P.S. 124 Osmond A. Church in Queens, New York] when we would study and we would come across the name but I heard the name as a child.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, it's just information that you, you process when you're like three or four or five years old, six years old.  You kind, of just, oh, yeah.  I don't know what that means yet but I, I know, I've heard the name before and that would be my household, but elementary school, you start studying a little bit and you hear a name or somebody says this was a black composer or this was a black jazz musician or this was a black opera singer, "Oh, yeah" and you process it again there's another layer of processing the same names, and then junior high school then all of sudden high school, bam.
Speaker 1: Now, now how--
Speaker 2: Pow.
Speaker 1: --how early did you, I mean can you remember when you first heard about Roland Hayes?  He was, I know he was considered like this classical black tenor, so?
Speaker 2: Roland, I ran into Roland much later on in life because I really now was, was into African American tenors and specifically him much later on life when I came here to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was just--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --wondered what your father--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, if your father idolized him or had--
Speaker 2: Paul Robeson--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --was the person name, that's the name that came up with my father early on.  But that's only because Paul had a couple different careers going on at the same time.  He was a great writer, great orator, great actor, great singer, great thinker, certainly.  So that was a name that I, you know, I say "Yeah, yeah, I know that name, yeah he mentioned that."  You know, my mother, and my mother would sit there be quiet and be right there, holding court and being able to process the conversation at the table and, and then again she would sing and it all makes sense, (laughter) you know, yeah.
Story_ID: 115563
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now, where did you start grade school?
Speaker 2: I went to P.S. 124 [P.S. 124 Osmond A. Church] in Queens, New York, kindergarten to fifth grade.  And that was during the years I was heavily into baseball every spring and going to church, playing the piano for church services, choir rehearsals.  And so grades one through five, you know, I did the junior choir thing as a child.  And my parents [Samuel Edward Dixon and Dorothy Jean Black Dixon] u--, my mother used to make choir robes for us.  Church [First Freedom Baptist Church] was on, a 133rd and Rockaway Boulevard in Queens, New York.  We had a, father had a little storefront by that time 'cause we moved out of the person's house, Ms. Porter's house.  And I would sing in the choir and I was banging on the piano.
Speaker 1: So, so this is from the early '70s [1970s] through--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: '72 [1972], actually '73 [1973], '74 [1974], '75 [1975], we're somewhere at that first storefront church and I'm in the junior choir and that was my life from '73 [1973], '74 [1974]--'74 [1974], '75 [1975] was when baseball, elementary school, and church were all running at the same time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 115564
Speaker 1: So did you, now, who, who are your, your heroes, baseball heroes?
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Now you, now you gone get me going.  Woo boy. '69 [1969] Mets, yowza, woo, boy.  Yeah, Jerry Koosman, you know.
Speaker 1: So '69 [1969] Mets?  Now you, you were only, oh about three or four years old, right?
Speaker 2: Three or four years old but I found out about them because I became a Met fan years later when I was seven or eight.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So they were just still fresh in everybody's mind, you know, young, young, Tom Seaver [George Thomas Seaver]--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --Jerry Koosman [Jerome Koosman], Nolan Ryan.  And I heard about them guys, when I was six and seven I heard about 'em.  And--
Speaker 1: So who, was that--
Speaker 2: Jerry Grote [Gerald Grote] behind the plate, you know, what I mean.
Speaker 1: Was that Donn Clendenon that got the big hits?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So at six and seven I was playing Little League Baseball and we heard about these famous pitchers who went on (unclear).  So '69 [1969], '6-, '72 [1972], '71 [1971], those pitchers were just starting to come into their, their own.
Speaker 1: Okay, now wait a minute.  Now you must have been a pitcher (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I was a catcher.
Speaker 1: You're a catcher, okay.  'Cause you're naming--
Speaker 2: I was a catcher.
Speaker 1: --all these pitchers.  So I'm thinking--
Speaker 2: I'm naming the pitchers because I used to catch those fastballs and call the game.  So at seven, at six, and seven I'm playing Little League.  I started to follow the Big Red Machine [Cincinnati Reds in Cincinnati, Ohio], you know.  Dave Foster [sic, George Foster], you know--
Speaker 1: And George Foster (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: George Foster.  My guy was behind the plate Johnny Bench, 'cause, you know, Jerry Grote, Johnny Bench, I, I, I also followed Carl Yastrzemski.  I followed Young [ph.], who is the pitcher now, manager, but I was into catchers but I was also into pitchers too.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And the Big Red Machine was my team.  And--
Speaker 1: Even in New York [New York City, New York]?  Now this is--
Speaker 2: Even in New York.  But I loved the Mets [New York Mets] too 'cause I used to go to the stadium.  See it was physical for me when I went to, I didn't care, I didn't particularly, wasn't fond of Mickey Rivers [John Milton "Mickey" Rivers] and them boys, you know, Catfish Hunter [James Augustus Hunter] and them boys, 'cause they were they the [New York] Yankees, they were in the Bronx [New York City, New York], you know.  I respected their ability to play the game at a very high level and they have great history of course the Yankees.  One of the great teams of Major League Baseball, historically.  But I was a, I was a Met fan because I physically was able to go to the stadium and I became a fan.  Just like, you know, my mother's [Dorothy Jean Black Dixon] sound was beauty of music for opera sounds, singing, the Mets physically was just, you know, I could touch them.  I followed them but when it came to excellence it was about the Red Machine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was about the Red Machine, man, (laughter) you know.  But then again I was a football fan.  I liked the Steel Curtain [Pittsburgh Steelers].
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: You know, so that's was my, that was my era.
Speaker 1: So you followed the talent, you weren't a homer, homer necessarily, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  You know, I, I followed the talent, you know.  And I was a line drive hitter, I hit the gaps.  I could hit for power but I could put the ball in the gaps.  I could throw from a crotch position, throw people out at second base.  I used to catch 92, 93 mile an hour fastballs.  I can catch (unclear) curve balls.  And just gutsy beyond the plate.  And I also played third base, a little bit of short, and I could pitch too.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's interesting 'cause, you know, typified catchers is being more squat kind of guys like Johnny Bench was, he had a big bottom--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --able to sit there and catch these but you're not, you know, made up like that, you know, you don't appear to be.
Speaker 2: Well my legs--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --gave me a very big advantage.  For some strange reason I had very powerful legs.  I could come up, I could just sit in that crouch position all game long and call that, call a baseball game.  And patterned myself after all the great catchers in Major League Baseball.  And one of my patented mentors in terms of catching was really Johnny Bench, because he used to put one hand behind the back and one hand in front and that was unique at that time but most people kept both hands in play but, you know, scooping up the ball, backhanded to flip here or grabbing it when it hit the dirt like that, that was, you know, that's, that was my passion.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was the prototype in those days.  Did, did people talk about Roy Campanella--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --Roy Campanella was another one.  But see I wasn't--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, I wasn't physically in the environment where I could, I heard about him, I knew who he was, you know.  Roy Campanella, and then there was, he died very young, famous, Pittsburgh Pirate--
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: --so but--
Speaker 1: Manny Sanguillen?
Speaker 2: Not Manny Sanguillen but it'll come to me.  Sometimes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --it takes some time to come back.  But that, that really was, now '74 [1974], '75 [1975], '76 [1976] all the way up until high school.  Those were the my two passions, baseball and music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were riding like parallels.
Story_ID: 115565
Speaker 1: Now, now this is, it's interesting 'cause they, you know, today, you know, there's a, it's kind of a, you know, complaint or well, the 'plaint, the complaint is that African American kids aren't playing baseball anymore--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --like they used to and, you know.  Do you have any thoughts about why that's true today?
Speaker 2: I don't know why, I, I don't know why African American heroes in baseball are not translating to kids in high school and junior high school and elementary school.  I don't know why it's not translating.  I wanna say that my observation of this question right now lends me to look at basketball as one of the biggest reasons why.  And I think that the glitz and glamour of basketball, in the thirty years or so in terms of the way it comes across the media, has glamit-- has, has made the game so glamorous that I think kids have switched their allegiance from firing baseball back in the '70s [1970s] and the '80s [1980s] around my time to following those African American stars in basketball, you know.  Your Magics [Earvin "Magic" Johnson, Jr.], your Jordans [Michael Jordan] in that regard.  The, the game commercially has gained their, has, has grabbed their consciousness.  And so they'll go out and play basketball before they'll grab a bat and ball and go out and imitate somebody, you know, playing baseball.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I think the organizational aspect of baseball might have something to do with it.
Speaker 2: That's true too. (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (simultaneous)  Now, now you played in, in organized leagues right, with--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Little League and--
Speaker 2: Little League every spring.  Played during the summer on the All-Star Team.  And I played basically from '75 [1975] all the way up until my junior year of high school which is, you know, '83 [1983].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And --
Speaker 1: Do you have a, can you name some, some of your teams for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I played for the Reds in Little League, the Pirates, those were my two big teams.  And I played for a league, that was semipro that was, that, that was associated with the Mets organization called DAC, D-A-C [DAC Mets].  And they had a, we played a little, somewhere near Shea Stadium [New York City, New York] at a field at sixteen and seventeen years old and I was a catcher and a third baseman.  And then all of a sudden something happened.  Something happened.  I--
Speaker 1: Well, well what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, this is in terms chronologically.  At this time I was in high school and was running track.  I was also attending Music and Art [The High School of Music and Art, part of the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts in New York City, New York] during the day, and I was also attending Harlem School of the Arts [New York City, New York] during the evening studying piano and voice and taking theory.  And that's what happened.  Music and the travels back and forth to Harlem squeezed out my baseball evenings and I couldn't do it all.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And that's what happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 113769
Speaker 1: All right.  So, so this love of baseball, we know is true, and being a youth, would you say that consumed you in grade school early, your love of baseball or, or what, was music a rival or is some other sub, subject I mean, you know.
Speaker 2: Church life--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was the pillar of how I functioned as a child.  Church culture, church life, church schedule.  School was a requirement.  I went to school at 124 [P.S. 124 Osmond A. Church in Queens, New York] and I lived a normal life in terms of homework, walking from 124 back and forth to home.  It was only maybe two miles from, you know, the conduit over in Queens, 124, you know, to my mother [Dorothy Jean Black Dixon] and father's [Samuel Edward Dixon] home.
Speaker 1: Now what was it, I know we've talked about the music but, you know, was it the music in church life or, or something else?
Speaker 2: I think, if I can use this word, it was the gestalt of the whole culture in which I was being raised.  School, academics, was important.  And I was the kind of kid that I didn't mind doing well but it was not something I preoccupied myself in terms of "I gotta do well.  I gotta get an A."  I wasn't, I'm not that kind of a, I wasn't that kind of a kid.  So I think the gestalt of all of it was: in church life you hear the theology, you hear the sermons, I'd watch my father construct his sermons, how he would deliver them, hear all that music which was very eclectic for a church service, and I would go to school, get this education, and history classes these names would drop, George Washington, Ben Franklin, Duke Ellington, you just hear names, you, you, you study them, you have a little class on it, you take some math and English and all that.  But I don't think the lights were cut on for me yet, for me personally.  I think as a child, I just was operating in that environment and just doing what every kid does between grades one and five, function, get educated, go to church, play baseball, and family life.
Speaker 1: Now were there any special teachers at school or, or, you know, or mentors among the, your, your teachers?
Speaker 2: No one really speaks, sticks out--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --because I think my mother [Dorothy Jean Black Dixon] and father [Samuel Edward Dixon] were such strong role models in terms of why education is important, why church is important, and why your humanity matters, that by the time I went to school and, and saw the teachers, they were, I'm not devaluing their relevance, I am just saying that compared to my parents they were the second tier.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So my first tier were, were always my parents 24/7 in terms of being who I am and growing and being raised.  My teachers were just, their job was to educate.  But you know, when you hear theology on Sunday morning or C.L. Franklin preaching one night and, and Aretha Franklin singing the next night and my mother singing an anthem the next night and I hear classical music, by the time I get to school, you know, the sciences were really at play because I had baseball to keep me entertained in the afternoons during the springs and the summer.  So school was really, school was what it was supposed to be for them grades one through five, a place of education, books, and learning.  But the lights weren't really on.  They were always on outside of the school atmosphere, the school culture because I was just doing so much.

Speaker 1: And did you have a favorite coach?  Was your baseball manager a mentor or?
Speaker 2: Not a famous coach, favorite coach.  I just loved the guys and the same men who would do all they could to give us a season every season.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Bring the equipment around, pick us up, make sure we got back home.  No one really speak as, sticks out.  Ernie [ph.] was the guy who used to drive around in a little hatchback [Ford] Pinto.  And in that pinto would be 5, 5,000 of us packed up in there with the baseball equipment, (laughter) you know, with the catcher's mitt.  Oh, I just loved that.  Putting on all the stuff, the catcher's stuff, just loved that.  But that's Ernie.  But he is the one that sticks out in my mind in my baseball years because he gave so much service with his time, his car.  And, and I had one relative who would come all the time, James Washington [ph.], who lived a couple of blocks from Baisley Park [Baisley Pond Park in New York City, New York] and he would come and stand behind the fence and watch me catch and play, Shirley Washington's [ph.] husband, and those were my memories of baseball.  My parents [Dorothy Jean Black Dixon and Samuel Edward Dixon] really couldn't come because the church [First Freedom Baptist Church in Queens, New York City, New York] was the primary focus, they had to take care of the church.  And so, Saturdays and Sundays was church and I was Saturday was playing baseball.  So anyway the, to, to, to deal with that, that was school had its propers, its proper place in my life.
Speaker 1: So were you a good student?
Speaker 2: I think I was average, okay.  Sometimes I could be a great student if I wanted to be but I had so much going on, so just being a good student, average, average good student was really my primary focus.
Story_ID: 113771
Speaker 1: Now who taught you piano?
Speaker 2: Watching my father [Samuel Edward Dixon] play.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then he started giving me formal lessons. But I learned to play the piano by imitating sound.  I used math.  I figured out one note and then I would count up two or three notes and then I would get a third.  And then once I got a third, and I would, I knew what I was doing, and then I would count up four, that's not, doesn't sound right, five, that's one-three-five, that was my first chord, the C chord, and that's how I began to play the piano.  And then he noticed me doing that on my own.  And then I would use the math to learn to play it in all the keys--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --as a child.  And I would play all the church morning devotion services.  And I would try to learn to play in all the keys that people sing in 'cause at that time I was playing by ear.  And then my father would say "Okay you gotta learn to play formally" so he would put the Hanon exercises ["The Virtuoso Pianist" by Charles-Louis Hanon] in front of me and the [Johann Sebastian Bach] Bach Two-Part Inventions in front of me, and sometimes an organ hymnal music and he would always, "You gotta read, you gotta learn how to read."  Then he would say that, "You gotta read, you can't just play by ear."  So it was always that but I wanted to play by ear 'cause I was--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --gathering so much information musically.  But that's how I learned how to play piano.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you have a gift really that some singers don't have and that's a, the musical gift of being able to play instruments too.  I've seen you play the piano and you can, you really can play (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So it's a, it's a, so you started playing by ear?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I started playing by ear.  Most church musicians do, you know, three or four if they have the gift they start playing by ear and then there are people go you need to train.  In my, in my, in my situation my father was very adamant about playing them hymns on Sunday morning.  He wanted to hear those four line hymns, you know.  "Church is One Foundation", "Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty", those kind of hymns.  "Crown Him Lord of All," those, he wanted to hear those hymns because it was part of the liturgical setting for the church service.  And he would play 'em.  And I finally began to realize that I had to read and so, I reluctantly so started to sort of pay attention and practice a little in between playing baseball (laughter).
Story_ID: 113772
Speaker 1: But it, it all changed at sixth grade.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So what would happen in sixth grade?
Speaker 1: Someone mentioned that I should sing for the Brooklyn Boys Chorus and audition for them.  And the Brooklyn Boys Chorus was all-boys chorus.  Dr. James McCarthy at the time, 19-- I wanna say 1977.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's good, 'cause I was trying to calculate it here (laughter) (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was 1977.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: In '75 [1975] I was still at 124 [P.S. 124 Osmond A. Church in Queens, New York] in the fifth grade.  And then all of sudden I was going to school in Brooklyn at Long Island University, downtown Brooklyn [New York City, New York], and I was taking the A train from Queens to Brooklyn in the morning at six in the morning and I was going to this all boys school that had this choir.  And they traveled, they'd sing classical music.  And I was taking theory as a child in sixth grade and I was taught movable do [solfege] in sixth grade.
Speaker 2: And, and what is that?
Speaker 1: Movable do is a system that they use to, to teach ear training in music.  There's a fixed do system and then there's a movable do system.  They're two, some people, some people have a difference of opinion which system is the best system to use but basically it's a "do re mi fa sol la ti do" and "do, do re mi fa sol la si do" and if you have half steps in between you have the do, da, something like that.  But I was taught movable do at sixth grade.  And I had ear training and theory besides the formal early years of piano training from my father [Samuel Edward Dixon] when I was five and six or seven years old.  So this, by this time I was basically 12 in '77 [1977].
Speaker 2: Okay, so what's the name of this school?
Speaker 1: The Brooklyn Boys Chorus.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's the name of actually the school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Long Island University, Brooklyn--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --Boys Chorus.
Speaker 2: All right.  I thought it was just a, you know, I'm tend to think it was the singing group.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: So this is the name of the school?
Speaker 1: The school.
Speaker 2: The Brooklyn Boys Chorus school.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I had classes in the morning.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: I would get there around 8:30 and I would have my regular science classes like English and math and history and then we would have chorus rehearsal for about two hours.  And then I would have music education classes in the afternoons, and then another set of chorus rehearsal in the after, because we traveled.  And it was like the Harlem Boys Choir, except it was an actual school.
Speaker 2: Right.  I, I was gonna ask you about the Harlem Boys Choir.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And I--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --did have association with them later on when I was at Mannes College of Music [now The Mannes School of Music at The New School, New York City, New York], I did run into the Harlem Boys Choir and did something with them in terms of coming there, talk to the kids, and spend some time with the kids, work with them but that was when I was at Mannes when I was an adult (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But the Brooklyn Boys Chorus--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: --was the equivalent of the Harlem Boys Chorus that we know of today.  And that was back in '77 [1977].
Speaker 2: It is, this is mostly African American though?
Speaker 1: Hispanic and African American.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And we traveled and sang concerts at Lincoln Center [New York City, New York], traveled the eastern corridor, corridor from Connecticut to Boston [Massachusetts], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Washington, D.C. even here in Illinois.  We were in concert here and I remember we had one of the Amtrak Trains had derailed right outside of Chicago [Illinois], Union Station--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --while we were on tour.  And we were safe and we were all bused back here to Chicago to get on another train and get back to New York City.  But that's what I did the whole entire year of '77 [1977] was tour and attend school.
Speaker 2: So how often would you tour?  Say, would you do something every week at least or what?
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause we were always singing every week.  That was part predominantly the way the school took in money.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: We did concerts, and those concerts were basically, I remember a Ceremony of the Carols [sic, "A Ceremony of Carols" by Benjamin Britten], Bach Cantatas, choral, lots of choral music, just classical music.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: And I was a second soprano.  The second soprano at the time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: What, what are the parts for boys in a chorus?
Speaker 1: There would be a soprano, second soprano, alto, tenor, and at that time we called them basses but the truth of the matter really, you know, technically they would be baritones and sometimes we would have extraordinary voices that would have bass notes.  And it's interesting these were kids who had to audition to get in the program so they were already gifted.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: And we all could read music.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 113773
Speaker 1: Would you, how would you rate the music program that you came out of in Queens [New York City, New York]?  I mean was it a, I mean, 'cause a lot of kids don't have those kind of music pro--, programs in school anymore, where you actually learn how to read music, and but--
Speaker 2: At that time the music program was subsidized by my own musical background from my parents [Dorothy Jean Black Dixon and Samuel Edward Dixon].  So I didn't know that the music program was any less than because, you know, you spent maybe eight, you spent maybe four hours a week at church, and you had all this classical music and this gospel music and you heard jazz at home and classical music in the car, the music appreciation I had flowed right into whatever music I could get at 124 [P.S. 124 Osmond A. Church in Queens, New York] so I really didn't see, I didn't, I didn't, it was never really delineated in such a way where I could tell that the program was less than because it was just all a part of one pot.  It was one big musical gumbo experience for me.  But then Brooklyn Boys Chorus [at Long Island University in New York City, New York] accelerated my path, in terms of me individually, because once I got into the program at, at twelve years old, and I became labeled as a second soprano and I was taking theory and I wasn't just taking piano lessons I was actually sight reading with other people next to me, then I was absorbing that environment too.  So 124 and Brooklyn Boys Chorus, 124, grades one through five, and Brooklyn Boys Chorus at sixth grade, those, Brooklyn Boys Chorus cemented me, I think, as a young, serious artist.  I just didn't know it yet.
Story_ID: 113774
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now who were, were there any special teachers or mentors in Brooklyn Boys Chorus [at Long Island University in New York City, New York]?
Speaker 2: Dr. [James] McCarthy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is Dr.--
Speaker 2: He's not living now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He passed away a couple years back.
Speaker 1: McCarthy.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (simultaneous) McCarthy, James McCarthy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he played pipe organ and he played the piano and he was our conductor.  And he was also our, you know, teacher in terms of music as well--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --along with the other teachers.
Speaker 1: Now he, is he an African American?
Speaker 2: No.  He was a white male.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Dr. James McCarthy.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: White male.  And I remember we actually shot a film in the park in Brooklyn for PBS.  We were doing a Bach special as a kid and we were rolling down on skateboards and they were filming us in trees and we were singing and I remember that that year [1997] and besides our travels, stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you see it on television?
Speaker 2: I never saw it.  I never saw it.  We also participated at the Brooklyn Academy of Music [New York City, New York] that year, in '77 [1977], in "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" [by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd-Webber] before it went on Broadway--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --when it was first being workshopped.  So I used to travel to the Brooklyn Academy of Music and do eight shows a week, and used to play in the basements at BAM.  And all of that happened that year, the traveling to Europe, I mean to Illinois and East Coast and the Bach movie and the "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" at BAM.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's Brooklyn Academy of Music is BAM?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, Brooklyn Academy of Music, right.  The big clock, right downtown in Brooklyn.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 113775
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now how long did you, now did you do all of junior high school at--
Speaker 2: No.  I was only in Brooklyn Boys Chorus [at Long Island University in New York City, New York] for one year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My voice changed at thirteen.  I was back in junior high, I was back in junior high school, I wanna say P.S. 226 [sic, J.H.S. 226 Virgil L. Grissom in Queens, New York City, New York], is that where I went to junior high school?  I can see the school but I'm not sure 'cause--(unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: I can tell you.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: In a second here.  Let's see--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: One, yeah, 226.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there you go.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right off the conduit.  House, Howard Beach.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Cross Bay Boulevard, 226, number 7 bus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ride it right past Aqueduct Racetrack.  Yeah, my voice changed at thirteen or was beginning to change, and then all of a sudden grades seven it was changing, grade eight something happened.  A chorus, Mr. Vecchioni [ph.] heard me singing in the tenor section in chorus.  And he walked up to me while we were singing and warming up and he stood next to me and he listened to me and he singled me out and he says you have a very beautiful voice.  My voice had already changed at thirteen.  And let me say something about that.  I sang throughout the whole vocal change.  I was a boy soprano, the voice changed and it dropped and I kept singing through church so I would crack while I was doing my solos.  The solos I used to sing as a boy soprano now my voice wasn't acting right but I never got discouraged because they never said anything negative about my voice cracking at church services.  So it seemed normal to me.  But I always had my baseball glove and my hardball in it, with my little rubber band wrapped around it when I went to church.  So I would sing, crack all the time I was thirteen and it was horrible.  I can remember now, it was just horrible, but I never was discouraged 'cause I, you just get up and sing and then you sit down.  Then I would go play the piano during service and didn't think anything about it, and never got discouraged.  But at 17 at 226, Vecchioni heard me and he said I had a, a beautiful voice and they gave me this torch song that Frank Sinatra used to sing, "My Way".  And I sang that at one of the concerts and that was grades, grade, eighth grade 226 choral concert, I sang "My Way."  Then all of a sudden the light bulb cut on.  It's funny it didn't really cut on at Brooklyn Boys Chorus 'cause I was still being talented and a boy soprano was just normal to me.
Speaker 1: So you, you considered that was just part of the chorus--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was just--
Speaker 1: --and not a, not having an exceptional voice necessarily.
Speaker 2: I had an exceptional voice 'cause I had solos.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the light bulbs weren't on.  I was just doing what I do, you know, what I mean.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I didn't, I, it was until Vecchioni singled me out in eighth grade, then he said, "Sing 'My Way'", that I, that all of sudden something flipped.  You would think that it would have flipped at Brooklyn Boys Chorus with all the traveling, the movie, singing the solos, singing "Soon and Very Soon" and sitting down playing the key of F with the Brooklyn Boys Chorus while we were traveling doing concerts, it didn't happen when I was twelve.  It happened when I was fourteen at 226, ""My Way" in that moment, light bulb cuts on.  And maybe because I was two years older and I realized something special was happening.
Story_ID: 113776
Speaker 1: I'm--we, we have story from [HM] Isaac Hayes that in Memphis [Tennessee] he, when he first did his first talent show and he saw the reaction of the girls when he was about thirteen--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he was convinced he wanted to be a singer.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did that have something to do with it, I mean, you don't think it, it--
Speaker 2: I don't know but I don't think it was really the girls for me.  It was just something happened to me, I don't know what about "My Way".  And, and that moment with Dr. Vec--, I mean Mr. Vecchioni [ph.] the teach, the choral teacher at the time, and there was another man in the room I can't think of his name but there was something about that moment, all of a sudden things were different.  And then the next thing I know just like someone took me to Brooklyn Boys Chorus [at Long Island University in New York City, New York] at twelve to audition for them, somebody in my eighth grade suggested I should audition for the School of Music and Art [The High School of Music and Art in New York City, New York, part of the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts] in Harlem [New York City, New York].  I went and did the audition and they gave me this entrance exam where I would have to repeat what the person tapped on the table in terms if I could repeat rhythmic ideas.  I'd have to repeat vocally what the person played or sang and I was accepted into Music and Art in Harlem.  So to make sense out of this chronologically, I started taking the trains at twelve to go to Brooklyn to study with the Boys Chorus, the A Train to Brooklyn.  Then for two years I was in Queens, 13 and 14 voice changes, I sing "My Way" in eighth grade.  Next thing I know I'm at Music and Art at ninth grade in Harlem taking the A train all the way up to a 135th Street, Uptown to Harlem.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is a 1980, I guess?
Speaker 2: This is 1980, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So where, where was this located is this--
Speaker 2: Harlem, a 135th Street right up under the City College [City College of New York in New York City, New York] campuses, a 135th Street up the hill.  On, St. Nicholas [Park] is down the hill where the B and C and D and A train runs, and then up the hill is City College campus.  It has a big old building right there, that's where Music and Art was housed, that was where it was housed, and then Performing Arts [the High School of Performing Arts in New York City, New York, part of the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts] was housed downtown--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Manhattan:
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the, the campus there, now this is the campus that was pop, popularized by the movie "Fame", I think?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's, that's, that's "Fame".  And I came in after that so that was still a buzz that this is where "Fame" happened.  This is where all those talented students and I was now a part of that family.  And, and meanwhile, basically from 1980 to '84 [1984] at Music and Art, I used to make that pilgrimage, every morning 6:30 in the morning catch the Q10 bus either take the A train or either pick up the E and F train on Hillside Avenue all the way into Manhattan, all the way uptown.  Hour and a half in morning, an hour and a half in the evening back home.  So I spent three hours a day traveling back and forth to Music and Art from Queens to Harlem, Harlem to Queens.  And I still managed to play baseball, and I still managed to run track, and I still managed to go to Harlem School of the Arts [New York City, New York] down the hill for two years in my junior and senior year.  But the Music and Art years were very important because those were the years that while I was running track and playing baseball as a freshman and as a sophomore, I was beginning to process education, music education, and regular, general education differently.  So by the time I was a junior in Music and Art, I was running the gospel choir, teaching gospel music every seventh period, writing repertoire and scoring my own piano compositions and writing for brass instruments, writing for string instruments and also I was a, a classical vocalist for the classical division of Music and Art, singing in a special class for soloist for classical music and also for chorus.  So, and I still managed to run track but I had to let baseball go and then I was downtown, I was down stairs at the Harlem School of Music, of the Arts, Betty Allen's school, taking voice, theory, and piano--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --junior and senior year.
Story_ID: 113777
Speaker 1: Now who was your first classical voice instructor?
Speaker 2: Barbara Mahajan.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Technically it's my mother [Dorothy Jean Black Dixon] and father [Samuel Edward Dixon] because I imitated their sounds and they taught me the beauty of singing but Barbara was the first person to actually give me technical terms, to tell me what exactly I was doing and she was helping me become a tenor.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: I had a high voice but I was only high, I had a high voice that was gifted but in terms of singing classical repertoire she said this is repertoire you need to learn.  So I learned the Twenty-Four Italian Art songs [sic, "Twenty-Four Italian Songs and Arias"].
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: All of the classically trained singers start with the Twenty-Four Italian Art Songs, and I had the high book with, you know, tenors, second tenors/baritone but I sing in those high keys.  And she taught me how to sing through the passaggio at sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was responsible for getting me into the Harlem School of the Arts to take voice, piano, and theory, her and Jonathan Sprague but mainly Barbara Mahajan.  She was an African American opera singer in Manhattan [New York City, New York], 'cause her daughter [Indira Mahajan] and I were very good friends.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There are a lot of naturally gifted singers, what is the value of, you know, classical voice training to someone who's already, they can already sing.  They're, they're gifted say, you know.
Speaker 2: I think it's a matter of taste, one.  I think it's a matter of what moves you, what stimulates your mind.  If you are a person who grew up like I did around technique, whether it be your father writing sermons, whether it be your mother singing technically sound, whether it's just unless she had just an interesting voice that did not have a break, the way it, the way training helps you process technique, and then you're able to apply that to how you study voice, you begin to say well I don't wanna just sing a piece of music any old kind of way just because I'm gifted.  So from my mother [Dorothy Jean Black Dixon] and father [Samuel Edward Dixon] singing to the Boys Choir [Brooklyn Boys Chorus at Long Island University in New York City, New York], where I was training as a second soprano, where School of Music and Art [The High School of Music and Art, part of the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, in New York City, New York,] was all about the big classical institutions like Juilliard [The Juilliard School in New York City, New York], you wanna go to Juilliard, you wanna go to Manhattan School of Music [New York City, New York], Oberlin Conservatory [Oberlin Conservatory of Music in Oberlin, Ohio], Westminster College-- Choir College of Music [Westminster Choir College in Princeton, New Jersey], all the big schools, Boston Conservatory [Boston, Massachusetts], so forth and so on, those institutions will inherently present the next level to you as you're training at that level.  So Music and Art in New York City with Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall, would always point that way, you know.  Even when I was up in Harlem, and you had friends who lived in Manhattan, Bronx, and Brooklyn who came from diverse backgrounds musically, would have skill sets and abilities that have certain things that they would do innately whether they were technically sound or not but there was technique actually in play that will point towards techniques, so therefore I was driven to the technical side of my gift.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Because it was processed that way over a period of time from the time I was, you know, from my mother and father up until high school.  So technique and technical aspects were always a part of how I processed what I was doing innately.
Story_ID: 116819
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so now the plot thickens here, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you're doing, you know, you're like kind of focusing in on--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --music now.
Speaker 2: Music and Art [The High School of Music and Art, part of the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, in New York City, New York,] made me focus then, and I was around a lot of gifted singers.  Not unlike Brooklyn Boys Chorus [Brooklyn Boys Chorus at Long Island University in New York City, New York] who were gifted but I still had the baseball in my hand and the glove.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: And that's the image I used.  It still was a possibility when I was twelve, but now, at Music and Art, it's fading away.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And track is taking its place.  I am now making it in the classical side of the school, building a reputation.  I'm also teaching gospel music and I'm taking classes down at Harlem School of the Arts [New York City, New York] and taking voice with Barbara Mahajan.  And all of a sudden Barbara introduces me to "Porgy and Bess" [by George Gershwin].
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And she introduces me to Jimmy Levine [James Levine], Marilyn Horne, oh, not Marilyn Horne [sic, Marilyn Horne appears on the recording], but Leontyne Price, the famous recording where she sings "La rondine" ['Chi il bel sogno di Doretta' from the opera "La rondine" by Giacomo Puccini] and the, the great mezzo [mezzo-soprano], I can't think of her name, that's on that recording.  And I hear "Porgy and Bess" because Barbara [Mahajan] and Jonathan [Sprague] are doing "Porgy and Bess" in Europe.  They were also singing it at Radio City Music Hall [New York City, New York] and I hear this recording by Jimmy Lovine and Leontyne Price in the Mets, I can't think of her name, Horne, I think it's Horne [Marilyn Horne], and Price sings "La rondine".  And then I heard this sound in that aria and then my life changed.  I processed the sound, the recording, I began to sing those Twenty-Four Italian Art Songs [sic, "Twenty-Four Italian Songs and Arias"] with Barbara, "Gia il sole dal Gange" [by Alessandro Scarlatti] was the first piece I had.  I used it in competitions in my sophomore, junior, junior year, and senior year in college.  Writing those gospel tunes, composing for brass instruments and string instruments for my gospel concerts with the Harlem Music and Art Gospel Choir.  And then I'm doing these classical concerts with the classical division of Music and Art.
Story_ID: 116820
Speaker 1: And then a semiannual concert happens at Music and Art [The High School of Music and Art, part of the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, in New York City, New York,] in 1984 and then Walter Beinecke [Jr.] and Joy Beinecke hears me at the semiannual and he says what school are you going to for college?
Speaker 2: So you, you, you sing a solo on this semiannual--
Speaker 1: Yes, I did.
Speaker 2: --concert.  And it's--
Speaker 1: The solo was 'Estuans interius' from "Carmina Burana" [by Carl Orff].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And Barbara had taught me how to thread the needle in passaggio to sing that passagg, to sing those, those G's in the Carmina Burana.  (Speaking Latin), you know.  And Walter and Joy were in the audience, and Joy was a former student of Music and Art and they were, and she was alumni and she was married to Walter, and Walter owned Nantucket Island [Massachusetts], basically.  He was from a very famous family that built all those famous structures on the East Coast, the famous hotel [The Plaza Hotel in New York City, New York] on Fifth Avenue on 59th Street.  They have a, the Yale [University in New Haven, Connecticut], the Beinecke Library [Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library] is named after the family at Yale.  And, and Walter was standing there and he was married to Joy, and Joy came to that concert and another lady from WQXR the classical station that my father [Samuel Edward Dixon] used to listen to, was there as well.  And they said, "What school are you going to young man?"  I said "Well, I don't have a school" because I had applied to University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] and wasn't accepted and I couldn't believe it.  But they did not accept me.  And so they were talking and they were talking and then all of sudden Walter says "Well, why don't you, you wanna go to Juilliard [The Juilliard School in New York City, New York] or you wanna go to Mannes College of Music [now The Mannes School of Music at The New School, New York City, New York]?"  I didn't know too much about Mannes but I had heard about Mannes and talked to my parents about it and I talked to Barbara about it and, you know, next thing I know he says, "Well come sing at Mannes, come audition for Mannes."  So I graduate in '84 [1984] in May, June from Music and Art with no place to go to study.
Speaker 2: This is incredible.  I'm, I'm, well, I have feeling (unclear) now why did you pick the University of Michigan now?
Speaker 1: Well, that's because that's where Barbara [Mahajan] and my good friend, Indira [Mahajan] and I were auditioning for, and we sang our 24 Italian Art Songs [sic, "Twenty-Four Italian Songs and Arias"] and they did not accept us.
Speaker 2: So you actually auditioned for them?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And they--
Speaker 1: They said you're not what we're looking for at the time.  But that's, that's okay.
Speaker 2: Now was--
Speaker 1: It was a blessing though.
Speaker 2: Were, were Shirley Verrett associated with--
Speaker 1: Not at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: [HM] George Shirley and Shirley Verrett--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: --wasn't there at that time.  I think they were still in their heyday of their careers at the time.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they weren't really on the faculties.  I can't say specifically on record that they weren't or they were, I just know that they are affiliated with University now--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --in terms of the last twenty years.  And Shirley has, Shirley made her transition--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --but I just talked with George Shirley within the last eight months or so, and so that was the first time we met in the last eight months.  But at that time in '84 [1984] I didn't have no where to go and, but it was a blessing because the Beineckes, the Osceola Foundation, said come sing at Mannes and then it this, you know, you could go to Juilliard, no.  And they were talking to Julliard, I say, oh, no, "Am I gonna get in?" (laughter) you know.  So anyway I sang and then Dr. Charles Kaufman, walked into my life, who was the dean of Mannes College of Music at the time.  I sang "Gia il sole dal Gange", Alessandro Scarlatti, 24 Italian Art Song [sic, "Twenty-Four Italian Songs and Arias"] for my audition at Mannes in September.  I think I wanna say September 6, woo, that's deep, that's deep, that's deep, that's, that's, that's taking me somewhere.  September 6, I auditioned, he said "Come down to my office" and he said to me "How would you like to go to school here?"  I said, "I would love to go to school here."  He said "Well, the Beinecke family, the Osceola Foundation, has offered to pay for your college education and you can go to school here as long you want."  At that time I was very grateful I didn't get into the University of Michigan, 'cause I would have to pay for student loans and my parents [Dorothy Jean Black Dixon and Samuel Edward Dixon] didn't have the means to really put me through school but here I was offered a full scholarship and Dr. Kaufman at that time, just took me under his wings.
Story_ID: 116821
Speaker 1: My freshman [at Mannes College of Music, now The Mannes School of Music at The New School, New York City, New York] year I was not as aggressive as I should have been be, because it was somewhat of a culture shock.  I was now going to school in Manhattan not in Harlem [New York City, New York].  I was in a private school that had maybe 300 schools, 300 schools at best.  I mean 300 students at best.  In the whole school there were maybe three or four blacks in the whole entire college.  So the first year was a transition year for me so, I was okay.  But when you get in that, that, when you get into that type of environment, then the Eurocentric or the European training atmosphere starts to get in, get into your space.  Which was different for me.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: You would think that after private school and Boys Choir [Brooklyn Boys Chorus at Long Island University in New York City, New York] at twelve years old, that I would be able to assimilate much faster but there was something about this atmosphere in the conservatory setting.  I was no longer around people who were just gifted.  I was around people who were gifted, talented, but they knew their stuff when it came to classical music.  And they really didn't care too much about the jazz and all the other things that I was really good in as well.  They were just saying, you know, that's nice but with serious musicians now.  Serious atmosphere and I was one of two or three blacks.
Speaker 2: How did you feel about that interpretation of music?  That a--
Speaker 1: I had no problems with it, you know, 'cause I told Dr. [Charles] Kaufman, I said, "If you think I can do this I'll come.  I mean it's a free, it's a free education.  I'll take it, right now I have nothing."  He said, "Well you start school tomorrow."
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: So September 7th, I was enrolled in Mannes with a full scholarship after I sang the day before.
Speaker 2: What, what was it, I'm tempted to ask you to sing a few bars of, of your audition, you know, can, can you still--
Speaker 1: Oh, I think--
Speaker 2: --sing it?
Speaker 1: I remember.  It's all in Italian but (singing "Gia il sole dal Gange" by Alessandro Scarlatti) that's what I remember.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So I'm impressed though.  So--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) some of the Italians say, "Oh, my God, his Italian."  But I hadn't practiced, I'm on the spot, it's okay, you know.  But no, it, that's what I sang.  And Kaufman said to me, he said, "You can come here as long as you want."  So I'm now I'm immersed in this environment with its completely Eurocentric, European sensibility about education.  I'm one of two blacks or three blacks at any given time.  I was there for seven years from 1985 to 1991.  I got my bachelor's, I received my bachelor's of music degree in voice, and my master's of music degree in voice.
Story_ID: 116822
Speaker 1: And during that seven years [at Mannes College of Music, now The Mannes School of Music at The New School, New York City, New York] I spent a couple years in France, which was very important, which has a huge, tremendous, connection to the city of Chicago [Illinois], when I went to France, I think, in '87 [1987].
Speaker 2: Now what, what is that connection?
Speaker 1: Fontainebleau [France] was where I met Leonard Bernstein, I studied with Regine Crespin and Madame Duplex [ph.], and I found out that [HM] Quincy Jones went to school there with John Williams as a composer to study with Nadia Boulanger.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I had spent two summers in France.  And at that cha--, at that Fontainebleau, at that particular town in France about thirty miles outside of Paris, I met my good friends, Chris Guardino, Bright Sheng, and there was another Asian friend of mine, I can't think of his name, Wan [ph.].  But there's a strong connection of Fontainebleau to Chicago in '87 [1987].  At that time I didn't know it.  But here are the, here's the triangle.  I'm in Fontainebleau my third year at Mannes in the summer.  I raise $500 to pay for my round-trip ticket to go there, everything else was paid for.  I get there, didn't speak any French, had to get from Charles de Gaulle Airport all the way into Fontainebleau, so I found a friend on the plane who was African American, who was an artist.  And we hooked up when we got to Charles de Gaulle and we finally said, well we figure out how to get to this town together and we got in a cab and got to the train station.  Then we figured out the train, then we took the train all the way to Fontainebleau.  So we're in town, we're at the school, watch this, about a week or two into my stay there, in Fontainebleau, I'm at the cafe in the morning having breakfast and we hear rumblings that Leonard Bernstein is on his way here.  Well, I'm sitting down with my friends Chris and Bright Sheng, and lo and behold a Mr. Craig Urquhart walks into the cafeteria.  Now Craig Urquhart is my piano teacher from the Harlem School of Arts [New York City, New York] during my Music and Art [The High School of Music and Art, part of the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, in New York City, New York,] days.  So Craig Urquhart, he walks in, I say, "Craig what are you doing here?"  He says, "Well I'm the assistant to Leonard Bernstein."  "What?"  "How you doing Rodrick?  What are you doing in France?"  "Well, I'm here to take voice with Regine Crespin, the great, the great opera singer of Paris, France, internationally known, sang at the Met [Metropolitan Opera in New York City, New York] for almost fifteen years or better.  Regine Crespin, pinnacle of opera, operatic importance."  He said "Really?"  So, Bernstein walks into the room, he looked and Craig says, "Well Rod, meet Leonard Bernstein.  Leonard Bernstein meet Rod and meet Chris Guardino, and meet Bright--" and well Bright Sheng was studying with Leonard Bernstein at the time, composition for classical music.  So for two weeks I spent time with Leonard Bernstein at the Paris Opera [Paris, France], watching him work with young conductors from the program who were working with the orchestra there from Fontainebleau, the Academy of Music [sic, American Conservatory], Fontainebleau.  I, we spent time going to dinner.  We spent time with him at his apartment.  And we spent just a lot of time in the, and, and I couldn't believe it.  Now mind you, Craig Urquhart was my piano teacher at Harlem School of the Arts during my years at Music and Art, is there, then all of a sudden when I was at Mannes during '85 [1985] through '91 [1991], when I'm at Fontainebleau in 1987, I believe, Leonard Bernstein lived on 72nd in the West End right down the street from where Mannes was on 85th Street between Amsterdam and Columbus.  So I had to go all the way to Fontainebleau to meet him, when he literally lived a couple of blocks down the street in Manhattan.  But the irony was, my piano teacher was his assistant.
Story_ID: 116823
Speaker 1: Then I spent time with him [Leonard Bernstein] in Fontainebleau [France], and I asked him a question when we were walking the street and I said, and I used to call him "Lenushka," and I said, "Lenushka, what, what is it?"  Just a arbitrary ambiguous question out of the blue, it had nothing to do with anything, we were just walking.  I said, "What is it?"  And he knew what I was asking him.  He turned around and he looked me straight in face, he said, "It's the Bible.  It's the Bible."  I thought about it.  I didn't ask any more questions.  I processed what he said and that was the most important piece of information I got, I could have gotten from one of the greatest classical conductors, composers, and pianists of American classical music history, with Leonard Bernstein giving me the answer to that question.  Out of all the things I could have asked, "Could I sing for you?  What do you think about my voice?"  What, I didn't wanna hear that.  I just wanted to know from him the truth.  The truth is what it is and what it's not.  That was the truth to me because I wanted him to give me something that was relevant to what I was searching for.  "What is it?"  He said, "It's the Bible."  And I began to understand what he meant by that years later.  But that was a defining moment for me because I wasn't asking for an opportunity, I was looking for something that would carry me through for the rest of my life.  Now I knew the Bible from my mother [Dorothy Jean Black Dixon] and father [Samuel Edward Dixon].  My father's a preacher.  But not in the context of what I was about to do for the next twenty years of my life as a serious artist.  'Cause, because in classical music, they'll refer to theology as a pillar to making beautiful music and moving people.  We refer to classical music in terms of technique and being able to really substantiate and call at will what it is that you're doing as an artist.  So technique was a part of that.  That would be a person's God.  That was not always my God.  Technique was part of the process of the entertainer but the Bible answer to me was important for me at that time when he [Leonard Bernstein] answered that question in 1987.  'Cause he said, he realized I was not looking for a career, I was looking for an answer.  And he gave me what I was, he gave me what I needed.  (Unclear) "The Bible."  What, what does that mean?  But I'll share with you how it began to become a very profound answer.
Story_ID: 116824
Speaker 1: So that's [Leonard] Bernstein in Fontainebleau [France], but here's the catch that is connected to the city of Chicago [Illinois] and Lyric Opera [of] Chicago, Bright Sheng, a young composer at the time in France, had written five songs for tenor and piano in Chinese.  So that particular summer for the concert at the end of the Fontainebleau experience and training, I decided to sing all five, all five pieces in Chinese for Bright at the Jeu de Paume Court in Fontainebleau at the Chateau.  You would think I would sing French repertoire after all I'm in France studying with, Regine Crespin, I did sing some French repertoire but I chose to put Bright's pieces on the program.  So we forged a relationship.  Next thing I know I'm back in New York [New York City, New York] at Mannes [Mannes College of Music, now The Mannes School of Music at The New School, New York City, New York] in '87 [1987], '88 [1988] happens, I get my training, '89 [1989], graduate from bachelor's degree.  I get my masters degree at Mannes in the opera department.  And Paul Echols is really a great opera mentor, who has since passed on, trained me very well.  And Dr. [Charles] Kaufman stayed in my life and, and sent me to Assisi [Italy] to train.  In those years at Mannes I got the best music training anyone could ever ask for on this earth.  I was trained like a composer, like a musician, not like a singer.  I mean I took three or four years of theory, three and a half years of ear training.  I had dictation for four years.  I had piano for two years.  I mean the hardware stuff.  Species counterpoint up to five, you know.  I was trained, I mean really trained.  And also part of that Fontainebleau experience is Bright Sheng and also the, the realization that [HM] Quincy Jones had gone there to, to study with the great theorists of the 20th century, Nadia Boulanger.  So that's where all of those guys inter, intersected in Fontainebleau.  So Quincy's now sitting in the, like a ship way off in the distance 'cause I knew he was there with John Williams and Nadia Boulanger chose to train Quincy and John Williams for the, for, for composition but she turned George Gershwin down.  So I'm sitting there in Fontainebleau with this information, with Leonard Bernstein, Craig Urquhart, Bright Sheng, the composer, Chris Guardino, my friend, I'm in France singing Chinese.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: Get back to Mannes, Paul Echols, he works me over real good, trains me well.  I get the greatest education ever.  And now it comes time for me to graduate in '91 [1991].  I run into Bright Sheng on Fifth Avenue [New York City, New York] years later.  And he says to me, "Hey how you doing?"  "I'm doing fine.  What's going on with you?"  "I'm great, I'm still, you know, I still have your five songs for tenor in piano in Chinese," you know.  He said, "Yeah, well, you know what?  Lyric Opera Chicago is doing my opera now and why don't you audition for the Young Artist Program [Lyric Opera Center for American Artists, now The Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center]?  Who knows, you might get in.  And if you get in they may even give you the lead, who knows?"  And it was in Chinese, "The Song of Majnun," Majnun.
Speaker 2: Can, can you sing a little bit of that in Chinese?
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't remember that (laughter).  I don't remember the Chinese at all.
Story_ID: 116825
Speaker 1: Question I have is like how, is it that you, you had to learn to sing songs in Italian--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --French--
Speaker 2: German.
Speaker 1: --German--
Speaker 2: Russian.
Speaker 1: --Russian--
Speaker 2: Spanish.
Speaker 1: --Spanish.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And Chinese.
Speaker 1: Now how, so you learned these songs phonetically and--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: That's how you--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were taught the international phonetic symbols in college--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --IPA [International Phonetic Alphabet].  And we have these symbols that we put under the vowels in all the different languages, and you learn the symbols and you begin to create the sounds, and it's a whole school of thought on the international phonetic symbols on that.  And that's how you learn to sing in foreign languages.
Speaker 1: So this is a class you take (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a class.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And its actual phonetic symbols.  I can actually show, I wish I had brought some music, but I'll show it to you.  But I still use international phonetic symbols to this day when I'm working in foreign languages because--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --it's hard to keep up with the mixed vowels when they're dark or lighter or when they have more E in the vowel and less E in the vowel and more O in the vowel and, you know, the especially in French when they have these schwas in German and end of words that are silent and all of that.  So, you know, I'm getting older now, I just have--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) last week Natalie Cole was on Charlie Rose discussing her father [Nat King Cole] singing in Spanish.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And that he was, she thinks hers is better than his but he didn't know Spanish and she-
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Speaker 1: --doesn't either so, but.  So this is how this is done.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Study the international phonetic symbols.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah
Speaker 2: For singing--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --in foreign languages.  And it's there--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --you know, for speaking languages too.
Speaker 1: Can you learn it one, I mean can you learn how this tech, technique in one class for one semester (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: No it's, it's, it's, it's a, it's a lifetime study.  You still have to, you know, the, the symbols are there, you take the class a couple of times and you start writing all of your, phonetics of your arias and your art songs down and all your music because when you work with cultures, you know, if you're stuck somewhere, you know, what, you know, is that a, is that a umlaut, you know, is it not a umlaut, is it a mixed vowel.  If it's more O in the sound, less E in the sound because of the natural way your voice lies and the color you're trying to create in the sound it's very, very specific in text, technical.  So this is a lifetime thing with the international phonetics, especially if you are American.  If not, if you're European and you grew up with French or German, Italian, you're singing in your native tongue.  It really doesn't matter.
Story_ID: 116826
Speaker 1: Now, how would you handle something, for instance, a dialect of a language?  I mean, if you, 'cause I'm sure some of, of some songs have a dialect--
Speaker 2: Well, it's interesting--
Speaker 1: --change.
Speaker 2: --you would say that because the dialect would not necessarily show up in the vocal color of your sound, your sound is your sound.  The dialect would show up in your mannerisms not in the sound but how you're able to create the persona of the character in their own culture.  So the sound is always gonna be the same because they're gonna hire you because the sound is your sound, you have the particular kind of voice type that fits that particular role and its traditionally your kind of voice type that sings that kind of role that plays that kind of character.  And so the voice comes first, the sound comes first, they hire that first and then they're hoping that you can facilitate and execute through all the traditions inherently built into performing the role over the last 100 years or so in terms of American opera or, you know, classical situation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So then would I be right in thinking that the voice in classical music is used the way an instrument would be used--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to hit certain notes and to hit 'em on time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --you can't change the, the nature of the sound--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --to facilitate a dialect.  Now, if we were speaking, then you can change the nature of the sound because you're not trying to hold a note.  You're speaking so, you know, it's your (starting to put on an accent) "I wanna tell you something, you know, I, you know, I'm so where did you study, very nice, very nice and so who did you study with, very nice."  That's dialect I mean, you know, it's characterization but you can't do that with sound because your sound is your sound.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause that's the color, and you work to perfect that color to get the legato sound, round sound, that will cover, you know, a 150 yards in a hall because you're twenty feet up stage and you gotta shoot pass a seventy piece orchestra with no mic on, and its acoustically built so that sound can travel to the exit sign and they can hear you.  So you have to be the right voice type with the right size voice playing the right character.  And so when you start getting all those matrix together, it's hard to create a dialect with the sound because the sound would dissipate when seventy instruments are blowing at the same time and you got to get the voice to cut through it.  So you become a human amplifier.  That's why you can't really in opera, back off the sound because everything is measured.  The orchestra has soft sounds, medium sounds, loud sounds and the voice is twenty feet up stage and it's on a raised stage and it has to cut into a 3,000 seat house, you can't back off.  That's like saying a running, a running back decides to get cute when a 4- a 2- 350 pound lineman running for 3 or 4 force coming at him full throttle, he has to square his body and be able to take the punishment because he would, he would take a loss.  He's gotta move forward rack yardage.  So sound is the same way.  It's the same kind of force inside of a house.  So we can't work with dialect, especially in opera.  Now if you singing pop, you can back off the voice and create lighter sounds and become more jazz, more gospel, more pop, and crossover--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --because you have a mic which amplifies the sound.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But in opera, at the top upp--echelons of the game, that 3,000 seat houses you have no body mic, you must pump, support the sound, hit the exit sound and be heard at all times, if not, you're out of work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 116827
Speaker 1: So then, then I take it that no one language would be any more difficult than another in this, in trying to--
Speaker 2: They're different in terms of making the sounds but what makes them extraordinarily difficult is convincing the French person that you sound French but you also act French and you're able to make them feel as if they're French culture is being a hit, being, paid, paid attention to it, according to the traditions of performing that character.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, part of your classical training as a, as a star opera would be drama then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you really have to pay attention and observe the culture because you have to bring their culture idiosyncrasies, and even though you're not, even though you're not French you have to find what those things are in the script.  What the funnies are.  Are the funnies in a joke form or are the funnies in the actual way in which you sing the word.  What do you do when you sing the word physically?  Do you do anything at all?  Is it a, is it, is it traditionally a word that's synonymous with something sacred but in the opera it comes off as something secular but the people who are French know that it is derived from something sacred and you're not aware that its actually derived from something sacred and you just play off the funny.  How do you play off the funny and realize it is sacred and then let them know that I know this is derived from something sacred and they go "Oh, you've studied.  You know the French way."  Those tiny little subtle, subtleties have a lot more to do with respecting other people's cultures, and therefore they're transferred in the operatic realm when you're working as an artist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then they pay attention, they say, "Oh, you're not just singing."
Story_ID: 113787
Speaker 1: You were saying just now, off camera, that the, the meat is in the spaces.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the spaces.  It's in the, see the text gives you the map but doesn't tell you the terrain.  And the terrain is the pauses, the periods, the question marks, the exclamation points, the spaces between words.  There are also spaces in music too where you take a rest and you don't sing but just because you don't sing doesn't mean you're not making any music.  In other words, eighty percent of communication is nonverbal.  What do you do with the eighty percent in those pauses?  The words are the other twenty percent.  Those pauses are where the eighty percent lives, it's nonverbal.  So you can become physical or you can be quiet or you can be observant in those spaces or you can force people to actually slow down in the moment and go "I'm not going to sing the next word, even though you're gonna hear sound, I'm going to force you to deal with your emotions about this person's humanity."
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And that's more about acting and being observant about human, than human nature about how people hide the truth.  Those pauses about, they're about discovering the truth is what it is and what it's not.  That's why I keep that phrase in front of me, because that's where music is made, it is in the nonverbal world, eighty percent of it is nonverbal and you have to be artistic in that world, you can't just be technically sound.  You have to take chances.
Speaker 1: Now, I was reading some of the reviews of your work and that of your wife [HM Alfreda Burke]--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --and some reviews were discussing the eye contact and the facial expressions.  And I was just thinking, this going back to you singing "My Way" by Frank Sinatra--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --who's a, he's, he's known for his phrasing yeah, you know, and his pauses and his (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 113788
Speaker 1: Did, did you, what, what, what was your first formal training I guess in, in phrasing and in interpreting a song?
Speaker 2: It was something that my parents [Dorothy Jean Black Dixon and Samuel Edward Dixon] were doing, and my father sometimes would talk about it but as far as I can remember, it had something to do with the divine intervention.  He would always say that.  And, of course, my, and my mother was always divine, (laughter) you know.  So that terminology would always follow me every time I walked into a musical environment.  Where is the divine intervention?  So I developed a sense of this because I, this is the paradox for me right now.  As a classical, operatically trained artist, I am taught to sing legato at all times because that's the, that is the way in which one can actually be heard past an orchestra because once that, people in the house hear your sound, you don't want your sound to stop, you want it to continue to carry in the hall because you have many different instruments with many different colors coming and girding up, girding the sound as it moves forward into a house if you're singing acoustically and you're singing classical repertoire in a foreign language.
Speaker 1: And just, just for the record "legato" means?
Speaker 2: Legato means a continuous sound that doesn't stop.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Just straight line of sound that just doesn't stop.  You can do this, this would not be legato: ah-ah-ah-ah, those are just different notes with spaces in between.  (Singing) just continuous sound.  And that sound travels.  And once people hear your voice they can distinguish it from all the other seventy instruments if they're all playing at the same time, or pockets of instruments that are playing at the same time, strings or woodwinds, so forth and so on.  We're taught to sing legato because we wanna have a legato line in all the languages in classical music because that's the essence of beautiful singing.  Round sound, supported sound, with the body under the sound, the diaphragm, sing legato.  But what I've discovered, and which is what my father would talk about, is that the divine intervention, you say well that's nice if you wanna be technical, but if you wanna move people, you have to figure out where the pauses are.  And you can't sing all the notes because if you're speaking to people in English, you don't have to sing legato to move them, you just have to move them.  So you take pauses, you think more like an actor.  You, you, you find in a line like, 'Somewhere' [from "West Side Story" by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim] that I sing in "Hallelujah Broadway".  He sings a line, (singing) "There's a place (pauses) for us," but that's not legato, you took a break and there's no legato line.  But for the camera, that's special because the camera captures the gleam of the eye.  Opera singers will do this, (singing) "There's a place for us, somewhere a-" that's the operatic tradition of singing sounds and creating of a legato line.  But (singing) "There's (pause) a place for us," and that's the paradox because the more you become keen on the eighty percent which is nonverbal and you learn that from the English side of your artistic gifts, then you have to then transfer pauses and pregnant pauses and lift pauses in classical music, which is a slight lift of silence into the next line, into the classical tradition then you have to hide it and be very careful 'cause you still have to sing legato but you have to break up where you're gonna not sing legato to become more influential in the moment to move people.  And that's where you have to be very artistic with the European side and their traditions and, and, and connect your artistic growth as a human being moving people as an artist in whatever you do, whether it be classical, jazz, blues, or gospel.  And that's where the geniuses live.  They live in the pockets of silence.  They move space where there's nothing going around, and then reformulate their idea in such a way to get you the pitch emotionally or mentally, one way of the other, and then they get you to open up.  And all of a sudden you become engrossed in the moment artistically.  And that's what my father calls the divine intervention.  And that's the paradox, technique against the organic.  But the organic is technical because it's like jazz, its improvisation.  You don't know where you're going but you know that whatever you're doing matters.  Technique means everything is planned, it matters because it's planned and it's serious.  But somewhere in the middle, there has to be moving people and that's the divine intervention of marrying the two.  So for me, we spent a lot of time accepting that I'm no longer calling it breaking the rules, I'm just calling it being a mature musician who's serious about trying to take the moment to the next human level of experience.
Story_ID: 113789
Speaker 1: Now, when did you first think of yourself as a crossover artist or do you think that's even (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I, that's perfect--that's a, that's a perfect way to say what it is that we're doing.  What we are when you say crossover artists is commercial, it's a commercial term because it's, it's not really acceptable in serious classical music, because there's no such thing as crossover in classical music, either you're, you're excellent in what it is you do in terms of playing an instrument or singing classical music because classical music is the epitome of music language.  It is where the language comes from.  We all use the same symbols globally from classical music language.  Guido's hand [Guidonian hand] seventh century [sic, eleventh century], you know, theory the third the minor third or the major third when the English and Reformation, when the two churches split up in 1595 [sic, 1534], the English went up and started the Protestant Church [Church of England], the Romans stayed down here, they had open fifths, open octaves, English added the third or the minor third, that is all classically derived.  And so our sense, our sense of notation G clefts, treble clefts, lines, flats, sharps, come from a European backdrop of what, how we define music on paper.  Having said that we are now, for me, as a crossover artist, I've had to marry the genius of Americana historically into the global conversation of music.  The [HM] Quincy Joneses, the Dizzy Gillespies, the Duke Ellingtons, the Nat [King] Coles, you know.  Nat, [Robert] Nathaniel Dett, you know, Tommy A. Dorsey [Thomas Andrew Dorsey], you know, Paul Robeson.  I had my mother's [Dorothy Jean Black Dixon] sound, my father [Samuel Edward Dixon], I had to marry that genius into a classical context and say, "Move over, I need some space here, I need to roll with the Lord.  I need to move with God divine intervention with me when I'm singing German, Italian, or French," and that's where it gets a little strange because now conductors and directors will say, "Wait a minute, that's what I've been waiting for," somebody to break the rules but they're not really being broken.  It's just a maturation of maturity and artistic force.  So for me, a classical crossover artist is a commercial term that only defines how I'm being defined when I'm crossing over singing the other genres but I'm using the same skill sets in the other genres I would use in Europe in classical music visa versa, because I'm actually maturate, I'm, I'm bringing together all the different things of the, that I've learned, tricks of the trade about pregnant pauses.  Take some time, give people some time to process what you just gave them, you know.  Don't sing all the notes.  Some notes are not sung.  You hear its audible sound but it doesn't mean that you engage the process "I'm singing now.  Don't you hear I'm singing.  This is important, you should sit down and listen."  Well, the masters in classical music didn't write all the notes.  There are some notes they left out of "La boheme" [by Giacomo Puccini], that's why it's a masterpiece.  They left some notes out of "Carmen" [by Georges Bizet] that's why it's a masterpiece.  They didn't write all the notes, they knew where the drama in the theater were, and they were actually crossing the human dilemma of theater and drama into a classical context, and moving people with beautiful melodies and motives like [Giuseppi] Verdi, Puccini, and [Richard] Wagner were doing.  But we're doing the same thing in crossover terms with gospel, blues, jazz, rock and roll, pop, and in folk music.  But the masters, doesn't make a difference what they're working with, as long as they got their hands in the middle and they're being artistic with it.  They don't let the different enclaves of each specific genre and all this idiosyncrasies about how one functions as this labeled artist classical or this crossover artist, when genius gets in the room, game begots game.  That's what I learned about [Leonard] Bernstein and that statement, it's about moving people.  But you have to be technically sound, you have to know your stuff to work in the industry.  And when you crossover as a classical artist into classical music, there are certain things you have to adhere to and pay attention to and be proficient in and deliver 'cause they have expectations just as well as if you crossover in bebop and jazz and swinging jazz.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: They have they're technical things that they're listening for.  But when you marry the two, everybody gets out the room and gets out of your way and say, "I don't know what to do with you."
Story_ID: 113790
Speaker 1: It's interesting I guess, [Leonard] Bernstein would be considered like a crossover artist, himself--
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Speaker 1: --as well as [HM] Quincy Jones and John Williams.
Speaker 2: There you go.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: That's what I'm talking about and that's what I ran into.  That's what I ran into.  The truth of what it is and what it's not.  'Cause the and what is not, is all technical.  That's technical truth.  But the truth is, "Well, you studied but can you move people."  That's not the truth.  The truth is you should be able to move people but you're not, you're just technically sound.  And then people decide to like your work simply because you moved them because they don't know what's going on technically, that's your job.  But how do you mask it?  So Bernstein wrote "West Side Story," and they said "Well, why did you write that?"  "Well, because it was in me.  What do you want me to do, fake it?  That's the truth."  "Well, that's not the truth, you're a serious artist."  "Well, yeah I am a serious artist as a conductor and composer and I, the New York Philharmonic in 1950, you know, I understand but the truth is also that it was in me, I wrote it."  So Broadway rewarded him with one Tony.  And then the Oscars gave him ten Oscars [sic, "West Side Story" won ten Oscars, but none of them went to Bernstein].  That was all political.  He was our--[HM] Quincy Jones and him were alike and John Williams, they're, they're crossover artists at the, at the highest levels of, of classical antiquity.  Not in terms of European definition but those of us who strive to be around genius.  Classical antiquity in terms of those definitions.  That's not about getting it right.  That's just about being in the room whatever happens is right.  You, you eating all of that, you're processing all of that, you're just going whatever you're doing, it's moving me and its 'causing my humanity to lift, to rise, and I'm starting, the light bulbs are cutting on.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And so that's why crossover word is an interesting word because it's used in commercial terms but the serious artist, no one in the room with serious artists.  They stop using labels and just start saying, "What are you doing?  Why don't you just do that some more and we'll just sit back and watch."  And then the conductor will say, "I know you sing crossover music but there's something about you in the moment I just, I want my baton on that.  I wanna conduct all of that."  That's what crossover artistry really is all about.  It's bringing together the technical with the organic.  And it looks like you're breaking the rules but the truth is you're discovering all the new realms that exist in the spaces and you're artistic with that.  That would be my definition of what I am.
Story_ID: 113791
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now let's, we'll go back to the chronology here--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and get a, you're at the Lyric Opera [Lyric Opera of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois] now?
Speaker 2: I'm at Lyric.
Speaker 1: You, you were talking about how you came to the Lyric and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bright Sheng, Fontainebleau [France], five songs for tenor in piano in Chinese at the Jeu de Paume Hall in at Fontainebleau at the Napoleon's Court Chateau '87 [1987].  Bright runs into me on Fifth Avenue [New York City, New York], I audition.  I come to Lyric for the finals, there are thirty-six singers, there are nine slots, and out of the nine slots there are two tenor slots available.  I sing a piece of Bright Sheng's "Song of My Majnun" or (different pronunciation) Majnun.  I ran it, I ran into Andrew Foldi who was the head of the program at the time in 1991 in New York.  I sang for Andrew Foldi who ran the, the Lyric Opera Center for American Artists [now The Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center], who had auditions at the Wellington Hotel on 7th Avenue in New York.  I sang five arias.  I think I sang 'Che gelida manina' [from "La boheme" by Giacomo Puccini], 'Un'aura amorosa' [from "Cosi fan tutte" by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart], 'Una furtiva lagrima' [from "L'elisir d'amore" by Gaetano Donizetti], 'There's a Boat That's Leavin' Soon [for New York]' from "Porgy and Bess" [by George Gershwin] and I sang something else, I think it was 'D'ogni piu sacro impegno' [from "L'occasione fa il ladro"], where [Gioachino] Rossini aria.  And then he handed me Bright's music, and he didn't know that I knew Bright, this is '91 [1991] but I knew the story about them doing the opera.  And he sent me to the finals in September of '91 [1991], 36 singers, 2 slots left for 2 tenors out of 9 slots, and they had a division, ensemble and apprentice.  And so there I was at Lyric Opera with Ardis Krainik who was the general director at the time, and Andrew Foldi who was running the Young Artist Program at, at young artists, the Lyric Center of American Artists [sic, Lyric Opera Center for American Artists].  So it's a weekend, I'm at the Bismarck Hotel [now the Hotel Allegro in Chicago, Illinois].  I'm working with the coaches and, and all the people at Lyric Opera that weekend, and all of us coming to town.  And I had Bright's music, so, you know, I knew it.  I knew Bright's music cold.  It was in Chinese, I had about five or six pages cold, I knew it.  Plus my "D'ogni piu sacro impegno" aria from Rossini.  We get to the actual day of finals where we're all singing to get into this program, 9 slots, 36 singers, somebody's going home.  I'm in Chicago and I live in New York [New York City, New York].  Well, the tenors, there were 17 tenors, remember there's only 2 slots, 17 tenors.  They all had backgrounds like me.  Everybody came from big prestigious pertis--, prestigious universities and college and music programs, major vocal studios or major teachers highly connected the, they had training like I did.  There was no slouches in this group of thirty-six singers.  This is one of the top programs in the country with the Metropolitan Opera House Young Artists Program [now the Lindemann Young Artist Development Program in New York City, New York], Lyric Opera of Chicago Young Artist Program and then every, Houston Grand Opera [Young Artists Vocal Academy in Houston, Texas].  But Lyric is at the top, top.  So we get to the auditions at the opera house main stage, and the tenors were all, they all had the music but they weren't taking it seriously because it wasn't standard operatic repertoire.  It was an offshoot opera and they wanted to hear, they were looking for a tenor to sing the role, this, and also put into the Young Artist Program to sing into the regular season of the opera responsibilities, 'cause that's what the program does, you train and then you cover big stars.  But they had this opera they were premiering.  And so the lady comes to me she says well, one of the tenors doesn't wanna go on early would you like to be moved up?  I said sure.  Because I knew I could get out the gate early and set the standard on Bright's music, 'cause I had sung it before and I knew that they didn't take it seriously because it wasn't standard operatic repertoire.  They were going to Lyric Opera, "I don't do-- sing Chinese music.  It's not standard up operatic repertoire, this is not important."  That was the consensus I heard from some of the guys at the time.  But I knew if I got out early, I would put a lot of pressure on the rest of the field of tenors.  And sho' nuff, I got out on the stage, I had the stand in front of me, I took off.  I sang the "D'ogni piu sacro impegno" with all these high D's and C's.  That went great.  Then they said we would like to hear "Song of Majnun" will you have the excerpted prepared for the audition, you know, this is, this is Ardis Krainik we would like to hear "Songs of Majnun," you know.  I said sure.  Next thing I know I took off, I was no longer in front of the music stand, I was on the side of it and I was directly going after them.  And I was, I had it by memory, and the other guys, when I came up the stage they just looked at me and said "Well, how long did you," I only had it for two months.  Some of them had it for two weeks, three weeks and they really didn't really pay attention but I had it for two months 'cause I knew Bright and I knew this was my moment.  And I had the, I wanted to honor him.  So I sang that Chinese piece and it was in passaggio, all these F's and G's, and F's and G's, and it was very difficult but I sang this piece.  And so that night at the finals when they went in the green room at Lyric Opera Chicago they read the names, my name was called as one of the top tiers, as one of the two tenors, my name was called, out of thirty-six people, seventeen tenors, my name was called, Rodrick Dixon as an ensemble.  And I got the role.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: "The Song of Majnun" just like Bright had talked to me about on Fifth Avenue in '91 [1991] when he saw me.  "Who knows?  Audition you might get it, you might even get the role."
Story_ID: 113792
Speaker 1: Two things, first of all how do you spell [Sheng] Bright's name to make sure we get it?
Speaker 2: B-R-I-G-H-T.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Sheng.  I wanna say, it was actually Sheng but it's, S-H-E-N, Bright Shen [sic, S-H-E-N-G].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So and the second thing, I'm just so curious as to how Chinese sounds in the operatic context.  Can you sing any, any of it?
Speaker 2: I don't remember "Songs of Majnun" [by Bright Sheng] at all.  I mean this was 1992.  I don't remember any "Songs of Majnun".
Speaker 1: Oh, but I didn't wanna be unfair but I (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: That's okay.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I'm just, I just, I just don't have any--
Speaker 1: Curious about that.
Speaker 2: I don't have any recollection of it in Chinese at the moment.  I just don't have any recollection of any of the melodies right now.  And not even in, I don't even have any, any memory of the five songs in Chinese for tenor and piano from France 'cause that was '87 [1987].
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: So this is, I've sung so much music since then, you know.  But if I had known, I would have tried to, to get something (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: No, no problem.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I just, I just, it just (unclear) seem like something that I would, you know.  Never would have--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's interesting.
Speaker 1: Never heard it before, to my knowledge so.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Umm.
Speaker 2: Sounds like spiritual stuff.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: The Chinese music, and they're so spiritual, like our spirituals, they sing just like we sing our spirituals, yeah.  Emotionally deep.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, 1991, you're with Lyric Opera [Center for American Artists, now The Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center, part of the Lyric Opera of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: "Song of Majnun."  I'm the, I'm in the title role, Colin Graham is the director, Bill, William Buckley [sic, Richard Buckley] is the conductor.  We were at the old Civic Theatre next to the Lyric Opera House [the Civic Opera House of the Lyric Opera of Chicago].  And it premiers [on April 9, 1992] and I, I receive rave reviews.  It was a, a great moment for me.  Dr. [Charles] Kaufman came from New York [New York City, New York] to see it.  And, and the opera house had taken me in under its wings and I studied there and performed, you know, six, seven, different roles.  Performed in the summer time at Grant Park [Chicago, Illinois].  And we also performed at the Chatelet [Theatre du Chatelet in Paris, France] in France as one of the four singers who went to do a slew of concerts at the theater in France, Paris, France during that period in '92 [1992], '93 [1993].
Story_ID: 113793
Speaker 1: Can you give us a, I guess a sense of the opera singing in Chicago [Illinois]?  With, you, you had the Lyric [Lyric Opera of Chicago] and you also have the Civic Opera and-- right?
Speaker 2: Yeah at the, at the, the building itself, the Lyric Opera of Chicago building had the Civic Opera [sic, Civic Theatre] right next door, a smaller theater that held I think 1200, 900, 1200 seats, something like that.  And at that time, you know, Lyric Opera was operating in the black, Ardis Krainik was one of the great impresarios of the opera business, not only artistically but also in terms of financially.  They were, this, this-- Chicago supports its classical institutions very well.  Back in the early '90s [1990s] with Ardis, the sponsorship level was up, donors were up, Chicago was right there with the Met [The Metropolitan Opera in New York City, New York] in terms of importance of opera in America.  It's the, it, it, you know, you have the Met operating budget I think today, 2013, I think it's $247 million a year annually.  Lyric Opera I think, an operating budget, I think, its $87 million somewhere around there, 86, 87 million dollars.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And so Chicago was, is a very important operatic scene in terms of opera but always so in terms, terms of the symphony because Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Georg Solti and then Daniel Barenboim and now Riccardo Muti, you know, it's, it's, it's an international city in the classical music business that has importance.  You don't have a career unless you come to Chicago, period.  Your top five orchestras include the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra [Cleveland, Ohio], New York Philharmonic [New York City, New York], Boston [Symphony Orchestra in Boston, Massachusetts], and then I think Philadelphia [Philadelphia Orchestra in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and you, you, you can't have a classical unless you go through those guys, and you can't have an operatic career unless you go through Chicago Lyric or you go to the Met.  Usually they either go to Lyric first, and then go to the Met, or they'll go to the Met first, then come to Lyric, but those are your two big, they're, they're like the [New York] Yankees and the [Los Angeles] Dodgers, you know.  And so Chicago has that, that, that legacy of importance to the industry but it also has the, the importance to the music scene globally.  And then, of course, you have Ravinia [Ravinia Festival, Highland Park, Illinois], which is the home, Chicago Symphony summer home.  And so Lyric Opera [Lyric Opera Center for American Artists, now The Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center, part of the Lyric Opera of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois] at that time, was my first professional operatic contract, gig, training ground, and I was in one of the top two programs in the country.
Story_ID: 113794
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean is it, I don't wanna get into your personal income and that sort of thing but, but like what is it--
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't mind.
Speaker 1: --in, in terms of like what, what does it pay in terms of the--
Speaker 2: $15,000 a year.  That's what I earned [at the Lyric Opera Center for American Artists, now The Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center, part of the Lyric Opera of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois].  I moved from New York [New York City, New York] at the time, I was only earning $15,000 a year in 1992.  That's all I earned.  And at the time, when I took the, the, the contract the offer to come join the program and study here in '92 [1992], I was also offered an opportunity to sing "Porgy and Bess" in South America and I could have made anywhere in excess of $80,000 but I took the $15,000 job because what's the sense of going to Mannes [Mannes College of Music, now The Mannes School of Music at The New School, New York City, New York] for seven years, get all that training, go to Europe for a couple of summers and then turn around and then turn down Lyric Opera [of] Chicago over money when you really need that next level of seasoning, of experience, which is like a Ph.D. program, a doctorate degree to go a program there that's really what it is.
Speaker 1: Or a post doctorate (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Post doc, yeah that's what it is.  I mean that's what, and, you know, after conservatory, the honors program at the Met [The Metropolitan Opera in New York City, New York] or Lyric Opera, it's a P- it's a doctorate program.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Because you're getting on the hand training at the international level operatically.  That's really what it is.  So it was important, again the technical won out, the organic would say "take the money," no but why spend eight years doing the Mannes thing, going to Europe, and then turn around and say well I'm gonna go sing "Porgy and Bess" because it's a chance to travel and go to South America.  And so the night I received the contract from Lyric I called the people at Norfolk, Virginia, Virginia Opera and told them I would turn down their offer to sing Sportin' Life in South America.  And I turned down a sizable income to make $15,000 a year to study here in Chicago.
Story_ID: 113795
Speaker 1: Here you're at the Lyric [the Lyric Opera Center for American Artists, now The Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center, part of the Lyric Opera of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois], $15,000 a year- dollar a year job.  But you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This, this is the Ph.D., right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is the pinnacle.  This is, you're either go to the, the Young Artist Program [now the Lindemann Young Artist Development Program] at the Met [The Metropolitan Opera in New York City, New York] or you're at Lyric.  I mean this is, and everybody in New York [New York City, New York] knew that I, I had gotten in.  You know, it was a buzz, you know, "Mannes [Mannes College of Music, now The Mannes School of Music at The New School, New York City, New York] had a young tenor who is in the Young Artist Program at Lyric Opera" and by the way, before I went to sing at the finals here at Lyric Opera in Chicago, the Met made me come in and sing for them.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: I thought that, at the time I didn't understand that.  They just said we just want you to come in and sing for us and to-- And, and I sang I think 'Un'aura amorosa' from "Cosi fan tutte" [by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart].  And I think I may have sang 'Che gelida manina' from "La boheme" [by Giacomo Puccini].  I think that's what I sang.  And I don't know why they called me in to sing 'cause I was going to Lyric Opera, I was going to Chicago.  And I had a sense about that.  But I'm there at Lyric, I'm studying, I sang the song of "Majnun", I do all my work, "Don Quichotte" [by Jules Massenet] with Sam Ramey [Samuel Ramey].  Kimberly Jones was in the program [the Lyric Opera Center for American Artists, now The Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center, part of the Lyric Opera of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois] at the time, this young soprano.  And Mark Doss came through, he used to be in the program and he was a barot--, bass-baritone.  And there was Donnie Ray Albert who was a, a baritone, bass-baritone.  And then I heard about this soprano who used to cover for and sing at the Met as well for Kathleen Battle, I can't think of her name.  There were some African Americans who were there, and then I met another African American who used to be in the program Bonita Hyman used to be in the program and sing there.  And so, there were some African Americans at the time that I aware of that was there prior to me coming in the '92 [1992], '93 [1993], '94 [1994] period.  And there were some that were there with me like Kim, who went, who would be singing together at Chatelet [Theatre du Chatelet in Paris, France] from the Young Artists Program in '94 [1994].  And that was great training, there's nothing like being in a 3,000 seat house with no mic and learning how to sing past a big old seventy piece orchestra in a international house.  Bruno Bartoletti was the conductor.  You know, I'd worked with [Richard] Buckley like I said.  I worked with Rockwell Blake, Chris Merritt, Dolora Zajick.  Who else, I thought was interesting, Susan Mentzer and Sam Ramey.  Zubin Mehta made a comment about me in "Il trovatore," [by Giuseppe Verdi] there's a famous entrance where I have to come through the door and I have to feel the down beat as I'm coming through the door and the conductors twenty feet away and he said, "I don't know how that kid did it."  I mean I was spot, spot, but I had a sense of the may trick, matrix in the moment, I just, I always know where the moment is on the stage.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And that's something organic.  I don't know where I learned that but coming to a door and trying to find a conductor's baton in the dark twenty feet away, down in a pit, and you're up ten feet coming through a door with some stairs and trying to hit a down beat in "Il trovatore" is a nightmare but I found a way to do it, I just, I knew where it was.  But I was training.  And that was good for me.  And then it came a reality check.  My time was up and I had to move on and go out and have a professional career.
Speaker 1: So, so you were there from '91 [1991] to--
Speaker 2: Basically--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: '9-, January of 1992--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --to the spring of 1994.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, this is at the Lyric, and so this program is finished at this point.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Story_ID: 113796
Speaker 1: And so, so what, what were your options?
Speaker 2: Well, I received an opportunity to sing "Les Contes d'Hoffmann" [by Jules Offenbach] in one or two performances at Portland Opera [Portland, Oregon] the following year in 1995.  I then had to find a way to subsidize my income and make a living, so I applied for a substitute teachers job at the city, Board of Ed, Board of Education of Chicago [Illinois] here in the City of Chicago at 26th and where the old Board of Ed building is on 26th and California.
Speaker 1: So as a sub in a public school?
Speaker 2: Sub at the public school, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I taught regular English sub there, as English, math.  I actually ended up working for a school that did, they had, they worked with behavior disorder children.  I was involved in a program where they did restraint.  So we would teach and if the kids had emotional problems we would have to, you know, we were taught techniques and get them into the isolation booth and then we would have to calm 'em down and, and these were kids who were, who were not mainstream kids.  There were, they had, they were BD, emotionally disturbed kids, who were not mainstream, they were in this program and I was teaching there.  So I was in that too as well for about a year, in the year '8-, '95 [1995]--
Speaker 1: Well, this seems like as good as work as any in a lot of ways but at the same time it seems like a waste of talent, you know, in a, in a way that you would but you're not (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Pursuing your talent full time.
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't pursuing my talent full time, it was just the reality of having a career.  You're gonna have ups and downs, ebbs and flows, and after all I'm an African American tenor, I'm in Chicago [Illinois], I've done my time.  I went out to Portland, had my opportunity to sing, "Contes Hoffmann," ["Les Contes d'Hoffmann"] I sang Hoffmman, but I still had to, I had to live the other 365 days a year in between getting work.  Didn't have management at the time.  And management was all, all of them were back in New York [New York City, New York], and so it was a period where that's what I had to do.  Now oddly enough, I did participate in a workshop of a new opera at Lyric [Lyric Opera of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois] during that time for about a couple of weeks.  It made some money, sing this opera "Amistad" [by Anthony Davis] that premiered there [1997] while the movie "Amistad" was coming out in the theaters.  And I really wanted to do that.  And that's when I first heard of Mr. Thomas Young, one of the tenors.  I saw the piece of music written for him, I did the workshop in '95 [1995], it was fantastic and I wanted to cover Thomas in that.  But then [HM] Alfreda [Burke] and I auditioned for "Show Boat" [by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein, II] at the Auditorium Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] at the same time.  And we were hired.
Story_ID: 113797
Speaker 1: Now, wait a minute.  Now we've gotta go to where you met [HM] Alfreda [Burke].
Speaker 2: I met Alfreda at Lyric Opera Chicago [the Lyric Opera Center for American Artists, now The Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center, part of the Lyric Opera of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  What, what year?
Speaker 2: In '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: In '92 [1992], okay.  Now, we gotta back to '92 [1992].
Speaker 2: Through a friend.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: So, in '92 [1992] I meet Alfreda.  We start dating January 1, 1993 was a twelve-hour date.  We went to movies, we talked but we met through a friend--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: --who, Stephen Powell, who was also a part of the young artist program, was a pianist here in town and he had joined the program, he had gotten in and he knew Alfreda and so he was putting together these little Christmas party groups.  And so we did a couple of gigs in like '94 [1994], '90 [1990], actually in '92 [1992] in December.  So I sang, and we just had a, and so our, so Steve asked Alfreda and I in December of 1992, would y'all sing "Oh, Holy Night" at one of these Christmas gigs.  And so we did, and I didn't think anything about it at the time.  And then, and then Steve said, "Well, I gotta go down to the opera house, I'm on tonight Rodrick I got, you know, so Alfreda can you give Rodrick a ride home?"  So she did.  And so we got to talking and next thing I know her father was an (unclear) minister and my father was a minister, and she played the Hammond organ and piano and I played the Hammond organ and piano and she had her degrees from Roosevelt University [Chicago Musical College, now the Music Conservatory of the Chicago College of Performing Arts in Chicago, Illinois] and I had my degrees from Mannes College of Music [now The Mannes School of Music at The New School, New York City, New York] and we had one child a piece from a previous marriage and, and we had so much in common.  And so she invited me to her church.  So it was Christmas and we had decided that we would go out on a date.  So I went back home to see my parents [Dorothy Jean Black Dixon and Samuel Edward Dixon] that December and I said, "Ma, I met a, a nice young lady in Chicago" and, you know, and she said, "Well that's nice.  You, you go do that."  So, Alfreda and I went on that date in '93 [1993] in January, twelve hours.  I went to her church and I met her parents and I said "Ma," and she said, "This is good for you.  This is, this is real good for you."  And she hadn't met Alfreda yet.  So Alfreda and I started dating January 1, 1993.  And so '94 [1994] I'm in the program, '95 [1995] I'm out of the program, I'm substitute teaching, we're dating, we both talk about auditioning for "Show Boat" [by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein, II] who was coming to town, she convinced me to do it.  I do it.  Next thing I know we're hired and then in spring of 1996 we open up "Show Boat" together and we're performing in that production at the Auditorium Theatre by Harold Prince, and we get engaged in '96 [1996].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 113798
Speaker 1: And sometime in the late part of '96 [1996], around September, I received an opportunity to join the cast of "Ragtime" [by Terrence McNally, Lynn Ahrens, and Stephen Flaherty] in Toronto [Ontario, Canada] and I left [HM] Alfreda [Burke] here, so her son Dean [Perrin, Jr.] joined the cast.  The next day I left to go to Toronto on September 7th, and I'm in Toronto doing "Ragtime", so Dean now is getting his equity card, her son from her first marriage is now a part of the cast and Alfreda's here--
Speaker 2: Of, of "Show Boat" [by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein, II]?
Speaker 1: Of "Show Boat".
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I'm driving on Sunday nights, eight hours on Sunday nights from 5 o'clock to about 2 o'clock in the morning to sit with her all day on Mondays to court, and then I'd drive back on Tuesdays in the mornings from like 6 in the morning to 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoons to go to, to go back to work to do eight shows a week from Tuesday through Sunday while she's doing eight shows a weeks from Tuesday to Sundays in Chicago, because we were engaged and I just didn't want the family and church members to think that I was some guy on the road living this hectic lifestyle that was not becoming of good Christian behavior.  And so I, I'd drive, two or three times a month, come back and date on Mondays and sit at her parents' [Mamie Lewis Burke and John H. Burke, Jr.'s] house.  We'd go to the movies and we'd spend time with Dean and then I had my son Jared [Dixon] from my first marriage and, and we courted for five years, from '93 [1993] to '98 [1998].  And in between that time was "Show Boat" and "Ragtime".
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so that's what I, that was my pilgrimage.  Eight shows a weak in Toronto for a year, while she's doing "Show Boat", and then I would go down and see her at the Kennedy Center [John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C.] when she was doing "Show Boat" there, and then we were married in January of 1998 on a Monday night, 'cause "Ragtime" was opening on January 18, we were married January the 12, because the person that was covering me in "Ragtime" in Toronto was unable to facilitate during my track, so I had to do all the preview performances and they wouldn't let me out of my contract to get married on a Sunday which was, we were supposed to get married on the 11th in Chicago.  So I had to get married on a Monday night at First Mennonite [First Mennonite Church] here in Chicago.  Then Alfreda and I went back to New York the next day to finish previews for "Ragtime" which were opening the following Sunday at the Ford Center for Performing Arts on Broadway [now the Lyric Theatre in New York, New York], and that's how I got my Broadway credit.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Doing eight shows a week.  This is still away from the operatic scene.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Which--
Speaker 2: Umm--
Speaker 1: --pushed me into the crossover conversation, commercially.
Speaker 2: All right.  So, I take it your, your son [Jared Dixon] lived with your, your--
Speaker 1: My ex-wife at the time
Speaker 2: --Ex-wife.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 113799
Speaker 1: So what you describe is a, a lot of driving and a lot of movement and a lot of performance--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --which raises the question of, I don't know if this is the right time to raise this, but the question of stamina, you know, you, you were athlete but, but singing and performing is physically demanding.
Speaker 2: Well, that's interesting because the, the, the miss-- I'm gonna say it this way, the conventional wisdom was at play that opera singers can't sing eight shows a week, let alone move on stage because we're not trained to function that way.  We sing two operas a week and rest the voice because it's all about getting the, the, the very essence of the beauty of the sound at its peak.  So you don't try to sing two or three times a week doesn't, and then, then also you're, you're a human amplifier and the body can only take but so much trying to project over a full orchestra and a 3,000 seat, on average, 2,500 seat house in America.  These are barns.  Broadway are usually in, you know, 1,400 to 1,800 seat houses with body mics on and they project the voice and you don't have to sing as much out, because you sing as much in terms of projecting, projecting the sound because it's amplified electronically but it's still eight shows a week.  And when you put in, like you said, the driving and the courting, that's all I ever knew, that was the right thing to do.  And I wanted to honor our relationship and honor our plans so that was the work that had to be put in.  I had to come back and see her, and spend time with her and yet perform eight shows a week.  And she was doing the same thing in Chicago.  So, but the misnomer is that because you sing eight shows a week and you're playing in church on Sunday and you're, and you're singing this Broadway music, now you're messing up your classical technique.  That's not true.  If anything, all the singers in the early part of the twentieth century were going back and forth between classical and Broadway anywhere in America, in New York City, prior to the 1950s.  You had Tin Pan Alley, you had Vaudeville, singers who were classically trained, and quite frankly, African Americans who did not have opportunities for singing anything they could sing in the early part of the twentieth century but and if they were good, they'd get hired but you had to do what you, you had to do what you had to do to make a living.  So this whole dividing after 1950, "This is Broadway, this is opera, and this is Lincoln Center [Lincoln center for the Performing Arts in New York City, New York], this is Broadway there are two entirely different things you can't do both."  Okay, I get it.  Which is what Leonard Bernstein made it difficult for both sides to coexist because he would sit in the middle of that conversation with the New York Philharmonic in the '50s [1950s] with "West Side Story," you know, "Candide."  "Why are you doing this?  We're supposed to be separating."  But all I'm saying is that African Americans singers for most of, what a hundred years or so, have always been crossing over to make a living.  So the stamina part was always in my DNA because that's all I ever knew.  Church on Sunday, baseball all the week, take the train up to Harlem [New York City, New York], sing, come back, run track, it's the same conversation.  So when I did the eight shows a week, it was normal to me.  It made sense because it was the New York lifestyle I grew up with.  I didn't know any better.
Speaker 1: Now, you said earlier, when, when I asked you what your favorite food was you said you liked fruit.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And do you have a dietary regimen that helps your voice stay, you know, flexible?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Fruit, I like to eat well before I perform but dietary regimen would be fruit, lots of water.  Try to stay away from the caffeine.  I love cheese on occasion.  But primarily eating healthy and just listening to my, my, my body on performance days.  And but for the most part, just trying to listen to my body every day now because I just wanna be comfortable and at peace.  And, you know, and be somewhat happy.  So, you know, that's my thing, is just staying consistent with eating good food, getting fruit, having some fruit during performances and keeping my sugar levels up and drinking lots of water and keeping my energy and really focus on what I wanna do that night artistically, vocally, and also artistically.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you do especially for your vocal cords?
Speaker 2: Just stay away from that caffeine.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what, what does caffeine do to your vocal cords?
Speaker 2: For me it, it dries me out and also I, I just I just don't feel good, you know what I mean.  I just, it just makes me a little nervous, a little twitchy, a little you know, I don't want, I don't wanna feel that, I wanna be (blowing air) so I can find the moment, lock in, and it's, and the moment comes not where you think it's gonna come.  It comes in the most interesting places, you know.  So for me that's my regimen is just being in tune to my body, fruit, water, eating good food that burns real well, and artistically attacking the room.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Story_ID: 113800
Speaker 1: So '98 [1998] you're, you're married now [to HM Alfreda Burke].
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: "Ragtime" [by Terrence McNally, Lynn Ahrens, and Stephen Flaherty] on Broadway [New York City, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Alfreda's here in Chicago [Illinois] doing ["Show Boat" by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein, II], just back from the Kennedy Center [John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Now, are you playing the lead in "Ragtime"?
Speaker 2: No, I'm in the ensemble.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Then you're, okay.
Speaker 2: I'm the ensemble.  Now this is the interesting part about this because I'm watching folks like Brian Stokes Mitchell, Audra McDonald, those guys work "Ragtime." I, I was just in the ensemble.  I'm dancing, getting my Broadway credit, watching them, watching all the other actors act and sing.  Watching the Broadway world.  That's what I observed, was watching how this Broadway world functioned, completely different from the opera side.  Eight shows a week and these triple threats who can dance and sing and act, watching them and I'm dancing and singing and I'm acting.  And, and, you know, I didn't expect to get into "Ragtime" I was, it was the farthest thing in my mind, I mean they came, and in '96 [1996] they came to get me because the director, the, the person who produced the show Live-Livent, Garth Drabinsky, was looking for a masculine guy to play one of the guys, Coalhouse Walker Jr.'s friends.  And my whole audition was about did I play sports.  He said, "I just wanna guy who just, you know, played sports."  You, I ran track, I played baseball, I played football.  And so he auditioned and put me in the cast.  I was the last person hired for that cast of "Ragtime."  And so in '97 [1997] Toronto [Ontario, Canada], New York [New York City, New York], Broadway there I am doing eight shows a week, and Alfreda is at the Kennedy Center 'cause I remember driving from New York down to Washington, D.C. on her night offs on Mondays to help her, so she can buy groceries.  We were married then, and she was at the Kennedy Center.
Story_ID: 113801
Speaker 1: So, I'm so, '98 [1998], from January to about June, I said, you know, "I gotta get back to Chicago [Illinois].  I've got to get back to Chicago."  So I approached the company in New York [New York City, New York] on Broadway, my parents [Dorothy Jean Black Dixon and Samuel Edward Dixon] and all the family came to see me in "Ragtime" [by Terrence McNally, Lynn Ahrens, and Stephen Flaherty] they loved it.  It was a great show.  And they said "Well, we have a opening for Booker T. Washington would you wanna read for that and come and join the Chicago company?"  I said, "Yeah.  I'll read for Booker T.  It was written for baritone, but that's okay, I'll read for it."  I got a lot of Booker T. in me anyway.  So I read, they gave it to me.  So they sent me back to Chicago.  So, now I'm back home with my wife [HM Alfreda Burke] and we're living here in Chicago on the West Side, you know, Southwest Side over there passed Palos [Heights, Illinois] and Oak Lawn [Illinois] and Worth [Illinois].  And, but then I got a phone call while I was here working on "Ragtime" for the opening of the Oriental Theatre downtown as playing Booker T. Washington as a main character.  Now, wait a minute.  No, I was covering Booker T. Washington, that's what it was.  But I end up paying, playing Booker T. Washington.  I went on for 6, 67 performances because the guy I was covering had to go play Coalhouse Walker, Jr. because Hinton Battle had gotten, was hurt as Coalhouse, so the Booker T. Washington had to go play him and I ended up playing sixty-seven performances as Booker T. Washington.  I was covering, that what's happened.  So I'm on stage playing Booker T. and I'm reading, doing the dialogue thing, great, wonderful, eight show a week, singing the baritone role which I could do, and I receive a call that summer of 1998 to join my colleagues, Victor Trent Cook and Thomas Young to form the Three Mo' Tenors.
Story_ID: 113802
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell, well, tell us about how this idea came about, the, the Three Mo' Tenors.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Three Mo' Tenors was an idea that was germinated and derived from a director by the name of Marion J. Caffey.  And the way I received the phone call was actually from my colleague, Victor Trent Cook, who just so happened to be a boy soprano at the Brooklyn Boys Chorus [at Long Island University in New York City, New York] in 1977.  Victor on that time was a big Broadway star.  We also went to Music and Art [The High School of Music and Art in New York City, New York, part of the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts] together during '80 [1980]- '84 [1984].  And our parents fellowshipped between the two churches in Brooklyn [New York City, New York] and Queens [New York City, New York], and Victor and I had a little group in our Music and Art High School.  So when Victor went on to Broadway, I went on to Mannes [Mannes College of Music, now The Mannes School of Music at The New School, New York City, New York], we split.  But our high school years together we were singing in the groups and singing around Brooklyn, Queens in gospel churches and, and I was doing the Harlem School of the Arts [New York City, New York] and the Music and Art thing and studying classical music and Victor was doing the Broadway thing.  He went on to do quite work, great work, you know, "Smokey Joe's Cafe" [by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller] and all of that.  He called me, he said, "Rodrick, there's this guy who's looking for tenor and I told him about you in Chicago."  I said "Okay, Trenty [ph.]", any time I get a chance to work with Victor, I know it's gone be a hot musical project 'cause the cat, you know, he's one of them cats, he's like Sammy Davis, Jr., you know, Victor's got an extraordinary gift in that regard.  So, then I heard the other name "Thomas Young," who that opera "Amistad" [by Anthony Davis] was written around at Lyric Opera [Lyric Opera of Chicago, Illinois] back in 1995, I did the workshop for.  So when I heard Thomas' name and then I knew about "Amistad" in '95 [1995] when I did the workshop at Lyric.  All this jazz, bebop, and swing and, and, he was also singing standard classical repertoire and standard operatic repertoire.  Victor said, "Thomas is in the room, I'm in the room, do you wanna come to New York and work with us?"  And so I come to New York, I do this workshop Marion, calls me in I sang, 'Ah! mes amis, quell jour de fete' [from "La fille du regiment" by Gaetano Donizetti] it's a French aria, and I sing 'Make Them Hear You' from "Ragtime" [by Terrence McNally, Lynn Ahrens, and Stephen Flaherty], then the group was formed, Three Mo' Tenors, November, September 1998 at the workshop in New York City.  And '99 [1999] they were trying to get the business together, and then I think in 2000, they called the three of us back to do these workshops in New York City.  And by this time, I still was doing, '99 [1999], '98 [1998] to '99 [1999], September, I was doing "Ragtime" here in Chicago at the Oriental Theatre playing Booker T. Washington and the Three Mo' Tenors thing started in 1998 to '99 [1999] and "Ragtime" was closing down.  I then go back to New York, I join the two guys.  We do a workshop in 2000 and then we landed on "My Favorite Broadway" in November of 2000 as the Three Mo' Tenors.  The next thing I know we had our own PBS special coming into 2001.
Story_ID: 113803
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now the Three More Tenors [sic, Three Mo' Tenors], of course, have to be compared with The Three Tenors.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Who was Pavarotti and (unclear)
Speaker 2: Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo, and Jose Carreras.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those were The Three Tenors at the time and they had started the whole Three Tenor commercial platform--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --crossing over, commercially.  And that's where Mr. Caffey [Marion J. Caffey] had the idea that he could, he can get three guys that can do that and do all this other stuff, the gospel, ju--, blues, jazz--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and other stuff.
Speaker 1: 'Cause that's not what The Three Tenors crossed over into, right?  They didn't crossover into black music necessarily, right, so?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, no, they didn't really.  What it, they crossed over, you know, Luciano Pavarotti was on the stage with James Brown, and, you know, Placido Domingo sang with Vanessa Williams and, you know.  And so, you know, the three of them would sing, you know, Broadway tunes and, you know, "The Sound of Music" and "Phantom of the Opera."  And, and, you know, they, they would do their thing, of course, and the famous arias they would split up and sing, you know, that kind of thing.  And so that was what they were doing and it went hugely popular and very successful in the early 1990s and sold out stadiums and went on to raise a lot of money for public broadcasting stations across the country, PBS.
Speaker 1: So, we were the African American version of that conversation but people thought we were imitating The Three Tenors.  It just so happens we happen to be classically trained and had real careers.  But the careers were interesting because all three of us had these diverse musical backgrounds.  Victor [Victor Trent Cook] was on Broadway, Thomas [Thomas Young] did standard operatic and classical repertoire and also bebop and swing and jazz, I came out of the church side of the things, I sing classical music training that came out of the program, I sang opera but I had all these, these abilities to sing to sing gospel, Broadway, and play piano.  And so we had these diverse, so here we are with these extremely interesting diverse backgrounds, musically we come together and then all of a sudden, things got interesting, quick, fast, in a hurry, in the music scene in America because the three of us were now on PBS singing these different genres of music, literally splits seconds of each other shifting out of one genre into the next genre on the Broadway, on PBS, as Three Mo' Tenors.  So basically from 2000 all the way until 2004 we did a commercial for Target, Marshall Field's, we had done all these PBS specials.  We had our own show Three Mo' Tenors and then we had a business situation that, that arose in 2003.  We then went as "Cook, Dixon and Young (Formerly of the Three Mo' Tenors)" in 2004, and we performed some more.  We recorded more PBS specials and throughout this tenure of 2000 basically 1998 to 2013, up until today, I think we have filmed up to eight PBS specials.  We've worked with every major orchestra in the country, and we have worked with such great artists as Barbra Streisand, Aretha Franklin.  We've rubbed shoulders with David Foster, Barry Manilow.  We've performed in all the, the, the great classical venue, outdoor venues from Millennium Park [Chicago, Illinois], with Riverbend [Music Center in Cincinnati, Ohio], Mann Park [Mann Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Chastain Park [Chastain Park Amphitheatre in Atlanta, Georgia], all these venues owned by the symphonies, Hollywood Bowl [Los Angeles, California].  You know, we just did it all, and worked with some of the most prolific and most interesting people in the music business, both musically as well as television-wise.
Story_ID: 113804
Speaker 1: Now what's the difference between, what was the difference between [The] Three Tenors and Three More Tenors [sic, Three Mo' Tenors: Dixon, Victor Trent Cook, and Thomas Young]?
Speaker 2: Well, commercially, the difference was, those were three icons.  Placido Domingo, Jose Carreras, and Luciano Pavarotti, those were the three icons that came along during the golden years of the Met [The Metropolitan Opera in New York City, New York], from the '60s [1960s] all the way through the late '80s [1980s] into the '90s [1990s], partially somewhat the early '90s [1990s].  They were part of the Metropolitan Opera golden years in terms of ticket sales, popularity in America, and established the Met as a world class operatic entity.  Jimmy Levine [James Levine] was the conductor who started in the late '60s [1960s, sic, 1972], and Luciano Pavarotti in the late '60s [1960s] came along with the, the tenor of the high Cs [sic, "King of the High C's," 1974] album.  Placido Domingo was, you know, the dramatic tenor who could sing, he had sung one of those seventy-five different roles.  He spent two years in Israel singing about forty something different roles [sic, he sang twelve different roles during his two years with the Israel National Opera in Tel Aviv].  Jose Carreras, those guys were the pillars of the industry in terms of tenors, in terms of leads.  So there they were, unbeknownst to the rest of the industry, deciding that the three of them to get together and sing a couple of pop tunes.  Next thing, you know, tickets are selling out stadiums, which the operatic business and classical music business had not really seen in that context.  It's one thing to play a 14,000 seat outdoor venue like Hollywood Bowl or Ravinia [Ravinia Park in Highland Park, Illinois] which is 14,000, you know, it can hold 14,000, or Tanglewood [Tanglewood Music Center in Lenox, Massachusetts] but it's another thing to sell 60,000 tickets at a stadium singing operatic arias in America.  But that's exactly what happened when the three of them got together.  United Center here in Chicago [Illinois], that's, they were playing stadiums.  And so they actually were able to marry, again, the technical of their icon status as three individual superstars in opera along with the organic of the commercial side and sell tickets at stadiums.  Now that's what they did.  They allowed us to be seen because they were crossing over and singing all this pop music.
Story_ID: 113805
Speaker 1: Now here we [The Three Mo' Tenors, Dixon, Victor Trent Cook, and Thomas Young] come along talking about well, we're gonna sing the European music but we're gonna sing all the music that we continue to sing on the side that's not considered serious music in the context of European music, gospel, jazz, blues, Broadway, folk.  And then we're gonna add these interesting harmonic abilities in terms of ensemble work when the three of us sing together.  So it wasn't so much that we would sing the arias and then and go and sing our Broadway stuff as soloists, people would marvel at our ability as artists to sing together as an ensemble to create these interesting Manhattan Transfer, Lambert, Hendricks, and Ross [Dave Lambert, Jon Hendricks, and Annie Ross], kind of, you know, vocal things we do as a countertenor, a post high lyric tenor, and a post high lyric tenor.  And so we would do things that the three of them would not artistically, musically do, and nor should they do it.  You know, it's not their thing.  In other words, I would say we were to music as an ensemble what Bo Jackson [Vincent Edward "Bo" Jackson] was to sports.  We weren't breaking the rules, we just were able to play at a very high level vocally in all the different genres, and we would capture and captivate all of the great icons in the industry.  So they would flock to our concerts in New York and say "We've been waiting for y'all."  [HM] Harry Belafonte, "It's been a long time coming.  We're waiting for you."  [HM] Ossie [Davis] and [HM] Ruby Dee.  All them, you know, who else was there?  [HM] George Faison and George C. Wolfe, and the, can't think of her name, tall with dark hair and his wife they played, he just passed away a couple of years ago,
Speaker 2: Valerie--
Speaker 1: Valerie, they were there.
Speaker 2: Simpson and [HM Valerie Simpson and Nickolas Ashford]--
Speaker 1: The, the, the major African Americans in terms of art but also in terms of civil rights movement, they were all there.  [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson [Sr.], they all showed up, they all came to our defense, they were all in the room watching us and said you three represent artistically the maturation of what we're talking about in terms of what people of color are all about, but you're doing it not just in terms of your blackness but you're doing it in terms of your sensibility about the European training and backdrop.
Story_ID: 113806
Speaker 1: And when you stand up there and sing nine high C's ['Ah! mes amis, quell jour de fete' from "La fille du regiment" by Gaetano Donizetti] in French on PBS and you sing all nine high C's or you sing 'Nessun Dorma' [from "Tutandot" by Giacomo Puccini] or something like that, you know, you're no longer just a classically trained artist, you're no longer African American, you're now an artistic force that's doing some strange stuff because one minute you sing that stuff, the next minute you singing, you know, "A Song for You" [by Leon Russell], sitting down playing the key of B natural with the orchestra staring at you going he's playing the key of B natural and he's not even looking at the keys.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: But I just saw him sing the French, now he's, playing Leon Russell's piece, you know, a Donny Hathaway made it famous for people of color and all over the globe, people everywhere.  And so now you're singing a Broadway tune, 'Make Them Hear You' [from "Ragtime" by Terrence McNally, Lynn Ahrens, and Stephen Flaherty].  Where did you come from?
Speaker 2: So Bo knows sports but Mo' knows singing.
Speaker 1: That's exactly right.  That's the commercial, "Bo knows."  And that's what we [the Three Mo' Tenors, made up of Dixon, Victor Trent Cook, and Thomas Young] artistically, vocally were doing.  We didn't really break the rules we just kind of put out in the forefront what our people had been doing all along for a hundred years.  You know, you know, the [HM] Quincy Joneses of the world were doing that back in the '50s [1950s], you know, Dizzy [Gillespie], Oscar Peterson, Miles [Davis], you know, Sarah Vaughan, you know, Ella Fitzgerald, Co-- Nat King Cole, Tommy A. Dorsey, you know, Alfreda's [HM Alfreda Burke] godmother here in Chicago [Illinois], Roberta Martin.  We've been doing it for a hundred years, this is not new.  It's just that commercially three guys in tails on PBS, they've never sold that before.  And so now all of a sudden, the comparison with The Three Tenors [Placido Domingo, Jose Carreras, and Luciano Pavarotti], well it's not about comparing the three, the two of us, the three of us [Dixon, Victor Trent Cook, and Thomas Young] with the other three guys, it was never about that because it was never based on what they were doing, it was based on what we have always been doing for over a hundred years.  That's all, Paul Robeson, magna cum laude 1905- was it 1916 [sic, 1919]? 26 different languages, thespian, actor, singer, politician, great writer, this is not new.  We, we were just put in the commercial platform for it to be seen in its entirety in two hours over twenty-four songs.  We were going through six or seven different genres and putting the European aesthetic on one side of the table and saying well, you know, what gospel equals that as well as Broadway, jazz, and blues, everybody has a place in the room today.  Nobody gets to become the big dog in this room, everybody's equal.  It's just that everybody gets to share in this two hour experience with the three of us.  And because Victor [Victor Trent Cook] had that post soprano high countertenor voice that was freak, he was a freak.  And Thomas [Thomas Young] was a countertenor too and I used to be a second soprano and I still have countertenor tendencies.  We all had very high voices that we could sing anything, any place, anywhere, and we were all trained.  And we had the organic thing working and the divine intervention thing working at the same time.  And that's what started the problems because people weren't, people were not prepared for us artistically in the room.  We would walk in the room with a major conductor in classical and as soon as we, switch over into another genre that conductor was no longer proficient in that genre.  That's not, that wasn't his thing.  So that intimidated people.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: That also intimidated some other artists too, which we did not expect.  But it can be intimidating when people can pick up the sheet music and swing an arc from one side, be in the room with [HM] Quincy Jones and start talking about, "Well you wanna go [Arnold] Schoenberg or you wanna talk about [Igor] Stravinsky or you wanna talk about writing for the strings" all across the board to David Foster saying "Well you wanna use a, a B minor seven chord right here and you wanna use a tag here and you wanna, you know, punch in at this point and maybe bring up the bass line" with him in another room in the recording studio.  People were not prepared for that kind of intelligence, let alone execution.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: And it was strange for us to find that out.
Story_ID: 113807
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, so did this really create a problem or, or, or did people, you know, I, I tend to remember that that, you know, Three Mo' Tenors [Dixon, Victor Trent Cook, and Thomas Young] and subsequent, you know--
Speaker 2: Groups, yeah.
Speaker 1: Group were, were successful (unclear)
Speaker 2: Well, it all depends on what you're looking at.  If you're looking at the actually body of work musically, we're talking about the three of us, Thomas, Victor, and I musically, no one has ever sang that show since.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: I mean black or white.  No one has vocally sung that show, the one we sang on PBS.  Now as, now that we have a subsequent legal ruling that allows us to refer to ourselves as "Cook, Dixon and Young (Formerly of the Three Mo' Tenors)"--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --that's a, that's a, that's a just a legal way of saying that we, we don't go by that name "Three Mo' Tenors" anymore because we're not legally allowed to, but we go by our own personal names both individually and collectively tenors "Cook, Dixon, Young (Formerly of the Three Mo' Tenors)."  The bottom line is, is that whatever we sang, it hasn't been produced since.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the--
Speaker 2: It's--
Speaker 1: I guess we're saying that the, now, now I guess the management for Three Tenors sued for the name infringement (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Uh--
Speaker 1: --something or was it--
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: What happened was there was a group of people who were involved as a partnership who had a difference of opinion about what we were and what they wanted to sell.  And the best way to explain is, is that there was just a difference of opinion.  They wanted to do a Broadway kind of set up with franchising the name but because what we were doing individually, well what we were, with the music, that became the actual product.  So, you know, it's, it's, it's not one of those things where you say, it's right or wrong it's just a difference of opinion, you know.  I like, I liken it this way, you can't, you can't franchise Prince, you can't franchise the Jackson 5.  You can't franchise somebody like Tina Turner.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: You can't.  Because the organic divine intervention thing took place.  It moved people, and so therefore those people are in people's lives at the most important points of their personal lives when they play that music.  So when you talk about a young African American soprano or mezzo [mezzo-soprano], who looks at Thomas, Victor, or I on the tape, can't franchise that simply because we came along at a time where they saw something they had not seen before in that context.  Now it's possible to say to a voice teacher well, "I wanna sing Broadway, I wanna sing jazz."  "Well, you, you, you can't do that, that's not good vocal technique."  "But why are they doing it and how come they can do it?  Can you teach it?"
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Now I'm not being negative here but now these possible questions were no longer, these questions were being put in front of people because they were one night in front of the, "He's just singing French, now he's singing Broadway, and he sang all the high notes and, and I wanna still be able to do the Broadway."  "Well you, you have to sing all the, he sang all the classical stuff first and then he sang the Broadway."  "No, he was singing Broadway, gospel, blues, and jazz before he was classically trained."  Now, people, you can't franchise that.  And that's the difference.  The difference is you can always create another Broadway cast because they're interchangeable parts 'cause you created it that way.  And that's successful or else Broadway wouldn't be here today.  But you cannot franchise a Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo, Jose Carreras [The Three Tenors] or the three of us because, or the Three Irish Tenors because the bottom line is, is that those artistic forces came along and, not reinvented the wheel, but people were exposed to the world in a different way.  And so therefore people develop differently, and they have a difference of opinion and they're not gonna buy something else when they have something that changed their sense about how something could be done.  So that's the difference between one side saying "I wanna franchise" and the other side saying "But you can't franchise something you can't duplicate."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 113808
Speaker 1: So, are, are you, are you three still performing now as the--
Speaker 2: I still work with Thomas [Young] and Victor [Victor Trent Cook] on occasion.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: But I also, during that time, strangest thing happened [HM] Alfreda [Burke] and I developed partnerships and relationships during the three tenor, "Cook, Dixon and Young (Formerly of the Three Mo' Tenors)" phase of 2000, 1998 up until the current date, we developed relationships with entities like the Opera House in Detroit [Detroit Opera House in Detroit, Michigan] and the Auditorium Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] with "Too Hot to Handel" during that period of time.  And we also, I went back into singing hardcore classical music with Maestro James Conlon in 2004 while all of this was going on.
Speaker 1: Well, well describe "Too Hot to Handel"--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --"The Jazz-Gospel Messiah"?
Speaker 2: That piece actually was written with Thomas Young in mind.  Marin Alsop conceived it.  She wanted to create a piece that was familiar with the general public as a bridge for people to buy tickets and come into classical halls and she thought that [George Frideric] Handel's "Messiah" would be the perfect piece to reimagine and re-create.  So she talked to Bob Christianson and Gary Anderson and they created this interesting piece called "Too Hot to Handel: The Jazz-Gospel Messiah", which is basically the Handel's "Messiah" that includes Hammond organ, electric bass, a drum kit, a big brass section ensemble, some percussion players, chorus, three soloists, and string payers.  And this interesting jazz-gospel version of Handel's "Messiah" is built on all the classical elements still in the orchestration.  So when you hear "Too Hot to Handel" you hear, Handel's "Messiah," you don't hear somebody changing the notes, you just hear how they reimagined the notes being sung and played with all these different genres at play.  So it would open with the orchestra playing, then all of a sudden this big kick would come in from the drums, and then all of a sudden this lead guitar player would play these rock beats and it's the same notes from the Handel's "Messiah."  So it's like, we call it "Handel's Messiah on steroids."  But it came along with Marin Alsop and the Concordia Orchestra and Denver Symphony [sic, Colorado Symphony Orchestra] in 1991, '92 [1992] [sic, 1993] at Lincoln Center [for the Performing Arts in New York City, New York].  And she performed the piece with artists such as Thomas Young, Vivian Cherry, and Lillias White, and it was incredible, with the Morgan State University Choir [Baltimore, Maryland], Nathan [Nathan Carter], Nathan, I can't think of the maestros name, but Morgan State and they came and it was just phenomenal, oh, my god.  This, with the, the New York Philharmonic string player would play in that orchestra every year, they'd play the piece 'cause it so exciting to play because you had this fusion of, of gospel, and these recitatives, and gospel that would cap and the pianist would play and, you know, the Hammond organ would come in and the lead guitar player would play these rock things and the choir would swing and the gospel would sound great and the blues would come and it's just a phenomenal piece.  So I thought since I sang the piece in 2000, I said, well why not sing the piece in Detroit [Michigan] and Chicago [Illinois]?  Those cities deserve to have a piece like this.  So I talked to Suzanne Acton in Detroit Opera back in 2000 when I was singing the regular Handel's "Messiah" with her.  And said why don't you-- You know, I'll tell you what happened, we were talking and she said "There's this great piece called 'Too Hot to Handel' and I wanna do it."  And I said, "Well, wow, I just did it.  I just did it at Lincoln Center with Denver Symphony, Concordia Orchestra with Marin Alsop.  It's a great piece."  "Why don't you come to New York and see it next year?"  Well, she brought herself and a few board members.  They came back, excited wanted to do the piece, they brought it to Detroit Opera House with Dr. David DiChiera.  And [HM] Alfreda [Burke] and I were there soloists along with Vivian Cherry, and then Victor Trent Cook joined us for a couple of years, and it's been there for twelve years.  And it's phenomenal because the demographic that buys tickets to that show in Detroit, is predominantly white.  And there was a, a person who worked in the administration at Detroit Opera at the time, a Mr. Brett Batterson, was called here to Chicago's Auditorium Theatre, and he wanted to bring the piece here, so he brought the production to Chicago at Auditorium Theatre.  It's been here now, Chicago for eight years going on its ninth year, and Alfreda and I sang as soloists for that piece as well.  So here we are with this classical crossover jazz gospel interesting piece that has galvanized in the consciousness of both Detroit and Chicago in a most unique way in these musical mecca centers like Detroit and Chicago, and we received rave reviews.  And it has really created a subculture of followers for this kind of crossover classical experience in the theater which is similar to what Thomas, Victor, and I did as the Three Tenors [sic, Three Mo' Tenors] on PBS.  Very similar to our crossover careers as artists, and my wife Alfreda is a perfect example that it's normal because she does it as well.  And that's what that piece does.  It just allows people to have their cake and eat it too.
Story_ID: 113809
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, so you mentioned another, something else, after Handel's, after, after "To Hot to Handel" there was another piece you mentioned and I--
Speaker 2: "Hallelujah Broadway?"
Speaker 1: "Hallelujah Broadway," right.
Speaker 2: That's, ha, that came because Bill Hughes of Mind the Gap Films in Ireland wanted to do this-- had this same idea, he wanted to get this spirituality of all these great Broadway songs that had a sacred tent or sacred bent to them.  And really what's sacred about them is that they speak to the human experience of joy, pain, and great songs like, 'You'll Never Walk Alone' [from "Carousel" by Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein, II] 'Climb Ev'ry Mountain.' [from "The sound of Music" by Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein, II]--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: 'Bring Him Home.' [from "Les Miserables" by Claude-Michel Schoenberg and Alain Boubil]
Speaker 1: So these are the songs from other Broadway shows--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that are inspirational and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And sung I mean a lot, I know when I was a kid, we'd hear some of these songs like 'You'll Never Walk Alone.'  I had no idea it was from "Carousel."
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: When I was--
Speaker 2: 'You'll Never Walk Alone.'
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he called, and our, he, he always wanted to work with me because of the tenors [Three Mo' Tenors], 'cause he, he actually produced the three Irish Tenors for television three or four times.  And so he finally had this idea about "Hallelujah Broadway" and so [HM] Alfreda [Burke] and I ended up joining Linda Eder and Anthony Kearns and we filmed that in 2010 in Prague [Czech Republic] with the Prague Philharmonia [sic, Prague Philharmonic Orchestra] for PBS.  And that was a very unique project because it spoke to our church roots.  The title said "Hallelujah Broadway" but as Christians we could then infuse our faith into the Broadway genre without necessarily talking about going to church.  And people thought it was just a gospel version of Broadway songs, no it's "Hallelujah Broadway" and we sang those songs in the traditional context of a full throated sound that sounds like Broadway but has an operatic texture to it vocally.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: So and, that, that was an excellent production for television and also in terms of recording because there really are fantastic solo performances on that PBS special and it, it, it was a great moment in our lives because "Hallelujah Broadway" has allowed us to work on television in that regard and we're gonna, we're certainly gonna be looking to do more television projects like that.  And so I mean for a couple to sing classical and crossover on television like that, that's a unique, that's a unique opportunity.  And that's what "Hallelujah Broadway" has done for us.
Speaker 1: I saw your wife on television sing 'You'll Never Walk Alone' what did you, I mean did, did you, what was your solo or one of the songs that you--
Speaker 2: I sang 'Somewhere.' [from "West Side Story"]
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: By Leonard Bernstein.
Speaker 1: I did that, I saw that too actually.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I also sang 'Anthem' from "Chess." [by Benny Andersson, Bjorn Ulvaeus, and Tim Rice]
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And, and the Bernstein correlation is interesting because we talked about Fontainebleau [France] and Bernstein, and spending time with him, so when I was asked to sing that song, it was important to me because there was a history with the composer, Leonard Bernstein, and that whole point of "What is it" and he says "It's the Bible," when I sang that piece I had that running through my veins, that experience of spending time with him and having that conversation and knowing, also knowing his history.  He had a profound effect on me as an artist.  And that's what that opportunity gave me.  And that also became the song that I actually sang for the Miss World Pageant in China for them in 2012 in [Inner] Mongolia, China if I'm not mistaken, Ordos City in China.  And Alfreda was there for that as well.  And that--
Story_ID: 113810
Speaker 1: Now this, I saw this [Dixon's performance of 'Somewhere' from "West Side Story" by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim at the Miss World Pageant in Ordos City, China in 2012] on YouTube--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, there's this purple stage and all these women, you know, the contestants are on then, then they announce you, the curtains open and you come from, this looks like a tremendous sized stage of this and this huge audience and I mean I, I, and I started thinking I said, I wonder if he ever gets afraid (laughter) when you come out and sing a solo on that kind of a setting--
Speaker 2: Ha.
Speaker 1: --I mean it seems like such a big venue, you know, I don't know.
Speaker 2: Well no, because the songs are derived from personal experiences that are very small.  "Somewhere" moves me because of my encounter with Leonard Bernstein in France but it also moves me because that was the place I met Bright Sheng, my good friend, Chris Guardino [Christopher Guardino].  It was also the place where the, the whole thread to Chicago started, the seed to Chicago, the whole Chinese, Chinese opera, Lyric Opera.  And that song represents that seed, that bridge.  So when I see 6,000 people, I don't see 6,000 people, I'm just trying to tell the story emotionally of that, that thing that rides in me and rides inside of me that connects me to the moment.  And I think as an artist I deal, I deal primarily in small beats.  One dot at a time and I connect them and try to create a straight line for the listener and the viewer.  And so I don't have any time to get nervous because I have a whole lot of work to do in the four minutes to create something that, that works.
Story_ID: 113811
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So now, you were, say in 2011 you performed in the production of the L.A. Opera's [Los Angeles Opera] "Der Zwerg" [by Alexander Zemlinsky], right?
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: That's actually 2007 [sic, 2008].
Speaker 1: 2007.
Speaker 2: 2008.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a very interesting time, because technically, in 2004, when I was busy with the tenors [The Three Mo' Tenors: Dixon, Victor Trent Cook, and Thomas Young] on one side of the spectrum, and I was busy with [HM] Alfreda [Burke] on the other side of the spectrum with "Too Hot to Handel" and our Olympic agenda 2016 [Chicago 2016 Olympic Bid Committee], which happened in 2008.  2004, I ran into a conductor by the name of James Conlon.  And Conlon and his wife, Jennifer Ringo, who is also a wonderful singer in her own right and coach, came into my life and literally put me back into the classical music scene.  Conlon was at Millennium Park [Chicago, Illinois] in 2004 conducting a concert in honor of open, of opening Millennium Park in 2004.  And I sang 'Ah! mes amis, quell jour de fete' [from "La fille du regiment" by Gaetano Donizetti] for him, the French aria with the ten high C's which I sang on the PBS special [Three Mo' Tenors].  And he said to me I want you to come sing at the May Festival in Cincinnati [Cincinnati May Festival in Cincinnati, Ohio] next year.  Now at that concert his wife, Jennifer Ringo, says to him, "James, Rodrick can sing 'Zwerg'" and Maestro Conlon who had already conducted "Zwerg," who was an international conductor in his own right has conducted at the Met [Metropolitan Opera in New York City, New York] for over twenty-five seasons, La Scala [Teatro alla Scala in Milan, Italy], Paris Opera [Paris, France] for eight years, Cologne Opera [Cologne, German].  He's now at the L.A. Opera.  He is one of the top conductors in the globe and one of the great opera conductors that have come out of America in a long time.  I mean he is the, he is the cat's meow.  He's one of the cats, excuse me for di, you know, digression of language but I have to use some kind of language to really explain what he is artistically.  He said, "I think you can, so look at 'Zwerg' for me."  He gave me the score and he said I want you sing at the May Festival in 2005, and he said I want you to sing "The Bells" [by Sergei Rachmaninoff] right, listen to this.  Well I didn't know "The Bells," I look at "The Bells," it's in Russian.  So Maestro Conlon says to me, he didn't tell me that it's in Russian.  I don't know that it's in Russian.  So he says, "I want you to sing "The Bells."  You're gonna sing it next spring, prepare it, my, mean time look at "Zwerg" and tell me what you mean, what you think."  So this is the summer of 2004, I, I call him up, no the spring, I call him up about a month later I said, "Maestro I've looked at 'Zwerg,' I have forty-five pages prepared for you."  "Forty-five pages, of 'Zwerg,' 'Der Zwerg,' Alexander Zemlinsky's 'Zwerg,' forty-five pages?"  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "Okay.  I'll be in Ravinia [Ravinia Park, Highland Park, Illinois]. Why don't you come by blah, blah, blah, blah, and sing it for me."  So I presented forty-five pages.  He said, "I think you can sing this.  I'll have to strip the orchestra down all the way, it's a little heavy.  It's written for heldentenor but you have the hutzpah to sing this.  You know what you're doing."  So, I'll work on it.  And so that's 2004--
Story_ID: 113812
Speaker 1: Two thousand five [2005], we're at the May Festival [Cincinnati May Festival in Cincinnati, Ohio] with him [James Conlon], I have now worked on the Russian, I have it prepared.  I sing "The Bells" [by Sergei Rachmaninoff] for him at the May Festival.  It was a huge success.  Then he says, "I want you to come to L.A. [Los Angeles Opera in Los Angeles, California] and sing "Tannhauser" [by Richard Wagner] in 2007, but in the meantime I want you to sing at the May Festival for me in 2006."  So I think I sang something like the [Gioachino] Rossini "Stabat Mater" something, something else in 2006.  So I make my debut with him at L.A. Opera in 2007 in "Tannhauser," and then I get the contract to do "Der Zwerg" [by Alexander Zemlinsky] in 2008 and film it.  And that was a major moment in my classical career because it was written for a heldentenor, I wasn't supposed to sing the piece but he had said that it's a very difficult piece to sing but because I had that Broadway, eight shows a week, background, and I had driven, and I had that kind of hectic New York lifestyle in the first place as a teenager--
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: --I had the stamina to sing "Zwerg" but I also had the technique to figure out how to be very careful about singing it, and I could also play the character because I had that crossover acting ability too, out of the Broadway and theatric side of my life, and I wasn't just primarily an opera singer.  If I had been just an opera singer, I couldn't have sung the piece but because I had this diverse backdrop, I could sing him and play him and I was used to a very heavy performance schedule with The Tenors [The Mo' Tenors], my wife [HM Alfreda Burke], so forth and so on.  So "Tannhauser" happens in '07 [2007].  I had success.  "Zwerg" happens, I'm on the stage, I come out the box, and [HM] President [Barack] Obama is running for the Presidency of the United States.
Story_ID: 113813
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us about "Der Zwerg" [by Alexander Zemlinsky]?
Speaker 2: "Der Zwerg" is a German opera written by Alexander Zemlinsky.  It's part of the Recovered Voices Project of James Conlon when he took over L.A. Opera [Los Angeles Opera in Los Angeles, California] under the auspices of the, the head guy, Placido Domingo, who is now over L.A. Opera, and Maestro Conlon wanted to do this Recovered Voices Project which dealt with Jewish composers who were suppressed by the Third Reich.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: And so he had these operas and "Zwerg" was one of the operas.  Viktor Ullmann was the other opera the, the broken, "Der zerbrochene Krug" opera, "The Broken Jug."  And these two operas were paired together for this series of DVDs that were being filmed for the Recovered Voices and which is there, therein lies the tale recovering the voices of composers who were suppressed by Third Na--, in the Third Reich.  And so he has championed this cause, and so he chose LA Opera, and Maestro Conlon chose me as a lead to, to, to sing "Zwerg" written for heldentenor, and at that time I was more of a full, full lyric tenor with dramatic tendencies like Carlo Bergonzi who was one of my great admirers that I like as a tenor.
Story_ID: 113814
Speaker 1: Well, maybe I should just stop and say, yeah I, it's occurring to me like what are the different kinds of tenor, tenors and can you describe--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the different classifications of tenors.
Speaker 2: Well, you have, first of all you have a countertenor.  And a countertenor is a guy who sings in his head voice but it has, he has ability to sing in his head voice with a full chest, the chest voice engaged and the head voice, so he sounds like a full throated sound, a countertenor.  And sometimes most countertenors are really basses.  They just sing in their head voice but they're really basses.
Speaker 1: Now, this is interesting in--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: --black popular music--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --we have guys who sing high--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --inside of their head as opposed to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a countertenor.
Speaker 1: That's a counter.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That would be a countertenor.
Speaker 1: So [HM] Smokey [Robinson] or--
Speaker 2: Smokey would be, yeah, a countertenor because he's not gonna be a full lyric, he's not gonna be a traditional tenor singing in the chest because he's actually singing in the head voice.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: Victor [Trent] Cook is a countertenor.  I'm thinking of some of those Motown singers who had that, the Tops, or not even '50s [1950s], the rock 'n roll, let me see, Prince--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --'70s [1970s], had the ability to sing in the head voice.  Michael Jackson sings in the head voice.  He was more, he was, yeah he's like a countertenor 'cause he's not singing in a regular tenor reg- tenor range.  Okay.  So those would be kind of David Daniels in classical music would be one, Derek Lee Ragin would be another countertenor.  So those are your countertenors that I'm thinking--
Speaker 1: Is that--
Speaker 2: --off the top of my head.
Speaker 1: Would that be synonymous with a falsetto?
Speaker 2: Falsetto, sounds like a soprano, that kind of a thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then you have just a regular tenor.  And then we have degrees of, of, of categories for regular tenors.  We have a regular tenor who's a dramatic tenor.  That would be Placido Domingo, Jon Vickers.  More on the heldentenors side, John Vickers is more on the heldentenor side with dramatic tenor repertoire.  I'm thinking of a tenor recently, and I can't see his name, but basically you have your dramatic tenors.  Then you have your full lyric tenors who have dramatic tendencies like Carlo Bergonzi, Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Carreras.  They're not necessarily dramatic tenors, because the dramatic tenors will sing the heavier roles like "Tosca" [by Giacomo Puccini], "I Paliachi" [sic, "Pagliacci" by Ruggero Leoncavallo], the [Richard] Wagner repertoire, you know.  But your full lyrics are Carlo Bergonzi, Luciano Pavarotti will sing anything from [Gaetano] Donizetti, [Giachino] Rossini, to [Wolfgang Amadeus] Mozart to [Giacomo] Puccini and sometimes [Giuseppe] Verdi.  They kind of skate the Verdi 'cause Verdi's on the other side of the dramatic side.  So that would be Domingo, Jon Vickers, so forth and so on.  So you have regular full lyric and dramatic tenors and then you have your full lyric tenors who will sing, you know, Puccini, Mozart, and for the most part that would be what they would sing.  And then you would have your light tenors, light lyrics, who would sing Mozart, Rossini.  And then you have these areas of category, categories like bel canto singers.  And there are repertoires, certain roles that are, that are synonymous with bel canto singing.  Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Carreras were bel canto singers, they sing all that repertoire but then they also sing some other repertoire that they were allowed to sing.  And when you're in school you, you have to be very careful of singing past your vocal Fach, F-A-C-H, Fach.  It's a German term for categorizing what repertoire fits in this particular Fach.  So, you have these degree of tenors.  So I'm a countertenor who has the dramatic ability to sing heavier repertoire, who is a full lyric with light lyric tendencies.

Speaker 1: I would be considered, in car terms, an SUV.  I can go four-wheel drive, I can go two-wheel drive, and if I have to pull huge things I can do that too.  Now the difference is the tractor trailer can't do what an SUV can get done.  Now those dramatic tenors, those heldentenors, those are tractor trailers.  You cannot go down the street doing 200 miles an hour with a tractor trailer.  Once you get them going it's, they're singing up against seventy piece orchestra majority of the time all night long and they're pulling a lot of sound in a huge house.  The other tenors they go into smaller categories.  The conductors have to be careful in terms of committing on the size of the house.  So in my case, because of my dramatic nature of my sound and color, I can play Zwerg [from the opera "Der Zwerg" by Alexander Zemlinsky] even though it was written for a heldentenor which is almost two Fachs [Facher] larger than my size of voice.  But because of the nature of my voice, if I was to really put it in sports terms, it's like handing, handing Walter Payton the ball thirty-four times up against a tough defense and he still ekes out a 125 yards and gets you two touchdowns but he's been stiff arming all night long and really running hard between the cracks.  Or Bo Jackson [Vincent Edward "Bo" Jackson], you know, running for speed but then running for power.  That's what I was doing with Zwerg.  I was singing a, a part that was really written for a fullback to just pound all night long up against 300 pounds of flesh that's just waiting for him to hit the cracks in the line of scrimmage and yet that's the orchestra.  The orchestra is the line of scrimmage.  The orchestration is heavy.  Brass is playing loud.  But then again I had the height to sing the high notes because if you pound so much then you can't, you can't burst for speed once you get past the line of scrimmage 'cause you've been, you've been hurt in the third and fourth quarters so you lose a step or two.  But vocally I could still sing high late into the opera even though I had been pounding up against the heavy orchestration for about forty-five minutes.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: And so that's the paradox.  I wasn't supposed to be able to do that.  But like I said before, [James] Conlon had faith and the L.A. Opera [Los Angeles Opera in Los Angeles, California] had faith and I was a huge success filming the piece, but then I acted the piece in a way that surprised everybody.
Story_ID: 113816
Speaker 1: Now, now is the title, is the name of the opera ["Der Zwerg," by Alexander Zemlinsky] the title character of the, "Does Swerg" [ph.] (unclear)
Speaker 2: "Der Zwerg"--
Speaker 1: There
Speaker 2: --is "The Dwarf."
Speaker 1: "The Dwarf," yeah.
Speaker 2: And there goes, err goes the comment about [HM] President [Barack] Obama running for presidency.  Because one of the board members at L.A. Opera [Los Angeles Opera in Los Angeles, California] said, "You know, he's, you knew he was running" because she had watched the opera.  And at that time the 24/7 news cycle had Barack Obama on in everybody's consciousness because he was in the primaries and he was running and "Zwerg" was filmed I think in the spring of '08 [2008].  And, "You know he's running" that's what she said to me and he wasn't given the head of the Democratic Party until the summer of '08 [2008] and then he, he won in November of '08 [2008].  So when she said to me, you knew he was running, the image of the dwarf coming out of the box in the all-white society and he believes that he can sing and he has all of this, this education but he's still a dwarf and he's ugly and he's a toy.  And the Infanta plays with him and then she throws him away and breaks his heart and he dies at the end from a broken heart.  But he's never seen himself before but he doesn't know that he's ugly, so he's never seen an image of himself.  So the parallels of an African American President thinking that he can win the presidency, let alone run, and actually win, and then me coming out that box in Los Angeles in '08 [2008] in the title role of a German opera as an African American tenor, let alone it being filmed.  And I can give you a great story about this at that time.  I had, there was a German person interviewing me about singing "Der Zwerg" in '08 [2008], and mind you I'm still dealing with the tenors [The Mo' Tenors: Dixon, Victor Trent Cook, and Thomas Young], still working with my wife [HM Alfreda Burke] doing "Too Hot to Handel," crossing over vocally, all this other repertoire sitting on the outskirts of this conversation with, the classical conversation with [James] Conlon riding in the middle, and this interviewer said to me, he said, "So tell me something about yourself," and don't mind me switching into some of his dialect, "Tell me something, something about yourself so, so how did you, how did you do this?"  'Cause I'm singing a German opera--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --in Los Angeles Opera, playing the title role and I'm African American.  And I knew the question, I knew the genesis of the question, I understood what he was really trying to ask me.  "How, how did you get here?"  And I had a patented answer but I was grinning while I answering so, so, so this, I was, "See, sir, I, my father [Samuel Edward Dixon], and my mother [Dorothy Jean Black Dixon] in Queens, New York [New York City, New York]--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: --they played classical music.  And I grew up with classical music and I studied and I had gospel music and I had my father's classically trained and my mother had operatic voice and," and it, and as I began to tell the story I could see him watching my mouth move and not taking anything in because he was in shock.  I kept talking and it looked like this, "So I went to school in Queens and, and so, and I went to Music and Art [The High School of Music and Art in New York City, New York, part of the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts] and so, I went to Mannes [Mannes College of Music, now The Mannes School of Music at The New School, New York City, New York] da, da, da da."  And I kept, I told the story and after a while, and then he, and when I finished telling him "I, I was at Lyric Opera [of Chicago, in Chicago, Illinois] and I met James Conlon the Maestro asked me to sing and sing, and I sing German" and so, so, he just got this puzzled look and he said "Well, why not rap?"
Speaker 1: (Laughter)
Speaker 2: Now this was before I walked on to sing opening night.  And he had just interviewed Maestro Conlon and the benefactor who had underwritten this great series [Recovered Voices] to recover the voices of Jewish composers and they have this African American coming out of this box playing The Dwarf in the title role in Los Angeles [California], the year that Obama is running for President of the United States.  If that's not juicy I don't know what else is.  And he says, "Why not rap?"  Why-- so I laughed.  So after the opening I'm coming upstairs and here's the famous comment from the board member, "You know that he's running, you knew that didn't you?"
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: I said "Yeah, I knew."
Story_ID: 113817
Speaker 1: And instead of me giving a performance that was in terms of operatic terms, a patented operatic performance, I gave a performance about making sure that The Dwarf [in "Der Zwerg" by Alexander Zemlinsky] was a human being and not just a toy.  That he was a man and not just an object.  And that, in this particular production, he would represent the truth in the particular context, knowing that the context in which he's being seen is actually being written by a script outside the opera house that night with [HM President Barack] Obama running for President.  And this board member looking at me strange and this interviewer from Germany looking at this whole situation strange, they got a black guy running for President, they got a black guy singing the German opera, he's in Los Angeles [California], all of this is weird.  I thought this was gone be about rap.  That's why Zwerg is so important because I didn't know that Placido Domingo, the great icon, one of the great Three Tenors, the head of Los Angeles Opera with international conductor James Conlon, would put me on the cover of the DVD of those two operas that were performed that night when they filmed the two performances later.  First of all, to put an African American male in the German role, in the title role, is unique anywhere on the globe, let alone film and then put him on the cover, that's another conversation.  Because you have to think if the German guy in Germany is looking at the cover he's going "Why, why, who is that?  Is he singing Zwerg?"
Speaker 2: So was, was it obvious that you were an African American on the stage or did you--
Speaker 1: It was obvious because everybody else was white.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But I didn't know if they--
Speaker 1: There was a few people of color.
Speaker 2: --made you up in the sense that, that you wouldn't be, you would look German or--
Speaker 1: No, I looked like a dwarf.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the stage was built up taller than me so I crouched down the whole night.  I had this very ornate costume, I'll show you the pictures of it.  And so I was made to look like a dwarf.  The illusion was that the, that as I crouched the stage was built up, everybody was taller than me, so that was the illusion but it was what I did between the cracks, it was what I did between the pauses is what I worked so hard on in capturing his world, the eighty percent of nonverbal communication, all that stuff was not operatic.  All that stuff was human, and I humanized him and that made it a very effective performance.  And I believe I was honored with the cover of the DVD because of the artistic force.  And then, of course, he just wanted to honor the performance 'cause it represented something more than just doing "The Dwarf."
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was a real operatic vocal feat.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: An acting feat.
Speaker 2: Yeah so, so is the DVD available now?
Speaker 1: Yes
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: On Arthaus Musik, Musik.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: You can buy it, you can buy it anywhere in the world.  I am very proud of the work artistically.  I'm proud of the fact that I was able to meet everybody's expectation.  It's a lot of weight to carry a whole production like that and to film that while doing an opera, it's not easy to do.  And I don't know of any other, I, I don't know if any other African American male has ever had the honor of playing the title role of a German opera and being on, and being put on the actual DVD cover itself for the actual opera--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --knowing that's he's an American and he's African American, I just don't know, I may be wrong but I'm not saying I made history but I am saying it is significant considering the two players in the decision were Maestro James Conlon and Placido Domingo, so I'm forever indebted to their honoring the work and have enough faith to put me on the cover of that particular work.  It's just a huge honor and its, that's history making in the sense that they did something phenomenal for our cultural group by making that decision.
Speaker 2: How, how many performance of "Der Zwerg" did you--
Speaker 1: I only did four.
Speaker 2: Four.
Speaker 1: And we filmed two of 'em.  And its, the DVD came out.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so that's why the 2008 "Tannhauser" [by Richard Wagner] debut was important to me personally, but the "Der Zwerg" performance carries along with it a, a level of execution that is highly regarded globally.
Story_ID: 113818
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you and your wife, [HM] Alfreda Burke, have been involved in some educational endeavors with young people that seem to me reminiscent of Leonard Bernstein's Young People's Concerts.
Speaker 2: (Laughter), yeah.  Alfreda and I have been up to no good.  We, let's see.  We've been involved in the Young Musicians Program which is now called the Young Musicians Choral Youth Orchestra, Choral Orchestra Young-- YMCO, Choral Orchestra, Young Musicians Choral Orchestra, which, which used to be known as the Young Musicians Program out of the University of Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley in Berkeley, California].  It's about forty years old and now it's in transition, and as of September first, it will be officially the first, I think, and I may be wrong about this, the first youth choral orchestra in the country.  In other words, the people who play in the orchestra is the chorus, and the people who are in the chorus, play in the orchestra at the same time.  And it's unique.  And Daisy Newman runs the program.  Alfreda and I have been clinicians and teachers and role models involved in the programs for over four years now.  And the program matriculates students into the top conservatories and schools in the country.  These kids are earning 40, $50,000 scholarships to schools like Juilliard [The Juilliard School in New York City, New York], Oberlin Conservatory [of Music in Oberlin, Ohio], Manhattan School of Music [New York city, New York], Mannes College of Music [now The Mannes School of Music at The New School, New York City, New York], so forth and so on.  Their grade point averages are between three and four.  Some of them in the top tier, 3.8 through a 4.0.  SAT scores range anywhere from 1800 to 2400, in that range there.  These kids come from underprivileged, lower economic families in terms of they can't make no more than $20,000 a year to actually become a part of the program.  And these kids are little wunderkinds because they play two or three instruments, instruments, and they sing and they train.  And she finds 'em as early as, as eight years old.  And she trains 'em up until they're eighteen.  And she spends about $10,000 on each kid and our budget is about 1.2 million.  And it's an extraordinary story because she used to be one of the great singers that used to sing for Leonard Bernstein, worked for the New York Philharmonic and the Detroit Symphony Diversity Inclusion Program [sic, Detroit Symphony Orchestra Education Program], and now she's out there and she finds these unbelievable students.  And they're pulling the load, they're executing, and it's amazing what we find ourselves involved in every summer with those kids.  And it's, and people are surprised because we taught a music business class, and this is the truth, this is the truth.  We handed the kids a contract, 100 kids.  All have their instruments, these little wunderkinds.  We had, I said, "Go home tonight, I want you to study the contract.  We're gonna work through the contract tomorrow.  I want you to tell me what you like about the contract, what you don't like about the contracts," and there were a few miscellaneous clauses in the back of the contract.  And the last clause negates the entire contract and I didn't expect any of the kids to find it.  So the very next day Alfreda and I get in the class, we start teaching.  "Okay, y'all let's, let's work through the contract."  And there's this lone wolf in the back, who Daisy said he hardly ever talks, "Usually my aggressive ones move up to the front of the class so they can take over the class and be aggressive."  He says, "Mr. and Mrs. Dixon, number five in miscellaneous."  I said got the doggit [ph.].  Oh, my god.  He then messed up my whole class.  Alfreda and I looked and said there go our whole class.  We gone have to teach something now.  He found the clause, I said, "Stand up.  Read miscellaneous five, read it."  And all it basically said, "No matter what you sign we still can sue you and we're not liable."  That's basically what the clause said in its essence.  And I looked at him, I said, "Young man come to the front and read the clause.  Now that you then taken over our whole entire class."  And that's what made these kids special because they were working in the gift realm.  They were technically getting it right, doing all the hard work, and they were organic but they had these special gifts and she would find them.  I called them these, they're, to me they're like, the, these, these kids in that movie but strange, strange kids.  But we have been able and fortunate, and we've been fortunate to work in this atmosphere for four years with these kids who are actually doing the work.  It's not just about inspiring them and giving them hope and being role models, these kids are getting these scholarships and they're earning their keep.  And these schools are going after them and they're phenomenal.  Flute players, playing in the orchestra, singing in the, the vocal program at University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] school.  I couldn't get in.  Hmm and I laugh about.  And there she is teaching in theory.  First and second year another child gets, she turns Juilliard down and picks Manhattan School of Music because they're gonna let her write her own curricula because she's that awesome.  These kinds of, these kinds of artistic forces.  Where they're doing the technical, the sciences, and they had the organic in, organic in space, and we are immersed in it and we love it.  We work every summer.  We teach the music business class, we teach voice, we actually teach a acting class for camera work for singers.  And we just get in there and we work basically tirelessly from 9:30 to 5:30, 6:00 o'clock in the afternoon, two weeks straight, and we work 'til we just have nothing left, and they squeeze everything out of us.  And every year we have to stay two steps ahead of 'em cause they're just that gifted.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: That's YMP, YMCO, Young Musicians Choral Orchestra, Daisy Newman.
Story_ID: 113819
Speaker 1: Is Daisy Newman related to Danny Newman who--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: --wrote subscribe--["Subscribe Now!"], you know, the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Lyric Opera [Lyric Opera of Chicago] subscriber?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: No, no, she's not.
Speaker 1: She's not.  Okay.
Speaker 2: I know Danny, 'cause he talked about--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --the whole hi there, how he wrote the book on subscription in the '60s [1960s] and helped turn Lyric around on the whole idea of getting people to subscribe to the opera season.  I, I know Danny, yeah.
Speaker 1: Whenever I hear classical music and Newman, I think of Danny Newman.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Right.  No, but just that's, that's, I haven't seen a program like that before.  It's, it's, and they eat, they're like locusts, they eat up everything that comes in the room.  If you're not authentic, they will run you out of the building.  Those kids are just that ferocious and fierce about what it is that they're doing.  And they're not mean and nasty, they're beautiful kids--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --it's just that they can tell a phony when they see one.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And I've heard, and, and many a people who came in, with logist, legitimate credits who were eaten alive by that much talent.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: That's YMP [YMCO, Young Musicians Choral Orchestra].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 113820
Speaker 1: Now, you also participate in something where you spoke about off-camera here but a Music and Medicine Symposium at Wright State University in Dayton [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Mr., Dr. Glenn Solomon and Cynthia Solomon.  Dr. Solomon, I just started there in Dayton and he actually was, had been in Dayton during his military days many moons ago, and his wife works as a pharmaceutical salesperson throughout the Midwest region.  And he wanted to do something special where he can combine music and medicine and do a symposium because there are so many doctors who are actually, are musicians.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And he thought there was a correlation between the two, why you have a lot of doctors who play piano and play string instruments but who also are in the medical field.  So he came up with the idea.  And so for the last four or five years [HM] Alfreda [Burke] and I have gone down as clinicians to talk about the correlations between health, famous characters in opera who had health problems and scenes, and doctors also talking about really what was going on with the characters in those, those, those operatic scenes that are not necessarily dealt with in the opera but using somebody who has tuberculosis or somebody who has, you know, some kind of coughing spell or who are gonna die of something, they actually deal with the medical and say this is really what's going on with the body.  And then we would then take the two pieces of information, the operatic tradition of the libretto of the characters and what was going on medically in the scene, what the actual diagnosis from the medical field about what's really in reality was happening with the body, and then we deconstruct the opera scene and then deal with the character in reality and then try to fuse the two worlds together in a symposium and talk about it, so that the doctors can see musically the correlation, and musicians can see the medical correlation.  And then there was this also, this whole idea of talking about how to improve, like in jazz, how doctors can deal better with their patients, how do they improv to get information out of their patients.  So the symposium deals with doctors using music and its ability to get information out of people, and the music people need to be more scientific about what's really going on with the person when they're playing an instrument and they're hurting so on and so on.  So it's been a very beneficial environment for us, for us, and enhanced our sensibility about relationships outside of music and that was one of them, medicine.
Story_ID: 113821
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now in 2012, you performed in, with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra Center here a piece called "Siamsa na nGael."
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Some people say, "Shamsa na nGael" [ph.] and "Shemsa na nGael [ph.]--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: It all depends on who, which Irish person you're standing next to.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) so either one works.  So you're right, Shamsa na nGael [ph.] or Siamsa na nGael [ph.], it all depends on the odd vowels.  But Siamsa na ngael is, it comes from Old St. Pat's Church [Old St. Patrick's Church] here in Chicago.  And Jack Wall started that tradition of a Celtic celebration at Chicago Symphony Orchestra with about a 140 voices and a full orchestra capturing the relationship between the Irish cultural group and other cultural groups.  And it's been going on for over ten years now.  And Bill Fraher is the music director of that, and [HM] Alfreda [Burke] and I have been involved with that project, and we have participated, performance wise and I've also been a consultant to them on putting that show together.  And so we've done great things like taking piece and snippets of "Ragtime's" 'Make Them Hear You' [by Terrence McNally, Lynn Ahrens, and Stephen Flaherty], making orchestrations bigger, having African American tap dancers tap dance with the Irish tap dancers and creating that kind of fusion in terms of artistic presentation.  Soul Children Choir [Soul Children of Chicago] along with the Irish and multicultural choir doing all kinds of choral works along with the orchestra, and then looking at the historical significance between great people like Daniel O'Connell and Booker T. Washington.  Matter of fact Daniel O'Connell purchased Booker T. Washington's freedom [sic, he paid for Frederick Douglass' freedom] and, and as matter, (unclear) Julieanna Richardson came to one of the productions a year ago and that information was put out there and, but I didn't know that until we started doing the Siamsa Project and looking at relationships between Irish and African Americans and Irish and Jews, and Jewish people and Irish and Italians.  So Siamsa, is all about a cultural fusion of how the Irish have affected and have been a part of the globe, humanity globally.  And those concerts have been great.  And have I have to act sometimes and play other characters.  And so Alfreda did a piece called "Let the World Say Amen."  But actually the piece is actually "Let the Church Say Amen" by Andrae Crouch and Marvin Winans that came out last year, which is derived from "Amen" the old hymn that we used to sing in church.  And, but we had taken that and we made it global, "Let the World Say Amen."  And we wanted to show this global epic conversation about cultural fusion and it's basically the Irish celebration here in Chicago at Symphony Center and it's a concert done every year.  And, and happy to say that this year it's Tin Pan Alley, and I think the conversation will be about Jewish and Irish relationships about that, and so they're working on that.  And Alfreda and I will be involved in that as well.  So this is our fourth or fifth year of working with the church on that.  And we expect that Bill Hughes will also take this project in other places as well, you know.
Story_ID: 113822
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just, I said Booker T. Washington but it was [Daniel] O'Connell purchasing Frederick Douglass' freedom, that's right.  And I actually played Frederick Douglass in--["Siamsa na nGael"], and there's a line in there that said, O'Connell said to Frederick in Ireland, he said, "Now we have the black O'Connell" (laughter).  So I just wanted to make that correction about--
Speaker 2: And so very few African Americans have heard of O'Connell, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And he's--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --an Irish liberation leader.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: At the time when Douglass visited Ireland--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he pretty upset about with what was going on with, what was happening in America with slavery.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: Renounced it profusely.
Story_ID: 113823
Speaker 1: Now this is, this has occurred to me as we're doing this interview that this, the work that you do in, in both classical and popular music is, and the travel, and the study, you know, is a tremendous cultural education.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  It's just was the kitchen table of my home as a child.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: This is the way the discussion would, would go world economy, politics, political science, this is what I, I'm used to.  I'm just living it now.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And I realize that now.  When my travels to Australia playing "Oedipus Rex" [by Igor Stravinski]; London [England]; Prague [Czech Republic] with "Hallelujah Broadway"; Umbria, Italy; Assisi [Italy]; you know, Fontainebleau [France]; China.  And now you look through the classical lens and you look at classical study which is classic study of art, literature, and history, and I used the word gestalt er-- earlier, it really is about the Renaissance man.  And I, I, I am very grateful that, that I'm privileged to be an American citizen, to have the opportunity to discover my humanity in this lifetime, this way.  I wouldn't change a thing.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: The good or the bad, I just wouldn't because it, it really is, and I feel like I'm just getting started.  It's, it's, it's amazing.  It really is the Renaissance man definition for me.  And I didn't plan it this way.  I still see myself with that baseball glove and that rubber band with that hardball in it.  You know, what I mean?  That's, yeah.
Story_ID: 113824
Speaker 1: So what, what are you gonna do next?  I mean or did you have an ideal next step scenario as you're in the midst of a very active cultural life?
Speaker 2: I think more television.  Television is certainly in [HM] Alfreda [Burke], our lives.  I think a lot of good will come from doing more television artistically in terms of education.  I will say that there is a current program that's about to happen at Carnegie Hall [New York City, New York] for me.  I'm gonna make my Carnegie Hall debut and it's with [Robert] Nathaniel Dett's "[the] Ordering of Moses" with Maestro James Conlon, so again, he's at it again.  And the piece has never been performed in New York City and it's never been heard at Carnegie Hall so it's making its New York premier.  And, and I'm going to get a chance to make my Carnegie Hall debut.  I've sung in all the venues in New York except Carnegie.  And it's a major deal.  Alfreda's made her debut at Carnegie with [Daniel] Barenboim and Chicago Symphony [Orchestra] already but I've not had the opportunity and here's my chance.  But that project is special because it's Nathaniel Dett in "Ordering of Moses."  It's, that's, that's, that's important to me because it's, it's a historical event that will take place in New York, it's an African American composer, it's the oldest festival in America that's actually doing the piece, the May Festival in Cincinnati [Ohio], and it's Carnegie Hall.  And I'm shaking my head going this is, this is 2013.  In 2014 that event will take place with a national broadcast of Nathaniel Dett's "Ordering of Moses."  And the backdrop to that story, as I talked to you a little earlier about Alfreda and I doing more television, is that when Nathaniel Dett heard his piece for the first piece in Cincinnati in 1937, there was such an uproar, that they [NBC] stopped the broadcast and when he went on stage he had no idea they stopped the broadcast, he was taking his applause.  Huge, New York, New York Times wrote a unbelievable review about this in 1937 about the power of the piece.  Then in 1950s [1956], Leontyne Price with her then husband, William Warfield, also sang the piece at Music Hall in Cincinnati.  And there was a huge uproar and they stopped the broadcast [sic, no interruption is on record for the 1956 performance].
Speaker 1: Now why the uproar?  What, what's the controversy over?
Speaker 2: Well, the controversy is that this is America in '37 [1937] and 1950s where clearly, you know, Jim Crow and that kind of environment was alive and well.  And there were some people who did not want to hear people of color singing a piece on the radio like that, and they didn't wanna hear that kind of a piece like that on the radio at that time.  And in Cincinnati there were some people who were upset but the beauty of that is that the May Festival which is started in I think 1870, the oldest musical festival in America, the May Festival in Cincinnati were the ones who, who actually premiered the piece.  They were the, they had enough foresight to put the piece on and they wanted it broadcast 'cause they thought that much of Nathaniel Dett's work that they did it in '37 [1937] and they did it in the '50s [1950s] again.  The May Festival in Cincinnati, again they have been at the, the forefront of making these kind of decisions, even despite those kinds of circumstances at those times.  And here they are again, which James Conlon is the head of that for thirty years, going to Carnegie Hall to have the conversation to finally give the national broadcast a complete broadcast, a complete hearing of the piece at a historical sight like Carnegie Hall.  And by the way, Music Hall in Cincinnati was built around the same time [1878].  Carnegie Hall was built a little bit less after that [1891] and then our own Auditorium Theatre here in the city of Chicago was built [1889] all in the same twenty-five year period of time.  So those historic buildings, it's interesting that Alfreda and I are working in all three entities--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --in that regard.  And so, for the future, it's television, that kind of work, being a part of the HistoryMakers family, connecting the dots, just looking to raise as much capital as possible to help as many people as possible.  I received a full scholarship, I want somebody else to receive a full scholarship.  There are people counting on us to get to our finish line.  To continue to inspire, continue to work hard, and really just trying to find out what else is out there in between the cracks in the silence, those artistic forces.  They never grow old, you just get smarter, you realize there's more to find out, more to dig for, more to find, besides, you know, the concrete stuff, the finite stuff.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My hope, let me start with my concerns.  My concerns are that our community continues, let me rephrase this.  I'm concerned about the ongoing dialogue about what are we supposed to do, what are we going to do?  I'm concerned about that.  I feel that the dialogue is somewhat focused on the problems and I'm, I, I would like to see us spend a lot more time creating the platforms economically to get rid of some of the problems.  And what I mean by that is that I think that we, we, we need to use our assets financially more effectively.  Not so much in terms of getting more assets in terms of financial power but that's important 'cause you can't get anything done unless you have financial capital.  But we need to spend more time using our financial capital to build better effective institutions in education and also in the arts.  I'm concerned about the arts being pushed completely off the table and me being relegated quite, quite frankly more into the world of the sciences, and I do realize that a digital, digital age is here and, and technology is important but I think our capital, not just financially but our capital in terms of the dialogue and discourse has to be spent more in terms of the arts and somewhat dialing back some of this, the, the interests in sports, especially in grade school and high school and putting it back into the arts.  Reason why I say that is because I do think that a lot of our children will, like myself, be better off if they have those other interests in high school, music, dance, painting, available and accessible to them in a way so that it can balance off their studies, and also play sports 'cause I did it all.  I'm not seeing that kind of platform available where they can do it all.  I think they're being forced into enclaves to specialize in one or two areas.  And so the discourse for me that's my concern, the money as well as the energy and the assets and, and the capital out of that that conversation to raise money should be spent more so in education but also the arts have to be an integral part.  And maybe 'cause I'm an artist I would focus on that quite naturally and I understand that but I'm concerned that the arts are basically being pushed off when it comes to educating a child and then it's being lifted up as an entertainment source on television and also in the ears.  And then the child would just make the connection to who is Duke Ellington?  Who was Ella Fitzgerald?  Who is [HM] Quincy Jones?  What is, what is a G cleft?  Why is it important you need to know?  I think it's only discovered in college now and in high school as sort of an offshoot because they're too busy with TMZ or whatever, those kinds of things.  So those are my concerns.  I hope I was specific enough.  But I, I'm just trying to articulate it in such a way.  My hope is, is that the more we continue to struggle to tell the truth, live the truth, and model the truth, I think these problems will be solved.
Story_ID: 113826
Speaker 1: What today when you look back over everything you've done at this point and you're in, you're still in the midst of the center of a lot of activity, well, what today would you consider to be your artistic legacy?
Speaker 2: That's a, that's a, I think my artistic legacy will ultimately be hidden for a while.  Simply because it's more so on the learned side of the table.  I'm not very much a commercial kind of person in terms of what it is I do.  I've been very successful commercially in some things I've done but I think when you care to look at the record and you look at the body of work and you listen to recordings and you say okay what is he vocally doing, when, how did he learn to do that, those things will start to, people will start to pay attention to that.  But I think my legacy will be more so on the technical side.  What is a crossover singer?  Why was his work important in that regard both, in terms of technically and also commercially?  And how does it affect other people dreaming that they can actually do that?  I wonder because of the way we function today in society but when it comes to commercial, commercial success that, that will have to dissipate somewhat for us to really truthfully, truthfully, inspect and look at what other people are doing, the, the meat and bones of what it is that they've done in a way that effect people around them and effect their industry.  I do think that at the end of the day, because we do not have a vocabulary to really articulate what it is to sing an aria, a Broadway tune, and a pop tune in a ten minute period of time, at a very high level with an eight-camera shot, where you cannot do any do overs, you can't take it over and, and either you, you, you are what you are in those ten minutes or you're not.  And so I, I don't know how to answer that question in today's terms but I think historically people will look back and they'll look at the performance and say I still don't know how to articulate teaching what it is that he just did.  And I know, I can teach it, and I know a lot African Americans can teach it but it's not necessarily something commercial that we've sold enough of it for people to really get into the lexicon of education where they can develop a vocabulary for it.  Same thing with jazz studies in terms of voice, how do you teach that?  You use jazz instrumentation to teach jazz voice.  This is what they were doing musically with the instruments, this is what they're doing vocally.  And there's influence, there's there is some vocabulary out there which they use words like bebop subdivisions of four, swing subdivisions of three to denote what the jazz artist vocally is doing but we're not really talking about the vocal pedagogy of what the black jazz singers doing, we still haven't developed the vocabulary really to discuss that like we can, we're discussing what they're doing when they're singing classical music and their classically trained.  But I think for crossover singers like myself, who has a hardcore, who has a hardcore operatic classical, standard operatic classical tradition and body of work, I don't think people are really gonna understand what I'm doing until time has passed and they looked at it and inspect it and there's vocabulary out there to really say, oh, we know what that is, now we know how to categorize that, call that what it is, and we have terminology and we have people who are teaching that kind of vocal pedagogy and that kind of a thing.  So I think my legacy in that regard will over time be understood but I don't think it's really understood in today's context yet.
Story_ID: 113827
Speaker 1: Now is it, is there, I don't know, if there's a national conference of artists, a lot of black organizations around professional--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --entertainment.  Is there any sort of a organization of black classical musicians?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the National Association of Negro Musicians, NANM.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: They meet on a regular basis.  They're about a-- they're about a hundred years old.  They just had a, an event here in the city of Chicago [Illinois], they had their convention here about two years ago, three years ago.  Of course, there's the gospel, the National Gospel Music Workshop [of American].  They're there, [Reverend James] Cleveland started that back in the '50s [1950s] or '60s [1960s], I don't know which one it is where they started, but that's them.  And then there's, there's a few other, there are a few other organizations.  There's the Historical Black colleges.  They meet once a year and have their, their seminars and conventions.  Specifically pertaining to music of African American composers.  And that's another thing the, that's gonna be very interesting to see how our music is talked about and dealt with because American music still has yet to be really dealt with.  It's, jazz has moved into the mainstream of classical music in terms of being described as a serious art form but pop music has yet to move into that realm as a serious art form when it comes to what makes it serious.  Is it the commercial success of it or is it the actual technical merit within it when the person's actually articulating something musical?  And so I think our culture, our music, it's still trying to find its way into the universal language of music globally when it comes to serious music.  We have serious people who write serious works but our music has not really moved into the definition of what we constitute as "serious music" in classic terms.  There's still no school to teach what constitutes gospel singing.  Gospel music has, it uses classical terminology when it comes to its compositions, Negro spirituals, it has its own culture, and its own legacy, its core works but it's, it's between two worlds now where its relegated to an experience of going to a church that still performs Negro spirituals and anthems but it's not a part of the commercial scene of classical music to sell Negro spirituals and anthems in that regard with classical institutions because it's still an offshoot.  And so our music be it jazz, blues, and some gospel commercially, are the only three that are commercially successful but jazz is the only one that really is considered now part of the, the serious music conversation.  And I could say that's part, partly because of [Duke] Ellington, Wynton Marsalis, Oscar Peterson, those kinds of, and Ella Fitzgerald, those kinds of icons who rubbed noses and worked with some of the great classical artists and conductors and composers who influenced them.  [HM] Quincy Jones, of course, is in that, in that category.  Miles Davis I said earlier.  So I think, I think the crossover conversation still is the best bridge for that discovery, that analytical research, and that possibility of pop music, crossover music being included in the conversation of serious music.  Now that's an oxymoron.  I know it's somewhat blasphemy for people to hear that but I think of that guy in Germany who said "Why not rap?"  And that's the perfect example of what I'm really trying to talk about.  I've done rap before.  I did some recordings with some groups in Queens [New York City, New York].  I was, you know, I grew up with that.  But he said why not rap to a guy who was singing an opera in German.  Well guess what?  Eventually you're gonna find somebody who can rap and sing an opera in German.  You were talking to one.  But you still were trying to divide them as if they were not, rap was not serious.  Well, rap was part of my consciousness growing up in Queens, New York, even though I didn't sing it, but I could do some of it some of the time because it's what I heard, like Leonard Bernstein said, it was in me.  It doesn't make it less serious.  But that conversation I had with that interviewer, the conversation that Bernstein had about "West Side Story," those are the kinds of serious conversations that artists who are into the genius of music, don't waste their times trying to divide, all they try to do is bring together so they can get in the room with the genius of it and be inspired.
Story_ID: 113828
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell us a little bit about your family now.  You've got--
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Speaker 1: --two children at least, at the last count when we were, where, when, when you married [to HM Alfreda Burke] you had two children--
Speaker 2: Two children.
Speaker 1: --and a wife.  And then and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So---
Speaker 2: Well, these are brilliant guys, Jared [Dixon] and Dean [Perrin, Jr.]. Dean is a year older.  Dean is twenty-four now and he's at DePaul University [Chicago, Illinois] getting his degree in sports medicine, I mean, sports management.  And he wants to work in the field of sports.  Dean has his equity card which I mentioned earlier from "Show Boat" [by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein, II] and we're excited about Dean.  He's a great guy and extraordinary kind soul.  And he reminds me of [HM President] Barack Obama a lot in the sense that, very even keel, sensitive, and just a beautiful young man.  And I enjoy watching Dean so much.  And then there's Jared from my first marriage.  He's a year younger.  Jared is from Southern Connecticut University [Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven, Connecticut].  And he has his degree in liberal arts and he's now in the music business.  He's actually been casted a couple times up in Boston.  He played a couple of roles, of all roles Booker T. Washington in "Ragtime" [by Terrence McNally, Lynn Ahrens, and Stephen Flaherty].  And he's gonna play, he just finished playing "In the Heights" [by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Quiara Alegria Hudes] in a small repertory theater [SpeakEasy Stage Company] in Boston [Massachusetts] and he's going back to Boston to do two more shows this coming winter.  And he is into pop music and writing music and recording music and, and he's beautiful and has a kind, he is a kind soul, a great kid and I'm very, very proud of Jared and extraordinary actor.  Boy, he's, Jared's a great actor and a, a wonderful singer as well.  So he's great.  And I put the two together as, it's hard to walk through the malls with those two.  You know, the girls they seem to find their ways, watching those two walk down the hallway when its extraordinary, but at the end of the day, the, the boys are they're exposed to a lot.  They have been exposed to a lot from being on the road with The Tenors [Three Mo' Tenors], in opera, Broadway, television, recordings.  Jared went to Music and Art High School [The High School of Music and Art, part of the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts in New York City, New York], graduate from there.  And Dean, you know, you know, it's interesting watching them having to navigate around their friends who some know that they have this wealth of experience in terms of their exposure to the arts in that's regard, in that regard, and some of them don't.  And the ones who don't, don't quite get it 'cause they don't have the vocabulary to comprehend what it is that the kids have gone through.  And the ones who do, have to find a way to feel comfortable around the two of them because they have to be careful that they don't speak beyond their pool of friends at that moment because, you know, they don't want to, you know, come off the wrong way but they're sensitive in that regard too.  So I would call it they're politically astute about their environment even amongst their friends given their, their backdrop and, of, of exposure.  But Dean is a, Dean Perrin and Jared Dixon, those are our two boys and 23, 24 and great guys.  And, and we're just excited about what they're gonna do, excited.
Story_ID: 113829
Speaker 1: I think I know the answer to this but does it, is it, is it challenging at all being married to someone [HM Alfreda Burke] in the same profession who is somewhat the same?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's challenging, the profession is challenging by itself, you know.  And these are the things that are important to Alfreda and I, it's being able to stand there with her or she with me and we're able to read what's going on and be able to comfort each other, good, bad, or indifferent.  And the challenges of the business is that, you know, first of all we're entrepreneurs.  We have our own company [DiBurke, Inc.].  We make our living as artists.  We pay our bills as artists.  We're like everybody else.  We have to depend on the phone to ring.  We do have management that represents a couple of different interests of ours whether it be classical music or whether it be theater or whether it be television.  And then we have our partnerships with the Auditorium Theatre [Chicago, Illinois], specifically on our new show ["Songs of a Dream"] now.  And so, you know, we have to make business decisions and like everybody else, file our taxes and pay our bills and create work.  And standing with Alfreda to do that, I couldn't think of a better person to stay, 'cause she's just a great lady.  At the end of the day Alfreda is a lover, but I admire her.  She's a great lady.  She's a lady's lady.  And she's extraordinarily talent, brilliant mind, and so it's easy for me to support her because she has so much to offer and so, you know, I just try to get in there and, and stand with her as hard, as best I can all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm not quite a little, I'm not quite right either, (laughter) you know.  I'm a little nuts.  I'm an artist, though.
Story_ID: 113830
Speaker 1: All right.  So now tell us about DiBurke Incorporated?
Speaker 2: DiBurke Inc. is our S corporation.  We started it in 2004.  And mainly the corporation at first was to handle our contracts.  We had to get incorporated for that purpose.  And then all of a sudden we got into partnerships with other entities.  One mainly is, I said here before that the Auditorium Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] we coproduced a show ["Songs of a Dream"] together that we're touring around the country.  We recorded a new album, the new show is coming out.  And our, our intention is to create other products and create jobs for other people to work through the same touring lanes that we have developed with Auditorium Theatre.  And they have the same desire too, is to produce and create more products for people to get work and to create work and we built partnerships.  Now we also are looking to create opportunities for scholarships and working with more organizations to provide more assets to people who have a need or are trying to accomplish things to.  So our company it's, it's young, it's new, its building partnerships, creating more opportunities for capital to be, they have that as an asset to really affect people's lives and put them in a position to be successful.  So one is art, production, and also philanthropy.  So that's what our, our goals are for our company.
Story_ID: 115575
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I have not asked you that we need to address or deal with before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I think we covered everything.  Yeah, we covered everything.  Mainly, you know, I talked about Roland Hayes and Paul Robeson and [Regine] Crespin and [James] Conlon and [HM] Quincy Jones.  Those were important people to me, my parents [Dorothy Jean Black Dixon and Samuel Edward Dixon].  And then, of course, all the institutions that we've been involved in.  Yes, I think so.
Speaker 1: Well there is something I guess I didn't ask and that is like, how did your, and I can only imagine one way they would feel about your career but what do they, they think or what do they say about your career, your, your parents?
Speaker 2: My parents?  That's an interesting question because I know they're proud, you know, they're very proud of what I've been able to accomplish.  And, and I know they're very happy when the church members are able to come to the events, I mean their church has been able to come to all of the PBS specials filmed in New York City [New York] and those are great moments for our church members.  And let me add that there, my brother, Sam Dixon, who is an artist and painter, he has been a big source of help, and my Aunt Naomi [ph.] who, who is a master cook.  Those two and Bobby Black who has been my, my uncle has been a part of my career in a lot of different ways.  Those, plus them, they, they, they give me the feeling what my mother and father are thinking.  It's through their eyes that they hint what my parents thinking.  Like my Aunt Naomi was at "Zwerg" ["Der Zwerg" by Alexander Zemlinsky].  It's how Naomi would talk that tells me how my mother feels.  And my mother she would, she would not necessarily come out and say anything but she would smile and she'd be happy and but I could, I can listen to my uncle or I can talk to my brother, Sam, and, and get a sense of how they must feel.  They're at very even keel with all of us, and it's interesting, most interesting thing to observe--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --is watching my parents be proud but they don't necessarily say "Oh, I'm proud of you, you did a great job."  That's not the way they do it.  They, they actually stand there and, and they, very comfortable, and they look at me and I can tell that they're very comfortable and very happy that I have executed and gone out and done, I've been blessed to do what I've, been, been blessed to do.  So they've never, they'll never, they never have been the type that will, my Aunt Naomi does that (laughter).  You know, pop a cooler and grab you.  And, and my uncle will say that.  But it's the way they express themselves, their love language, it's different, it's very different.  And I'm, and it's interesting 'cause I, I had to learn how to decipher that as an artist.  As a child I used to, you know, I'd go home and my mother and, you know, everything's fine, my father and everything's fine but as an artist the support is different.  But they give the support in such wonderful ways because they just, they're always there.  My parents are always there.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So, yeah.
Story_ID: 115576
Speaker 1: Well, the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Ooh, (laughter).  That's okay.  Whatever way people look at the body of work and whatever conclusions they, they, they have, it's okay with me.  I think, I'm hoping that as a songster, singer, artistic force, that I, I do something that cuts the lights on for somebody else.  That they, they're able to come this way, be inspired, and say, you know what, if he can do it, I can do it.  You know, I'm good with it.  Whatever the body of work puts out there, good, bad, or indifferent I'm good with it because of, you know, it's, you know, I don't, it's amazing thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.

Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Go ahead and tell us about that photograph.
Speaker 2: Well that's, my, that's me at I think three and a half, four years old, Christmas time.  And I wanna say that it looks like it's my grandmother's [Gertrude Black] house.  The paneling it's the basement of my grandmother's house.  It looks likes that's my grandmother's house three or four years old.
Speaker 1: And that's in Queens?
Speaker 2: And that's in Queens, New York [New York City, New York].  And that's the block of my home I was raised in Queens, New York in South Ozone Park outside of our home with my sister--
Speaker 1: Who?
Speaker 2: --and we had just moved, Andrea Dixon, my sister.  And I had to be at least four or five at that time.  That's Grant Park, Chicago [Illinois], before it become Millennium Park and the edifice was built in the city of Chicago for the Grant Park Music Festival.  That's gentleman right there is Mr. Walter Beinecker [sic, Walter Beinecke, Jr.] or Beinecke on the island of Nantucket [Massachusetts].  He actually was responsible with Joy Beinecke for the Osceola Foundation career grant to study at Mannes College of Music [now The Mannes School of Music at The New School, New York City, New York], Bachelors of Arts and Masters Music.
Speaker 1: And that's me posing for Essence Magazine.  No I'm only kidding (laughter).  Actually that's me, young, just trying to get some pictures done during college to have something that I can show when I hand my bio (unclear)
Speaker 2: About what year, year was done?
Speaker 1: I, I'd have to be 21, 22 at that time.
Speaker 2: That's '81 [1981]?
Speaker 1: '8-, '86 [1986].
Speaker 2: '86 [1986].
Speaker 1: I mean '86 [1986], '85 [1985], '86 [1986].  Yeah, that's the same thing.  Yeah, just in college the world looked like an oyster (laughter).
Speaker 2: Ah, "Ragtime", Toronto [Canada], just arrived first day of rehearsal on our way to Broadway but we're there in "Ragtime" in Toronto for a whole year.
Speaker 1: About what year?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That has to be 1996.  That's me playing at my father's [Samuel Edward Dixon] church, storefront church in Queens, New York, playing piano at the service and making these strange faces.  Who knows, I might have been singing.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Now this is Freedom--
Speaker 2: First Freedom Baptist Church in Queens, New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I
Speaker 2: And that's 1996 Auditorium Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] I was leaving the show "Show Boat" and on my way to Toronto to join the cast of "Ragtime".  And I was in the show with [HM] Alfreda [Burke] and that's where we were engaged at that theater in the city of Chicago there's a goodbye party.
Speaker 1: Oh, and these are our parents.  The woman in red is Alfreda's mother, Mamie Burke, and the woman next to her is my mother, Dorothy Dixon, and we were down stairs in the basement of First Mennonite, Mennonite Church here in the city of Chicago [Illinois] when my parents came to meet them for the first time when they came to see "Too Hot to Handel" here in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Those are our fathers.  On your left is my father, the taller gentleman with the glasses is Reverend Samuel E. Dixon.  And the gentleman on your right is Reverend John H. Burke [Jr.], my father-in-law.
Speaker 1: This is our wedding photo on a Monday night at First Mennonite Church and we're with our family, Mamie Burke and John Burke and Alfreda's sister, Renee Davis, Bill Davis, her husband, Danielle [ph.] and our older son, Dean Perrin [Jr.], and that's our wedding photograph at First Mennonite.
Speaker 2: That's a photograph of myself in Fontainebleau [France] with Bright Sheng, the composer of "Song of Majnun" and Chris Guardino [Christopher Guardino], another composer, and a violinist who was his friend, and our, our friend who was a pianist, Juan and that's when I was studying in France in 1987.
Speaker 1: Oh, this is a photograph of my Aunt Naomi [ph.] and my son, Jared Dixon.  And Aunt Naomi is the cook in the family and that took care of the whole family for many, many, many moons.  We ate well and Aunt Naomi is still cooking to this day.
Speaker 2: That's Alfreda and I exchanging vows and Reverend [John H.] Burke was the presiding officiate of our wedding that particular night, Monday night, and the next day we were on a plane ride to New York [New York City, New York] for "Ragtime" for previews because it was opening that week in 1998, that's Monday.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's "Rigoletto" [by Giuseppe Verdi] that me playing the Duke in Cincinnati Opera [Cincinnati, Ohio] with my good friend, Stephen Powell who introduced us.  Steven Powell is the gentleman in the red who introduced Alfreda and I back in 1992 at Lyric Opera [Lyric Opera of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois] and that's when we first met.
Speaker 2: This is another seen from the same production of wriggle, adult, "Rigoletto".  I'm the Duke sitting down getting ready to sing a passage or two of an aria at the time, yeah, Cincinnati Opera.
Speaker 1: This is with the United States Air Force in Washington, D.C. at Constitution Hall.  We were singing a concert and it was a lovely concert, and I think I was singing "Ah! Mes amis, quell jour de fete!" [from "La fille du regiment" by Gaetano Donizetti].  I can tell by the wideness of my mouth what those High C's look like.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And that's one of my head shots, my professional head shots currently today, that, that goes around in the industry.  That would be I, as The Dwarf in Los Angeles Opera [Los Angeles, California] production of "Der Zwerg", Alexander Zemlinksy, Zemlinsky.  And that's me playing the, I think lute coming out of the box as a dwarf in the production.  And that's the stage photograph of myself as The Dwarf in Los Angeles.  That was under the baton of Maestro James Conlon and part of the "Recovered Voice" series on the DVD that is now in circulation for purchase.
Speaker 2: And again, the very ornate costume The Dwarf, "Der Zwerg", L.A. Opera, 2008.
Speaker 1: So the cast him as a moor specifically?
Speaker 2: RODRICK DIXON: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.  This would be me, when I at Mannes College of Music [New York City, New York] singing.  I had a concert and I just don't remember where, I can tell by the suit, yeah it was my days at Mannes and singing.
Speaker 1: "Siamsa na nGael" Chicago Symphony Orchestra Symphony space with our good friends Bill Hughes, and Martin Sheen, myself, and good friends, Dr. Glenn and Cynthia Solomon, and Mel Katten and Renee [Katten] and Kathy Bliss and Judy Green.  Those are all the Auditorium Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] people and our good friend Martin Sheen.  We all are participated in the "Siamsa na nGael" with Old St. Pat's [Old St. Patrick's Church in Chicago, Illinois] for their Celtic celebration in the city of Chicago.
Speaker 2: You know, Martin Sheen's from Dayton [Ohio] too?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Speaker 1: Yeah, Dayton.  This is a famous photograph for me (laughter) because they put it, me on the cover of their poster for Mannes College of Music to draw attention to people to study there, and so I was so honored to be put on the photograph cover so I saved it.  And this, this has to be 1985, '86 [1986].  That was important.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was on the cover of my own college.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: It's a big deal.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Speaker 1: Ah, that's one of the great production photographs of this "The Dwarf" at LA Opera.  The Infanta, the famous photograph [sic, painting] of Las Meninas [by Diego Velazquez], 1600s and that they were re-creating that picture up there in the back of the stage as The Dwarf dies.
Speaker 2: These are frameable aren't they?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I haven't framed them yet.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: And that's the opening segment and with the full stage of that production.  It was a beautiful production.  A camera shot, filmed, and just lovely coming out of the box there.
Speaker 2: And that's a photograph of the Infanta actually toying with The Dwarf, and as you can see, she's way above him and I'm on my knees, I have to keep that frame as small as possible so I can look like a dwarf even though I'm 5' 9".
Speaker 1: (Laughter)
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And this is my lovely family.  My grandfather [Henderson Dixon], my father's father in the middle with my younger brother, Elijah [Dixon], under his hands, and my little sister, Jeanette [Dixon], and to my left, my mother, Dorothy Dixon, my younger brother, Leroy Dixon, myself, Rodrick Dixon, and then if you go to the right would be my sister Ann [Andrea Dixon], my father, Samuel Dixon, and Nathan, his brother.  And that's a family shot inside our home in Queens, New York.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's it.
