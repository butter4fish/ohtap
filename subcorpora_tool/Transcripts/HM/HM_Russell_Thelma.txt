Story_ID: 275249
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Ernest Cox, Sr.] side, and we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Gearldine, G-E-A-R-L-D-I-N-E, F-U-L-K-S, Fulks [sic. Gerline Fulks Cox].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure but I think she was born in, also in Charleston [Missouri].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Well what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side of the family?  How, how far back can you trace the ancestors?
Speaker 2: Not too much.  I can only go back to my aunts, which was my mother's sister.  I don't know any more about their family or more than that because my mother passed when I was three years old and it wasn't like I had the time to talk with her and learn the family.  So I don't know other than my aunts, her sisters, that's all I know.
Speaker 1: Did they talk about their, their parents and where their parents came from or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Nothing, oh--
Speaker 2: No, it never came up in a conversation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you never met your grandparents on that side--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --either?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how old were you when your mother died?
Speaker 2: Three, three years old, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did your aunts ever talk about growing up in Charleston and what, what it was like for them or--
Speaker 2: I've heard them only speak of how they had to pick cotton and the riots, the lynchings, I've heard a lot, talk about those.  And I can remember one lynching where they dragged this man down the main street of Charleston and set him on fire and dragged him behind a car.  But that's, that's about all that I've ever heard them talk about was the job market wasn't too good and how some of the blacks had been treated in Missouri.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was a small child but I can remember that lynching for one thing.  And that's about as far back as I can go for that.
Story_ID: 275250
Speaker 1: Where is Charleston [Missouri] in terms of the rest of Missouri, I mean, is it south of St. Louis [Missouri] or is it--
Speaker 2: It's south of St. Louis, right across the bridge from Cairo, Illinois.  Very, very, very small town.  It's near Caruthersville [Missouri] and Hayti [Missouri], south of St. Louis.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's the area that, that's the area that Mark Twain writes about, isn't it?  I think they call Little Egypt [Southern Illinois] or, I mean, that, the area around where Illinois and Missouri come together (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) connects.
Speaker 1: --with Kentucky and all that, it's a--
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hum
Speaker 1: What's that (unclear)?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: They now have, I can remember when I was smaller there was a, a boarded, a bridge that was made out of boards and as you crossed that going from Illinois into Missouri, the boards would rattle, I remember that.  But now it's a very large, beautiful bridge that takes you across and you can see the rivers meeting at the Ohio River and the rivers meeting and the water turning and churning as you cross.  It's been a long time since I was down there but I do remember those, those few things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now those stories they told about the lynchings and riots and those sorts of things, those, I guess, had to have taken place not maybe, within maybe twenty years of your, your own birth, I guess, at least.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were, I was a small child but I can remember, I don't know whether it affected me that much that I remembered it but I was a very young child because I was six or seven when we moved to Fort Wayne [Indiana] but I can remember that very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your [maternal] aunts told, did they have any other stories that they talked about?
Speaker 2: No, that's about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm sure there were but me being a younger child those type of things were discussed among the elders and you didn't even dare talk too much about those things but I do remember that, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well can, can you give us your, do you know, well, let me go back a little bit and say, do you know if your mother [Gerline Fulks Cox] had a chance to go to school as she was growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  My mother was a teacher.  And I think that's where I've got some of my teaching abilities from.  She taught in the schools in Charleston.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That, trying to think of some, okay, so she did, she had a chance to go to school and she was a teacher.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you know what school she went to?
Speaker 2: No, no, I don't.
Speaker 1: And what did her sisters do?  You know, what did your aunts do?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: Did your aunts teach as well?  Did they get a, with, with the teachers (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, no.  My mother was the only teacher in the family and the rest of them I think just did housework for different white people of the community.  In fact, I think, my sister-in-law and a cousin that still lives down there, worked for some of the ancestors of the white people that my aunt worked for.
Story_ID: 275251
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name was Ernest Cox, Sr.
Speaker 1: And, and how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Ernest, E-R-N-E-S-T--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --C-O-X.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I really don't know.  But I know he was born in Caruthersville, Missouri.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how do you spell Caruthersville?
Speaker 2: C (laughter) I, I really don't know. C-R-U-T-H-E-R-V-I-L-L-E [sic. Caruthersville].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: So, so your father was born in Caruthersville, Missouri?
Speaker 2: Missouri, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-um.
Speaker 1: And so would you guess he was born probably turn of the century, 1900 or so or, or was he, do, do you have any idea of what age your parents were when you were born?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Were they in their twenties or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --thirties or--
Speaker 2: No.  They weren't, they weren't too old and I'm pretty sure that they were in their twenties 'cause, there were three of us and I remember my mother [Gerline Fulks Cox] was in her twenties because when we purchased a stone for her grave seem like to me it was twenty-four or twenty-six somewhere, she was that (unclear), about that age, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I guess, maybe about 1910 or there abouts that they were--
Speaker 2: I had no idea.  If I had known (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So somewhere that gets us in the ballpark at least.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause if they were born in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --turn of the century they'd a been in their thirties when you were born.  You were born in '31 [1931], so it's, you know, that's thirty years, you know, if they were born in 1900s so I would say about 1910 that's probably close.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Pretty close.  But, so what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Not a thing.  I guess, (laughter) I guess I didn't, I was too young to ask when we were in Missouri.  And I didn't realize that you needed this information, I might could have gotten some but I don't know too much about their, his ancestors.  I know more about my aunts on my mother's side because I didn't know my dad's, other than a, one brother and that had migrated from the South to South Bend, Indiana, but other than that I did not know his family.
Speaker 1: So you never met his, his parents [Belle Wallace and Sam Cox] or anything?
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: So you didn't know your grandparents (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Did he ever talk about, about 'em, or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: He never talked about his mother and father, or father?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well did, did he have a big family in Caruthersville, do you know?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I never met them because we moved to Fort Wayne [Indiana] when I was about six years old.  And if he had family there, we never went back to visit or anything like that.  He came to Fort Wayne to find steady work but I never met, other than his brother that lived in South Bend, and his name was Robert [Cox], but other than him and his wife, I did not know any of, of his family on the, on my father's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is, is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: If it is I don't know it.
Speaker 1: So no, none of your aunts ever talked about how they met or anything?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 275252
Speaker 1: Do you know what your mother [Gerline Fulks Cox] died of?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Twelve minutes.
Speaker 1: I'd rather not say because she was killed, so I'd rather not mention that but I was three years old at the time.  I was three, there was a brother that was five [Willis Cox], and one was seven [Ernest Cox, Jr.], there was three of us, three children.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So is your mother, your, your mother died in Missouri?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Before and, and you moved to--
Speaker 1: But I came to Fort Wayne [Indiana] with my dad [Ernest Cox, Sr.].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And at that time my stepmother, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  So, so he came, did he have relatives here already when he moved up here?
Speaker 1: No--
Speaker 2: He just had the brother [Robert Cox] in South [Bend, Indiana] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But there were other friends of his that had came to Fort Wayne in order to find work.  And, I guess, they kind of passed the word along.  During the, during that time, the '40s [1940s], there were a lot of migration from the South to Fort Wayne or to the North.  And it just happened my father was one of those that came to Fort Wayne to seek work.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you, you came when you were about six years old?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: About 1937, I guess, and did, do you remember much about Missouri, you know--
Speaker 1: No.  I've been back a few times because my middle brother [Willis Cox] was raised by an aunt and I went back to visit him, he stayed there and that's where he lived with an aunt in Charleston [Missouri].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Where I was brought to Fort Wayne with my dad and my other brother [Ernest Cox, Sr.] lived with another aunt in Illinois.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What was the aunt's name in, well what were your aunts' names?
Speaker 1: The one that raised my brother that lived in Charleston, her name was Lillie Mae Townsend [ph.] and she raised my middle brother.  And the one that raised my older brother was Lee Anna Whittaker [ph.], she was the sister on my dad's side and they lived in Joliet, Illinois for years and years and years and then they moved to Fort Wayne also.
Story_ID: 275253
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?  The first memory that you remember ever having?
Speaker 2: I don't know what you mean an earlier childhood--
Speaker 1: Earliest, earliest, the first memory.  Do you have a first--
Speaker 2: No, not really, not really.  My biggest memories or worthwhile memories, I guess, would be when we moved to Fort Wayne [Indiana] and I started going to school here and but other than that, I don't, I don't have too much memory.  That's been a long time ago (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now did, did you go to school in Charleston [Missouri] at all?
Speaker 2: No, yes, first, the first, I think first grade or something like that and then I went to, finished here, grade school at Harmar School [Fort Wayne, Indiana] when is no longer in Fort Wayne but was over on the corner of Jefferson [Street] and, Jefferson and Maumee [sic. Harmar Street], I believe.
Speaker 1: And it's called, what is it?
Speaker 2: Harmar, H-A-R-M-A-R.
Speaker 1: H-A-R-M-A-R.
Speaker 2: Harmar Elementary.
Story_ID: 275254
Speaker 1: Can you tell us what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The sights and smells and sounds of growing up?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter) not too many because at that time mostly, I remember we had an, an old coal stove in the house, there were no furnaces in the homes.  And we lived on Douglas Street here in Fort Wayne [Indiana].  And I remember the heat from the old coal stove, how red it would get.  And I don't know why they didn't have fires back in those days with those potbelly stoves, I remember that.  And I also remember the Saturday night baths.  Is that the type of thing you're asking me?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The Saturday night bath when you would put the tin stove, tin tub, by the red hot stove and take a bath.  Those type of things.  But I don't know, I don't remember too much in the smells but I do remember that's how we took a bath on Saturday night to get ready for Sunday school for the next day.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any, any sights and sounds or--
Speaker 2: No.  When you move from, when you migrate from the South, everything is so different.
Speaker 1: How, how was it different from the South?
Speaker 2: Well one thing, when you go to school in the South, it's an all-black school.  When you come to Fort Wayne, Indiana, which is in the North, you're in a mixed classroom and most of the time there are more white children in your class than black children and I can remember that at Harmar School [Fort Wayne, Indiana].  And being a little afraid because children from the South are used to the lynchings and the mobs and being afraid and you don't know whether you should answer questions or talk back to the white teachers.  It was years before I had even one black teacher here in Fort Wayne, all the teachers were white people.  And when you migrate from the South where you've been used to lynchings and not talking back as they called it, that's quite a change.  Even when I was in high school [Central High School, Fort Wayne, Indiana] here, there was white teachers only.  Very, very, I think, in my classes there was about three hundred of us and there was like twenty or thirty blacks in the classes here in Fort Wayne.
Speaker 1: Twenty or thirty out of, out of a whole--
Speaker 2: Three hundred.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, black children.  And that was during the time that the migration [Great Migration] from the South was very prevalent in Fort Wayne and, I guess, all the North.  Because during that time in Fort Wayne we had the International Harvester, we had GE [General Electric], several big factories.  And I do remember that when new black children came into the classroom, and it was very unthoughtful of us to do that, but they used to call them Rushings in that they were rushing into the North to, where their parents came to get those big jobs at the Harvester and black people did, black people did.  When they migrated to Fort Wayne, the International Harvester, which was a truck plant, they were lucky enough to get ahold to those jobs and I guess they retired from those factories, General Motors, GE, International Harvester truck company.  Fort Wayne was a thriving community and I do remember a lot of blacks migrating here for jobs.
Story_ID: 275255
Speaker 1: Can you describe your neighborhood for us?  What, what kind of house did you live in and what was it, what did the neighborhood look like and who lived there?
Speaker 2: Here in Fort Wayne [Indiana]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, the neighborhood is not there anymore, the houses have been torn down.  But the neighborhood that I lived in was over on, when we first came to Fort Wayne we lived on Hayden Street, the 600 block, which was a brick home.  But during that time people were very nice to each other.  And it wouldn't be odd for two or three families to live in the house with, together, because people were kind to you and if you knew you came to Fort Wayne in order to get a job.  So two or three families would live in one house in order to help the other person get started and then when you got started your dad, or got a job, then you would move out into another house.  And we moved from Hayden Street to Brackenridge [Street] which is all in the same block area.  And then from Brackenridge Street, at that time, my dad [Ernest Cox, Sr.] was working for American Coal and Supply [Company], he delivered coal.  And but that was a steady, paying job because people did not have, like I said, furnaces, so it's nothing to have you bring a load of coal to your house and dump it in the basement and that's what he worked at.  But he worked there for years and years and then he, as he got older, he got a job with the city as a janitor.  Then we moved from Brackenridge Street to Douglas [Street].  And that's where I went to high school [Central High School, Fort Wayne, Indiana] from Douglas Street.  And we had our own house then, we didn't live in a home with another family but we had a small home there and it had a upstairs and down stairs.
Story_ID: 275256
Speaker 1: Oh, we were talking about the neighborhood (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was telling you about when we moved from one, from living with multi-families in one house to, we finally got our own home, own house.
Speaker 1: It was pretty, I think, what you described is kind of the rule for a lot of places that black folks would move to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --during the Great Migration.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: They'd live in a room in a big--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --building or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a big house or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --townhouse or something.  In Chicago [Illinois], I mean, that's what they did and, you know, even in my hometown, the same thing.
Speaker 2: I imagine there was a lot of migration from, in Chicago, they come to big Chicago.  But I remember Fort Wayne [Indiana] had quite a big migration movement in the '40s [1940s] and the '50s [1950s], um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now was, was there a black side of town here in Fort Wayne?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  There was what, what we called the, my--it's against the law to let your dog roam.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  We're back to speed.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So I was asking you if there was black side of town--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --in Fort Wayne during the--
Speaker 1: There was, yeah, I'm sure there was a black and a white side of town.
Speaker 2: Did, did you have a name for it?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It was called The Avenue and that's where mostly of the black businesses were on The Avenue which was Lafayette Street at the time.  And oh, we had the, the normal black businesses like The Huddle Barbecue [ph.] and a dance hall, and the, The Elks [Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks] where people gathered on Saturday, Friday and Saturday night to have a good time.  Several taverns, restaurant down there and that, that was called The Avenue.  And then black people lived in the southeast which was four or five blocks from The Avenue.  But that's mostly where we lived on, in the, there was a place called the Rolling Mill [Fort Wayne Rolling Mills] and that was out west and there were several families that lived out there.  And several streets that just blacks lived on like Hugh Street and Douglas Street, Brackenridge [Street] and Hayden Street, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  Now how would you describe yourself as a little girl?  What were you like and, as a little girl, and what did you like to do?
Speaker 1: I've, I've, as a little girl, I guess, I did the normal things that little girls do, played jacks, skate.  In grade school [Harmar School, Fort Wayne, Indiana] we had, did have sidewalks here in Fort Wayne and that was where we did most of the skating.  And there was one black, there was skate, one skating rink where blacks went once a week.
Speaker 2: What was the name of it?
Speaker 1: Oh, gosh.  I can't remember, right--
Speaker 2: It's okay.
Speaker 1: Crease, Crease, Crease Skating Rink [Fort Wayne, Indiana].
Speaker 2: Oh, how do you spell it--
Speaker 1: Crease, see.
Speaker 2: How do you spell it?
Speaker 1: C-R-E-A-S-E [ph.], I think.  And I think Tuesday and Wednesday, Tuesday or Wednesday night was black night and we all would catch the bus and go out to Crease to skate.  We had a couple doctors in town, black doctors in town and everybody went to these doctors.  Black churches have always been plentiful.  My parents, my father [Ernest Cox, Sr.] and stepmother, my dad was a deacon of the church and it was down too on Brackenridge Street called Mount Olive Baptist Church [Fort Wayne, Indiana]--
Story_ID: 275257
Speaker 1: I was asking you what kind of little girl you were and what did you like to do.  And then, did anything bother you when you were a little girl?
Speaker 2: When I was a little girl?  No, I went to school and mostly came back home and played with friends and I was a normal girl.  The only thing that bothered me, my stepmother wasn't the kindest woman there was.  And that used to bother me because I thought, I, I was the, and I didn't, I was not one to have a whole lot of new clothes and new shoes and new things because I was, I guess, 'cause I was a stepchild and I just didn't get those things.  And that was a sad part in my childhood because mostly what I wore or had was always given to me or hand-me-downs as they called it then.  But I've never been one to complain too much.  And I always figured well things will get better and they did, and they did, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she wasn't the kindest person but, you know, it didn't hurt me too much.
Speaker 1: Now who did your family consist of, I guess, when you finally moved here to Fort Wayne [Indiana]?  Was it your father [Ernest Cox, Sr.], you had a stepmother, you said (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, my father, stepmother, and my stepmother raised her grandson, so I guess he would be my step-nephew 'cause her daughter wasn't here in Fort Wayne, she came to Fort Wayne years, years later but he was raised with us, he was two years younger than I.  And at that time being a stepchild, he got most of the new clothes and the new bikes and the new stuff like that, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she was clearly, now how did your father, I mean, your father didn't seem to, that didn't seem to bother him (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, he was just complacent and whatever she said that's what went, that what would go down, you know.  Some men are like that, whatever the woman says that's the way it is.  But it was rough during that time.  I had a terrible, I think it was a pretty sad childhood but I'm okay.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: I'm okay.
Speaker 1: --you know, that was a time period, we're talking about from 1931.
Speaker 2: I'm telling, talking, taking the, talking of the years of the, of the early '40s [1940s], '39 [1939], early '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Well you grew up, I mean, from the very beginning, you, you grew up right in the heart of the Depression, the Great Depression anyway, so--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --it's, it wasn't very good for anybody, I guess, during a period, that period of time from 1930 to, or '29 [1929] to, through the end, the end of the war [World War II, WWII], you know, so.
Speaker 2: I grew, I grew up most of my growing up was here in the Fort Wayne.  And like I said, the only thing I missed was not being with my brothers [Ernest Cox, Jr. and Willis Cox] but eventually one of them moved here, which my oldest, was my oldest brother and I can remember before we came to Fort Wayne he was the one that kind of would do for me.  So a lot of people have bad childhoods but you don't dwell on it, you move on.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You move on--
Story_ID: 275258
Speaker 1: Now, you went to Harmar School [Fort Wayne, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Harmar, Harmar School over on Jefferson Street.
Speaker 1: And how did you like school and did you have a favorite subject or--
Speaker 2: Oh, I always loved school.  I always loved school.  I was a good student.  I got A's and Bs, I was a good student.  And somehow the teachers always seemed to like me so I could get, even in high school [Central High School, Fort Wayne, Indiana], I had favorite teachers and I had several that I could talk with.  And I loved the subjects.  And I always said that I was gonna be a teacher and I did take college, when I went to college, I, here in Fort Wayne [Indiana], I took elementary education, majored in elementary education.  So I loved school.  And for some reason it seemed like that God kind of placed me with working with children all my life.  So my training what, I never finished college because I went into Gingerbread House [Inc., Fort Wayne, Indiana] but there was my teaching ability, I used there too.  So, but I loved school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I still read a lot and study a lot.
Speaker 1: Now from what I read about you, now you, you were very, you, you kind of took a leadership role in school in terms of speaking, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at events and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were a lead in a play I saw.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now how did these things come about?  How did you get involved in, in being a lead spokesperson?
Speaker 2: I, I don't know other than, it's just, you know, your life, I feel your life is destined to do some things.  And I think that was one of the callings that the good Lord have gave me and wanted me to do.  I was always asked to take a lead in the plays and to work with the younger children and I was just always kind of a leader.  And even with children and young adults at the time, although I was maybe say two or three years older than they were, I still would take on the role of showing them what to do and how to do.  I think that's just one of the things that your life is, whether you ever get a chance to fulfill it, but I think your life is destined of what you're gonna do and what you should do.  I think it's all laid out from you, from birth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You don't think that, really think that, you know, it, well, okay.  Did, well why do you think that?  I just (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Why do I think that?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's it all laid out for you?
Speaker 2: I think that because what I have done in life, even though I didn't seek it, it came to me on a level where I could do what I had to do.  For instance, when I was in high school, maybe we're jumping from grade school [Harmar School, Fort Wayne, Indiana] to high school [Central High School, Fort Wayne, Indiana], but when I was in high school, I think the good Lord knew that that I was destined to work with children because I became a camp volunteer.  And from being a volunteer it grew into a four year summer job.  And before that I had to work, catch the bus, and go to work for a white lady that lived out on Calhoun Street. Calhoun was still the main street in Fort Wayne at that time.  And we rode to the end of the line and there I had to work for this white lady and that was just not me.  So after about a first summer of that, I think this is when I became a camp volunteer.  And from the camp volunteer it became into a summer part-time job for me.  And I just feel that from that I went to Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the USA], Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America], and that type of thing.  I just feel God had his way of showing me that I want you to work with children and that's where, the reason I think I was so successful in whatever I tried to do and it's always was with children.

Speaker 1: You were the keynote speaker at, at, now this is just one, on one paper I read, but can, can you tell us about some of the speaking roles you played in, when you were still in high school [Central High School, Fort Wayne, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Well I wasn't in the drama club but I was always asked to kind of be leaders for some of the classes that we took.  For the art class and also other than the camp project, for the teenagers, underage classmates, under-classmens.  I don't know why I was chosen for some of these things but it just wasn't.  And also in church [Mount Olive Baptist Church, Fort Wayne, Indiana], when it came to some of the, the roles for the plays in church and other young people to or showing them what to do, it, it was just there.  I don't know why but it was just there.
Speaker 1: Now I remember you, you included in your packet a folder about a program, I guess, of a church program, a youth day.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Where it was just amazing the number of youth involved in this and everybody had a part (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, there are so many parts and then you were the, the major (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Speaker for that Sunday.
Speaker 1: --you, you, you had the major--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you, you were the major speaker but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah, you know.
Speaker 2: I guess, because I wasn't afraid to get up and do, some people are shy.  But I think that was one of my ways to of climbing out of a, a small hole that I was in because I just knew things had to get better.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So things, even though they weren't that good at home--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when you went to church and when you went to school you had--
Speaker 2: She was--I had an out.  And I was always in a leadership or a lead role of something of what we should do and what we shouldn't do.
Speaker 1: Now, as I was saying, the thing that impressed me about that program wasn't just that you were the keynote speaker was the, it was the, the organizational, I guess, well it just seems as though the, the program shows there's a high level of organization involved at your church--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --to have a program like that.  So many assignments and so many people involved in it and do you consider yourself the beneficiary of, of people that knew how to organize for youth, you know, because (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well at that time, I didn't, I was just asked and I did.  But there were several things that, when I got a little older working with the cotillion and the beautillion for the young people.  We had what we called a career day and we would get speakers to come in and speak to the teenagers.  And also we would take them to the theater.  And it was just some things that had to be done and I've always been a person look like either asked to do it or it had to get done and I was always been a person that got things done.  I don't know why or what but I never thought of it that way before but I was always asked the--, "Thelma [HistoryMaker Thelma Lee Russell] do this and can you do this," and I would always say yes.
Story_ID: 275260
Speaker 1: Now who were your favorite teachers, and you can name 'em, you know.  This is (unclear).
Speaker 2: Some of my favorite teachers--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in high school [Central High School, Fort Wayne, Indiana]?
Speaker 1: Well grade school [Harmar School, Fort Wayne, Indiana] and high school--
Speaker 2: Ah--
Speaker 1: --going back to the grade school.
Speaker 2: I don't remember too many in grade school 'cause a lot of 'em, that we were, had in grade school, came to the high schools.  Mrs. Blanche Huddle [ph.], she was my art teacher but I don't care how busy she was, she always would take time to talk with me.  And for some reason she thought my paintings were one, in fact, I won several [Alliance for Young Artists & Writers] Gold Keys for my painting and I love art.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now what's the Gold Key?
Speaker 2: The Gold Key is when you win state.  You have a theme each year and you send your picture, and I don't remember what it was even, but I do remember, I think I sent you a copy of that Gold Key program.  My art teacher was my favorite 'cause I love art, I think.  But she always took time to talk with me too.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you were a painter that everybody--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh, well, I wasn't--
Speaker 1: --a lot of people liked, I guess.
Speaker 2: --better than everybody but I was in the running.
Speaker 1: Well if you won the Gold Key Awards--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that's a, those, those are the Gold Key is given to, to, you know, outstanding students from all over the state, right--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) they compete for?
Speaker 2: --yes, uh-huh.  Mrs. Spence [ph.], she was my civics teacher, and she was the sweetest person.  I think when I was in high school [Central High School, Fort Wayne, Indiana], because of some of my home programs and things that weren't going so nicely there, I think I kind of leaned on these teachers and they were kind enough to kind of take me under their wing and say things will be better, things will be okay.  But she was my civics teacher.  And there was--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Mr. Sprunger [ph.]. And, and I loved Mrs. Ingram [ph.] who was my English teacher and typing teacher and those were the rooms I got good grades in.  If you love to be there you'll do your best and they, they were.  So I, I, I, I had pretty good schooling 'cause I loved it and the teachers were sweet, were nice.
Story_ID: 275261
Speaker 1: Now when you were in high school, now you, you went to Central High School [Fort Wayne, Indiana], right?
Speaker 2: I went to Central.
Speaker 1: Right.  And were, were you involved in, you know, act, high school activities, did they have like clubs and that sort of thing and did, did you run--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the art club and the science club, I was in.  And some girl, GAA [Girls Athletic Association] activities which was the girls gym programs and that type of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't do tumbling or nothing like that but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we were there for, just for the sport after school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now did you, when you were in high school did you think about going to college?  Did you think, think that was an option?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Going to college was, is always on my mind I guess because I wanted to teach.  I wanted to teach.  And when I got out of college after the tour of duty with my husband [Robert Russell, Jr.] in the [U.S. military] service, this is when I was working and going to Saint Francis College [University of Saint Francis, Fort Wayne, Indiana]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --majoring in elementary education.
Speaker 1: But at the time you were in high school, did you, I mean, were there plans to go to college?
Speaker 2: Well it wasn't plans but I knew I wanted to go.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I knew I wanted to go.  And I think with these teachers kind of taking me under their wing, I wanted to do what they were doing and that's when I said that I'm gonna be a teacher one day.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did, did anybody, I mean, so when you were, when you were a senior in high school, when you're getting ready to graduate, from what you're saying you didn't really have a college selected or didn't know how to do it, to get in or, or did you?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't choose, I got, in high school, I think I was too anxious to get married when I, my senior year of high school.  And I got married right out of, I graduated high school at seventeen.  And I graduated on the eighth of June and got married on the twenty-fourth of June.  So at that time I knew that's what I wanted to do but I didn't pursue it at that time.  And one reason why was because my husband went into service and we followed him over to Germany.  And when you get married the babies start coming and all of that kind of stuff.  And so it was only after we came back and I got settled that I started going to college.  I was--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --working and going in the evening and taking additional courses for elementary education, majoring in elementary education.
Story_ID: 275262
Speaker 1: How'd you meet your husband [Robert Russell, Jr.]?  I mean, where was, was, was he in school with you or--
Speaker 2: No.  We lived on Douglas Street and he lived, migrated from the South, from Alabama to Fort Wayne [Indiana].  And that family too came to Fort Wayne seeking work.  And when I had to go to school [Central High School, Fort Wayne, Indiana], I had to cross the street which was Monroe Street where he lived.  And going and coming to and from school is where I met him because he would be on the corners and that's where I met him, going to and from school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did he join the [U.S. military] service, was, was he in the service then or--
Speaker 2: No.  He joined the service after we got married in '50 [1950], 1950.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, so shortly after you got married you, you went to, you joined him in, he was in Germany I know at one point--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is that where he was stationed during the whole--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We went to Germany about a half a year, about six months after he had got there, we were joined, we joined him in the service.  In fact, my oldest daughter [Marla Jean Russell Williams] was born in Germany.  And almost my second son [Michael J. Russell] but he was born in Merced, California and that's because just about a month after we got back, not quite a month because I thought I was gone deliver on the plane coming back but it waited, it, the baby, waited 'til (laughter) we got to Merced, California.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your, your daughter was born in Baumholder [Germany] is that what--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Baumholder, Germany.
Speaker 2: Baumholder, Germany (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) right.  And we've interviewed--
Speaker 2: That was quite an experience, yeah, because there was still a lot of ruins from the World War II [WWII].  In fact, you would still see buildings look like they were still smoldering.  And we lived, when we first got there, in a German home because they were just building up dependents apartments.  And being a black couple, I wasn't used to living in a German home.  And we had to catch the bus to go back to the base, the PX [post exchange] to get groceries and so forth.  And it would just be my, my little boy and I on the bus and I was scared to death because they would look at you so, like who is this?  Or why is this black persons on the bus?  And I don't think Germany at that time was used to black people either.  And so I was glad when dependent housing became available and we moved.  When we would leave, we would leave a fire in the stove, they too had stoves, and when we'd come back they would have all the windows opened and the heat out of the house and (laughter) you had to start all over again to get the place warm to live in.  But we finally moved on to dependent apartments.
Speaker 1: So they, they liked it cold in the--
Speaker 2: They like it cold.  That's why you see so many Germans in their heavy coats and the little caps, the fur hats and stuff 'cause they like the cold weather and it was cold over there.  It was cold.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how long did you stay in, in Germany?
Speaker 2: In Germany?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Oh, I was there about two years, two years.  And then he was sent to Merced, California.  We went from there, he was in the service about eight years.  Then we came back to Fort Wayne [Indiana].
Speaker 1: Merced, now that's supposed to be a pretty place, that's a, that's the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) California?
Speaker 1: --San Joaquin Valley [California] or something.
Speaker 2: It's, it's mostly hills and valleys and it's a pretty place but we lived on a base.  So the only time we got to see California was on the weekends if we could get out and go see the city and that type of thing.
Story_ID: 275263
Speaker 1: So when did you come back to Fort Wayne [Indiana], now?
Speaker 2: We came back to Fort Wayne in, in the, about '57 [1957], '58 [1958], somewhere along in there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were, you were away a pretty good while, yeah.  You were--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were gone quite a while.
Speaker 1: About seven or eight years, I guess.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So what did you, when you were out of town did you, did you do any, did you pursue anything other than, you know, being a housewife or--
Speaker 2: No, because being in Germany that's all, all the women did was housewife because you don't know anybody but each other you depend a lot on each other 'cause in the morning, the men are up going to the post to do whatever they had to do and out in the field and the women get together and play cards or talk.  And that's about it when you're in the [U.S. military] service.  Go to the PX [post exchange] which is the grocery store or place you buy stuff.  And you depend on each other because you're away from home and you make friends real easily because everybody wants to be your friend and have somebody from the [United] States to talk to, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So well what did you do when you came back to Fort Wayne?
Speaker 2: What did I do?  That's when I started school.  I was employed at James [H.] Smart School [Fort Wayne, Indiana].  I worked for the Fort Wayne Community Schools [Fort Wayne, Indiana] and I was going to Saint Francis College [University of Saint Francis, Fort Wayne, Indiana].  That's where I was majoring in elementary education because it had bothered me that I hadn't done what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was working at James Smart Elementary.
Speaker 1: And you were doing secretarial work?
Speaker 2: Secretarial and teachers assistant.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And then when I leave there I would go out to Saint Francis and study and come back and take care of babies and go to bed and get up and do another day (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were busy, you had enough to--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 275264
Speaker 1: Now we're getting up to, now tell me if I've skipped anything but we're almost getting up to your, your starting the Gingerbread House [Inc., Fort Wayne, Indiana].  And what were some of the conditions that you were noticing?  I mean, when, when, I know when I read about the Gingerbread House you said that, that you just noticed a lot of, of mothers, well a lot of the students at, at the school would miss days 'cause they had to watch their brothers and sisters--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --little brothers and sisters at home.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So these are little, little kids watching smaller kids--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --missing days in school.
Speaker 2: Well as I told you before there was a lot of migrating to Fort Wayne [Indiana] and with that came the jobs for black people and with that came the large families.  In those days you didn't just have one or two children, almost every family you met had three, four, five, or six kids 'cause I had six of my own.  And being at [James H.] Smart [School, Fort Wayne, Indiana] there at elementary school, I could see that the children in the first or second grade were very, they were not ready for school.  They had, and then so many of the older siblings would miss school to babysit their younger brothers and sisters because mom and dad had got these nice jobs, paying this big money and they would keep 'em at home to babysit their younger ones.  And I saw so many that weren't ready for school.  And it bothered me because they became discipline problem and would end up standing in the hallways and sitting in the principal's office and that meant to not only did they, were they discipline problems but they would miss another day of learning because they weren't in the classroom even though they were at school.  And I began to ponder and wonder, "How could I help these kids?"  And because kids, I've just always loved working with them and I thought this is so unfair that this child is spending her day either at home babysitting or in the office.  So that's when owning this building that we owned, we owned an apartment building, this was in the '60s [1960s].  And there was still no hotels or apartment buildings that blacks could move into.  And we owned this large brick building on Pontiac Street which was just a half a block from the school where I worked.  And there was one night when I left Saint Francis College, which is now Saint Francis University [sic. University of Saint Francis, Fort Wayne, Indiana], I had go by to collect rent and just as I was coming out, it was if God was just talking to me and he said why not take this building and make a childcare center.
Story_ID: 275265
Speaker 1: All right.  Now I wanted to ask you, you talked about acquiring, having this building, you know, and I was asking you off-camera, how did you acquire this building and, and, and--
Speaker 2: We acquired this building from an--
Speaker 1: And this is you and your husband [Robert Russell, Jr.], right--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --acquiring a building?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we acquired the building.  This attorney owned the building because his mother and brother, his brother had a little slight mental problem and his mother and brother lived there and he was, I think, wanting to move them out of the neighborhood so they wanted to--
Speaker 1: Is this a white gentleman?
Speaker 2: Yes, a white family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we acquired the building from him.  And we rented it a long time for apartments and extra income because in the '60s [1960s] I think we had one black hotel here in Fort Wayne [Indiana].  And I can remember when people like Cab Calloway and used to come to Fort Wayne and didn't have a place to stay, they would live in someone's homes or in this one hotel.  So that's when we bought the building and our intentions was to make a hotel out of it.  But we rented it for years as a apartment building.  It had about eight apartments in it, two big ones down stairs with double bedrooms, about four apartments on the second floor and two on the third floor.  And, but we rented it to blacks because at that time blacks had a terrible time finding a place to live.  And some time you got paid and some time you didn't.  This was why the night that I, that God revealed to me that I could take the building and make a childcare center I was going by there at night to collect, trying to catch some of the tenants at home, they would leave, leave before you come by in the morning so I was trying to catch 'em at home to collect some money.  And when I come out of the building, it was just as clear to me as if it had been God standing right there on the porch by me.  He said, "Take this building, make a childcare center with emphasis on education and preschool readiness program."  And the tears just began to come because I had wanted so badly to help those children that I had seen at [James H.] Smart School [Fort Wayne, Indiana] get ready for school and the older children be able to go into school.  I had spent evenings when school was out trying to tutor them and some would, would absorb it and some wouldn't.  But I think it's because there was no concrete foundation for them to, to, to be ready.  And I began to, that night that I went by the building, I became to walk around the building and to see what I could do and it was just so clear to me that that, this building is large, remodel it according to state, fire marshal, and board of health standards and get a program going and teach these kids.  So that was my first teaching experience, even though I hadn't got finished at Saint Francis [College; University of Saint Francis, Fort Wayne, Indiana] but I had enough and I wanted it.  It's just in me to be a teacher.
Story_ID: 275266
Speaker 1: So that's what I did.  I came home that night and I told my family what had been revealed to me and my youngest daughter [Renita Russell Hopkins], we were helping, we were having gingerbread for dessert that night and she said, "Mom the, the bricks are brown, name it the Gingerbread House."  And so that's where it got its name from was from the gingerbread for dinner that night and so that was the beginning of the Gingerbread House [Inc., Fort Wayne, Indiana].  The next day I got up bright and early and when I went to work, I took my vacation and I went by the building, sitting outside and going through it and said, I gave the tenants notices that they would have to leave.  And we began the remodeling job of getting it ready for children.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now did, did it take a lot of money to do this?
Speaker 1: No.  I took part of my retirement that I had accumulated while working for the Fort Wayne Community Schools [Fort Wayne, Indiana] and my husband [Robert Russell, Jr.] was working as a policeman at the time, and we would take money, a little here, a little there, with the rooms being so big and it didn't take a lot.  We only ran into big problems when we wanted to get the kitchen ready 'cause we had to have all stainless steel equipment, stove, refrigerator, and that type of thing.  But there was a company downtown that let us have, Box Burgers [ph.] at the time it was called, let us have the equipment, tables, chairs, decorations, educational material and we got that.  And we reversed the doors, paying a little bit at a time.  So finally it was June and I quit my job where we could spend time getting it ready for September.  And that's the only big problem that we ran into was when we had to buy the kitchen equipment.  But we had it ready for September because oh, we paid as we went and as I said we took my salary and my retirement and put it into the building.  And we had a local artist that decorated it inside and it was ready for September.
Speaker 2: Now it was, the decorations were, I've read that you used a big drawings of cartoon characters that's what I think, you know, for decorations and initially to attract kids was, was that--
Speaker 1: Well, if it had to be a childcare center, it had to look like a child's care center and a place that the children would want to come to.  So we, at that time we used all of the cartoon characters that was popular in those days, now you got SpongeBob [SquarePants] and all those things, but then we had Bugs Bunny and we had Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse.
Speaker 2: I think I saw a big Huckleberry Hound or something.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Huckleberry Hound.  And we put all of those on the walls, this artist didn't charge me that much and he's still here in Fort Wayne [Indiana], he was a friend of my husband at that time.
Speaker 2: Well, what, what's his name?
Speaker 1: Robert Starkey.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Robert Starkey.  A beautiful artist.  And but, you know, salaries weren't too high then.  If you made three dollars an hour or five dollars an hour, you were making big bucks back in those days.  And he would, would do the paintings all inside, we painted the walls, all of us, the family, it was a family affair.  We painted the walls and he did all the cartoon characters and he cut out wooden characters for the outside and it, it looked really, really beautiful.  And finally come September we were ready.  We had sixty days to get our kitchen together.  And we had to borrow five thousand dollars, that's all the bank would let us have because they called it a weird dream.  It's just a dream, it's not a thriving business and we, all we could let you have was five thousand dollars but that was enough because some companies were nice enough to let us open and have stuff on credit.  For instance, like I said Box Burgers, they'd let us have chairs and all type of educational material and when you get started then you can go.
Story_ID: 275267
Speaker 1: And we did our homework too because there was no childcare center or daycare school there in that area for Fort Wayne [Indiana] and I knew by working at [James H.] Smart [School, Fort Wayne, Indiana] it would go, it would be a demand for it.  We were open two weeks and we were filled to capacity.
Speaker 2: In two weeks?
Speaker 1: In two weeks.
Speaker 2: Now, now what was capacity?
Speaker 1: Capacity at that time was forty-five children.  After we got our loan, but before we got the loan we were able to have our lunches catered in.  The board of health gave us permission in writing that if we could get our lunches catered in then we could open.  So that's why we were able to open in September.  And we went from that, 'til finally after we got the money, Lincoln [National] Bank [& Trust Company of Fort Wayne, Fort Wayne, Indiana] finally decided to let us have the five thousand dollars.  And things didn't cost as much as they do now either.  So we were able to get the kitchen ready within those sixty days that we had.  And it's been a thriving and successful business ever since.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I hired my first worker after two weeks and she had a little boy and that gave us two children to start out the first two weeks.  And after that we would, just had people couldn't get in the building.  So we began at that time to enlarge closets and take out closets and took the front porch and made classrooms and a sun porch and made an office for me and that freed up one of the rooms where we had used for an office for a classroom and that's how we began.
Speaker 2: Now I'm thinking was, did black people take advantage of, of the white run preschools in Fort Wayne prior to that at all?
Speaker 1: At that time, it's--
Speaker 2: Or could they?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah because there was one company that had a preschool but it was on a different side of town, it was out north, but it had a black assistant director.  But on the south end of town where the Gingerbread House [Inc., Fort Wayne, Indiana] is, still is, there was nothing over here.  And I think that was one reason why it was so successful.  And then our fee was very nominal, it was just twenty dollars a week.  Now the fee is about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was 1960--
Speaker 1: Sixty [1960], 1970.
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy [1970], okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Twenty dollars a week and then we raised it from twenty to twenty-five, and, and, and now but we were lucky within three years we had government assistance for fees.  And we were able to successfully hire other staff and get our kitchen done.  And it was so successful we just had the money coming in, just flowing in because people were paying because they needed the childcare.  And then they liked the program we had.  I was determined that a child would not leave Gingerbread House unless she was ready for first grade, not kindergarten, but she had be ready, he or she had to be ready for first grade.
Speaker 2: Even though they would leave at, at four or do they leave at four or do they leave at five?
Speaker 1: Leave at five.
Speaker 2: Five, okay.
Speaker 1: Had to be five on or before October.  And--
Speaker 2: And when did they start, what, what age did they--
Speaker 1: Age, we started at age two and a half if they were trained--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --potty-trained.  If they weren't trained we took 'em in at three.  And we had more than we could handle.  And it was just, it was just beautiful to see those kids thrive and learn.
Story_ID: 275268
Speaker 1: And, and I remember the one family that the, the little boy had been such a problem at [James H.] Smart [School, Fort Wayne, Indiana] because he had missed so much, we got, brought in tutors for kids like him, the older group, and he became an A student and is now an airline pilot.
Speaker 2: Wow, now that's a, that's quite a story.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I've got 'em, I've got one boy and he was a problem (laughter) but I just think no one had taken the time to say you can be somebody, you can do this, you can do that.  I met a parent, oh, a couple, a couple of years ago and she said, "[HistoryMaker] Mrs. [Thelma Lee] Russell, you remember when you taught my son the poem, 'I Am Somebody' [William Holmes Borders, Sr.]?"  She said, "Every time I'd get him, get on him about being naughty or bad he would say I am somebody 'cause Ms. Russell told me so."  And he is a counselor in a school now in one of the schools here in Fort Wayne [Indiana].  And she said, "He never forgot that you taught him that he was somebody."
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: So I could tell a lot of stories like that.
Speaker 2: And what, what made you, now you, a couple, the last two stories you told have been about, I guess, positive reinforcement for youth, you know, for kids and now that's something that, you know, is, was of big concern.  A lot of people in the early '70s [1970s], I know as part, part of the black cultural arts movement was about trying to change your perception that, that our people had with themselves, what we say to each other and to cut out the name calling and the (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you know.  The other negative dialogue that goes on in the black community that some have, have think, and I think it's probably true is our, our remnants of slavery basically or and oppression over the years.  People calling each other the N word and all the other kinds of derogatory things and--
Speaker 1: Well that was one of the things that I stressed with the children that you must learn, you must be somebody, you've gotta be--and when we added our gallery on, after we'd knocked out every room and enclosed porches for rooms we finally added on a multipurpose room.  And the walls of our gallery, we called it the gallery, and it allowed us to take fifty some kids more, and I remember that our walls were decorated with all kind of black history, inventors, and doctors, lawyers, so that our kids would have, I didn't just talk it, I wanted them to see and know the history of black people.  We had one wall that had the negative, where drinking fountains, the white fountain and the black fountain.  And then we had another wall that said although you couldn't drink here, look what [Charles R.] Drew did with blood plasma.  And this poem 'I Am Somebody,' there's a couple of verses in there that said, "I may not be a George Washington Carver but I am somebody.  I may not be a Drew but I am somebody" [sic.].  It was teaching the kids that although we can't do some of the things, history didn't allow us to do some of the things that blacks was, that whites were doing, you are somebody and if you learn, this could be, make you just as important, you are somebody and you can be just as important as a white boy but you've got to learn, you've gotta focus.
Speaker 2: It even seems like you're, you were teaching them that that you, even if you might not do what some blacks have done like Drew and others you might, you were still somebody, if you do the best you can, right?
Speaker 1: Yep, yep.  And, and we did it in such a fun way that the kids loved to come to the Gingerbread House [Inc., Fort Wayne, Indiana] because you, you might be counting and use puppets to count, let the puppets count.  So they enjoyed it in that way but they were still learning.  We might play hopscotch and, and, and count but they learned.  And I've got 'em in all fields of, of life.  I still get letters from them, some of the parents wanna know just how I'm doing.  And it really makes your life worthwhile when you can look back and said I helped somebody, I did this, I did that.
Story_ID: 275269
Speaker 1: Did you play like a hands-on role in the beginning in terms of teaching as well as administrating?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  We had the kids to do a little bit of everything, dress-up roles.  And, and oh, they, they just loved the way that the teachers brought the classes across because they learned their alphabet but we also learned black history names to go with A.  We learned what, who did what for the letter D.  Who did what for the letter, you know--
Speaker 1: For (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) like Martin, like [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  For instance, like under A who would you have under A (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh, you kind of got me stuck there 'cause I don't--
Speaker 1: Well, well B (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Let's take Martin Luther King (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --K.  And they would learn all about that and they also learned, the one wall was the great kings of Africa.  And they never knew what Africa was.  And they know that, to know there was people that were kings and queens in Africa.  And another thing we taught them that, although this is not your mom and grandmama, you must address adults in a respective way and then they ca- will respect you too.  There was just so much difference in the way children lived then and the way they live now.  Some children now just don't seem to have the respect that they had back in the '70s [1970s] for adults and their teachers and their leaders.
Speaker 1: This is observations made many times, you know.  I've heard it so, so many times about--did, did you see your role as head of the Gingerbread House [Inc., Fort Wayne, Indiana] as, as providing some almost like a, it, because it sounds like a lot of the things that you, you open the place up for the community and it almost sounds like a, a settlement house from the old days in some ways as well as a preschool.
Speaker 2: Excuse me.  The teachers would tell me that they could always tell the children that had come from the Gingerbread House because they were so full of energy and they knew so much.  Where you learned your alphabets in kindergarten or first grade, they would know all of that.  They would know how to count to a hundred and write.  Every Friday our teachers would have our papers together.  We took a letter each week and they would learn that letter, reciting, and printing, and, and then we would send all those papers home so mom could see what Johnny was doing at school.  And the same way with numbers.  And they learned how to sit quietly and listen.  We would have just a quiet time.  And then they would tell us "Well when you, when you were quiet what were you thinking about?  What do you wanna be, think about what you wanna be?"  We'd have a career day even though they were four and five years old.  I didn't feel that they were too young to see dentists come into the building and doctors come into the building.  And you'd be surprised the questions that those four and five year olds could ask when we'd have career day.  But that was still putting it, instilling in them that you are somebody and you must be somebody.  You must learn to be somebody, be a productive citizen, and they did.
Story_ID: 275270
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you draw on any particular educational philosophy that you learned at, at I, IPFW [sic.] or Saint Francis [College; University of Saint Francis, Fort Wayne, Indiana], you were at Saint Francis, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: St. Francis, yeah.   Did you draw on any particular body of educational knowledge like [Jean] Piaget or [Maria] Montessori or anything?
Speaker 2: No, not really because I had my own way that I wanted to, to teach the kids.  I felt, at that time, the way that I wanted them to learn, and how we learned, how they would learn, was the best remedy for that.  And I think it was because they enjoyed it.  And I had children wanted to come on Saturdays, (laughter) Sunday they wanted to come to the Gingerbread House [Inc., Fort Wayne, Indiana] because they wanted to know what was the next letter and what we were gonna do.  Then they learned about the community around them.  They don't have to be afraid to go out in the community.  We'd have field trips and just like the older boys and girls and they learned about the zoo and the, learned how to get along with other adults, other than grandma and grandpa and the teachers at school.  They learned when they got to school, they'd had no need to be afraid of this white teacher because she was there to help.  And if it's taught, you can learn, you know, as well as the white boy sitting next to you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did, did you all have any Head Start money?  Did you get any of that?
Speaker 2: Head start?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Head Start came into being after we were in the Gingerbread House, about ten years [sic.].  And then there was the Head Start program that came up.  But at the time Gingerbread House opened in 1970, there were about three childcare centers here in Fort Wayne [Indiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think that's why it was such a, it was needed, a much needed service.  And I think that's why it was such successful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have any trouble with building inspectors in Fort Wayne?  Now--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --having lived in Chicago [Illinois], I know the building inspector can make a big difference in your business (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, at the time that I, I opened the center, I called, as I said the night I went by there in two days I had called and they had sent me a list, in fact, they were, I got a list from the city fire marshal and the, the city board of health and then I was received the mail from the State which requirements were just about the same.  And we tried to do everything that was on the list for us to do and I never, I never had any problems.  They would call for panic bars to be put on the doors, and reverse the doors so they open outward and that type of thing.  And the only problem I had was we ran out of money and, and we couldn't get the kitchen going at the time.  But we finally did get enough money for the kitchen.  But far as the inspectors, I never had any problem.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I never had any problem.
Speaker 1: Now, now what about discipline?  You know, some of, you know, we've, you were describing the, the, the type of attitude you're trying to foster in the school, now did you have like students that just didn't, couldn't fit it, you know?  Just didn't have the discipline to--
Speaker 2: We didn't have too many of that.  We had, you've always got one or two children that's gonna be a slight discipline problem.  But we would learn to set them off to themselves and then I would let them come into the office and sit with me and that gave me another chance to talk with them.  And, and, and then they would sit in my office and see the fun the other children would have and they would wanna be out there.  And so we finally said, "Well can you go out there and join the class and act nice, do what you're supposed to do and they would."  So I, I never had too much discipline problem.  I think one time I had a biter and the mother, see back in those days too, mom would say, "[HistoryMaker] Ms. [Thelma Lee] Russell whoop his backside."  But I never, I never, I threatened a couple of times, if you bite him again I'm gonna let him bite you back or I'm gonna spank you.  And I think once the little boy bit the other little boy (laughter) he finally learned that you just don't do that, it hurts, and you don't hurt other people.  And my parents cooperated too.  You know, nowadays, parents will wanna come to school to jump on the teacher and fight.  But if I isolated a child and they loved our program so that they knew their child was missing a lesson or missing a learning session, they would get on their child at home and say now when you're learning your alphabets, you learn and you stay there and you take it all in.  So I didn't have too many problems with discipline, unh-uh, 'cause I had the cooperation of the parents.  And it makes it so nice because parents I know now that kids went to Gingerbread House, they're proud to say well my kids was in that first graduation class.  And see we had a graduation every June, the kids that were going into school, we had the caps and the gowns and the graduation.
Story_ID: 275271
Speaker 1: So you had good parental involvement pretty much?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  The parents cooperated beautiful.  If I had a problem I'd bring that parent in and talk with her.  And our discipline problems were very minimal at the Gingerbread House [Inc., Fort Wayne, Indiana], very, very minimum because the parents were, were anxious for the child to learn and we didn't have any problem.
Speaker 1: Now did, oh, oh, okay, this is the question I had.  Like when did you start, I know at first it was all tuition, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And when did you start getting, you know, subsidized (unclear)?
Speaker 2: It was in the '80s [1980s] that we got our first, well we got our, no, it wasn't, I'll take that back.  It was 1978 that we got government subsidy from what they called at that time Title 20 program [Child Care Subsidy Program].  And it depended on the, on the income of the parents.  And then, and I think in '82 [1982] we got another, we were on another program.  And the same time when we got our kitchen done, we were on the food program.  Mostly in the '80s [1980s] when we got government sub- subsidy for our program.  We were under three funding programs and the food program.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We finally got under United Way [Worldwide], Fort Wayne's [Fort Wayne, Indiana] United Way umbrella in '80 [1980], '88 [1988], I think or '89 [1989].  And, of course, that made us happy to be under those programs because we had kept our fee at $25 a week for years.  And, of course, when we got under those funding programs, it could raise our fee to about sixty a week at that time, which gave us income to do the remodeling and do the knocking out of walls for expansion.  And when we did that, we had funds that we could add new rooms.  When we put our multipurpose room, which was our gallery, we paid for that cash.  And it was just a needed child support for the southeast section of Fort Wayne and it just flourished.
Story_ID: 275272
Speaker 1: Now you were talking about graduation, I think, just before the tape changed and that you have like a full (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --graduation for the--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --five year olds that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --are moving on [from the Gingerbread House, Inc., Fort Wayne, Indiana].
Speaker 2: They wore their full, we would have a little program, the mother that was telling me about her child learning the poem 'I Am Somebody,' [William Holmes Borders, Sr.] and in other words, I think it was about four or five verses to that poem.  And they would go through an inventor or, or some black.
Speaker 1: Now that's, is that based on [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson's speech?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I just happened to find it in, in one of my teacher's books and it might be, it might be.  But we went through that, we would have something like that four or five kids repeating that.  And then we would learn songs.  We had a, a wide variety of songs.  They would learn how to square dance, we'd have square dancing.  And they would be different types of animals and they would know what type of sound this animal made and talk about that.  We would have a program and in the second half is when they would dress into their caps and gowns and come up and get their diploma and take a bow.  The girls would curtsy, the boys would bow after receiving their diploma and then we'd take a big picture of them.  And each, each year we'd have 25 or 30 children that were leaving us going into, to kindergarten or first grade.
Story_ID: 275273
Speaker 1: Now I read in some of the material that you gave us that you had, you know, the community [in Fort Wayne, Indiana] generally supported you pretty good, I mean, you had a pretty--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --high--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --profile and a positive profile in, in the community but you had a theft here in '87 [1987] that really, it made a lot of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: What--
Speaker 2: We had a theft and the, what made me so angry with the theft, not that they were taking the things for the children, as much as the police didn't do anything about it and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, describe the details of this 'cause they're kind of remarkable, I mean, the--
Speaker 2: Uh--
Speaker 1: --this theft occurred around, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was, it was during the--
Speaker 1: --early morning hours or--
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was during the Eastertime.
Speaker 1: This is in '87 [1987], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And we had bought eggs and egg dye and stuff like, what kids do for Easter, color Easter eggs.  And when they came in that night, I still did not know, and I don't understand it today that you could cut the alarm wires and get in the building and that's what they did.  And we did not know at the time that the center was, they had all night, see we closed at six, so they, the clocks went off about eight o'clock so they had all night 'til six the next morning to remove stuff from the center.  And at that time we had record players in each room, tape recorders in each room, and they just removed everything.  And the policeman that was on duty at that time just happened to see the guy pull off with the couch in the trunk of his car.  And he followed him and we got to the house where they were storing all the material about four blocks away.  And the stuff was taken from the Gingerbread House [Inc., Fort Wayne, Indiana] to this house.  And then when the police caught them, they brought it all, confiscated it all and went to the police station.  Well what really irritated me so, that they let the guy go, let the guys go, they didn't do anything.  And I thought they should have been punished.  And they were after me to come to the station and identify this stuff 'cause the guy wanted to get it, they confiscated his car too, 'cause he wanted his car and nothing ever was done about that crime.
Story_ID: 275274
Speaker 1: Now did you get the stuff back?
Speaker 2: We got the couch and some of the stuff back.  And they took a lot of stuff that was unnecessary 'cause nothing they could do with it.  I had at that time received many awards and, and plaques and, and they even took all those and nothing they could do with that because it had my name on 'em and stuff like that.  The Kappas had, I had just gotten to be a Kappa Sweetheart and Kappa Alpha Psi [Fraternity], they'll love that I mentioned that (unclear), and they took the large dish that they had gave me and things like that and nothing was ever done about that crime.
Speaker 1: Not even after the articles you wrote and--
Speaker 2: Not after that.
Speaker 1: --afterwards (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And seeing the, the couch in the car and following them to the home where they were storing the stuff, nothing was ever done.
Speaker 1: Did they ever press charges against them?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I mean, did, oh, now that's, that's really incredible.
Speaker 2: And that was a very hurting thing because this was like, I say, this was on a Friday and we didn't have the eggs for the kids to color and we had to go out and rebuy all that stuff.  The place was a shambles.
Speaker 1: What did your politicians say here?  I mean, did, I mean, they were, you had an interim mayor [Cosette Simon] then, I guess, from what, what I was reading.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: A guy named (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nothing, nothing was said.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: And I wrote articles in the paper and I stood up even though I was kind of afraid to, I stood up and I wrote articles, couldn't nothing be done about it, and described it just like I'm doing with you but nothing was ever done.
Speaker 1: Do you have a black city council representation here in Fort Wayne [Indiana] or did you, did you?
Speaker 2: At that time we didn't, we do now.  But at that time we didn't in the district that I'm in.
Speaker 1: So what's your, when you reflect back on that now, I mean, what's, what's, what do you think actually happened, I mean, why not prosecute a thief that every, that's obviously a thief?
Speaker 2: I don't to this day understand why nothing was ever done and I never got any answers.  Like I said, I began to speak up, I went to city council meetings and I don't to this day understand why.  My lawyer, at the time I had a, I thought was a very good lawyer and he said it was up to the police to do it, he could not do anything about it but nothing was ever done.  And I just think they just didn't care.  It was a black daycare [Gingerbread House Inc., Fort Wayne, Indiana] and they just didn't care.  That's the only, only reasoning I can give because with the police finding all the stuff and finding the couch in the man's car, that's why he followed him 'cause at six o'clock in the morning you don't find people moving a couch in your car, and nothing was ever done.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They told me to come down and they even had some record players and different item, other items in his car, told me to come get my stuff so the man would, could get his car, he wanted his car (laughter).  But that was in the '60s [1960s], no, no that wasn't in the '60s [1960s], that was in the '80s [1980s] but nothing was ever done.
Story_ID: 275275
Speaker 1: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) so I--
Speaker 1: --you had, you had the twentieth anniversary of the Gingerbread House [Inc., Fort Wayne, Indiana] in 1990.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And your featured guest speakers were [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis and [HistoryMaker] Ruby Dee.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now how did this happen, how, how did you get, get, get them to come?
Speaker 2: Oh, you know, the years that I was at the Gingerbread House I always had so many, many people that wanted to help.  I had beautiful people on my board and we would revolve the boards every two or three years.
Speaker 1: Well how, how was the--
Speaker 2: And this particular board decided twenty years, it's gotta be special.  And they wrote the Directors Guild [of America] and the Screen Actors Guild [SAG; Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA)], and Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis is the ones that accepted to come.  And they got sponsors to pay for the room and board, to help pay the fee that they were charging and like I said, I had a beautiful board of directors.  And they came and we met them at the airport with a limousine service and they came by the Gingerbread House and we had newspaper coverage out at IPFW [Indiana University - Purdue University Fort Wayne, Fort Wayne, Indiana] that night, we had good coverage.  And then on Saturday morning, Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis conducted family workshops for the parents of Fort Wayne [Indiana] and Gingerbread House parents.  It was well attended.  So that was a beautiful, beautiful presentation that they gave.  And my children at the Gingerbread House was on the program that night too, we had to show off a little bit.  And we had taught the children Spanish and they could speak it fluently.  And they did a Spanish speaking session and they also did a, what we called our soul train which is made up of inventors and black inventors and so.  And Ruby, I mean Ossie Davis just loved that.  He commented on how fluently they could speak Spanish and, and that soul train how they learned how blacks have contributed to the success for this nation.  And--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Excuse me, ma'am, would you say that sentence again, about how Ossie loved it, so we can get it without clock?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, I was saying that because our children were on the program, and the children did a presentation of how well they could speak Spanish and we did a black soul train and when Ossie got up, the soul train was, was of, of inventors, black inventors and, and black people that have contributed to society.  He made the comment of how well the children, how fluently they could speak the Spanish and how well they learned our black history.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that was a successful program.  And it, it got a lot of publicity from what I can see from--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah we did.
Speaker 1: --visiting with Ossie and Ruby.
Speaker 2: We did.  And that's one thing I can say about the Fort Wayne newspapers, we always got good publicity which helped too, to make the Gingerbread House a success.  We always got, at least once a month someone was there writing about the Gingerbread House or some special thing.  We've got nice contributions.  Someone was always giving us some money to help us with the children because I think they realized the importance of the work we were doing and wanted to help.  So, so we always got good newspaper coverage, um-hm.  And some sorority or fraternity or the Kiwanis [International], was always doing something for the Gingerbread House.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is your, your board a multiethnic or is it (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yes, our board was made up of black and white and all of 'em always worked so diligently on our monthly meetings and whatever to make sure the Gingerbread House was running smoothly, to make sure that we had what we needed there and made it a success.
Story_ID: 275276
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you notice, have you noticed a difference over the years, now you, you retired in 2000, that's like after, after thirty years of working at the, you know, at being the director of Gingerbread House [Inc., Fort Wayne, Indiana].  And did you know, have you noticed in the thirty years is there a difference in, in the families?  'Cause I, I know, I, you know, there's an article in the paper today about the number of single black families now is, you know, now is what it, as opposed to what it was like in 1960, you know, there are many more black single families than it used to be.  Are there, I mean, do you notice anything different in the, in the, in the families in the, in the family structure and the kids that are coming to Gingerbread House?
Speaker 2: We had in the, in the '70s [1970s], I'll say the '70s [1970s], a group of families that were considered anxious for the children to learn.  I think it was right in the middle of the Civil Rights Movement.  And everybody wanted their child to learn because they didn't want their child to go through what they had went through.  With the migration from the South to Fort Wayne [Indiana], everyone was hoping well, I hope my child will not have to pick cotton, my child will not have work, work in Mrs. Anne's kitchen.  And I think they were very, very anxious for their children to learn and to grow up as a doctor, lawyer, or whatever.  But as the years go by and we get all of this money, it changes, I think it changed the whole lifestyle of black living.  I know it did as far as discipline because at that time you didn't mind spanking your child and your child had that fear instilled in 'em that you, there's some things you just don't do, some things you just don't say.  But nowadays, anything goes.  It doesn't matter whether there's a dad in the home or not.  And, and in the '70s [1970s], most parents did have a dad in the home.  If it, if he wasn't in the home, at least he kind of helped with that child.  But I think nowadays it's because there's no discipline that you see so many kids with problems.  But then my children which grew up in the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s], they didn't have the drugs and all that to deal with either.  But I think if we had stricter parents and the parents really cared about what their child do but parents nowadays are too busy, they're busy.  They got to go on this job and so many of 'em are working two jobs because they want that big car or they don't wanna spank their child and the child has no discipline and if a child doesn't have discipline, he's gonna grow up like a weed.  I think every child needs, that's one thing that you can't be lax on.  And spend some time with the child.  The kids nowadays don't have too many parents at home because mamas are busy going here and dads going here or if there's a dad in the home.  So I think that makes a difference in how your child grow up.
Story_ID: 275277
Speaker 1: --Now you, you retired in 2000, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, I mean, how would you assess the state of the, of the organization now and, and, and what are you, and, and how do you (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Gingerbread House [Inc., Fort Wayne, Indiana]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 2: It's now, when I first retired it went down some.  It makes a difference when you're in something that you own and when someone else takes it over and don't, are just looking for a paycheck.  And it went down for about two years and now one of our big churches have it and it has come back up to where it was.  But the enrollment dropped and it, it just, the building itself was deteriorating in some spots and there was nothing being done.  But since this church has it now, Union Baptist Church [Fort Wayne, Indiana] has it, and they seem to care like I do, like I did.  And it's back up to where it was now.  But it makes a difference when you own it and you wanna see it flourish than when you are just working for a paycheck.  It makes a big difference.
Speaker 1: Now did you struggle with retirement 'cause a lot of people it's, you know, they'll start something and they never wanna retire, they just--
Speaker 2: Yes, I took, I thought about it, and thought about it and sometimes now I think about it, should I, should I, or shouldn't I.  But I had explored all the avenues that I thought needed to be.  And when I retired I was in hopes that the program that I had started would continue but as new people come in to something they have their way of wanting to do and it made a difference, it made a difference in the children, it made a difference in the parents.  And it just almost tumbled there for a while 'til this church took it over, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I thought, I, I gave some second thought to retiring but, you know, you, you get kind of mentally exhausted and you get physically exhausted as you get in your seventies.  And that's where I was and I thought well I've done all I can do.  And I thought it would be kept up as, as it was but it is now which I'm glad to see that it's still going strong and good.  And I think they're getting ready for their thirty-fifth anniversary which I was told by the board president that they would be honoring me at this banquet which made me feel good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 275278
Speaker 1: Now we always ask this question, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My hopes and concerns is somehow that families would begin to care and love each other again.  I think a lot of caring has left because everybody is so busy.  If mama didn't raise us, grandma raised us back in the '60s [1960s] and the '70s [1970s].  We had an extended family that loved us and cared for us and you don't see too much of that any more.  Grandma is very busy, and grandma is going here and grandma is going there, not that I think your, a parent should dump the child on grandma, but that was there extended family where we loved each other and kept our kids disciplined from mama to grandma.  And you just don't see that any more.  I'd like to see somehow that parents would realize that their child must be, leave these drugs alone.  I hate to see that.  And so many of our black boys and girls are getting killed.  Every week you read about, almost twice a week here in Fort Wayne [Indiana] there is some young man getting shot or young girl getting shot and it's mostly centered around the drug.  Teach the children that you must work for what you want.  That that quick money from drugs is not, not the way to go.  And I'm sure there are some parents that do that and then there are some that don't.  So I would like to see that somehow the police or the government crackdown on more on these drugs that these kids are getting involved in.  And stress education a little more.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 275279
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you had it to do over again?
Speaker 2: What would I do differently?  Oh, dear.  I don't know if there's too much I would, would do different.  I can think of other programs that I might, I probably would finish my education that I started.  But I think I did well with what the good Lord gave me for the sinner.  And I've got so many children that was helped so very, very much, so many parents that needed that service and that was helped in that way.  'Til, I don't think it's too much I would do differently.  I might still be there (laughter).  But other than that, I, I, I don't know whether it's too much that I would do differently with my life.
Story_ID: 275280
Speaker 1: My children have all done well and all educated and--
Speaker 2: Well tell us about 'em, you know, you've got, you got six right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) About my children?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you got six?
Speaker 1: Oh, gosh.  My half dozen that's what I call 'em, I had six.  And my oldest son [Willis D. Russell] he finally got his degree, he stuck to it and he got his degree and he is a manager for a big corporation here in Fort Wayne [Indiana].  I don't know whether he wants me to say where he works or not.  My oldest daughter [Marla Jean Russell Williams], she's a chemist, she worked for Central Sawyer [ph.] and she's doing well.  Her two children just graduated, one from Schaumburg there in Illinois, and the other one is graduating next year from Indiana Central [sic. University of Indianapolis] down in Indianapolis [Indiana].  She though, they're doing well.  Then my third son [Michael J. Russell], my engineer I call him, he graduated from DeVry [University] there in Chicago [Illinois].  And I was so glad he did because he and his little friend kept me running to, back and forth to Chicago, moving him 'cause DeVry doesn't have housing and they, (laughter) he and his boys would play the music to loud and they'd have to move.  But he's an engineer now here at one of the companies here in Fort Wayne and doing well.  He's got two children.  Then I have a set of twins, one's a teacher [Lynette Russell Madison] and one's a beautician [Lynda Gibson].  One's in education in Atlanta [Georgia], she left Fort Wayne 'cause Fort Wayne didn't, she's a sports fan, Atlanta's got all those big sports teams, so she's down in Atlanta, she's doing well, she's got a little boy.  The other twin is here in Fort Wayne working, she's got a little boy.  Then my youngest, Renita [Russell Hopkins], is doing well.  She's a nurse.  And she's head at several hospitals and now is getting ready to move to Charlotte, North Carolina.  She's married and got a little boy.  So they have done well and I am proud of them, all six of 'em.  They--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) have done well.
Story_ID: 275281
Speaker 1: Oh, well, tell us about your father [Ernest Cox, Sr.], I didn't ask about your father.  Now your father passed away some time ago, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my, my father died, I think he was only sixty, sixty-six [sic. sixty-eight], (unclear) which is young.
Speaker 1: Had you started the Gingerbread House [Inc., Fort Wayne, Indiana] when he, he--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  Gingerbread House was started in 1970.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he never--
Speaker 2: Yes, I had, yes, I had.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm sorry.  He died in '74 [1974], '74 [1974].  But he was only sixty something years old.
Speaker 1: So he had a chance to see it become successful?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.  But even when you're in your sixties that's young to pass away, uh-huh.  And I've often wondered if, if him working in that coal had any bearing on that, I don't know, but he got a chance to see the Gingerbread House.
Story_ID: 275282
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna ask the question I asked--
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: --at the end of the last roll.  But when you look back on it, on all of your activities with the Gingerbread House [Inc., Fort Wayne, Indiana] and, and what would you consider at this juncture to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Gingerbread House (laughter).  I think with Gingerbread House I don't think it'll, nothing I've done in life other than my children that can top that.  And I'll, I'll, there won't be to much more I'll do.  Because now I'm sitting, I'm sleeping late, and drinking coffee when I get up--and we're not on tape now?  Oh, I didn't know we were on tape.
Speaker 1: Yes we are (laughter).
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.  I still think Gingerbread House is my greatest legacy other than my children.  My children have been good kids so I did something right there.  They're all educated and thriving citizens of the community.  So other than Gingerbread House.  And I think seeing and knowing thousands of children that went through the center and how proud their parents and mothers are.  I still get letters and cards and right now I've got six graduation invitations and that's, that's few compared to what I used to do.  I got two wedding invitations for June and I've, and now that's, it's gradually getting lower and lower the numbers of invitations I get because the kids have grown up so and now the kids that I didn't spend quite as much time with is coming into the picture.  I know if their Gingerbread House.  But I still get letters and cards just people saying, "[HistoryMaker] Mrs. [Thelma Lee] Russell thank you."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: "My kid is in college and she's this because she had that cement foundation that made her want to learn, gave her a thirst for learning."  And it makes me proud, it makes me proud that I've helped somebody along the way.
Speaker 1: Now you've had, there have had, there have actually been reunions for Gingerbread House.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.  Our, our twenty-fifth anniversary was a big reunion and we had kids come back and one boy brought his cap and gown and showed that, what he wore when he graduated.  And he now has a childcare center.  This is a young white boy.  And at the time he, his mother used to say that when she would pass The Gingerbread he wanted to go, go to Gingerbread House.  And he would be, he was the only white boy that we had in our center but it did not matter to him, he was just as happy as a lark.  And the kids played with him and he played with them and it didn't matter that he was the only one.  But, and now he and his wife has opened one and he talked, told us at the twenty-fifth reunion of Gingerbread House that that what's inspired he and his wife to own a daycare center was when he attended The Gingerbread House.
Speaker 1: Is he here in Fort Wayne [Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes he's here in Fort Wayne, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well is there anything that we have failed to ask you that we need to discuss before we--
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I think you've covered just about everything that I have done in life.  I haven't done too much 'cause with thirty years of The Gingerbread House wasn't too much more I could do.  But I had great staff, I had people that worked for me twenty-five, twenty-seven, ten, fifteen years.  And I was so proud because they did stay there and they did, I was able to give people jobs 'cause most of the people that worked for me were parents, mothers that had children and we provided benefits for them.  And I was just proud that I had The Gingerbread House, that God had revealed to me this need and how I could fulfill this need.  And I don't know too much more I could do.
Story_ID: 275283
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well our last question is similar to legacy but it's a little bit different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  Well now you're gonna bring tears to my eyes.  Just that I tried to help.  I tried to--you know, it, in, in the Baptist church, there's a song that says, "If I can help somebody as I pass along this way."  And see now you got me all filled up.  And I'd like to be remembered that I did my best to help somebody.  And when I see my little student that's flying those big jets for American Airline[s] that makes me so proud 'cause he started out as a discipline problem and we got him turned around and he was one of our best students and now he's flying for American Airlines and that makes me proud. So I would like to be remembered that [HistoryMaker] Thelma [Lee] Russell did her best to help somebody as she passed along this way.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well thank you very much for sharing with us.
Speaker 2: Thank you for having me.  Thank you very much.
