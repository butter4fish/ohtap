Story_ID: 6469
Speaker 1: Now let's now start with your family and I'd like you to give your mother's name and what you know about her background growing up.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Willa M. Dellums. Her maiden name was Terry, M for Mae, Willa Mae Terry. My mother was born in Houston, Texas. Her parents were from Louisiana and Mississippi. On my mother's--grandmother's side, my mother's mother, Louisiana.  Her maiden name was Poole and they came from back in the woods in the country outside Shreveport, Louisiana. On my mother's father's side, they were the Terrys, and they were from, I believe it's called Crystal Springs, Mississippi. That's about all I know about that aspect of her.
Speaker 1: Did she ever grow up--talk about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes. My mother grew up in the [San Francisco] Bay Area because they came from Texas. My mother was a very, very young child, maybe four or five years old, so my mother actually grew up in the Bay Area, went to school in West Oakland [California]. West Oakland was the major port of entry for African American people coming to northern California.  Most black folks came to northern California for one of two reasons, either to work on the railroad or to work in the lumber mills in northern California. So that was the early reason for the movement of African Americans into the Bay Area, for one of those two reasons. My mother's folks came in--her folks worked in the lumber mills.  My grandmother and her sisters and brothers for the most part were outstanding cooks. My grandmother was the champion cook, she made a great living as a cook in the Bay Area. My mother [went] to the twelfth grade, dropped out of high school in order to get married and bring me into the world and after I came into the world, she went back and finished high school.  My mother--my view of my mother is that she is a person very lusty for knowledge, very inquisitive, always searching for more and more information. But I realized at a certain point that my mother wasn't going to be able to live out her dream, her dream would be lived out through her children.
Speaker 1: Did she--now, what age did you say she was when she came to Berkeley [California]?
Speaker 2: About four or five.
Speaker 1: Oh, so she--.
Speaker 2: Into Oakland.
Speaker 1: To Oakland. So she really grew up in that--.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Elementary school right through into high school.
Speaker 1: Do you think, you know, that her family was happy there? Did they miss Louisiana at all or do you think they enjoyed the area there?
Speaker 2: I think they enjoyed being in the Bay Area because all of my mother's mother's family all came to northern California. Because I recall growing up--all my family--we had a huge family on my mother's side of the family because my mother's mother, all of her siblings came to the Bay Area as well, so it was really a replacement from one place to the other.  And so they all came together in the Bay Area. They had a tremendous network, they lived within blocks of each other. I could walk from one uncle and aunt's home to another--cousins--so we all lived in West Oakland in a four or five block area of each other.  So it was very close, very tight community and we related to each other very, very well.  So my sense of my mother, my center, my grandmother, was that, you know, that they lived easy with each other because those relationships were there.  I mean, there are other pressures, but family life was good. My sense is that it was very positive and very supportive.  You know, there are other issues like income, finances, you know, making it on a everyday basis in a society that was essentially racist and oppressive to African American people but inside that milieu, in that black community, there was comfort, there was a sense of safety.
Story_ID: 6470
Speaker 1: Now your, your grandmother that you spoke of earlier that you said you were close to, or influenced you, is this on your mother's side or was it--?
Speaker 2: Yes, on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that a little bit?
Speaker 2: Yes, my grandmother was someone who didn't have a tremendous amount of formal education, but she was an incredible human being and spent a great deal of her life helping to raise me. And if you know anything about grandparents and grandchildren, there's a very special relationship. My grandmother was the matriarch of our family.  When we had family reunions, it was family reunions at Gram's, that was my reference to my grandmother. And so being my grandmother loved boys and I was the only boy in the family--I had a sister and her son had four daughters, so I was the only boy, so I had a very special place. So in one sense, if my grandmother was, to use an analogy, the queen of our family and I was her favorite, so I sat at the right hand of the queen of the family. And she obviously spoiled me to some extent. But she was a very, very significant human being. Even today, my friends have all said to me, "You need to write a book about your grandmother," because I always quote my grandmother.  I learned a great deal from my grandmother. As I said earlier, in response to one of your questions, "Nothing beats a failure but a try." "Don't grow up to be just a big stand up in the road." What does that mean?  To have focus, to have purpose, to have a sense of where you're headed, have a plan.  "Nothing ruins a duck but his bill," so don't shoot off your mouth constantly. You know, listen, hear, observe, understand. Many, many other comments that she made to me that I remember to this day that are still guiding examples, even to a small point of how to eat. She'd say, "If you notice--," she said, "--every time your elbow bends, your mouth flies open."  So bring your food to your mouth, then open your mouth. Now this is a woman without letters, without great sophistication, but she taught me a certain sense of how to handle myself. "Never surround yourself with 'yes men'.  Be strong enough to have friends who will question you, who will challenge you, who will disagree with you."  An incredible thing. And as I go along, I'll remember many others.  But she was a valued friend, someone that I knew loved me very much. She was from the old school, "spare the rod [spoil the child]" kind of thing, so I had to experience that.  But I always knew that that was based on love.  Cooking for my grandmother was a way of showing and expressing love and she taught me how to cook. I remember one time she said, "Most men can't pour piss out of a boot if the instructions were written on the heel," and when I realized what she was saying, I fell on the floor laughing and she said, "And I don't want you to be a helpless male so I'm going to teach you how to cook, wash, sew, and iron," and she did that so that I could be self-reliant and self-sufficient. And cooking for me also is an expression of caring for someone. It's a way of saying that I love you, because that was what my experience was. In some societies, going from childhood to adulthood is marked very specifically.  For me, it was the day that my grandmother sat down with me in the kitchen and poured me a full cup of coffee and sat it in front of me and sat across the table with a full cup of coffee. And that was the first time in my life that I was able to not just stir her coffee, I had my own cup. At that point, I realized that what my grandmother was saying was that I was moving from childhood to young manhood and that was my, that was my coming of age, as it were. So I have very fond memories of my grandmother. As I said, she was a very strong individual in my life, very caring individual in my life and taught me a great deal.
Story_ID: 6471
Speaker 1: Now let's go to your father and if you would give his name and talk about what you know about his family.
Speaker 2: Right, my father's first name is Verney, as mine, middle name, Gordon, last name, Dellums. My father was born in a little town that--back then was a little oil town in Texas. It's now the fruitcake capital of America, I believe, it's a town called Corsicana, Texas. What I know of my father is--and I have to back up some--somewhere in the mid-1800s, say 1860, 1870, in that time frame, for a variety of reasons, I think part of it had to do with the drought, but there was a major exodus of large numbers of Swedish people from Sweden who left and went to different places in the world. One such family, the Fortsons, left Sweden and went to England.  From England, they went to Texas. And I'll just have to tell you the best that I know.  My sister's been doing a lot of research on the internet about this and wants it in maybe even more detail than I am, but that family of Swedes, the Fortsons, was headed up by--it was a patriarchal family--they referred to old man Fortson as the 'Big Swede'.  He developed a relationship with a Cherokee woman who lived on one of the reservations in Texas and her name was Kitty--and as I understand it, that was a popular name among Cherokees at the time--and she would go on and off the reservation. He had a son by this Cherokee woman and they named the son Henry Fortson and he was so enamored of his son that he took the son and had the son raised by his sister, not his mother, the Native American Cherokee.  So Henry Fortson, half-Swedish, half-Cherokee, is now living with his father's sister and as he began to grow, he realized that his mother lived on the reservation and his father lived someplace else, but he didn't live with either one of them, he lived with the sister. So from time to time, Henry Fortson would run away in search of his mother.  And because by that time the Swedish family were prominent enough in this community that the sheriff or whatever would go out and find little Henry and bring him back home. At a certain point, as a young teenager Henry Fortson successfully ran away and found his mother. By that time, Kitty, his mother, the Cherokee, had moved to--was living in Corsicana, Texas, and married an African American whose last name was Dellums--and I believe his first name was Robert Dellums, I'm not quite positive about that.  And Henry Fortson decided to drop Fortson out of apparent resentment that his sense, that he had been to some extent rejected by his father and took the name Henry Dellums. As the story goes, at some point Henry Dellums walking down the street in Corsicana, Texas, sees a beautiful young mulatto riding on the back of a horse-drawn cart. Her name was Emma Anthony and she was part African, part Native American, part Italian, etc., etc.  And he said, "You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. Someday I'm going to find you and marry you."  Well, Henry Fortson, the half-Swede, half-Cherokee, and Emma Anthony, the mulatto, did marry each other and that union was my father's mother and father. And Henry Dellums, though not an African American, married a woman who was part African American. They lived in the black community in Texas, and he raised his children very strong quote, unquote, "race conscious" people.  And there are stories about times when, when slaves seeking refuge would seek refuge in that home and Henry taught all of his sons to use--they all could hunt, so they could shoot very well.  And there were even times when they recall when the sheriff would come knocking on the door and asking them had they seen a runaway slave or whatever, and all of them would be positioned at a certain place unbeknownst to the sheriff, all ready to shoot if they had to in defense of the slave, you know, or the person who was running away from the authorities. So this man raised his, raised his kids in a very strong and powerful way.

Speaker 1: My father [Verney Gordon Dellums], I learned, was the historian of his class. I have a excellent memory, but my father has a superior memory. My father had a photographic memory.  And as a result of that, combined with his desire, his desire to debate, he became the class historian and was one of the great debaters in his class. He left Corsicana, Texas, after C. L. [Cottrell Laurence] Dellums, his older brother, who came to California as the first Dellums to come to California and moved into the [San Francisco] Bay Area. C. L. sent for my father as a young man after he graduated from high school and my father got there, I guess he was in his early twenties, maybe nineteen, twenty years old or somewhere there about--maybe early twenties.  My father was supposed to come to California to go to the University of California [Berkeley, California] to study journalism because my father was a great sports fan and with his photographic memory for detail, and names, and whatever--and he loved sports, he wanted to become a sports writer. Well, he comes to the Bay Area and the word was my mother was one of the young beauties in the Bay Area. My father, attracted to women, attracted to my mother [Willa Mae Terry Dellums], and that attraction led to their marriage and my coming into the world, so he never went to college.  My mother never went to college, but they brought me into the world and one year later, my sister Theresa into the world.
Story_ID: 6473
Speaker 1: My father [Verney Gordon Dellums], as a result of his relationship with his older brother, C. L. [Cottrell Laurence Dellums], who along the way--along with A. [Asa] Philip Randolph, helped to organize the first black trade union in the history of America.  This changed the perception of the black worker in America for all time because up until then, often times, black workers were used to exploit their oppression, to break strikes, et cetera. Here were these group of African Americans who had the audacity and the courage and the bravery to actually organize their own trade union.  So it became the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.  Well, my father became a sleeping car porter and he traveled on the railroad and I remember the mark of someone working on the railroad was the guys that used to carry these little bags, they called them 'grips', and you know, this was their article that they traveled on the railroad with. In one sense, they were like the black astronauts in the sense that they went beyond the black community.  They traveled on the railroad, they met movie stars, they met famous people, they heard other things, they saw different parts of the world that black folks had not seen, so they came back with stories. My father came back with stories. The Pullman porters came back with stories, so as I said, they were the first astronauts.  They went beyond our community.  They went beyond our world--they explored other worlds. So it was fascinating to listen to my father when he would come back and tell stories about seeing this movie star or seeing this famous person, or seeing this place, fascinated by the fact that my father saw places that I only read about as a small child.  Later, my father integrated the waterfront and became one of the first African American longshoremen in San Francisco [California] and became a member of the ILWU union [International Longshore and Warehouse Union], and this was an incredible job during that period of time because union workers, longshoremen, made a excellent living.  And so my father, to become a longshoreman meant that our economic well-being, you know, moved up some because this was a good living and my father worked there and actually retired as a member of the ILWU.
Story_ID: 6474
Speaker 1: How long did your uncle [Cottrell Laurence Dellums] in Calif-, I mean in California before your father came?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Before my father [Verney Gordon Dellums] came? Okay, I was born in 1935. My father came to California several years prior to that, so in the early '30s [1930s]. C. L. was in the [San Francisco] Bay Area in the '20s [1920s].
Speaker 1: Do you know what the C. L. stands for?
Speaker 2: Cottrell Laurence Dellums.
Speaker 1: And can you spell that? Is it C-O-T-T-R-E-L-L?
Speaker 2: --Laurence with a U.
Speaker 1: Okay, Laurence with a U. And can you also spell Fortson?
Speaker 2: I think the correct spelling of that particular name is F-O-R-T-S-O-N.  Fortson. It might be S-E-N, but I'll just have to check.
Speaker 1: Now that is a pretty amazing story. I'm also wondering, with your uncle, was he sort of in his activist period, you know at that point had he--you know, how had he come to know A. [Asa] Philip Randolph? Do you know that story?
Speaker 2: Okay, first C. L. came to the Bay Area as a high school graduate and just as an aside--if you go back, if you could hear how A. Philip Randolph and the people around them, they all spoke with perfect English, and the strategy was to command the language because now you're going to deal with the white power structure. So C. L. Dellums, if he were right here now, I guarantee you, you would think he was a Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], Ivy League graduate.  Long A's--instead of "class" it was "closs," because they developed a speech affect that from their perspective said, "You must take me seriously. I am intelligent, articulate, thoughtful person that you have to deal with," though C. L. never went beyond high school. And I remember my aunt said to me that when she met C. L. he said, "Take a chance to marry me.  I'm never going to wear overalls." And that was his thing, he was never going to wear overalls.
Story_ID: 6475
Speaker 1: Well, somewhere along the way and I don't know the exact--I don't remember the exact story--but C. L. [Cottrell Laurence Dellums] did a oral history project and you can find that out and he'll tell you that he and A. [Asa] Philip Randolph met.  A. Phillip Randolph became very impressed with C. L., and C. L. became his West Coast organizer because C. L. was a young activist at the time. And these were the old left-wing guys--these were the young socialists of the '20s [1920s]. These were the young--you know, so everyone says is in my genes, in the genes. (laughs)  So these were the young progressives.  These were the young guys that had the audacity to challenge. And I remember, you know, him telling me stories about the early days of unionizing and the dangers, you know, and the goons that would beat them up, throw them through plate glass windows, I mean all this kind of stuff. Or take blacks who were working on the railroad once they found out they were organizing, then throw them off the train in places in Utah and other places where within 100,000 square miles they would be the only black person and then say, "Walk home." So needless to say, most of them never made it home, you know, walking thousands of miles back to the [San Francisco] Bay Area. But at any rate, C. L. was not only a union organizer, C. L. was also a civil rights leader.  C. L. helped to organize the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in the state of California.  C. L. was one of the organizers of the Fair Employment Practices Committee [1941-1946] that fought for fair employment in the state of California. And he was so awesome in that regard, that once California passed and enacted the Fair Employment Practices Law, C. L. was appointed to that board and became chairman of the board. And became so awesome and so powerful and so credible in that regard that Ronald Reagan, when he became governor further down the line, was forced to reappoint C. L. as chairman because even a number of Republican [party] appointees said, "If you don't reappoint C. L. Dellums, there's no credibility to this commission and there's no sense in me serving."  So--which was a major statement to me that here this extraordinary person, my uncle, who was so audacious that even a conservative Republican governor was required to reappoint this man without him ever violating his credibility nor his integrity, which was a major statement to me. So C. L. became a very forceful person in the community. Even at the local level, there was a predominately black high school in West Oakland [California], McClymonds High School where [William] Bill Russell [basketball player] graduated from and a number of African American athletes, Frank Robinson [baseball player], Vada Pinson [baseball player], not Vada Pinson but a couple of other black athletes. At one point, McClymonds High School had more professional black athletes in professional sports than any other high school.  C. L. fought to make that high school credible, set up a committee because this was a high school that had this enormous number of African Americans, but it wasn't an accredited high school, so he fought to make--I'm sorry, not credible, but accredited high school.  And so all the way from the community level to the state level, to the national level, C. L. played a role.  When I came to Washington [D.C.] in January 1971, more than one black came, more than one Dellums came. I came to [U.S.] Congress and C. L. came to the National Board of AFL-CIO [American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations] as the president of this small African American union in 1970.
Story_ID: 6476
Speaker 1: Okay, one of the interesting things about my uncle [Cottrell Laurence Dellums] as a young guy, well first of all, at a certain point I realized that the name Dellums was magic and because whenever I'd say my name to certain people, sometimes teachers, or in other places, they would immediately say, "Is C. L. Dellums your father?" and I'd always have to say, "No, C. L. Dellums is my uncle."  And some people just assumed he was my father.  But when they would hear the last name, I would note that people dealt with me differently and I realized that my uncle really is a very influential person. And so there was a success model in my life in the sense that in West Oakland [California], on Seventh Street which was the main--you know, every place in the black community in the country always has its black downtown and Seventh Street was the main place, you know, where the shops, the clubs, the restaurants, the barbershops, all that in that area. Well, C. L. had a office over the pool hall. He had a secretary, he had a office, a leather chair, smoked a pipe, three-piece suit--powerful people came to see C. L.  So I was impressed with the fact that C. L. was an important person and had a office, so it wasn't like only white folks had offices. Here was my uncle who had a office and who obviously was an important person. Along the way, I remember C. L. said to me, "Never be a politician.  Be the power and the influence behind the scenes."  Remember, he was a labor leader--they endorse candidates, they push forward positions, they provide political support, financial support.  "Never be a politician--behind the scenes."  Fast forward--in the latter part of his life, I remember I flew in back to the [San Francisco] Bay Area to attend a banquet where my uncle was being honored and he spoke.  Here's this incredible person in my life, who was a role model in my life who along the way always helped me, made sure that I stayed in school. Whenever I needed any resources he was always there to help me out--finish college, he kept pushing me to go to school and you know, grow up to be somebody, to do some important things in life.  So he was standing at the podium just talking about history and I'm sitting there, tears in my eyes, and I said, "This incredible man is part of my family." And he suddenly, out of the blue, he recounts this story and he said, "It's the one piece of advice that I'm glad my nephew never accepted," He said, "Because I'm in the twilight of my life, but I can leave knowing that there still is a Dellums who continues to fight and continues to struggle," and I just cried. It's just so amazing because at that moment, in that public forum, my uncle was saying, "I can be at peace because I've handed the baton to another Dellums." And in the Bay Area, there is a statue of my uncle that is near one of the Bay Area rapid transit stations as a testament to his commitment, you know, as a union person dealing with the railroads and so that this beautiful statue right in front of the train station of C. L. Dellums. Wonderful likeness--captures a great deal of his strength and his elegance and his eloquence, just his style. And then several blocks down the road, there is now the Ronald V. [Verney] Dellums Federal Building.  So the two of us have our little moments in history in the Bay Area and I'm very proud of my heritage. I'm very proud of the contribution that my family made and I'm very proud of the contribution that each of them made to make me who I am.
Story_ID: 6477
Speaker 1: I'd like to ask you about what your earliest memory is of growing up. Do you have an earliest memory?
Speaker 2: (Pauses) Yeah, I'm trying to focus it, yeah, my earliest memory is the first place that we lived on Linden Street in West Oakland [California]. And I was a very small child, I had to be younger than five, maybe even younger than four, but we moved to 1014 Wood Street where I literally grew up, graduated from high school [Oakland Technical High School, Oakland, California] before I went into the Marine Corps. So my earliest recollection was somewhere in that three to four [year old] time frame.  My mother [Willa Mae Terry Dellums] and father [Verney Gordon Dellums], and my sister [Theresa Dellums] and I lived there as very small children. One of the things that stands out in my mind, this was the time when ice trucks came and the ice man literally with, you know, these clamps and a leather strap on their back would carry twenty-five pounds or fifty pounds of ice to put it in your icebox. This was before they had refrigerators.  Well, I remember my sister and I--the ice truck was parked--and my sister and I were playing around the ice truck and I remember that I'm sitting with my legs open sort of around the back wheels of the truck, just playing as kids, you know, sitting on the side of the curb, the street.  And I heard a scream from a man who probably saved my legs and my life because the driver was getting ready to drive off.  Now as I recall, the man across the street, for some reason--his angle--he saw us playing under the wheels of this truck and he screamed for the driver to not move and if that driver had moved he probably would have crushed my legs and maybe crushed my sister. And this man saved two children's lives, and I remember he ran across the street and pulled me out from under this truck and I don't remember the words, or whatever, but I just remember the commotion, you know, and my mother, you know, "What are you guys doing? You could have gotten killed out there!" and a lot of commotion around that.  But that stuck in my mind that that was a very dangerous moment and the person across the street had done something incredible, which was to save these two children, because I remember my mother cried and hugged this man. That's one of my earliest memories.
Story_ID: 6478
Speaker 1: Now also, if you could take yourself back either to Linwood or to--it's 1014, 1015, what is the address?
Speaker 2: Linden Street was my first and 1014 Wood Street was where I literally grew up.
Speaker 1: If you can take yourself back, I'd like you to talk about what sights, smells, or sounds, or all three of them really remind you of growing up.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Now, West Oakland [California], as I've mentioned earlier, was the major port of entry for African Americans during that period of time, in the late '20s [1920s] and the '30s [1930s], but as a kid in West Oakland, West Oakland was really sort of 'Archie Bunker' [referring to 'All in the Family' TV show's white, blue-collar character] with black folks in it.  So West Oakland--classic sociology--you know, most cities grow up around the water initially, so the big homes, you know, initially close to the water, but then as people leave out, they move further inland, they live up on the hill and more affluence, et cetera  And what happens is working class people move in and take those places, and then later ethnic Americans move in as white workers move out.  This is classic sociology, zone one, zone two kind of stuff you learn in Sociology 1-A.  This was classic West Oakland, so as a kid, my friends were not only African Americans, but if you see the picture of my elementary school class--was multi-racial because my friends were Irish, Italians, Portuguese, et cetera.  Latino Americans, African Americans we're all there, this hodge-podge of ethnics.  When World War II came, a lot of jobs in the [San Francisco] Bay Area, defense jobs, lot of money.  Working-class whites left West Oakland [California] and moved to more affluence areas in Berkeley [California], North Oakland [California], other places.
Story_ID: 6479
Speaker 1: Well, during that first part as a child, I remember all these ethnic smells. I remember the Italian family around the corner who would unload boxes and boxes from these big trucks of grapes and actually made wine right there, right around the corner.  They had their own little winery, you know, in their back yard. So I remember those smells. I remember the smells of Italian food. I remember the smells of Mexican American food; I remember the smells of soul food. As, as the white ethnics moved out and larger and larger numbers of black folks from the South moved in, West Oakland [California] changed from this ethnic community to literally a transported southern town. So I also remember right across the street, the Busy Bee Cafe, where the music would be playing loud until 12:00, 1:00, 2:00, and 3:00 in the morning, or the Rum Boogie Club, so the smells of barbeque and greens and et cetera, so the smells started to change as the community started to change.  The sounds, the speech patterns, started to change. The nature of my friends started to change because as a little kid, as a young kid in elementary school, one of my closest friends was a red-haired Irish kid who had such a beautiful voice that he actually sang, had his own little program on Saturday morning. He actually sang--had a beautiful voice.  And later as West Oakland changed, then my friends became young kids from the South. And I'd go visit them and old, the old folks, many of whom had very little formal education moving into the [San Francisco] Bay Area. "Well, who is the little red fella?" [referring to his skin color]  And I didn't ever had heard that term before and so I was like, "Who is the red fella?"  I said, "I don't want to be the red guy," right? So they'd say, "Who is the little red fella?" this was the old people used to say that. Or, now I'm going to Saint Patrick's Elementary School [Oakland, California] although I'm not a Catholic, but I went to Catholic school because my parents were pushing, pursuing educational excellence for me and they felt that between the public school and the parochial school, I would get a better education at the parochial school.  So they decided to send me to Saint Patrick's because they figured that with the nuns, and et cetera, that I would get a much stronger education and a much better educational foundation from which to spring, so I went to Catholic school.  Well, now I'm going into the homes of my new friends, my friends who are now young kids from the South and the old folks were saying--they'd hear me speaking, talking, so-- "How you know that?", "Where did you learn that?", "That boy sure can talk." "He gonna grow up to be a preacher or a lawyer, or something someday."  Had never heard those words, you know, from other people because now I'm hearing how other people perceive me.  Because here southern folks who had not encountered a young kid whose education, who was being educated at this particular level, because they were now new migrants into the Bay Area. So that was--then, you know, I started to hear different sounds, different smells.
Story_ID: 6480
Speaker 1: Now, my--I grew up in essentially in a southern family, my grandmother--wise old southern person, my mother [Willa Mae Terry Dellums] grew up in the [San Francisco] Bay Area. But at a certain point I came home and they started to hear me say instead of "Throw the ball," they would hear me say, "Chunk a cher" (ph.),  which was a southern statement. Or instead of "Tiny" they would hear me say "Teenintsy" (ph.) because that was what I was hearing from my southern friends, okay? So my--my mother says, "Why are you speaking like this?" but I'm absorbing my environment. I am now dealing with my peers, so if they say, "Chunk it--chunk the ball" instead of "Throw the ball," then I said, "Chunk it" or "That sure is teenintsy," rather than that is a tiny piece you know, or, et cetera.  So I started to pick up the vernacular, which started to bother my mother because now I'm not speaking correct English. I'm now not enunciating clearly, you know. And this is a challenge, you're the only person in the house who speaks like this. Well, I was the one person in the family that was influenced by my environment because I'm out there all the time, more than my sister [Theresa]. Boys at that time tend to be out in the world, you know, more playing and whatever, and more adventurous and away from home.  So I absorbed all of that. So those are the things that I remember, you know, as a young person because I started to cinch my own changes. And then I became fascinated because West Oakland [California] now had become this sort of transplanted, small town, almost in some instances rural southern. The old men, who used to sit on the corner at night, and light fires in these old metal cans, and sit around maybe drinking a little wine and telling old southern stories or rhymes, or playing the dozens [humorous insults] and the rhythm, of all of that became fascinating to me.  So sometimes I would go to bed at night, and go in my room and close the door when I finally got my own room, and then quietly climb out of the window and walk along the fence and then drop down and ease out to the corner and sit up 'til late at night in the middle of these old men telling these stories, so that I got to hear stories about the South even in more detail sometimes and more graphically than even in my own home. Or I would hear 'Brer Rabbit' and 'Brer Bear' stories and rhymes and old teachings. These old sort of poems, that you know, that come out of the black community. As I said, "playing the dozens" and all of these things, I learned all of that sitting on the street corner with these old men. So in that--later, people would say, "You know, you have this southern quality to your voice but I thought you were born in California." Well I was, but I grew up in a southern environment so it's just transplanted. And as I said, my friends and people around that started to shape my life.
Story_ID: 6481
Speaker 1: I'm going to Catholic school [St. Patrick's Catholic School, Oakland, California] but then here's the Holiness Church [Oakland, California] right down the street--tambourines, church rocking, you know.  And some of my friends were--their father was pastor of one of the little, sort of, store-front churches, you know, church in the basement of a house, and I became fascinated with that.  Would sneak off at night and go down to the church and listen to the preachers and play the tambourine and you know, one time I just found myself when the preacher said, "Come forward," I remember I came forward and knelt down at the altar, began to speak in tongues--"Loose him, Satan," you know.  I began to speak in words that I never had heard from myself before as this young kid.  So church became an important part of my life. Now I'm going to Catholic school, I was an athlete, I was a student, but now I'm going to Holiness Church where the pastor was saying that going to the movies was a sin, playing sports was inappropriate--tremendous clash. How can I reconcile this as a kid?  I loved these things, this is part of my life as a childhood. For a minute, I gave that up--for a minute, I stopped going to the movies, for a minute, I stopped playing sports, for a minute, I became this oddball at the Catholic school because now I'm this young Holiness guy. And the minister was a big hero to me--maybe I should become a pastor, maybe I should become a preacher, maybe this is what I should do with my life.  And one of the ministers had a huge family of kids and several of the brothers were my friends--very poor people. One night he walked away--vanished. And this was one of my heroes, this was the church that I crawled out of the window past the old men on the corner to go further down the street to the church.  And I remember this was a incredible moment for me. That's when, in the vernacular of the old folks, I backslid. And I said, "Well, why would playing sports, playing football and baseball and basketball, or going to the movies be worth leaving twelve kids impoverished?" So that ended that.  And so I continued my life as usual, but it was--I went back to where I was but there was this brief interlude that I became deeply religious as a young kid in the Holiness Church.
Speaker 2: How old were you at the time, you think?
Speaker 1: I was still in elementary school, so I think it was that period when a lot of young kids become rather idealistic. It's in that ten to twelve, you know, just sort of pre-adolescence, just when young kids are slowing down, preparing for this huge onslaught, this tremendous rapid change of adolescence when your body, your hormones, everything starts to grow quickly.  But there's a period, you know, in human development when you slow down because your body's getting ready for this huge surge and it's in that period, often times, that you see young kids become these very spiritual, almost idealistic, you know, kind of wonderful people who see things in these kind of beautiful terms.  And because this period when you're slowing down, when your body's slowing down, you're not growing so fast because you're getting ready because your body's saying, "Rest, because for the next few years everything's going haywire," you know, and so it was during that period of time, I would say during that ten to twelve.
Story_ID: 6482
Speaker 1: Now I want to also ask you, what were you like as a young person? You said you were spoiled a little bit--I don't know if you recognized you were spoiled.  But were you an introspective person, were you mischievous, were you, you know, a loud mouth, were you well-behaved?  I mean, what were you like?  What was the young Ron Dellums like?
Speaker 2: Now I wasn't--one thing I said--I wasn't a loud mouth. Spoiled to the extent that my grandmother did special things for me but I also knew that there were limits--that I would get the whipping. You know, because this is old school, "spare the rod [spoil the child]" kind of thing. But she might bake two cakes and the small cake that I had, you know, that was mine, under my bed, that I cut for me.  Or there were times when I would be home and my grandmother would fix special food for me. You asked me earlier what are my favorite foods.  I ate so much that I couldn't eat what the reg-, what everybody else ate because I was eating so much when I went into my growth spurt, alright?  Right after that period because they used to say, "Sit down boy, you look like you're growing right there standing up," and I ate everything in sight. So I learned to really like beans because if they fixed chops or whatever, that wasn't enough food for me, so my grandmother fixed food for everybody else and a pot of rice, pot of beans, half a gallon of milk, cornbread for me alone.  That's not what everybody else ate, but that was the only thing I could eat to fill myself up. So red beans, pinto beans, you name it, I ate it, okay? And I was just growing and I was growing so I was not big, not husky, because I was growing so fast and I ate everything in sight. I would say that I was some of a lot of it.  I was adventurous, you know, your bicycle was your trip out of the community 'cause that was your way to explore even beyond your own community, and so I was an explorer, I was adventurous.  I was a good student, although the nuns used to say, "I'm not giving him a 'A', I'm giving him a 'B'," which at that time I never quite understood, "So I'm giving him a 'B' because he's not working. It's too easy for him.  If he were working harder--the same--this other person sitting next to him, doing exactly what Ronald was doing, I would give them a 'A', but I'm giving Ronald a 'B' because I want to challenge him to work harder."  And so, you know, I'd work hard.  But in my home I had to do my homework everyday, that was an important part of my life.  I was an athlete.  I was well-liked, you know. I didn't like to fight, but if I had to, I fought. My friends treated me special because my folks--see, I was kind of like this special guy--Catholic school and other things, and my folks wanted me to go to college, so at sundown, my friends used to call me 'Sundown Ronnie' because when the sun came down, I was supposed to be home to eat dinner, do my homework.  And so at sundown, you know, my friends would say, "Run, Ronnie, Run," you know, because it meant head home. Wherever I was, when the sun came down I had to start, I had to head home.  So there were certain, there was a framework within which I lived, but inside that framework I had absolute freedom to move around.  And I was, as I said, I was liked by my friends, you know, I was, you know, sometimes a leader, sometimes a follower, but more often than not, I was a leader of my little group of guys, and I had great fun growing up. I had a wonderful childhood with an enormous number of friends because as I said, when West Oakland [California] became, you know--a huge number of kids everywhere, so I had an enormous, you know, number of friends. The only time life was not cool was when, you know, bigger, stronger, tougher guys, you know--
Story_ID: 6483
Speaker 1: Can I come back just quickly to this quick story? And I want to come to that.
Speaker 2: Yes. Please.  I want you to finish it.
Speaker 1: Some argument occurred with this guy who was kind of a bully, and my friend and I turned to walk away--to go home. I was about a block and a half from my home and he threw a knife and hit me in the back with the knife.  And the reason why the teacher the next morning said it was a miracle was because it was one of those pocket knives and he literally threw the knife, threw it so hard it hurt me, but the blade didn't hit, the back of the knife hit and I just kept walking and he never threw it again.  But, you know, every now and then I remember that moment, flashbacks of different points in your life about certain things.  Had that knife come a different way, I would have been a dead person and she mentioned that. But anyway, that was an important moment in my life, that's something else that I recall.
Story_ID: 6484
Speaker 1: But I--you know, I was--my grandmother reinforced that I was a good person, and she said that to me many times. My mother [Willa Mae Terry Dellums] said that to me many times, I was a good person.  "This is a nice kid," so my view of myself was that I was a good person, that I was a nice guy.  You know, it wasn't that I didn't get in trouble.  It wasn't that I didn't lie from time to time.  It wasn't that I didn't go in my grandmother's purse and ease some coins out, you know. My grandmother said, "You stole some money from me?"  You know, and later, after I'd get the spanking, later she would leave money in certain places to test me, to see if I had learned the lesson. So you know, I had that mischievous side of me as well. Candy, for some reason--sweets was the big deal, so I'd go in there shaking money out of the bank to go buy candy bars and what have you. That was a part of me, but my sense of myself as a young kid was that, you know, I was easy-going and I was not a troublesome person in my family. Like even, like sometimes we would be--I'd be with my buddies and you know, coming home late at night from the movies or whatever, you know, guys who are out there being adventurous or sometimes going by--you know how kids some of you go by the school and they pick up a rock and break a window--it's crazy stuff that kids do.  But walking down the street--now this is the black community , this is the 'hood.  Well police officers, seeing three or four or five, six young black kids walking down the street pull over, "Where you going? Where you live? What are you doing?"  And it was very interesting that they would question us and they would get to me and they would you know, "Your name, where do you live," et cetera, and always, very consistently, "You come here,"--separate from the other guys. "Why are you with these guys? You're going to get in trouble running with these guys."  Some kind of way, whatever, the speech pattern or whatever it was, for some reason even the police would say, "You're a fish out of water."  But it really wasn't, these were my friends, we grew up together. But again, as I said, West Oakland [California], different educational background, you know, et cetera--so even to them, sort of stuck out.  And one of the things that I wanted desperately to do was to not stick out because to stick out puts you in danger.  You could get beat up because even when I started to grow too fast, you know, we'd be at the parties and somebody would break in the parties and you're standing 6'2" and other people are standing 5'8".  You know, "You.  Come here." "Oh."  So you know, you try to shrink down to 5'8", so I was trying not to stand out. But at a certain point, you know, my folks gave me the wherewithal to have the courage to stand out, be the total person.
Speaker 2: So really everyone was really fighting on your behalf, I mean, to keep you on the straight and narrow in many ways.
Speaker 1: I think so. Like I said, even my peers, I mean, even guys said, "Look, man,"--when they'd get ready to go out stealing cars, or stealing hubcaps, or getting ready to get into some kind of other activity, they'd run me home.  "Get on outta here now." You know how guys would want to know your mother's first name?  "You know Willa Mae wouldn't like that. Now get on home."  Some of them would boot me in the tail, "Get on home."  And in their own way they were saying, "No, this is not for you." And they would never take me with them.  And, "Get on home. Now you know Willa Mae don't want you out here. Now go on home."
Story_ID: 6485
Speaker 1: Now what about school? Did you take a liking to school? I know you said you were a good student. Did you take a liking immediately or was it because everyone was telling you you should do well? Or you wanted to please your parents?
Speaker 2: I liked school up until high school.
Speaker 1: So the Catholic school, you said the teachers were very strict.
Speaker 2: They were strict, they were very strict, but encouraging, you know. 'Cause I knew that I was a good student--they let me know that. They just said to me that I could be better. Well, I have to backtrack. When I left Catholic school [St. Patrick's Catholic School, Oakland, California] and went to public school because, you know, they raised the tuition on non-Catholics.  My mother [Willa Mae Terry Dellums] and father [Verney Gordon Dellums] are now separated, money's important and plus my sister [Theresa Dellums] and I kept thinking public school kids were having a lot more fun. But they didn't want me to go to the public school in the 'hood [neighborhood]. So they sent me across town using C. L.'s [uncle, Cottrell Laurence Dellums] address that allowed me to go across town because C. L. didn't live in West Oakland [California], he lived in North Oakland [California], which made me eligible to go to another junior high school [West Lake Junior High School, Oakland, California], which was a white middle-class high school where there were quote "better teachers, better education."  Again, my folks wanted me to have a good education. But in junior high school at a certain point, I fell in love and I remember my counselor said, "You fell in love way too young, kid."  'Cause I was doing extremely well in school and suddenly, you know, the girls became important and this one girl became super important and my focus in school kind of unraveled.
Story_ID: 6486
Speaker 1: I asked you just briefly about your parents' separation and it affected you--did it affect you?  You were the oldest. Were you affected?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in one sense, but you know, I was used to my father [Verney Gordon Dellums] being gone. See, I was used to my father being gone and once--because he worked on the railroad. And so it wasn't a total change because he would spend days, weeks, you know, as they used to say "running on the road." It did bother me that my mother [Willa Mae Terry Dellums] and father separated, but in my own sense, you know, as kids in their own sort of juvenile way know when something's not quite right, know when Mom's not happy or when Pop's not happy--and I sort of sensed that.  And as I look back--while that unraveled my life to some extent, I think in my own sort of primitive, youthful way, I understood that they needed to go their own way.  And then my father wasn't that far away, he was several blocks away but I could get on my bike, or I could get a ride with my friends.  I could go see my father whenever I wanted to. And I went to see my father regularly, so we'd talk and never questioned that he was not my dad and my father loved me. I was a baseball player, wanted desperately to be a baseball player and even with meager resources, my father made sure that I had the baseball bats, the gloves, the shoes, the whatever. This was his way of showing support. If there was one lament that I ever had, was that I always wanted my dad to be able to see me play.  And he was always too busy to do that, which was fascinating because later in my life I was busy saving the world, and I was not at the games of my own children. And so in one sense, you know, later I understood even more clearly why my father wasn't there. Sometimes it's not because he didn't want to be, because he had no option.  But that didn't throw me off a great deal because my relationship with my dad was never interrupted.
Story_ID: 6487
Speaker 1: And just to go forward a little further, at a certain point, I was able to do something that most young people are never able to do. In my--I was married once, first while I was in the [U.S.] Marine Corps and at a certain point I realized that I was not going to make it in that situation--that I felt that I was going to literally die in that relationship, that I--that this was a mistake.  Well-intended, I was trying to do the right thing as it were, 'cause that's the way I grew up. That's the way I was trained--make your bed, lay in it, take your responsibilities. But at a certain point, I realized that this was a mistake,  that if I was going to evolve  as a human being, I need to get out of this.  And I went to see my dad [Verney Gordon Dellums] who was living in a little apartment, one-bedroom apartment, and I told my father, I said, "Dad, I've got to get out of this, I have to get out of this marriage, but I have no money and I'm going to school on the G.I. Bill [federal education benefit for military veterans] and I got, you know, and I have a part-time job, but I need a place to stay because I have to pay child support and whatever."  And he said, "You can come live with me," which was a phenomenal time in my life because most children only see their parents as parents so their roles, the roles they play a role in your life. I was--my father became my best friend and my roommate. I lived with my dad all through college and we'd live with each other, two men.  And so I got to really know my father as a human being in a way that many young people never get to know their parents, because they always see them in the context of relationship in the home.  I--my relationship became isolated with my father. We lived with each other for six years, night and day. So we had to accommodate each other, you know, when he had his girlfriends, I had mine.  We had to have signals. "Well son, if the window shade is up six inches, then that means you gotta go spend the night with your partner 'cause I'm busy."  Or if my shade was--.  So we had to learn to live with each other even at that level of intimacy. We had to share space with each other, so I got know my father's strengths and his weaknesses, he got to know mine, you know.  And we loved each other, we'd argue with each other, and I cherish that moment. I cherish that time in my life. It was a wonderful time, wonderful opportunity for me to really get to know my dad in a way that I had never gotten to know him before, in a way that many people never get to know their father.
Speaker 2: What surprised you most about your father that you learned during that time?
Speaker 1: That he's really a very gentle man, incredibly gentle guy, loved to argue, loved to argue.  And he had this incredible memory, you know, like my dad, I'm sometimes--I'd be there--my dad would, he'd come in with his friends and say, "I told you alright, get the book, I'm going to page 133, you know, on the bottom of the page.  Now read it.  I told you that's what it was," and it was that kind of memory--loved to argue.  But move that aside, there's this incredibly gentle man, very gentle guy that I got to know. And I really had a great feeling for the gentleness of my father and I really got to know and understand my dad as a human being. And I also got a chance to understand my dad's insecurities.
Story_ID: 6488
Speaker 1: Because C. L. [Cottrell Laurence Dellums] was his older brother, C. L. was a larger than life figure not only in my life, C. L. was a larger than life figure in my dad's [Verney Gordon Dellums] life. He became sort of a father surrogate to my dad. Here's C. L. Dellums, the great labor leader, C. L. Dellums, the great Civil Rights leader, C. L. Dellums, this very powerful guy, this very influential African American man. But my dad might have been even brighter than C. L., but he had to live in the shadow of C. L. So here's this guy who lived a whole different live than C. L., struggled financially, you know, lived a different level of life. But my dad had his friends, men and women loved my dad, you know.  But he had a different kind of life than C. L.  So the other piece that I learned about my father was that I sensed his pain, that he lived in the shadow of somebody that loomed larger than him.  But that on any given day, my dad could have been C. L. or better--incredibly bright, thoughtful person, and a guy who taught me to question things. Because I'd come home with rote memory and my dad said, "That's not the way it happened. Ask questions."  So he taught me to hear and to listen and to absorb but not to take in without question--to search for my own perspective. That he gave me because he always questioned things and he would argue with me and talk with me so he'd say, "No, read this.  Be informed.  Understand this." So here's a man without college education but who understood the value of reading, who understood the value of assessing and arriving at your opinions and views, and here's a guy who had a very progressive perspective, you know, about things. And I remember when I came home from the Marine Corps, you know, my dad was like, "I hope you're not brainwashed," you know, because he was a progressive guy and a thoughtful person. But living with him, we got to know each other and I felt and sensed my dad's love, I sensed his gentleness, I sensed his insecurity.  But I also understood that he gave me something very important in that at this point in my life I understand what he gave me and I'm very thoughtful and very thankful for it. People compliment me on my ability to retain a lot of information but I have no ego about that. That's in the genes, I got that from my dad.
Story_ID: 6489
Speaker 1: Now just a little bit, can we just touch on the--you know, you being a Marine and going into the [U.S.] Marines [Corps]?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: I just want to know--'cause you had a friend, I mean you were at this point, you're not doing well academ-, you know, in school, you're exploring other parts of life, right?
Speaker 2: Right. Because I graduated from high school [Oakland Technical High School, Oakland, California], absolutely blew a scholarship because in high school one of my teachers discovered this young African American kid and went to the other teachers and said, "This guy has the potential to go to college," so I was a young black kid that the white teachers discovered and they talked among themselves and they said, "Give him a chance, this guy is college material."  I remember I was sitting in the back of a chemistry class and I was doing literally zero, 'cause I'm sitting in the back talking and dodging and the teacher, apparently in talking with the other teachers, kept me after class and said, "When you come to class tomorrow, you will sit in the front row."  So, she moved me from the back row to the front row and my grades changed from the back row to the front row because now I'm sitting right there--I'm forced to be attentive, I'm forced to focus, I'm forced to be prepared because I can't hide in the back of the room, so I'm out front. Well, the teachers went to the principal and said, "This guy can go to college.  He's college material, working class, black family.  There any money here?"  They discovered a scholarship that somebody had endowed for young--then it was Negro, male, academic scholarship, not athletic--academic, black male, it was that circumscribed. So they put me in for the scholarship early on, this is in my sophomore year, high sophomore year.  Scholarship's sitting there for me, multi-thousand dollar scholarship to the University of California, Berkeley, all I got to do is keep doing what I'm doing and I'm going to get this scholarship. My life's going to radically change.  My folks [Verney Gordon Dellums and Willa Mae Terry Dellums] didn't have the money to send me through college, here's UC [University of California] Berkeley.
Story_ID: 6490
Speaker 1: I proceed again--hormones raging, discovered the girls, wanted to play ball,  and also wanted to--now, I went to school across town but I lived in West Oakland [California]--I wanted to run with the fellas, be part of the peer group. And--so my grades went down because I was focused on other things. I--well fundamentally, I lied to my parents [Verney Gordon Dellums and Willa Mae Terry Dellums] for two years because I got--I was able to obtain from my friends blank report cards, 'cause I didn't have the heart to tell my mother that I was really screwing up by the numbers in school because I'm out ripping and running and doing all these things that young teenagers do.  But one of them I wasn't doing, was doing my homework and paying attention. School was easy for me, it was just that I just blew it.  And so I made two sets of cards--my mother and father are separated now, and my mother signed all my report cards. Nobody ever saw V. G. [Verney Gordon] Dellums's signature so I could just make up a signature.  So I set up two sets of cards--the real cards which I signed, and the false cards which my mother signed.  And she's thinking all the way through high school [Oakland Technical High School, Oakland, California] that her student is still on the Principal's List, that I'm in for this scholarship, and I didn't have the heart to tell her that I was really screwing up. Well, the day of reckoning comes--graduation night.  By that point, I wasn't even sure I was going to graduate from high school because, you know, I'm happily being one of the fellas, but suddenly here's the night.  First of all, am I going to be embarrassed by not graduating because I'm, you know, skipping classes, and making excuses for not going to school, and coming in late and not doing my homework?  I mean, this was my period of sort of falling apart and kind of exploring other things.  As I said, this was that adolescent period when everything's going "Boom!" at the same time, and you're not quite able to make sense of it.  And my mother come--my parents come to hear this great announcement--"Ronald V. Dellums, recipient of multi-thousand dollar scholarship to the University of California"--and I wasn't even sure I'm going to graduate.  (Sighs) But I did graduate that night, thank God. And I remember, with fear and trepidation, I ran into the locker room in the basement that night and opened the envelope--"Whew, diploma's there, so round one is over, but I've got to face this other thing." So, we go out to dinner, my mother--father bought me a watch for graduation. And my mother said, "Well, what about the scholarship?" "Mom, Dad, up until now, I've been a boy. Tonight I have to grow up and be a man.  I have to tell you that I have lied to you, and I have to take responsibility for lying. But I promise you, I'll make something of myself. I promise you, I promise you. I messed up and I know that I shouldn't have.  We don't have that kind of money for me to throw away a several-thousand dollar scholarship to the University of California [Berkeley] but I promise you I'll go to college. I promise you I will do this."  And so I did to go college but, you know, I didn't--hadn't quite figured out what I wanted to do. I wasn't really quite sure, so I went to San Francisco City College [San Francisco, California] for a minute and then I said, "You know, my mother's working, my father's trying to put me through school, this is my fault."  So that became the rationale for me to drop out of college and I said, "Mom, Dad, I want to pay my own way through college. I screwed this up, I've got to deal with it. I'm going to leave school, go make some money. I promise I'll go back to school."  My mother thought, "No, this guy's going to land in San Quentin [State Prison, San Quentin, California], gonna end up in jail.  This is going to be the worst thing in the world."  I said, "No, Mama, I promise you."

Speaker 1: So I go out to try to find a job. I'm either too young, too inexperienced, or black--or all three--couldn't find a job. And then I decided that I was going to join the service.  And my father [Verney Gordon Dellums] said, "You don't want to go down South, so don't join the [U.S.] Army."  Okay, so you're in rural bases and you know, in different places. He said, "Join the [U.S.] Coast Guard. Seaport towns--better, you don't have to confront the same kind of racism and oppression you would going into rural South, et cetera on some of these military bases."  So I decided that I'm going to join the Coast Guard. I went there, they said, "We're not recruiting right now"--slammed the door on me. I talked my buddy into it. I said, well now I've decided that I could be on the sea, so I talked my buddy into joining the [U.S.] Navy. We go to be recruited by the Navy.  The Navy wants to talk us into not a four-year term, but sign up for six years, not as seaman, but as stewards--now this is in the '50s [1950s].  So they want me to be a cook or whatever.  Well, you know, my uncle [Cottrell Laurence Dellums]--Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters [Pullman porters union]--I had no problem with cooks and stewards, it's just that that wasn't what I wanted to do.  And don't make that the ceiling for me, don't make that--don't limit my universe.  I want to be a seaman--no four-year seaman, no six-year steward.  And so the guy in the  [U.S.] Marine Corps, which is a component of the Navy said, "I've got a deal for you guys." My buddy said, "I want nothing to do with the Marine Corps."  I took the test.  I passed and he passed, but I passed higher than he did, so I was category one, could leave immediately.  He was a lower category, he would leave in a few months.  "No, we want to go together."  "Can't do that."  So that was another reason why I wouldn't go in the Navy.  So we said, "Okay, not going to the Marine Corps, let's try the--"He said, "I've always wanted to go to the [U.S.] Air Force.  I've done your thing, now you do mine."  So we go over and decide we're going to volunteer to join the Air Force because I'm going to go in to get the G.I. Bill [federal educational benefit for military veterans], that's what this whole military thing was about.  So, we go in. Here's two hot bodies ready to go to the Air Force, the recruiter says, "Here, take the test."  We both take the test, same thing happened.  I passed category one, he passed a lower category. "You can leave in a week or two, you can leave in a month or two or three." "No, no, we want to go together, we're buddies."  "Sorry, you're category here, he's category here."  So suddenly we realized that we're not going to be able to do this together.  So we leave and he said, " Ron, I really want to join the Air Force for four years."  He said, "You're going back to college, I'm not going to college. If you can go in the Marine Corps for two years--," he said, "--man, you're gone. Guys like us, we can do anything for two years. You could do two years standing on your head.  Then you can go back to college, that's what you want to do. I'm going to make this a career. Why don't you go ahead and join the Marines?"  He said, "As your friend, that's what I say you ought to do."  So we go back, I join the Marine Corps for those reasons. I announce to my mother [Willa Mae Terry Dellums] that I've joined the Marine Corps--this is Monday night, Wednesday morning, I'm off to the Marines. My mother almost fell over dead. Her thought being I'll never go to college. "I promise you, Mom. I'll go to college, G.I. Bill, I'll do this."
Story_ID: 6492
Speaker 1: I joined the [U.S.] Marine Corps, I passed the test--I passed the test very high, so in the boot camp I get interviewed by two white gentlemen--military guys--who were recruiting for Officer's Candidates School because I scored high enough to qualify and I had college prep and some college. So I walk in to to be interviewed, and these two white guys--I walk into this quonset hut--and these two white guys look up and here's this black guy and it was clear to me that they were surprised that I was black and they said, "Well, what race are you, lad?" and I said--this is the '50s [1950s]--"Sir, I'm a Negro, Sir."  "That's what I thought. Get on back to your outfit, son."  I was summarily dismissed.  So with shattered dreams and hopes because I figured, "Man, I'm going to be an officer." I'd never seen (with emphasis) a black officer in my life.  So here's an opportunity for me to be a black officer, this was a door-opener, right? "Maybe my folks are going to be proud of me.  This will be my way to get my college education. I'm going to show my folks that I'm going to make it, black officer, this is incredible, okay?"  But suddenly that was crushed in a split second.  Come to find out that when you first come into the Marine Corps, they cut off all your hair. I was just a light-skinned guy. Somebody just looked up and just saw a light, skinny--was Ronald V. [Verney] Dellums, Caucasian--by mistake, 'cause I had no hair, or anything.  And so they came to--the only difference was that they thought were going to interview a white private in boot camp rather than an African American and I was summarily dismissed.  And that's what my drill instructor, who was a black fellow told me, "That's why you were rejected, they thought you were white."  So that wasn't my--so from that point, it was just a matter of getting out.  And then when I got out, the G.I. Bill [federal educational benefit for military veterans] became my vehicle to go to college and so I spent six years and received a master's degree from University of California [Berkeley, California] with the G.I. Bill in part and working in part.
Story_ID: 6493
Speaker 1: We were talking about the [U.S.] Marines and how that was really--once that happened with the Officer Candidate School, your whole thing was to get out.
Speaker 2: Well, that was a great disappointment to me because it's not so much that I--you know, 'cause I went into the Marine Corps for a very specific reason--get the G.I. Bill [federal education benefit program for military veterans]. But for a brief moment, that door opened up at a time when, you know, I read about, you know, [General Benjamin Oliver] B. O. Davis [Jr.], you know, and a couple of one or two black generals who became larger than life people.  But up until that point, I had never seen a black officer up front and personal, so this was, you know, this was a door-opener kind of moment. So that was crushed and that gave me a different view of things, okay? But I have to say honestly, that my experience in the Marine Corps for me, personally, was a good experience.  It was a incredible experience at several levels. One, I developed the experience of living beyond my family, that I learned how to survive on my own. I learned how to live in another environment where I did not have the immediate support of my family and my friends. I had to develop new friends.  I had to develop survival skills and hone survival skills and be able to survive in a whole different kind of world, a different kind of environment. [Ronald] Ron Dellums is now operating out there in the world on his own. You've got to sink or swim. There are rules, regulations, there are pitfalls, there are dangers, there are opportunities.  You've got to figure this out. Mom's [Willa Mae Terry Dellums] not there, Dad's [Verney Gordon Dellums] not there, Gram's not there, your sister's [Theresa Dellums] not there, your friends at home are not there.  You've got to survive. So I learned that, I learned the sense of that, the sense of discipline, that discipline and focus are important aspects of one's life.  You learn how to discipline yourself, learn how to focus, learn how to be measured. Those are important values.
Story_ID: 6494
Speaker 1: Also, one of the points that I was going to make earlier when I said high school [Oakland Technical High School, Oakland, California]--see, I wanted to be a baseball player and I went across town to school where they never had many black athletes, certainly in baseball.  That was still a white guy's sport for the most part in the '50s [1950s]. Remember, not too long before that, you know, was Jackie Robinson in our lifetime. And I didn't make the baseball team. Maybe I wasn't there, maybe I wasn't up to it but I thought I was, and I didn't make the team and I sort of lost heart for high school as a result of that.  Well, the [U.S.] Marine Corps--because in the mythology-- Ron, that Ron survived the Marines, you know, because the sense of Marine Corps training--this is rough duty, this is rough training.  So when I came home a Marine, that was almost better than having a letter as a member of the varsity team. So in one sense, the Marine Corps became my--my Marine Corps uniform to my peers back home became my varsity letter except it was a 'M' rather than a 'T' for Tech High [Oakland Technical High School].  You know, so this was physical validation. Also, psychologically, the guys that I would walk two blocks out of the way to not have to confront as a kid, I no longer feared them because my sense of being able to handle myself psychologically and physically was very different.  One of the things you do learn in--you are a Marine--so I was trained so I knew how to handle myself so I was not as uncomfortable with myself physically. You know, because I wasn't fearful of anybody. You want to take me on, take me on. I'm not Ronnie D. that left here before. I'm Ronnie D. the Marine. I have no fear of you.  I'm confident in my ability to handle myself--very different.  So for all those reasons I knew that I could survive on my own, I learned discipline, I developed a confidence in myself, you know, because to run and jump and handle and march and carry and do and under great stress and survive it, that that says something to me.  That let me realize that I could operate, you know, in a stressful environment and I could survive. I could learn the rules and I could play the game and that I could survive.
Story_ID: 6495
Speaker 1: On the other end of that, there was the G.I. Bill [federal education benefit program for military veterans] that provided me the opportunity to go back to school. Initially, I went back to school because I felt that I needed to repay my parents [Verney Gordon Dellums and Willa Mae Terry Dellums] because I had lied to them and that I knew that I had let them down.  And in my own sense, I knew that in some way that my parents needed--I needed to live out my parents' dream. The things that they were not able to do, that would be okay with them if the next generation did it, and I let them down.  So when I initially came back with the G.I. Bill and working, et cetera, I did it for my parents. But at a certain point, school became wonderful to me on its own, and that I realized that I love to learn and that learning and being in a learning environment was challenging and special and that I enjoyed it. And that I could be successful in that, that I realized that I could learn at this level, that the reasons why I didn't do it earlier had nothing to do with capacity and capability, just had to do with the moment--I was busy, interested in other things and doing other things. But now I'm focused. Now I come back from the [U.S.] Marine Corps my sense of myself was as a man, not as a boy, not as a teenager, but as a man.  And as a person more mature and that I had 'X' amount of years to do what I needed to do, so I needed to be disciplined and I had learned discipline. I needed to be focused, I had learned focus. I could get the G.I. Bill for four years--California, Veterans [Administration] for two more years--six years I could get some assistance, so I have six years to do my thing.  So I did six years--two years at community college [Oakland City College, Oakland, California], two years, San Francisco State College [later San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California], two years University of California [Berkeley, California]--A.A., B.A., M.S.W. [Master of Social Work] [academic degrees]. And so the Marine Corps helped me, you know, develop that but along the way I decided this is what I wanted to do. I realized at a certain point I was not going to school for my parents, I was going to school for myself.
Speaker 2: Do you remember when that clicked? When you realized that? Was there a defining moment?
Speaker 1: I think that came when I transferred to San Francisco State [University]. Then it started to be fun and--I had, you know, I had left my first marriage and--you know, taking care of my kid.
Speaker 2: That's [Pamela] Pam--your first wife was, was it Arthurine [Dellums]?
Speaker 1: Yes, and Pam, my first daughter.
Story_ID: 6496
Speaker 1: And you were then at Oakland first.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Oakland City College [Oakland, California]?
Speaker 2: Right, and I finished Oakland City College living with my father [Verney Gordon Dellums]. But then when I went to San Francisco State [University, San Francisco, California], I truly was a young single guy in my twenties going to school, but I had the maturity of, and the mystique of being a former [U.S.] Marine, so the girls saw me a little differently, the fellas saw me somewhat differentl. You know, because well, you know, I was a Marine, so I wasn't just like a guy that went from high school to college, okay? There was an intervening period there. And I started to enjoy my life, I started to have fun. And the Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] wanted to recruit me because at that point, I started carrying a 3.0 grade point average because I heard that 3.0, that's what everybody was shooting for so I said, "Okay, 3.0, that's cool," so I lifted my game to 3.0. And then they said, "Man, you know, the man's a good student--3.0" and so I was going to join the Kappas but my buddy, [John] Johnny Apperson was an Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity]. So Johnny talked me into pledging Alpha and I pledged Alpha and I went through rough duty because, well if you were a Marine you can handle this, so I took some extra, you know, some extra action, but I had to handle it. You know, like that commercial [slogan], "Never let them see you sweat?" So I had to handle it like that. I can't let them know they're getting to me because their image of me is that I'm tough, so I have to be tough, even though sometimes I wasn't, okay? But you learn how to mask and handle things. But I had fun going through college and then by my senior year, I said, "Well, what's 3.0, that's--let's see if I can lift my game higher," so I lifted my game higher and I believe in my major, I graduated with 3.85.  So, you know, a three point something high, but it was a much higher level.  So then I realized that I could go even further and then with graduate school--now I'm paying child support, working part-time--hundred and some dollars a month--G.I. Bill [federal education benefit program for military veterans]--I don't have much money.  Graduate school comes, "Well, Mr. Dellums, we don't have any financial support for first year graduate students, second year graduate students.  Most of our students come from agencies where their agency is paying or they have the resources or you know, whatever.  Do you have the resources to get you through the first year?"  So, I looked at the woman and lied straight-forward, "Yes ma'am, I've been saving for a long time, you know, since my days in the Marine Corps for this college educa-," okay,  and I have two nickels to rub together.  And they said, "Well, your academic record is excellent; you have outstanding references." And I remember one day I came home and there was this envelope--and I was living with my dad--from the University of California at Berkeley.  This is like beyond my wildest imagination because remember, I'm the first member of my family to go to college, getting a B.A. was excellent. I opened the envelope and those words, "You have been accepted" my heart jumped. I said, "Yes! I'm going to Cal-Berkeley." [University of California at Berkeley] And I was going to Cal and I was working at nights and the weekends and carrying a full load--full-time student.  My counselor heard that I was working weekends and nights and a full-time student. She said, "Are you trying to kill yourself?"  And I said, "I'm just trying to get through school. I want to do this."  So she put me in for a John Hay Whitney Fellowship and I got it, but by the time it came, it was near spring, so I had just about made it through the first year anyway.  So that was extra money that I put aside, you know, for my education, and I kept working. I got through the first year. Second year, I received a Veterans Administration stipend, it's like a scholarship--they gave a lot of different scholarships and stipends--and I was awarded the VA stipend and I wanted to be a psychiatric social worker which paid me pro rata [at a proportionate rate] as an introductory psychiatric social worker--so it was a good stipend. That's how I got through my second year of school and you know, that was more money than I had seen in a long time. And I graduated from UC [University of California] Berkeley with an M.S.W. [Master of Social Work] and I went into psychiatric social work, that's what I decided to do.
Story_ID: 6497
Speaker 1: And I decided to go to psychiatric social work--one, because I was very interested in, you know, this whole field and at a certain point I decided I was going to try to be the black Sigmund Freud.  When I look back, I kind of smile about that. But the other reason was again--black man in a racist society grew up in an environment where people said, "If you're going to make it, you can't be less than the white guy 'cause you have no chance.  And if you're equal, you're going to lose on the basis of race, 'cause if you're the same as, they're going to choose the white guy."  So if you have any potential, if you have any potential to succeed, you have to be better. That's your guarantee, that's your only real potential guarantee that you have, is to be better than the white guy.  So, and this was not trying to put pressure on me or my generation, but it was our folks trying to say to us, "End this kind of environment.  Understand you can't slough off and you can't be mediocre.  You've got to be--you have to excel."  So my whole life in one sense was programmed, you know, for that kind of excelling, so I looked out there and said, "Psychiatric social workers can probably work anywhere in any setting because they were the prestige social workers. So let me go be a psychiatric social worker.  I can work in any setting with that training.  It may not be the, you know, the same.  You might not be able to work in a psychiatric setting with this M.S.W. [Master of Social Work], but this M.S.W. will allow you to work anywhere."  And so I pursued that and that became the vehicle, you know, for my training and I enjoyed that experience. Again, it was a wonderful opportunity for me.
Story_ID: 6498
Speaker 1: Now didn't you take an exam also at that time and scored, you know, very high on it?
Speaker 2: During--.
Speaker 1: And for the state afterwards?
Speaker 2: Yes, they had a state-wide exam for social workers and I scored in the top few percent in the state-wide exam and I remember I got opportunities to work all over the state of California because I had scored extremely high--it was like in the top one or two percent. And so I got opportunities to go everywhere.  I also had an opportunity to go to the Karl Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas for a post-graduate course in group psychotherapy, which I was tremendously interested in, but I could have done it as a single person, but I couldn't do it now as a married guy with kid. And so I had to turn that down and I took a job in the [San Francisco] Bay Area as a psychiatric social worker with the [California] State Department of Mental Hygiene. I worked in an after-care program with people on leave from state mental institutions. So I worked with people with histories of--severe psychotic histories and I worked in that field for a while, though my training at the Veterans Administration during my second year graduate school was in an out-patient clinic.  And I worked in a clinical environment and I worked with a gentleman who was the president of the American Group Psychotherapy Association and he chose me as his co-therapist as a student--which was very prestigious, which is why I wanted to pursue group psychotherapy.  But, you know, I had to work in a job, so I worked in the Department of Mental Hygiene and I did that for a while.
Story_ID: 6499
Speaker 1: I heard of these sort of pre-poverty program opportunities and I decided that I wanted to take my skills back to the black community and back to the low-income community and take my training. So I left the field of psychiatric social work, but it was as a direct result--well, in part, because there's always multiple reasons why things happen--but I was assigned a case as a psychiatric social worker.  A black man in his forties with a very hostile history--angry, hostile, and you know, they assigned him to me.  They said, "Ron Dellums,"--I'm a young black guy--"would be perfect."  So I'm staffing the case and I tried to do my best. I read up, read all I could about this fellow and it was interesting because up to a certain point, there was no history of mental illness, there was no history of him acting out.  But at the point where he lost his job, he started to act out.  In looking back, his life, apparently his life deteriorated.  Here's a man who saw himself as self-sufficient.  He was not a skilled worker, he was not a trained worker, he's not a well-educated worker, but he worked.  He was a laborer and he had a job, he took care of himself, he took care of his family, paid his bills, he lived his life.  When he lost that, everything unraveled and he started to act out.  That one particular day, he looked at me and he stopped me and he said, "You know, I like you.  And I'm proud of you.  You know, a young black man and I know you want to help me."  He said, "I'm going to tell you something.  I don't want to talk about my feelings, man.  I need a goddamn job," and that was so pointed and so poignant and so incredibly "right there" for me.  While it may have been overly simplistic, maybe even overstated, there was a powerful truism to that--in realty to that and it was at that moment that I knew that the days of Ron Dellums seeking to be black Sigmund Freud was over, because this man in one sense is right.  And how many men over forty, how many black people, how many people where the economic and the racial and the social oppression have harmed them, and that it gets manifested in all these different ways, but what about these other factors that contribute to this oppression? To what extent can I deal with those issues?  And that in one sense, whether I fully understood it at that moment or not, was my journey out of psychiatric social work.  Although social work and the psychiatric training that I had will always--and I've always used that, it has never left me.  That training was important to me but I knew that I had to express it in some other way than a one-on-one clinical relationship.  And that took me out of that.
Story_ID: 6500
Speaker 1: I went into pre-OEO [Office of Economic Opportunity] poverty programs funded by Ford [Motor Company] Foundation, [U.S.] Labor Department, President's Commission on Youth Crime and Delinquency and what is now HHS [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services] but then was HEW--[U.S. Department of] Health, Education, and Welfare--developed pre-poverty program prototypes.  And I worked in San Francisco [California] in one of them called the Youth Opportunity [employment program managed by the Private Industry Council of San Francisco]--fabulous experience for me 'cause it took me back to my roots, took me back into a low-income community. Took me back  dealing everyday--now as a more skilled and well-trained person, but it took me back to the sisters and brothers in the 'hood [neighborhood].  It took me back to young people.  It took me into the areas that I felt I needed to be in. I learned about community organization up close--mobilizing politically, using community organization and organization to politicize an issue, how to empower people at the local level. And somewhere along the way, I remember it was interesting because we had a confrontation with the mayor of San Francisco at the time, who was Mayor [John] Shelley, and we were advocating on behalf of the poor people. And our argument was that poor people should control the funds in the program that effect their lives and that if you're going to have a board of directors of the poverty program, poor people should be in the majority, they should be in the control, okay?  So we were the young Mau-Maus [Kenyan insurgent movement of the 1950s], we were the young, you know, black militants at the time. We were the 'Young Turks' [young progressive members of established groups].  And we went to Mayor Shelley to confront the power structure on these issues and I had one role to play, some part of it that I was supposed to speak to and when I finished, Mayor Shelley--and when I look back, I remember he was the first guy--'cause he said, "You ought to be in politics, you're a natural," and that's the first person that ever said, "You ought to be in elective office," and I had never--no one has ever said that to me.  And at the end, walking out the door, I mean when he put his hand on my shoulder and he said, "I meant that--,"  He said, "--you're an absolute natural. You ought to be in politics."  And I had never ever thought about that.  It had never been something that, you know, we were community organizers.  Other people who were politicians, also remember, C. L. [uncle, Cottrell Laurence Dellums] said, "Never be the guy out front, be behind the scenes pushing." So that's what we were--that's what I was about.
Story_ID: 6501
Speaker 1: On the African American side, the director of the Youth Opportunity [employment program managed by the Private Industry Council of San Francisco, California] was a black man, a Ph.D. from Brandeis University [Waltham, Massachusetts].  To me, he was like God, he was like, here's this black man who's running this multi-million dollar program, Ph.D. from Brandeis University--very erudite, articulate, brilliant man that's running the whole thing, that they had to bring from the East Coast to run this program. I had no idea he even thought I was alive. One day I get this phone call and they said, "Dr. Louis Watts--,'' was his name, "--wants to see you."  I go to see Dr. Watts and I'm in fear and trepidation because I'm working in one of twenty-some agencies that was under the umbrella of Youth Opportunity Center, a coordinated, multi-agency, multi-disciplined approach to dealing with the problems of young people between the ages of sixteen and twenty-one--education, employment, training, placement, all this stuff.  And so I went in, I said, "Sir, you know, you wanted to see me."  He said, "Here's a book. I want you to read this book. When you finish the book, come back to me."  So I said, "Yes sir."  I took the book, did an about face--I'm [U.S.] Marine-trained--left the room, and I looked at the book, 'Shoes of the Fisherman'.  And I didn't want him to think that I was a slow reader, I read this book night and day as quickly as I could so I could get back to him fast.  I read the book and I go back and he said, "Do you--?" and I said, "Sir, I've read the book."  "Why do you think that I gave you this book?"  And he could see the be-puzzlement on my face and he answered the question. He said, "I gave you the book to read because this is a story about the loneliness of leadership and I see you as a young leader and you need to prepare yourself for leadership, and it is a lonely road.  And secondly, you need to go back to school." Getting an M.S.W. [Master of Social Work] was beyond my wildest dreams, to get a Ph.D. was beyond my wildest thought--that was not even on my radar screen. He said, "And you need to go to Brandeis University  to get a Ph.D. in Public Policy. They will learn more from you than you will learn from them because what you're doing in this program is cutting edge.  This is the future, okay?  But you're a young black guy, this is the '60s [1960s], it's a union card. Go get your union card."  He sets up a interview, he then--well, along the way, he gave me another book.  He said, "I want you to read this book," and I forget the title of the book, but it was a book that essentially focused on the notion that one had to constantly be in the process of self-renewal, self-reevaluation, always ingesting and internalizing new ideas, new information, always updating,striving to be current, to be relevant, you know, always in the process of renewal, reassessment, reevaluation so that you don't become stagnant--very valuable lesson. Then he sets up this interview for me with the dean of the Florence Heller School for Advanced Studies in Public Policy [now the Heller School for Social Policy and Management, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts].  And he said, "Be at this hotel room at 2:00 [P.M.]--," I think it was a Sunday, "--I've set up this interview with the dean."  Remember, he was there at Brandeis, so one--you know, right there promptly at 2:00 I knock on the door. This very erudite gentleman opens the door, invites me into his suite, we have this interview and he asks a number of questions, he said, "Dr. Watts--you know, you come highly recommended--da, da, da, da, da--would you like to go back to school?"  By now, I'm married a second time [to Leola M. Higgs Dellums] because I got married in my last semester in graduate school.  I've got two kids--actually I had three kids--and he said, "You want to go back to school?"  "Yes sir."  "You're in."  In the fall, this is now, this would be the fall of '67 [1967].  I was going to go back to Brandeis University, okay? Great opportunity, I said, "Man, you know, I'd never thought about being a Ph.D. I can be part of the black intelligentsia. Go back to school."  I told my brothers and sisters in the movement. You know, again, never wanted to be out front, I wanted to be the guy when black folks said "I hear you rappin', but what's the plan?"  I wanted to be the guy writing the plan. I'm the policy guy, how to eradicate poverty, housing, education--da, da, da--okay, I'm the policy guy.  Okay you guys, I'm going back to school to train.  I'll be back to the movement.  They hated to see me go, but I was going to head out to Brandeis University in the fall of '67 [1967]--great adventure--take my wife and children to Waltham, Massachusetts to Brandeis.

Speaker 1: What are your kids names?  You have Pam, and--
Speaker 2: Brandon [Dellums], Erik [Todd Dellums], and Piper [Dellums].
Story_ID: 6503
Speaker 1: You've decided--okay you're gonna take this gamble and go to Brandeis [University, Waltham, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then what happened?
Speaker 2: Okay, I'm real excited. My wife Leola [M. Roscoe Higgs Dellums], who everybody calls 'Roscoe'--then Roscoe and, and she was gonna go back to graduate school. I'm gonna work on a Ph.D. My kids are going to be in a child development center, they're going to have a tremendously high dropping-off point--everything is good, this is win-win. I get a phone call one night--I believe the 21st of January--my buddies, " We want you to go to a meeting at Wilmont Sweeney's home."  Wilmont Sweeney, at that time, an attorney, was the first African American elected to the Berkeley [California] City Council.  The backdrop was that a city council election was coming up and in California at the time, local elections are non-partisan--theoretically, although everybody knows who the Republicans [political party] and the Democrats [political party] are. And they're in off-election years, so, you know, when the national elections are in even, these are in odd-numbered years. So this election was coming up in '67 [1967], spring of '67 [1967].  There were four candidates up for the city council, 'cause there are eight city council persons and the mayor makes the ninth. Four city council persons were up for election--two Republicans, two Democrats. Of the two Democrats, one man, one woman--[Arthur] Art Harris, the male, the man, Bernice [Hubbard] May the woman.  Art Harris decided for personal, family and health reasons that he would not seek re-election. He had become an icon, had been on the city council in Berkeley for many, many years. I think even since he was a young guy at UC [University of California] Berkeley.  He said to the Democratic Party, "One black person on the city council is tantamount to tokenism.  I would be honored if the Democratic Party supported the second black person--let the black community choose, we endorse their choice, that's how you could honor me." So they said, "Fine."  So my friends called me to take me to the meeting at Wilmont Sweeney's home where 'The Black Community' was to meet.  This was the power structure of Berkeley--religious, political, community, civil rights, et cetera--to choose a black candidate. I didn't want to go because I said, "Look, you guys know me. I'm going to Brandeis University in September, man, I'm not interested in politics."  You know how your friends--"No, no, man, you're going to the meeting. Be ready in twenty minutes.  That's it."  So sure enough, twenty minutes, a half hour, door bell rings. I'm married, as I said, two-bedroom apartment, three kids--stair-steps, and so I told my wife then, said, "Look, let me just go on and do this.  I'll be back about 9:30 [P.M.] or so, 9:00, 9:30. They want me to go, let me go to the meeting, I'll be back."  I go to the meeting. Six people show up who really wanted to be the candidate.  I'm the guy who didn't want to be the candidate, but I'm showing up with my friends.  They asked all seven of us different questions, asked us to make statements. I didn't mention Brandeis University--that was my business. I stuck to the business of politics, and my main point was, "I'm not interested, don't want to be in politics." Now remember, this is the '60s [1960s], our view of politics and politicians were rather cynical at the time--over thirty [years old], you know--da-da-da.  And politicians speaking out of both sides of their mouth--you've got a liberal speech, a conservative speech, a white speech, a black speech, you know, a church speech, a non-church speech--I didn't want to do that. So that was sort of our view of politics and politicians. And so I said to them, "I have very strong views about things. I don't want to be in politics."  Short version, I don't think politics is ready for me, I'm not ready for politics. Meeting goes on to about two-something in the morning. Finally they decide, here's the rules--we're going to have a secret ballot, there's seven people, whoever gets 50 percent plus one is our consensus black unity candidate, we'll keep voting until we get to that point, and low person will drop off until we get to the point where we get down to a reasonable number of candidates. They roll the blackboard out, seven names on the list, somebody said, "Well, take Ron Dellums's name off because the brother's not interested."  And I go, "Whew.  Let me get out of this, okay."  And there was this wonderful African American woman, Maudelle Shirek who is a member of the Berkeley City Council right now and been on the Berkeley City Council for some time--no one had any idea that this would ever be in her future--but she's sitting there, very quietly, observing everything. She said, "Before you take the young man's name off the list, I want to ask some questions."  And she said, "You know, I've listened to you very carefully, but you know, if the community wanted you to run, why wouldn't you run?" And, you know, I, this is not, you know, "I can make a different contribution to community. I don't have to be in politics to do that." But she said, "But if the community wanted you to run, would you run on your own terms? I heard what you said, that you feel strongly, you can't speak out of both sides of your mouth--straight head, strong. If the community asked you would you run on your terms?"  In my mind's eye, I said, "This woman is asking me am I for real. This is a question of integrity. This woman is asking me, am I full of hot air. Is this simply rhetorical, or am I serious? This is a very serious question."  And I looked at her, and inside I'm trembling, and tried to be very polite, and I said, "Ma'am, that's the only way anybody ought to be in politics, on their own terms. They should take counsel and advice from anyone, but in the end, they need to be there on their own terms.  The people need to know exactly who and what they're choosing. And the only way they know if you be there up front and honest and on your own terms.  That's the only way anybody ought to be in politics, on their own terms.  And if I were going to be in politics, that's the only way I would be in politics."  "Leave his name on the list. He is going to get at least one vote."  And I'm thinking, "Hey lady, don't do me any favors. I'm trying to get the hell out of here, okay."  And one of the guys, [Donald] Don Hopkins, who later became my chief of staff in the district, grabs me by the back of the jacket and says, "Hey, shut up, and sit down, man. We gonna win this damned thing."  And pulled me into the seat.  And that moment passed in silence.  And the rest is history--on the first ballot, 90-something percent of the votes. And suddenly here it is between 2:30 [A.M.] and 3:00 [A.M.] in the morning, I'm being congratulated, and I'm going, "But I, what, what?" And it's like a freight train hit me. I did not want to be in politics.  "What is happening to me?  This is not why I came to this meeting. I'm several hours overdue  to be home, okay?"  And people are congratulating me, writing checks and signing pledge cards and it's like, "What happened?  I want my life back."  I get home, awaken my wife [Leola M. Roscoe Higgs Dellums], "You won't believe it, I'm a candidate for Berkeley City Council."  "What are you going to do?"  "I don't know.  Maybe I can sleep a little while and figure the damned thing out."  The next morning, tossing and turning I call in deathly ill to my job, as a lot of us have done in the past, with that voice, "I'm very sick."  I stayed home all week, absolutely gone.  I am at the end of my wits. I actually looked a little schizophrenic, hair standing all over my head, no sleep, you know, in the fetal position. Got out of bed only for absolute necessities, and I'm like this--all day, all day, every day, thinking.  Finally, by Friday, my discipline kicks in, my psychiatric social worker training kicks in--empower yourself, get up, move, you've got to act.  So I go to see my friend Otho Green, who is one of the instigators.  And I said, "I've been thinking about this night and day.  I've had no sleep. You've got to get me out of this," had tears in my eyes, I was crying. I said, "Man, I don't want to be in politics.  Get me out of this.  I want to go back to school. This is what you guys want for me, I love you, but this is not what I want for me. I want my life back. I want to go to school.  You've taken my life from me, okay?  I don't want to do this."  "Man, you're really serious."  I said, "I've never been more serious in my life."  He said, "Man, it's too late."  And the 'hood [neighborhood] came out in me. I was like, "Too late?"  You know, I wanted to fight, man. "What do you mean, too late? Get me out of this, man. You got me in, now get me out."  He said, "No, man.  It's too late.  There's no--tomorrow morning at the Democratic Caucus they're ready to endorse the black unity candidate.  You're the guy, the deal's done. You're not going to get black folks together again to make this decision between now and tomorrow morning.  It's too late."  So I leave his house and go down, you know, to the waterfront and I'm thinking my wife had police looking for me.  I mean, they knew I was really on the ragged edge of my sanity 'cause I did not want to be in politics. So finally I pulled it together, I thought it all the way through and I go home.  Everybody's happy to see me.  "Where have you been?  What did you--what are you going to do?"  I said, "Well, I've never taken a dive. The community wants me to do this, so I've got to go out here and do my very best to win and let's pray that I lose."  And I guess my prayers weren't answered 'cause I won.  And I became a member of the Berkeley City Council and then three-plus years later, people probably figured how I didn't know how to say "No" to the community, so they came and said, "You got to run for [U.S.] Congress."  When the question was asked, I knew the answer because I knew that, you know, "Well, let me think about it."  I knew when I said that, I was just avoiding the--you know, what ultimately was going to be the decision 'cause I didn't know how to say "No."  Remember, this is the '60s [1960s] and early '70 [1970], you know, the whole idea of challenge and change and struggle, these were compelling ideas and they overshadowed one's personal interests.  And so in one--in essence I guess I was idealistic and optimistic and so I laid down my dreams again, and I said, "Okay."
Story_ID: 6504
Speaker 1: What was it like at that point in time?  Because I often--when I talk to people I say the Bay Area, you know, you can't say San Francisco [California] there.  Everyone says, "This is Berkeley [California].  This is Oakland [California]."  So what was West Oakland [California] like, versus Berkeley and what was Berkeley like at that point in time and how large was the council?
Speaker 2: Okay. The city council of Berkeley was eight, eight members of the city council, the mayor--because this was a city manager form of government, not a strong mayor form of government--was really the ninth city council person.  But he was called the mayor.  But the every day running of the city was a city manager.  So we had a city manager form of government, not a strong mayor form of government. I would say that--well, the whole [San Francisco] Bay Area, in my opinion, probably one of if not the most progressive region in the entire country.  But the difference, you know, probably population, West Oakland [California], to some extent is more homogeneous in that regard--working class to low-income community.  Some African American professionals continued to live there.  Here's a community, you know, battling over the poverty program, housing issues, education issues, everyday realities of the community.  Now the black community is no longer just West Oakland because they've now moved out into other areas, so African American presence is now in--all over Oakland, but West Oakland is still sort of the historic, classic, quote, black community in Oakland, but not the only now because you've got East Oakland, North Oakland, and other places.  The difference in Berkeley [California], Berkeley is a university town.  West Oakland was a working class community.  Berkeley was the--is a factory town in that sense.  The University of California--very dominant force in Berkeley, so the dynamics of the University of California at Berkeley, a very profound role an impact on Berkeley.  So if there was student upheaval on the campus of the University of California, that had impact for Berkeley, it tends to spill off into Berkeley, the politics of Berkeley--People's Park, for example, spilled into the community--that was a major piece.  Remember, Berkeley was a place where a number of professors and people in Berkeley were brought before the House on Un-American Activities Committee [Federal hearings conducted to root out Communist Party activists and sympathizers], investigated during, you know, during that period of time in the '50s [1950s].  So there were scars, you know, in Berkeley.  But Berkeley is sort of what many people used to call the 'Radical Citadel of the West'. The interesting thing about the Bay Area--Oakland, Berkeley, or even the region, but just take Oakland, Berkeley--in my opinion, was almost unique from any other place in the country outside the Bay Area because every movement of the '60s [1960s] emerged in the Bay Area in close proximity and almost simultaneously.  You had, remember, Mario Savio, years before with the student Free Speech Movement. Then here's the peace movement, the Civil Rights Movement, the nationalist movement, the African--Afro-American Society, the Black Panthers, Third World Liberation Front, the black studies, third  world studies, Gray Panthers [senior citizens radical organization],  women's liberation, the first Earth Day took place in the Bay Area--the gay liberation movement, the Brown Berets [Mexican militant organization].  So the point I make is that in the Bay Area, because of proximity and simultaneity, all of these different movements were forced to hear each other's rage, to hear each other's anger, to hear each other's analysis, and to hear each other's music, to hear each other's pain, to hear each other's poetry.  So black folks heard the young white radicals.  Young white radicals heard black folks.  We heard the Latinos.  Latinos heard the Native Americans, Asian Americans.  Women heard the gays, so across--environmentalists.  So here's all this cross-fertilization of all these different movements evolving in the Bay Area in close proximity.  So what happens?  You absorb--your analysis becomes informed by other people's analysis. You pick up pieces that resonate with you.  You start to hear things that resonate with you.  So the ground was fertile in that sense for the development of multi-racial, multi-interest coalition-building.  In the South, there was the Civil Rights Movement.  In some other place it might have been the peace movement. In some other place it might have been the peace movement and the Civil Rights Movement.  But here, you had all of this--Gray Panthers, Black Panthers, Brown Berets.  You had all of these different things, all emerging simultaneously.  And, you know, along the way here's women saying, "Wait a minute.  Why are we talking about the 'nigger-izing' process--we're being nigger-ized, too, so while we about liberation, we're going to be about liberating mom, sister, daughter, wife, okay?"  So all of this.  So the women started to challenge, women start, "Well, you know, let's talk about women's liberation in the Bay Area, let's talk about gay liberation in the Bay Area, along with black liberation, brown liberation, third world liberation."  All these things started to merge together.  "And while you're at it, you're raping, you're not only raping and plundering human beings, you're raping and plundering the environment,"--ecology.  So all this incredible diversity in 1970, that incredible diversity, that extraordinarily diverse community comes together in a coalition to elect the first African American to the United States Congress in a predominantly white district in the history of America.
Story_ID: 6505
Speaker 1: I mean, this is sort of a pretty amazing thing that's happening. One, Berkeley [California] has gained a reputation at this point, for being sort of left of center and that could be fearful to a lot of people. And then you had the Black Panther [black militant organization] movement out there--right.  The Black Panthers, even though it had different chapters, it was really based there.
Speaker 2: That's where it started.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Huey Newton, Bobby Seale.
Speaker 1: Right. And then, I mean, you had nerve to elect this [U.S.] Congressman.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--who's identified with--,
Speaker 2: --All of that.
Speaker 1: --all of that.  And you're still very new to politics in many ways.
Speaker 2: City council was all.
Speaker 1: Right. That was it. Just four years on [Berkeley] City Council.
Speaker 2: Right. Less than four years.
Speaker 1: Right.  And in the place where you also said that, you know, there was not a mayor, you know it was a city manager, so the council had your different constituencies right there.
Speaker 2: Right. We were all elected city-wide.
Speaker 1: Oh, you were elected city-wide.
Speaker 2: We were all elected city-wide in Berkeley.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: So my first election was in a predominantly white--
Speaker 1: I read of that, but I didn't know--
Speaker 2: Constituency.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were all--okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Everybody in Berkeley was elected city-wide. They now have a district system, but at that time everybody ran city-wide.  And when I ran then I ran city-wide.  The three incumbents came in one, two, three, and I was the fourth--new guy on the block, and I came in fourth and took the fourth seat.  Many people, so that first test that I won in in Berkeley, really was a majority white because the majority population in Berkeley was white.  And so that a coalition of Democrats [political party] and progressives, you know, were what elected me to the city council.
Story_ID: 6506
Speaker 1: Then in 1970, this extraordinary coalition, you know, decides to send me to [U.S.] Congress.  And I got there the hard way because I took on a Democratic incumbent with twelve years seniority in the primary in a predominantly white district.  Very few members of Congress--people come to Congress defeating an incumbent in their own primary.  New seat, open seat--a fight at the general [election], but in the primary, a very difficult thing to do.  When I agreed to accept the responsibility to run, and now maybe in part of my head, I may also have been saying, "Maybe this is what I need to do."  But when I announced, the first question that was asked of me is--short version, "You're a black man getting ready to run in a white district.  What makes you think you could win?"  And my response was, "Your question assumes that there is a monolith known as 'The White Community'--I reject that idea.  You look out there and you see 'The White community',  I look out there and I see peace activists, feminists, students, senior citizens, consumers, workers, environmentalists, et cetera.  And if I speak to the issues of the peace activists, of the advocates of peace, if I speak more effectively to the issues of the environment, if I speak more effectively to the problems of the students, of the senior citizens, of the working class, if I speak to the issues of people who are mobilized on more than one dimension--who will mobilize on the basis of their self-interests, then I think that I can take the majority of those people and win.  So your idea that it is a black man versus 'The White Community' is an assumption that I don't accept, and that people move on the basis of their self-interests, and I believe that we can take that majority and win."  And that's the coalition that allowed us to win.  Now, obviously, white voters in the [San Francisco] Bay Area [California] were not right-wing, you know, I mean, these were very progressive people, but people who were sophisticated, who decided to move beyond my race as a single factor, and who were willing to deal with me on the basis of my intellectual capability, and my political acumen, and my political integrity, my stance on the issues.  In that area, my being a young black man in 1970, if anything, was probably a plus. Because, remember, this is now when we're beginning to say, "It's time for black people to be represented in the body politic.  It's time to be represented in the Congress and in the halls of the state legislature, in the city council.  We need to elevate the numbers of African American participation in the body of politic."  So now the Bay Area, with that kind of diversity, has an opportunity to send a young black man to Congress.  And that, along with a statement that [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] made, allowed me to come here and understand what my role was in representing that diversity.
Story_ID: 6507
Speaker 1: But were you the favorite son of the [Berkeley City] Council?  I know that John George, he's the one who approached you about running, but were you the favorite son at all?  Or was it--did the whole thing of then-Governor [Ronald] Reagan, you know, attacking people on the People's Park, you know--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Bringing in the National Guard and you being identified--?
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah, and because of--well--I'll come quick, it's just that first of all, many people think that the role that I played during the People's Park [University of California at Berkeley student protest of May 15, 1969] probably was a precursor to my becoming a member of [U.S.] Congress.  Because when Berkeley [California] looked around and saw itself occupied, this was not necessarily a black community issue--the People's Park.  But when they looked around, they saw a young black man standing up in the community beyond race.  So some people think that it was at that moment that I was able to transcend (with emphasis) people's view of me as the black guy on the city council, but a black person on the city council who spoke to the concerns of the people who were being victimized irrespective of race.  And because they saw a young black man standing up on the People's Park issue, that a lot of people thought, "Well, young, white, long-haired, hippie, left-wing, Commie-pinko's issue."  But I said, "No, this is a human question, so we needs to deal with it."  And--so that was one thing, but when--the first guy that ran against--the man that I defeated was in 1996 [sic, 1966], Robert Scheer, who writes for the 'L. A. [Los Angeles] Times' [newspaper] now, who's a brilliant candidate, and he came forty-something percent of the vote, but he lost.  But it was a brilliant campaign, it went beyond their expectation. Then in 1968, a black man--a friend of mine, John George, who was on the Board of Supervisors in Alameda County [California], ran against [Jeffrey] Jeff Cohelan.  And some people thought he should run again in 1970.  But he came to me and he said, "You will be a better member of Congress, and I think you can defeat Jeff Cohelan.  And people think I have squatter's rights to run against him because I ran in '68 [1968].  But I don't think I have squatter's rights.  I want you to run. I think you can win, and I think you would make a good member of Congress.  I want you to do this."  That, along with other things, I agree to run.  I won.  And I became, as I said, the first African American to win in a predominantly white district that was 71 percent white, 29 percent total non-white, about 18 percent African American.
Story_ID: 6508
Speaker 1: This is a whole other thing, but I became Otho's principal spokesperson. So I was a guy that if Otho [Green] couldn't make the meeting, I would go in his stead and speak for Otho.  Okay?  And so Otho sent me to all the radical meetings that he didn't want to go to. And Bob Scheer was this young, radical white guy as the candidate for the CNP, the Community for New Politics.  This was a young, new left, so Bob Scheer and I were on the same podium in all these radical meetings.  One night Bob [Robert] Scheer leaned into me and said, "Why aren't you the candidate?"  He said, "You ought to be running rather than speaking for somebody else."  Because I'd get out there in these radical meetings, I didn't know what Otho thought about this stuff.  I just said, hey, I'm not going to be booed out of this joint.  So, you know, I just spoke.  And people like cheering at everything, right? [laughing]  And I'm learning from this guy, and I came back and I nicknamed him among our group the White Mau-Mau [Kenyan rebel group of the 1950s].
Speaker 2: Now, who was--?
Speaker 1: Bob Scheer.
Speaker 2: Bob Scheer.  Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Because this guy spoke against the war and talked about challenging the Vietnam War, and eradicating racism and poverty in America in a way that was so brilliant and  incredibly uncompromising.  I had never heard anybody running for office who spoke with that kind of eloquence and courage and intellect. I mean, he was without peer in my mind.  And I used to go back and say, "Man. You got to hear this white boy, man.  He is bad.  This is white (inaudible) militant, incredible guy." Right?  I'm hearing him.  I'm learning from him and his analysis about the Vietnam War.  Learning about, you know, his stance and what have you.  And I actually brokered a deal that brought my guy, Otho, and Bob Scheer together in a meeting that if my guy had adhered to the agreement, I would never have come to [U.S.] Congress because in that agreement Bob Scheer needed to get into the black community and the black churches,  and I told my guy, I said, "Bob Scheer has a human army of campaign workers.  This guy has got a few thousand students out here and young people.  He has an army.  Oppose the Vietnam War, man. You can do this as a brother.  The priorities-- Martin Luther King's [Jr.] point, "We're dropping bombs in North Vietnam that are exploding in the ghettos and the barrios of America."  Use that quote as your way of bringing in the Vietnam War. Challenge the Vietnam War.  Bob Scheer, if his campaign and your campaign hook up," I said, "I'm telling you, this guy's got a few thousand workers.  You'll win this election."  I brokered the deal. I thought I was a mastermind, you know, political thinker, again [uncle] C. L. [Cottrell Laurence Dellums] point, behind the scene.  Working the deal to get Bob Scheer in the black churches and Bob Scheer's people carried Otho's  literature.  Now we got two or three thousand people carrying Otho's literature, man we going to win this election.  My guy is pressured by the pro-war Democrats to not come out against the war so he backs off of that.  So Scheer doesn't get in the churches like the commitment was made, and Bob Scheer's people endorsed Otho's opponent.  But we had a strong campaign, a strong enough campaign going.  My guy lost by a few hundred votes and Bob Scheer lost by a few percentage points.  And if they had gone for that deal, Bob Scheer would have been in Congress and Otho Green would have been in the state legislature, and he wanted me to be his district guy.  He wanted me to be the new political guru on the block. I'm going to be the new local political boss. I'm going to be the new guy who's his representative at the state level.  Not an elected office at all, but that deal didn't go through.  Otho went off in a different direction and his life; Bob Scheer continued to pursue journalism ['Los Angeles Times' newspaper columnist].
Story_ID: 6509
Speaker 1: Four years later, I won the seat that he [Robert Scheer] ran for and I became the member of [U.S.] Congress [Washington, D.C.].  I mean, it's just absolute, you know, it's those kind of moments in history that are, watershed moments and you have no idea that these moments, at that particular time, are going to have a major impact on the future of your life. I won the primary and I beat the guy.  And then to everybody's shock and amazement, I beat [Jeffrey] Jeff Cohelan in the primary.  Then Spiro Agnew, who was at the time Vice President to Richard Nixon, President, attacks me in Arkansas.  And says to this big audience where they raised you know, millions of dollars, that there was a young man, a young black man, on his way to Washington that he perceived as the most dangerous person and the most radical person to come to Washington since Vito [Anthony] Marcantonio of New York, who won as a Socialist back in the '20s [1920s] or the '30s [1930s].  And that I was this radical that needed to be purged out of American politics.  I was a dangerous person.  I get this phone call.  This is when Agnew was going around attacking quote, rad-lib [radical-liberal] senators.  And we were talking one day, just joking in our campaign and somebody says, "Man, wouldn't that be cool if Spiro Agnew attacked you?"  And we laughed and [said], "Attack me?  Spiro Agnew doesn't even know I'm alive.  He's the Vice President of the United States and is going to attack Ron Dellums.  Right? This is ridiculous," so we laughed at that and we went on.  But he did attack me.  And I get this call in the middle of the night,  "Ron, you won't believe this. Spiro Agnew attacked you.  He called you this radical, dangerous black man.  Need to be purged out of politics."  And I sat up straight and I said, "You're lying."  They said, "No, no. It's for real."  And so I said, "Press conference tomorrow morning, ten, campaign office. I'll be there."  I couldn't sleep that night.

Speaker 1: I get up the next day and I'm standing at the street corner getting ready to cross the street into my campaign office and there's press trucks, cars, vehicles, cameras from all over the world.  They came from China, Soviet Union, BBC [British Broadcasting Corporation], ABC [American Broadcasting Corporation], NBC [National Broadcasting Company], network, cable, news, magazine.  In the height of the People's Park [Berkeley, California], I had not seen that many cameras and microphones dripping off the table.  But I'm getting ready to cross the street and out of the corner of my right eye, I see this elderly white woman slowly walking up to the corner with a cane, kind of slow.  And I looked over and she smiled at me and she said, "Are you Ron Dellums?"  And I said, "Yes, ma'am, I am."  And she said, "Well, I just walked ten blocks to give you this."  And she reached into her pocket and she took out a ten-dollar check.  I think it was about ten dollars, maybe it was smaller amount of money, five dollars or ten dollars. And she said, "Anybody that Spiro Agnew attacks, I got to support.  Good luck to you." And I hugged this woman; it was an amazing moment.  Where if I think about it now, I could cry, it was such a heartfelt moment because when I saw this woman walking so slow, this woman walked ten blocks to give me ten dollars.  And we hugged each other, this tall, angular black man, and this short, elderly white woman hugged each other on the street corner.  And she turned to make her slow journey back and I crossed the street into my future.  I walked in the room, and here's all these people.  Every eye is on me.  You know that's when, like when you graduated from high school you walked across the stage, almost forget how to walk for a minute you're so self-conscious. That's the way I felt.  And I'm nervous, and my heart is beating like this and oh my God!  And my campaign manager's, "Man, this is the big time."  And he said, "Here. Here's the statement for you to read."  And I said, "What statement?"  And he said, "Man, we've been up all night writing this statement."  And I said, "Man, I didn't need you to write a statement all night."  And they said, "Man, you going to wing this?"  I said, "I have nothing to hide.  Why do I need to a carefully written, carefully scripted statement?  I have nothing to hide.  I have nothing to fear. I don't want to read this statement, man. I love you guys for being up all night, but you didn't have to do that.  I'm not reading a statement."  Parenthetically, I probably never could have read it, I was so scared to death.  So they said, "Well, before you at least before you go into the press conference, read the press releases so at least you know what he said."  And I noticed that my hands were trembling.  So as I picked up the press release, the press papers started to quiver like this.  So in order to mask my nervousness, I acted as if I was speed-reading so that I would have to move my hand.  And so I went, "Hmm, [motions that he is turning the page] hmm [motions that he is turning the page again]."  And they're going, "Wow. This guy is speed-reading."  I never saw a word.  Never saw a word.  And so time came to sit down and said, "Press conference is starting."  They're all ready for me to read this carefully drawn statement.  Vice President Agnew says I'm a radical.  I am. You know, I mean, you carefully, and they came to see not who Ron Dellums was, but what was Ron Dellums.  They probably came to see me dance on the whims of expediency.  You know, is this guy going to handle this big-time challenge from the Vice President and well, I'm not this, and I'm not quite that. And I said, "I have no opening statement.  I'm here to answer your questions.  First question."  Pregnant pause, outside the script, right, because it was supposed to read this carefully written statement that every word was contemplated.  I didn't do that.  So finally, they get over the shock and somebody says, "Vice President [Spiro] Agnew charges that you're a radical.  How do you handle that charge?" "I don't know what Vice President Agnew means by radical, but if what Vice President Agnew means by radical is that I opposed the insanity and the cruelty of the war in Vietnam, that I oppose the insanity and the cruelty of racism and sexism and age-chauvinism, and all of the other 'isms' that harm human beings, that if he means by radical that my opposition to the pain of poverty and hunger and disease and all of the other conditions that adversely impact the human condition, then I'm proud to be called a radical."  Pregnant pause, they weren't prepared for that answer.  Remember when [Massachusetts Governor] Michael Dukakis was attacked as a liberal [during his 1988 presidential campaign], and my view was never let the other guy define who you are, because anything over which you have control is how you define yourself and your faithfulness and your willingness to show up for the battle.  Never let somebody else define you.  The assumption is that there is a consensus of what radical means, because the Vice President called me a radical, then we agree on the definition?  Then, is your definition more superior to mine?  Then I have diminished myself as a human being; I have diminished myself as a person.  I don't care if you are the Vice President, I respect your position, but I don't respect any effort to diminish me as a person or a human being. So if that's what you meant, then, fine.  I'm a radical. Always be in control of your own definition of who you are.  Now, other people, there are factors of which you have no control, but I have control over how I see myself.  So you define yourself.  Second question, "Vice President Agnew charges that you advocate bringing the walls down."  You know, this is in the days of 'Burn, baby, burn,' right?  He said, "And Dellums advocates the politics of bringing the walls down.  How do you respond to that charge?"  And just the whole idea that this was a charge by the Vice President--. I said, "Well, if the Vice President had taken the time to hear and understand my comments in context, what he would have learned that I said that we built walls very high and very thick in this country among the races, the classes, the sexes, and even the generations. And if we bring down the walls that divide us, what we will find that there are millions of human beings across race, across sex, across gender, across regions that are leading very desperate lives.  And if we bring those folks together, in a major coalition, we can change America, we can change the world.  So, yes, sir, I advocate the politics of bringing down the walls.  The walls of racism, classism, sexism, and chauvinism and all of the other 'isms' that divide us as human beings and keep us from coming together in a powerful enough and unified enough way to adjust the human misery that inflicts us across the many lines that divide us." Last question, that was it.
Story_ID: 6511
Speaker 1: So what did your people, your advisors say or think at that point?
Speaker 2: They were blown away.  But everybody was.  I had no idea what their questions were going to be, but I just sat there and just said, there's a power greater than me just allow me to express what I feel and to do the best that I can.  That's all I was asking.  So I just sat there and said, okay. Let it happen and whatever happens, happens.  And suddenly there was the question, and I think that if you're not there to shadowbox, if you're not there to hide, and the answer flows cleanly and freely, it's an easy answer.  And so because the first question allowed me to define myself, the second question allowed me to define my politics. This is what the first question, this is what I believe in.  The second question is I am an advocate of building the coalition.  I'm a black man, that's obvious, I don't have to protest that.  When I walk into a room, my presence is a protest.  Remember, this is the late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s], so when I walked into the room, there was a black man in the room.  And as a result of my experience growing up as a black person in a racist society, that has often been oppressive and discriminatory to many of us, that responsibility to speak, strongly and powerfully and courageously, that's unquestioned.  I'm a black man, I'm going to do that, understand, all right?  Now, because I'm a member of a community that has been affected, that has been harmed, that has been victimized, that has been oppressed, that allows me to be sensitive to forms of oppression, so Latino community, I will speak to that, Asian American community, Native American community, women, gays, left-wing, environmentalists, people who are perceived as outside the mainstream.  We were perceived as outside.  We have been victimized by the process that attempted to deny us voice and opportunity.  So I will speak to those issues as well.  So now I'm not only said to the black community, "Have no fear."  I'm a black man, I would not compromise that, speak to that. That's where I am.  I learned that from my folks, my parents, my people.  And to the community of color and other people who are victimized, I understand oppression. And what I don't understand educate me because I'm there to do that.  So then, now the coalition has broadened.  What about the rest of the community outside of those folks?  I said, "Well, simultaneously, I am a human being. I'm a human being.  Black doesn't deny my total humanity. I'm not one-dimensional.  I don't get up in the morning, and I'm black.  I'm a human being."  As my mother said in that story, "You are hundreds of adjectives. Two of that you are black and of African descent.  Be proud of that. But you are a total human being."  So I'm a human being.  So for those of you who are interested in ecological issues, human beings have to breathe clean air and drink clean water and be concerned about the fragile nature of our ecological system.  Human beings are consumers.  I speak to the issues of consumerism.  Human beings are concerned about budget and tax policy and this policy and that policy.  In short, what is a black issue?  Ron Dellums's answer is any issue that affects a human being is a black issue.  Any definition more narrow than that circumscribes and limits my personhood and my humanity.  I am as concerned about war.  I am as concerned about environment. If you want to limit me to two or three issues that you decide are black issues so that I can't talk across the board.  So what happens was the black community heard.  People of color heard.  Other victims of oppression heard.  Other citizens, white citizens in the [San Francisco] Bay Area [California] said, "Hey, this guy, he's there."  Because I was running as a human being who was not denying all of the characteristics. That was a plus for me.  That was a sensitivity for me.  But at the same time, I'm a human being.  So this was not black versus white. This is a set of human issues. Now black folks, you know, we're in bad shape. There are a lot of issues that most profoundly manifest themselves in the black condition.  So I have a responsibility to speak to those issues.  They are profound in other parts of the community of color and other people who are victims. Half of society being treated as second-class citizens, women.  Now, if there's anybody understands being treated something other than a first-class citizen black person, so why would I not be sensitive to the pain of women?  So I didn't want to get into the position of is racism or sexism more significant.  See, once you start babbling over, once you start fighting over which 'ism' is more powerful, that's unnecessary energy.  The important thing is, let's come together to eradicate all of the 'isms' that affect human beings in an adverse way.  That thinking and that coalition was what put me in office.
Story_ID: 6512
Speaker 1: Now, talk about the Congress that you came to in January of 1971?  What was that [U.S.] Congress like, and who was president?  Just the structure, because remember you said, "We were trying to take it in."
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  Now when I got to Washington [D.C.], I didn't really realize how far the [San Francisco] Bay Area [California] was from Washington in many ways. Not only was it twenty-five hundred miles away, it was probably twenty years away.  The Bay Area was standing on the street corner that eventually the world had to come by kicking and screaming.  The problem was that the Bay Area got there early, okay?  So the Bay Area sends a peace activist, a radical, a feminist, an environmentalist, talking about ecology.  People, "And what is a black man who's a feminist? Does that mean he's gay?  What is ecology?  Peace advocate, does that mean he's a peacenik.  Does that mean he's a pacifist?  What are all these things?" So I'm coming, they're not quite knowing who I am. The first day that I walked in the Democratic Caucus, I remember I walked in the door very self-consciously. Now I'm twenty years away from home and twenty-five hundred miles away from home.  I'm now in a whole new environment. I walk in the door absolutely self-conscious. What am I going to do? Democratic caucus, I've been elected, now what do I do? And there were a group of Democrats to my right, and I heard one of them say, "Where is that radical S. O. B.?"  And somebody kind of looked out of the corner of the eye and said, I could hear them say, "He's right behind you, to your left."  And then I'm thinking to myself, "Oh, my God. If that's how the Democrats see me, how are the Republicans going to see me." Remember, I'm being sworn in January, 1971.  America's involved in the Vietnam War.  We're caught up in the national security state. There's a heightened sense of paranoia, in America, in the national security state. Richard Nixon was President, Spiro Agnew is Vice President.  You've got student movements, radical movements going on.  You've got picture-taking at rallies, you've got dossiers, you've got wire taps, because eventually, the [U.S.] House [of Representatives] and the  [U.S.] Senate investigated intelligence abuses of that period of time and we came to learn, in retrospect, that what people thought was paranoid wasn't really paranoia.  There were mail openings. There were wiretaps. There was surveillance. There were, you know, counter-insurgency kind of people. There were all of those, you know, we used to call them agent provocateurs.  Well, we came to find out that those things were real, in retrospect.  So I came against that backdrop. The view was that Berkeley [California] was the radical citadel of the West, probably perceived as the Commie pinko [epithet for Communist-leaning radicals] center of America, and that Berkeley was considered 'Beserkeley'.  Therefore, their representative, by definition, had to be a commie-pinko radical, anti-American, because that was their view.  And if Berkeley was 'Beserkeley', then Ron Dellums had to be flakey and iffy, not a former psychiatric social worker, not any of that. No, I had to be a weirdo, Commie pinko, un-American guy.  So that was the mantle.  Now the night that I won, the quote that went around the country, newspapers and magazines 'Afro-top, Bell-bottom, Radical Black Man from Berkeley [California] Wins Election.'  So in the mind's eye of my colleagues, in the context of the national security state, heightened tension, heightened paranoia around security issues, heightened paranoia around Vietnam War, heightened tension around the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Panthers [black militant organization], you know, all the different student movements, etcetera, Kent State [University, Kent, Ohio, where the U.S. National Guard shot student protesters in May 1970].  All of these things were happening, that's the environment that I walked into carrying the mantle of the 'Afro-top, Bell-bottomed Radical Black Man from Berkeley Wins Election.'  All right. So here's automatically a guy who is suspect.  Here's a guy who's suspect. So that's the environment that I walked into. If you go back and look, Richard Nixon's top ten enemy list, if you get the book of lists, Richard Nixon's enemy list of the '70s [1970s], Ron Dellums is number six on Richard Nixon's top ten enemies.  Now this was crazy.  All right, now I am number six on the President of the United States enemy list as an enemy to the United States.  Now how incredibly extreme and bizarre that is.  It's just crazy.  Mort Halperin [Executive Director, Open Society Policy Center], who in a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act, for example, later got papers that had Ron Dellums and [U.S. Congresswoman] Bella Abzug of New York on the same par with the Soviet Union and China as dangerous to the United States.  Now, how incredibly overstated and bizarre and extreme.  But that's the environment that we were in, that kind of overstatement, that kind of crazy, way-out-of-the-box security environment that I was in.  So it was lonely, it was painful. It was extremely difficult. Sometimes my colleagues in voting down measures that I put on the floor as a young guy coming in on foreign affairs the first couple of years, if I offered an amendment, they would shout it down so loudly that the rafters would almost shake.  Like all opposed, "No!" to humiliate me, just to humiliate.  Or, when I would take the well of the [U.S.] House [of Representatives], the noise level would consciously go up as people would start to talk loud to drown me out, to make me start screaming at the top of my voice, just to try to be heard.  At first, they would want to hear me just as a curiosity, the first couple of speeches. Then after that it was how to drown the guy out, finally to the point where one time I turned my back on the House, and I turned to the Chair, and I said, "Mr. Chair, the House is not in order, and I make a point of order that the House is not in order."  "Gentleman is correct. House is not in order." He'd tap and they'd quiet for a second, then I turned around to speak and the noise level went back up, and I turned back to him, and I continued to press my point of order that the House was not in order.  And "The gentleman is entitled to be heard. House would come to order," and I kept my back turned.  I said, "This is it. I'm planting my feet here. This is the moment. No more of this B. S."  I was sworn in the same way they were.  To harm me is to diminish my constituency, I represent a half a million people here.  This is not personal.  Okay?  My half a million people's voice have the right to be heard as I respect other people's right to be heard.  So they saw a drama unfolding because I refused to turn around. They said, "Gentleman, you may proceed."  I never turned around. I kept looking at him.  I'm looking at him, like, "No, you're going to quiet this joint down, period."  Then at a certain point you could only hear a pin drop, and then I turned around and I said, "I thank the gentleman."  And then I said to them, "I sit here each day in profound respect of the process, to give you the opportunity to speak and to pay you the greatest compliment that anyone could play the adversary to you. I give you my undivided attention. I deserve nothing less than to be heard here."  And from that point on, they never drowned me out again. Then from that point, I realized that to be heard, I had to be substantiative.

Speaker 1: All right. My name is Larry Crowe, I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers; our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please give us your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My name is Ronald V. Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums], R-O-N-A-L-D, V as in Victor, Dellums, D-E-double L-U-M-S.
Speaker 1: The V stand stands for?
Speaker 2: Verney.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right (laughter).
Speaker 2: You're one of few people that know that.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, all right, okay.  Just want to make sure that somebody in the future doesn't think it's Victor (laughing) there'll be a book you know, Ronald Victor Dellums.
Speaker 2: I hear you (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: No, that makes sense.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: November 24, 1935, Oakland, California.
Speaker 1: And sir, what is your title, I mean occupation and title?  I guess you gotta kind of--
Speaker 2: Well, I served for nearly twenty-eight years in the U.S. House of Representatives, so people call me Representative Dellums.  I chaired the District of Columbia committee [U.S. House Committee on the District of Columbia; U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform] and ultimately I chaired the committee on the House armed services committee [U.S. House Committee on Armed Services], so people call me Mr. Chairman.  From 2007 to 2011 I was the mayor of Oakland, so people call me Mayor Dellums, so I'm not quite sure what the label is.  So some people say the Honorable Congressman Dellums, Mayor Dellums, Mr. Chairman, any of those words.
Speaker 1: So you got a long career in politics.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The interesting thing is that it wasn't something that I had planned to do or wanted to do, I had any particular ambition.  My graduate degree is in clinical social work, I jokingly tell people I wanted to be the black Sigmund Freud of America.  Bring mental health to the hood and, but I was a guy in the '60s [1960s] and it was responding to the call to service.  And I got up one morning and I had spent thirty-five years in elected office and it wasn't ever something that I particularly sought.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Today you are retired from politics but you work for a consultant group right here?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Right now, I'm a consultant with Watt Partners [JC Watts Companies], I'm a senior advisor to the American Beverage Association and I do various other sundry things.  So far, I've in my new life after mayor I've not done any lobbying work to date, any advocacy work in that regard.  All of my work has been primarily at advising and consulting.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. All right.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: Today's date?
Speaker 2: What is it February the 15th?  February 15, nine- (laughing) 2013.
Speaker 1: All right and where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're at 300 New Jersey [Avenue NW] in the suite of offices occupied by the Watt Partners and Bill Gray [HistoryMaker William H. Gray, III] consultant firm [Gray Global Advisors LLC].  Bill Gray was one of my colleagues in the House of Representatives.
Story_ID: 672725
Speaker 1: Now we are finishing an interview we started in 2003, that's ten years ago.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: And, and before we get started with the chronological narrative, there's a story that our director, Julieanna Richardson, wanted you to tell about high school, right.  High school graduation some of the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well as I said, I was born and grew up in West Oakland, California [Oakland, California] and the high school that I was to attend was McClymonds High School [Oakland, California].  And Bill Russell who played for the Boston Celtics, Frank Robinson who played baseball, you know went to McClymonds High School.  So I started McClymonds High School in the tenth grade and I came home from school the first day with my classes.  And my parents [Willa Terry Dellums and Verney Dellums] had always said, "You're going to college, education is important, it's an important way to advance yourself, you're going to college."  So college was part of the family narrative and it was almost abstract, right?  So anyway I get home and my mother says, "Let me see your classes." She was expecting college preparation courses in English and math and et cetera.  And I had a schedule full of shop programs; my mother said, "Wait a minute, what is this?"  Auto shop, wood shop, you know, "What?"  And I said, "Well that's what the counselor gave me," and she said, "I said--we said you're going to college, what about your college education?"  And I said, "Well the teacher said I should prepare myself to go to work, not worry about college," my mother said, "Later for that."  She gets on the phone; calls my uncle, C.L. Dellums, who along with A. Philip Randolph organized the first black trade union in the history of America when they organized the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.   Well he was living across town in North Oakland [Oakland, California] which was in the area of Oakland Tech High School [Oakland Technical High School, Oakland, California].  So he said--my mother said, "You don't know it, but Ronnie's going to use your address and we're transferring to Oakland Tech."  So I transferred to Oakland Tech and I get all of the necessary college prep courses and I'm riding all the way from West Oakland to North Oakland every day to go to school, but my mother's pleased, I am now enrolled in college preparatory work.  Along the way, in the tenth grade, many of my teachers, 'cause I'm going across town to a predominately white middle class high school, and my teachers discovered a young African American kid, Ron Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] who they thought could do college work.  So they started writing on my report card to my mother, encourage your son to go to college, he's capable of doing this kind of work et cetera.  And apparently the teachers got together one day and they all realized that they were interested in this young guy so they got me together with the principal and said, "We think this young kid," this is in the '50s [1950s], "is capable of going to college and we want to encourage him.  Can--are there any scholarships?" Now this is how long this was ago.  The principal found the scholarship, Negro male academic scholarship to the University California at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] for several thousand dollars.  And they said, "We want to put him in for this scholarship," I get home and lay out this message to my mom that I have a scholarship.  All I've gotta do is doing what I'm doing, keep my grades where they are and when I graduate, I'm going to Cal Berkeley with a scholarship.  My mother is super proud, you know we're living in the hood and here is--my son's going to go to college, University California at Berkeley.
Story_ID: 672726
Speaker 1: Well, in the spring of the tenth grade [at Oakland Technical High School, Oakland, California], now I wanted to be a baseball player.  I wanted to be--I came along, you know, Jackie Robinson, I wanted to be a baseball player in the worst way.  Everybody said, "No problem, when you go off for the high school baseball team, you probably gonna make varsity in the first year, no problem, minimally, you'll make junior varsity."  So the day comes when the list is gonna be posted in the gym as to who made the team, I ran to the gym after school, and I looked for my name and it wasn't there.  Brokenhearted, I remember I went to the bleachers whey they played, you know, football field and I sat there until late at night, I just cried for hours, it was like my life was over.  Baseball was what I wanted to do; academics just came along with that.  Well, to make a long story short, that was how I di- that's how I defined myself as a student who was a baseball player, who wanted to be a professional athlete.  When I didn't make the team, my life fell apart. I lost interest in school, because being in school meant that I could play baseball.  So I started running the streets, I started cutting classes, I started doing a lot of different things. Well, my mother [Willa Terry Dellums] and father [Verney Dellums] had separated and it dawns on me that the school had never seen my father's signature, only my mother's.  So I got a friend to literally steal some blank report cards from the principal's office. So for the remainder of the time over two years, I had two sets of report cards.  One set of report cards where I was really not doing well because my life sort of spiraled out of control and things went down.  Not that I couldn't do the work but I wasn't doing the work.  So I wanted to be, you know, one of the cool guys, I wanted to be one of the thugs.  And my grades started to reflect that, but my mother only saw great grades. B pluses, A minuses, A's, the same work that I had been doing.  Well, the day of reckoning comes when graduation comes, my mother gets all dressed up, comes across town to witness this graduation.  My mother, father there, my sister's [Theresa Dellums Simmons] there, my mother can't wait for this great announcement, "Ronald V. Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums], recipient of multi thousand dollar scholarship to University California at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California]."  Well, that night, not only did I know I wasn't gonna get the scholarship, but when I walked across the stage for them to hand me my diploma, the way the light hit it, was almost as--it looked as if there were no diploma.  I said, "Oh, my god, not only am I not going to get this scholarship but I'm not gonna graduate.  This is gonna literally break my mother's heart."  And I remembered I ran downstairs to the locker room and I was praying, "Please dear Lord let me graduate," well I did graduate.  So we go out to dinner, my mother looks at me; she says, "What happened, what about the scholarship?"  And I had to look at--look into my mother's eyes tearfully and I said, "Mom tonight I have to grow up and be a man and accept responsibility, for over two years, I've been lying to you.  And I wasn't lying to you because I wanted to hurt you, just the opposite, I didn't want you to know that my life was falling apart and I was doing very badly in school."  My mother--I could see the incredible pain, my son's gon' end up in San Quentin [San Quentin State Prison, San Quentin, California], you know, this is the worst case.  And I said, "Mom, I promise you, I promise you that I will make something of myself."  She didn't quite believe me but I made this promise.
Story_ID: 672727
Speaker 1: Eventually I realized that I needed to get off the streets; I joined the Marine Corps, I spent two years in the United State Marine Corps.  When I left the Marine Corps, I had the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944], when got out, I enrolled in Oakland City College [Laney College, Oakland, California] for two years and I received a A.A. degree in English and social sciences.  The next two years, I enrolled at San Francisco State University [San Francisco, California] and I received a bachelor's degree in social work and psychology.  And in my senior year, one of my professors said, "Have you ever considered going to graduate school?"  And I was so busy wanting to make sure that I kept my promise to my mom [Willa Terry Dellums], I never thought about graduate school.  He said, "You could do that work. Why don't you apply? I will write a recommendation."  I applied and, sure enough I was accepted, so for the next two years I went to University California at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] and I received a master's degree in clinical social work.  And that was in June of 1962, the spring of 1967, I was elected to the Berkeley City Council, in November of 1970, I was elected to the United States Congress.  In June of 2006, I was elected mayor of Oakland, California, my mother passed away, just before President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] was elected, but she saw me into that.  And I remember one time she called me up and she said, "Remember when I told you the day you announced that you had joined the Marine Corps that I thought that was the worst decision you ever made, and that that meant that you'd never were gonna go to college?"  I said, "Yeah mom," she said, "I just called you to tell you I was wrong, you were right, that was best decision you ever made.  I'm proud of you and I just walked past the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building in Oakland and the buttons popped off my chest.  'Cause that building is named after my son," so I was able to keep my word with my mother.  And I told the young students that story because I was--I told them that the take away from that story is never give up on yourself, never ever give up.  And know that the journey of life sometimes is not the journey you planned, but be available, stay in love with learning and go after it with as much passion and caring as you can and transmit that caring to the people that love you and who you love.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well that's a different story that we don't often hear that kind of story.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I made all the mistakes, and you know I made all the mistakes that a young guy could make.  In some kind of way you know I keep--when I look back on my life, I keep thinking that the strength of my--the strength of my family you know, my  mother, my grandmother [Dellum's maternal grandmother, Estelle Poole Terry], my father [Verney Dellums], my sister [Theresa Dellums Simmons] and the caring that allowed me to not totally fall apart.  But some kind of way I kept some semblance of the need to regain my own balance and redefine myself not as a baseball player, but as a human being who had another contribution to make.  So I tell young people that 'cause often times they see you on one end of your life and think life was a silver spoon, but for me, it wasn't, it was a, it was a tremendous struggle.  But I was able to overcome it.

Speaker 1: The people we've interviewed from the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California] often mention McClymonds [McClymonds High School, Oakland, California] and it's a powerhouse, athletic teams and all the great--Bill Russell, Frank Robinson, Vada Pinson, and a bunch of them.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Coming out of McClymonds so the pressure to be involved in that, you know, I guess, we can, you know.  For those who don't know the atmosphere, you know.   Were you in class with any of these?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I was only there for a relatively short period of time, and but Frank Robinson and I graduated from junior high school [Westlake Junior High School; Westlake Middle School, Oakland, California] together and in fact if you--the yearbook the prediction was that Frank Robinson and Ron Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] would play--would be in Brooklyn Dodger [Brooklyn Dodgers; Los Angeles Dodgers], New York Yankee [New York Yankees] uniform by the year whatever.  And so the anticipation was that we both would play baseball.  But after my mother [Willa Terry Dellums] saw those cards, right away, she took me right out of McClymonds.  And I kept thinking if I had stayed at McClymonds, I think I would've made the baseball team, I went across town and they had only had one black baseball player in the history of that particular high school and I didn't make the second.
Speaker 1: So the Oakland Tech [Oakland Technical High School, Oakland, California] team was an all-white team?
Speaker 2: Pretty much, yes, sir, over the years.
Story_ID: 672729
Speaker 1: We left off in 1970, when you were elected to the United States House of Representatives.  Represent- now what congressional district is that in Oakland [California]?
Speaker 2: Well, then it was the 7th Congressional District, I don't know the numbers now, but it included Oakland, Berkeley [California] and some suburban areas.  The first time that I ran, it was all urban, primarily Oakland, Berkeley area before the redistrict with the new census tracts.  But the history of that was that I ran against a Democrat who was an incumbent twelve years in the U.S. House of Representatives.  He was a Fulbright fellow [Fulbright Fellowship], labor union background and we ran--I ran against him in the Democratic primary, 1970 in a district that was 71 percent white, 29 percent total non-white, that 18 percent African American.
Speaker 1: Now this is Joseph Cohelan?
Speaker 2: Jeff Cohelan [Jeffery Cohelan].
Speaker 1: Jeff Cohelan.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Jeff Cohelan.
Speaker 2: And so I tell young people that the interesting this was that in 1970 that district that was 71 percent white, sent a tall skinny black guy to Washington [D.C] to be the U.S. representative in the House of Representatives and thirty-eight years later, that same--this country sent a tall skinny African American [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] from Chicago [Illinois] to be the president of the United States.  My point is that that district in California was thirty something years ahead of its time.  It was able to get beyond race, it dealt with whatever they perceived to be my political acumen, values, principals, stance on issues, so it was an effort to rise above simply viewing me as an African American running against a white guy in a white district.  And I remember one of the press people when the announce- when we announced that we were running, the very first question was, "Why do you think, you, as a young black man can beat this white guy in a 71 percent white district?"  That literally was the question.  And my response was, "Sir, your question assumes that there's a monolith known as the white community, that's a concept that I reject.  When I look out there, I see peace advocates, trade unionists, senior citizens, students, consumers, et cetera.  And if I speak to those issues, and speak to them powerfully enough that it embraces their self interest, I think that I will get their votes.  So you look out there and see a monolith known as the white community, and I see white folks who are peace advocates and white folks who are many, many other things."  People don't get up in the morning and leave their homes one dimensional, people leave their homes as human beings who are very complex.  As my mother [Willa Terry Dellums] said to me when I was a young guy, "You're a thousand adjectives."
Speaker 1: So this is--this is a precedent almost and to be sure, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It was the first time in American history, the first time in American History that an Africa American won in a predominately white congressional district, that was history.
Speaker 1: That's right, and later Harold Washington would do it in Chicago [Illinois]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and others would follow, but it's--was a very first time and the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California] that time was one of the, I guess the most liberal part of the country.  At least it was seen--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, absolutely and, and it was an effort to build coalition around ideas, all right?  So in terms of speaking to the Latino community and the Asian community, the Native American community, the women community, the gay community, what I said was that you know I was born into a racist society as a young black person.  So I understand oppression and I understand that oppression goes beyond the black community.  So that if you elect me I will go to [U.S.] Congress to fight against all forms of oppression, all forms of discrimination. All right, so that that allowed me to speak to people beyond the black community.  When I went into the white community, you know I said you know that we're human beings and they're issues that we need to deal with.  War and peace, education policy, health policy, et cetera, et cetera, environmental policy.  So we started to talk about these issues. That allowed me to build a multi-racial, multi-issue coalition and win.
Story_ID: 672730
Speaker 1: Let me go back a little bit to the how you were kind of drafted to do this 'cause you said you weren't really, so much interested in a career in politics.  But you're on the city council--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at this point and what were the issues that I guess caused people to urge you to run?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Remember now this is, the elections take place in 1970 against the backdrop of a very tumultuous era.  The period of the '60s [1960s] the Civil Rights Movement, the peace movement or slash anti-war movement and we could talk about that difference.  The women's liberation, gay liberation, the environmental movement, all these issues were percolating at the same time.  And I maintained that the Oakland [California], Berkeley [California] area, perhaps unlike any other place in the country where it--say in the south it was primarily the Civil Rights Movement in some other areas it was primarily the anti-war movement or the peace movement or whatever, in the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California], all of the issues of the '60s [1960s] emerged in great--with great simultaneity close proximity. Every one of those issues emerged in that area, unlike perhaps any other area in the entire country, all right?  And because I had--was on the Berkeley City Council, during the late '60s [1960s], the People Park [sic. People's Park, Berkeley, California], and you know all these incredible issues at the time.  I think people saw in this young African American guy who they had drafted and elected to the Berkeley City Council was the person they thought who ought to run for [U.S.] Congress.  So they came to me, people from the Civil Rights Movement, people from the peace movement, young students, et cetera and they said, "We need you to run for Congress."  Well, I didn't want to be a city councilman, as I said, I wanted to be the black Sigmund Freud, I wanted to bring mental health to the hood.  And so I'm just trying to finish out my four years on the Berkeley City Council and I wanted to get back--oh, along the way, I had an opportunity for thirty-three thousand dollars scholarship to Brandeis University [Waltham, Massachusetts] to work on a Ph.D.  And coming from West Oakland, California [Oakland, California], at this point in my life to go to an Ivy League college to get a Ph.D., was like going to Mars, it was beyond my comprehension.  But I was totally excited by it because you know, I was turned on to learning and that once I knew--understood that I could learn at that level, that was a very exciting prospect.  Well, apparently they figured out that I didn't know how to say no to the community.  "We need you to run for Congress," and I said, you know, "I'd like to get on with my life and get back and go back to school."  They said, "No, we need you now."  And I said, "Well, I have to run on my own terms, I'll take council, but at the end of the day, what I say have to be what I believe, what I stand for." And they said, "Fine." I said, "I'm not gon' be owned by anybody and I'm not gon' be maneuvered by money," they said, "Fine."  I said, "And if I lose, I want you to detail this campaign and figure out what we did wrong and the next person correct that and run and win," they said, "Fine."  I won the election and I ended up staying in Washington [D.C.] for nearly twenty-eight years.
Story_ID: 672731
Speaker 1: Now one, one of the aspects of your political life that stigmatized you was membership in the Socialist Party [Socialist Party of America].  What--can you talk about that and what the ramification--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You know actually I wasn't a member of the Socialist Party, you know I was a Democrat and in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, there was an organization, I don't recall the exact name of the organization--socialist alliance [ph.] or something.  Anyway, this was an organization that allowed me to communicate with other progressive people in this country, but also in other countries, like social democrats in Europe, and other places in Latin America.  And I decided to do that to be able to communicate with people at that level, you know on a global basis.  But also I think in one way, when I look back on that moment, I was also trying to make sure that I wasn't making myself comfortable in the role of a member of [U.S.] Congress and playing it very safe.  So I think in one sense, I put myself on the edge so that I could continue to take risks, to stay in touch with why I went to Congress.  And to not to get so comfortable, that I started playing it safe.  So for all those reasons, I--I identified with that organization, but I never joined the Socialist Party, no I was just aligned.
Story_ID: 672732
Speaker 1: Your major opponent was another Democrat in the primary, right, which was, is that true then? Yeah, Cohelan [Jeffery Cohelan] was a Democrat so the Democratic primary was the (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause I ran in the Democratic primary--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --major election.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause there some people that wanted me to run as an independent, you know sort of Berkeley si- and they're, Ron [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums], no, you're a Democrat, you're gonna run as a Democrat. And that made sense.
Speaker 1: So that the district at that time was so heavily Democratic, like Chicago [Illinois] is now and Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] or some other cities, where if you went--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well if the question is could a Republican win in that district, I doubt it.  Yeah, I mean I think that's safe to say, yes.  So it was a Democratic primary and as I said, the mold that we broke was that here's this young African American.  So it's interesting I remember, well I don't know if I told his story, but when I beat Cohelan in the primary, and nobody thought that I could for the reasons that I already enunciated.  And it was predominately a racial analysis and my point to them was, no, I think we're gonna put together a coalition and at the end of the day, we gonna beat his guy 55-45.  Well, it turns out that we beat him 55-45.  Well, shortly after the primary, I get this phone call one night they said, "Ron, you're not gonna believe this, you been attacked by the vice president of the United States, Spiro Agnew."  I mean it's the middle of the night and I was campaigning like eighteen hours a day.  And I said, "Look, I'm asleep, you know stop joking, the vice president--how in the--the vice president of the United States doesn't even know who I am," okay.  And they said, "No, it's true." And apparently at a fundraiser in Little Rock, Arkansas, the vice president of the United States, Spiro Agnew, walked up to the microphone and he said, "There's a young black man on his way to Washington [D.C.] from Berkeley, California that I consider the most dangerous radical to be elected to [U.S.] Congress since Vito Marcantonio of the 1920s [sic.]."  I mean, you know like incredible statement, right?  And I said, "You gotta be kidding," and they, said, "No."  This when Spiro Agnew was attacking like Senator Kennedy [Edward M. Kennedy] and others as rad libs, but he didn't use that term.  He said dangerous radical, great point of departure.  So I said, "Well, okay, call a press conference tomorrow morning, ten o'clock, I'll be there."  So, I'm standing across the street, getting ready to walk cross--waiting for the light to change and my campaign office was right on the corner and it was press from all over the world.  And you know growing up in Oakland [California], Berkeley, we've seen a lot of press, but this was different.  There was press everywhere, and my heart's beating, and I'm nerve--I'm scared to death.  I went oh, my god, attacked by the vice president.  Out of the corner of eye, I see a little--a elderly woman walking very slowly and I turned toward her and she said--she happened to be a white elderly woman--and she said, "Are you Ron Dellums?"  And I said, "Yes, ma'am," and she said, "I just walked ten blocks," and clearly they were slow and painful ten blocks, "to give you this."  And she pulled out a check for like five or ten dollars and she said, "I came to give you this check."  And this is a woman that walked ten blocks to give me this check, and I looked at her, and like tears came to my eyes and I just hugged her and I said, "Thank you, ma'am."  And she cried, I cried, I was like this incredible moment, and she turned for her slow ten walk back to her home, 'cause she said, "Anybody that Agnew attacks, I wanna support."  And I crossed the street into my future, having no idea what was waiting for me.
Story_ID: 672733
Speaker 1: I walked in the campaign office; my campaign manager said, "Here's the statement," and I said, "What statement?"  He said, "Man we've been up all night writing this statement for you to read, you've been attacked by the vice president, this is big league stuff."  And I said, "I don't even know everything the vice president said, why should I read this statement?"  I said, "I'm sorry you guys stayed up all night, but I'm not reading any statement." (Gasps) He said, "What?"  I said, "No, I'm not gonna read any statement, I'm open for any questions."  And he said, "Man you gonna be--you just gonna wing it?"  I said, "Yeah."  And he said, "Well at least read what the vice president said." So they had a stack of press, you know statements and I was so nervous, my hand was trembling.  And all the press was looking at me; they were from all over the world.  And I didn't want them to notice that my hand was trembling so I acted as if I was speed reading so I could move my hand.  And I--but I was so nervous, I didn't see one word, I don't you know, so I turned to the guy and I said, "I'm ready."  We sit down, microphone dripping off and they said, "Mr. Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] has no opening statement," well, that's counterintuitive, right?  The press go, wait a minute, no statement?  'Cause they came to see a young black guy dance on the winds of expediency.  Well, I'm not really a radical guy, I'm a Democrat, I'm this, I'm that, I'm here.  I said, "Have no opening statement," pregnant pause.  Finally somebody says, "Vice President Agnew [Spiro Agnew] charges that you're a radical, how do you respond to that charge?"  "I don't know what Vice President Agnew meant by radical but if what he meant by radical was that it was radical to oppose to insanity and the cruelty and violence of the Vietnam War, if it was radical to oppose the oppression of racism and sexism and other forms of chauvinism that visit pain upon my fellow human beings, if it's radical to want to eradicate poverty and hunger and disease and inadequate education in this country, then sir, I'm proud to be called a radical."  Praise, you know.  My staff and the community people they were cheering, the press were like whoa.  It came out they didn't know how to react to that.  "There any other questions?"  "Vice President Agnew charges that you advocate bringing the walls down in this country.  How do you respond to those charges?"  Now remember, I don't know what the questions are gonna be, so I'm just sitting there waiting, and my heart is beating you know like.  "If Vice President Agnew had taken the time out of his very busy schedule to understand my comments in context, what he would've learned was that I said we have built walls very high and very thick in this country, among the races, the classes the sexes, the generations and even the religions.  And if we bring down those walls that divide us, the walls of racism and classism and chauvinism and sexism, we will find that there millions people in our country leading very desperate lives.  And that if we bring those people together and mobilize them into a great coalition we could change America, change the world, so yes, sir I do advocate bringing the walls down.  The wall that divide us as human beings." That was the last question they asked.  They packed up and got out of my office, because they didn't anticipate the response.  And what I tell people was that the first question--never let anybody define who you are.  First question was the vice president tried to define me as the radical, as if there's some agreement upon what that word means.  And so I tell young people that my response to that first question was based on the idea, never let the other guy define who you are.  Always be in control of the definition of who you are.  And secondly, the second question was, you advocate bringing the walls down, was an opportunity to define what I stand for, what I stood for.  Define the nature of your values, your principals, your politics.
Story_ID: 672734
Speaker 1: What was it like going to Congress in 1970, I guess you started in '71 [1971] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: December, 1970, when we came to organize (laughter) it was funny.  I remember my family and I got back and I remembered the first night and, that we were in--I was to--the next morning, I was to go to the Democratic Caucus [U.S. House of Representatives Democratic Caucus] for the very first time, brand new.  But the night before, I went up on Capitol [U.S. Capitol, Washington, D.C.] steps, this is when it was open, before 9/11 [September 11, 2001] and whatever.  And I sat on the Capitol steps that night, December, 1970, and I'm thinking, wow, West Oakland [Oakland, California], Ronnie D [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] is in Washington, D.C. and is a member of the United States Congress.  This is stuff that I see on TV, now, I'm here, and this is a true story.  I said why am I here, why did my constituents send me here?  Was it to be an activist and change the venue of my activism, 'cause I was pretty doggone good activist in the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California] and I didn't have to leave my home, my family, my friends.  So did they ask me to come twenty-five hundred miles away to still carry my sign and still be an activist?  Or did they send me here to put my sign down and walk inside the building and take my seat at the table and assume the burden, the risk and the responsibility to try to govern. Okay?  And I decided it was the latter as opposed to the former.  So I decided that people sent me here not just to change the venue of my activism, but to try to change the world, to try to govern.  And I remember one day one of my colleagues (unclear) said, "You know when you came here," and I remembered the day that I walked into the Democratic Caucus for the first time.  I saw out of the corner of my eye a group of my colleagues, who I was to later learn were a group of my southern white colleagues, they said, "Have you seen that radical SOB yet?"  They, you know, and I said, "Oh, my god, if that's how the Democrats see me; (laughter) I wonder how the Republicans are gonna see me," right?  But any way, the same guys were to later come up to me and say, "You know when we heard that, you know, here's this young black radical from Berkeley [California], elected to the United States Congress, we thought you were gonna be the devil incarnate.  But you're really a nice guy," and I said, "Well I appreciate that."  I said, "Let me tell you something," they said, "You know you're willing to work with people."  And I said, "Look my friend, if there were 217 other people here from Berkeley, it would be my way or the highway, 'cause we'd have 218 votes, but that's not the case.  There not fifty-one members of the United States Senate from Berkeley, so it's not gonna be my way.  You don't have 218 votes, I don't have 218 votes, so I decided that I've gotta figure out sit down with you sir, from Mississippi and you from Alabama and you from Georgia, you from Louisiana, you from New York and you from Illinois.  And we've gotta figure out together how we're going to solve the problems of this country."
Speaker 1: Now did you have--
Speaker 2: That was my way--that was how I approached my job.
Story_ID: 672735
Speaker 1: Now did you have any--or who were your political mentors, I guess in terms of striking that kind of balance.  'Cause that's some wise stuff and not everybody gets it.  So who did you draw on for this kind of--and you may have discussed it in the other interview, I don't know, but--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  Well, not and that's a good question.  Two things: the person that truly inspired me politically, and gave me a philosophical framework to allow me to understand my responsibilities and to sharpen my advocacy was Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], without any question.  And my great lament in my life was that I never got a chance to meet this incredible man.  I never got a chance to tell him that whether he knew it or not, he reached out and touched me in way that changed my entire life.  And so he helped shape me. And I'll tell you a specific story. Martin Luther King had spoken at the Riverside Church in New York [New York] when he first articulated his opposition to the Vietnam War.  And it was an incredible speech, but when he walked away from the pulpit, he was attacked by blacks and whites.  Whites attacked him because they was essentially saying, you know you're a civil rights leader, now you starting--now you and start getting serious, you start talking about foreign policy and national security and war and peace.  You have no role in this--
Speaker 1: You're out of your lane, you know.
Speaker 2: You know, you're out of your lane, absolutely.  Conversely there were a number of black folks who said Martin Luther King; you're a civil rights leader, now you're talking about war and peace, you watering down our effort, okay?  Martin Luther King then began a tour around the country to answer his critics; one of his stops was Berkeley, California, University of California [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California].  I attended that speech in Sproul Hall plaza [Sproul Plaza, Berkeley, California], thousands and thousands maybe, twenty something thousand people were there.  And I was way in the rear of this gathering, and this eloquent brother said in answer to his attacks, "I cannot segregate my moral concerns."  Which I thought was awesome, okay?  And I never forgot that, the other thing that he said in that speech that caught me very powerfully was, "There are two kinds of leaders, one who waits until the consensus is formed and then runs quickly to the front to announce their leadership."  And he said, "But there's another kind of leader who dares to go out and try to mold a new consensus, I am from the latter."  And people cheered and my heart almost jumped out of my chest.  Here's this beautiful black man like me who had the--who inspired thousands of people with his eloquences and with his principals and his values.  That helped shape who I became as a, you know as an elected official.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: All right.
Story_ID: 672736
Speaker 1: Somebody willing to go out and mold the consensus, be willing to stand, you know.  But also be willing to respect other people, work with other people, you know, it's like, Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] said, "God don't talk to me alone."  So you know talk to every--lot of people so you have to sit down based on those ideas.  The other thing is I'm trained as a social worker and one of the things you learn as a social worker is the principal of non-judgmental, non-judgmentalism to learn how to not be judgmental.  Because as a therapist you're trying to help other people so you're not there to judge their behavior, you're there to help them cope, okay?  So I learned how to not be--not judge other people, to not attack other people, all right, and to figure out how to work with other people you know.  And Martin Luther King said something else that also helps shape and it goes to the question you asked.  One night I'm sitting by the radio and Martin Luther King--they were getting ready to play a speech.  And every time I would hear Martin Luther King--knew that Martin Luther King was gonna speak; I got out a notepad and a pencil just to take notes.  And I hear this voice saying the most radical act that our people can engage in is to assert the full measure of their citizenship.  I wrote that down, the most radical act that our people can engage in is to assert the full measure of their citizenship.  So after the speech, I went to the desk, I said what was he--what was he trying to say to me, what was he saying to us?  And the radical act is a act of to achieve great change, all right?  Audacity to step forward boldly, citizenship, if you look in the dictionary it outlines your rights and prerogatives, but it also lays out your duties and responsibilities as a citizen.  So I said what Martin Luther King is saying to me is if you seek significant change, then step forward boldly and assert your rights and prerogatives as a citizen.  I am a citizen and I have these rights, but also assume your responsibilities as a citizen.  Know the issues, learn, be involved, be engaged, be there, okay?  Those became very, very powerful things for me and--so Martin Luther King was very powerful in that.
Story_ID: 672737
Speaker 1: My family, my father [Verney Dellums], my father's brother, C.L. Dellums, as I said, worked with A. Philip Randolph, to organize the first black trade union in the history of America when they organized the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.  So as a kid I grew up hearing stories about unionism.  And when they would find out that these African Americans were organizing the union, you know, or these people worked on trains.  Sometimes they would throw them off the train in Montana or in Utah and say, "Walk home nigger."  And many or most of them or all of them never got back to Oakland [California], because they were coming across, all right?  So I heard about the stories what was involved in the politics of fighting for worker's rights and decent wages and stuff.  So I grew up in that kind of family, I grew up with--and so that helped shape my life.  My father he was one of the first guys to integrate the waterfront.  He was one of the first African Americans who became a longshoreman, at the time when that was an incredible job.  And my father cared about politics, and cared about ideas and he--I used to come home from school sometime with a history lesson, my father said, "That's not true, don't take everything that the teacher says for granted, go learn."  So my father taught me how to be critical and to not just totally accept without challenge, without thought, without expansion, you know ideas.  My mother [Willa Terry Dellums], who when I came home from school one day after a young guy had called me a dirty black African, and we got into a fist fight.  I get home and I couldn't wait to tell my mother, I'm in junior high school [Westlake Junior High School; Westlake Middle School, Oakland, California], and I told her that this guy called me a dirty black African and I fought him.  And I wanted her to be proud of me that I won the fight, thinking that she was gonna ask me well what do you want for dessert, you know.  You want me to bake you a pie, my mother said, "Wait a minute, let me go put my coat down and meet me in the living room."  So I'm thinking, oh, oh, maybe I did something wrong, my mother said, "Now explain to me again why did you fight this guy?"  And I said, "I told you mom, he called me a dirty black African."  My mother said, "I work, you go to school, so the decision you make to fight or not fight is your decision 'cause I can't be there.  But since you brought this to me, let me give you my thinking, if you had to fight this kid, you should've fought him only because he called you dirty, if that was enough to make you angry, but not because he called you black, because you're a member of the black race.  Not because he called you African, because you are of African descent.  And I want you as long as you live wherever you go in this world, when somebody calls you a black African, I want you to say, 'Yes, I am,' and be proud of that."  She said, "But I wanna tell you something else, you're a thousand adjectives.  You're Ronnie Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums], you're a student, you're an athlete, you're a son, you're a grandson, you're a brother, you're a cousin, you're generous, you're this, you're that, you're black, you're of African descent.  I want you to embrace the whole of who you are, but being black and being African are two very important aspects of your identity.  Never let anyone talk down to you about that, always deal with that with a great sense of pride."  So that was also important part that helped shape my politics.  Finally, going back to Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], and I actually quoted him on the floor of [U.S.] Congress.  I--when he said, "Peace is more than simply the absence of war; it's the presence of justice."  Well, when I heard him say that, that helped shaped my politics, because peace is more than simply the absence of war, it's the presence of justice, then the ultimate movement, the ultimate umbrella movement has to be the peace movement.  Because under that umbrella, you're fighting against racial injustice, economic injustice, gender injustice, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, okay?  So what I drew from that, was that in raising my voice in the name of peace, then I had to simultaneously raise my voice in the name of justice.  So then I was able to go on the floor of Congress and say to my colleagues, "Let me state that a different way, as chairman of the Armed Services Committee [U.S. House Committee on Armed Services].  Peace is more than simply the absence of war; it is the absence of conditions that give rise to war."

Speaker 1: I was sitting here, and I was think- I'm just thinking about the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California] in those days, and all of the minds that were there.  So you got like in the Bay Area and there are leaders on the national scene.  You got--in the black community only, you got Price Cobbs [HistoryMaker Dr. Price Cobbs], you got your uncle [C.L. Dellums], you got Asa Hilliard [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III], you got Nathan [HistoryMaker Nathan Hare] and Julia Hare [HistoryMaker Julia Reed Hare], Robert Allen [Robert L. Allen], Robert Chrisman, Oba T'Shaka you got the Panthers [Black Panther Party], [HistoryMaker] D'Army Bailey of city council [Berkeley City Council], challenging people.  I mean, it's a whole, it's so many minds there and I just--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It was incredible.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, I understand the point that you're making and going back to my earlier point, that I maintain rightly or wrongly that the Bay Area because all of the movements of the '60s [1960s], the nationalist movement, everything, Panther movement, Gray Panthers, Black Panthers, Brown Berets, you know all were there.  Unlike any other part of the country, we--we heard each other's analysis, we felt each other's pain, we sang each other's songs, we went to each other's rallies, we learned from each other.  So we were able to talk across all these lines and remember these were the '60s [1960s] when we actually used to sit down and have serious conversations, come the revolution.  We talked about these things.
Speaker 1: So the--I heard about discussions where people would sit and talk all night about these things (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Absolutely, and the people that you mentioned, so we all knew each other, so there was no hierarchy, okay?  Now, I'm this young--you know I like to think I'm a sponge, or least I hope I am.  But I was taking--I was hearing from everybody, listening to you know, learning from, from people.  Because one thing I learned early on was listening how you learned.  And here's all these very bright people and I wanted to--I wanted get the best from them, try to figure how to not make whatever mistakes some of them might've made you know.  You know I remember when I met with Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton] and Bobby Seale and the Black Panthers, we talked way into the night, you know.  But I felt that Martin Luther King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] way of nonviolence, his way of embracing peace was the right way to go.  And I felt that to pick up the arms was to violate that principal, so when I look back on my life, I'm very happy that I made that decision to follow that path, okay?
Story_ID: 672739
Speaker 1: Tell me about your staff. What kind of staff did you have when you went to Washington, D.C. and was it what you wanted?  Or was it compromise, or--and who did you depend on?
Speaker 2: Well, you know first was you know to put together you know my, my, my local staff, okay?  And there was a young guy, Don Hopkins [Donald R. Hopkins], brilliant guy. You mentioned bright minds, Don Hopkins was one of the--was one of the incredible minds.  Incredibly bright guy and my scent of him was that he was a person of not only great intellect but great integrity.  And one night, I just said, "Don Hopkins, that's the guy that I need."  And I went to Don Hopkins and I said, "I need you to be my top staff guy in the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California], okay?  Be my chief of staff," and he agreed to do it, and I was thrilled.
Speaker 1: Now what was he doing at the time, I'm sorry, what was he doing?
Speaker 2: I think at one point Don was the dean of admissions at University of California, Berkeley [Berkeley, California], you know and he was writing articles and some of the periodicals that you had mentioned doing.  So you know Don--and he was you know, we were kind of the Young Turks in our community and Don Hopkins was one of the Young Turks.  We're the guys that not only went out there to express ourselves, but you know we talked among ourselves until we grew with each other.  Well when Don Hopkins came on, he was like the--my core guy, and I remember one day I looked up in my campaign office, my very first campaign and this young guy from the community college walks in the door with a huge gang of students that he had mobilized on the campus and brought to the campaign office to volunteer.  And he became literally a part of my life, and he started out driving me around and then I noticed that when I'd get back in the car he would give me feedback.  He would say, "You know when you said so and so," and I said wow, this guy is listening.  And so he grew to become also a very significant person on my staff.  And when Don Hopkins eventually retired, he--I'm sorry, near the end, he was like the second in command in my office.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Wonderful guy. And I--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Who is he, what's his name?
Speaker 2: Sandre Swanson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do you spell that?  Sandre is that S-A like--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, D-R-(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Andre with a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: D-R-E with an apostrophe over the E--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay. D-R--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: S-A-N-D-R-E, Swanson, S-W-A-N-S-O-N.
Story_ID: 672740
Speaker 1: Then there was Lee Halterman [H. Lee Halterman], young attorney, brilliant guy; Ying Lee Kelley an Asian woman, progressive, fighter, sensitive.  Barbara Lee [HistoryMaker Barbara Lee] at one point was on my staff, who is now a member of Congress.  And I'm very proud to say that I had something to do with helping to train her and I had no idea that she would go into politics. Because I thought people worked around me realized how lonely that road really is, 'cause leadership is a lonely road.  But you know she's been a magnificent public servant.  Sandre Swanson became a state legislator, Keith Carson, who was a member of my staff became a member of the board of supervisors [Alameda County Board of Supervisors], Barbara Lee who is a member of my staff, became a member of the United States Congress.  You know so I had staff people that from the local all the way back up to the federal government were members of my staff.  And there was a guy who had been a member of Congress who ran for the United States Senate the same time I ran for Congress.  His name was George Brown [George Brown, Jr.], he ran against John Tunney [John V. Tunney] for Senate back in '70 [1970].  And George Brown sent me a note and he said, "Ron [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums], I want you to interview this guy Michael Duberstein," he said, "He's a radical guy but I think he's your kind of radical guy."  And so when I got back to Washington [D.C.] this very strange looking guy comes up to me with this handle bar mustache and he introduce himself as Michael Duberstein and I interviewed him and we entered into a multi-decade relationship.  He knew Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.] like the back of his hand, I'm a newcomer, didn't know my way from one room to the next.  He taught me all about Washington, all about Capitol Hill, all about the committee structure, where, where the skeletons were buried.  He was just an incredible guy; he taught me how to use the tools of the Congress to do my job, and he was an exceptional person.  Carlotta Scott, Bob Brower, Charles Stephenson [Charles Stephenson, Jr.], I actually had a coalition of staff people there in, you know.  When you get to be seventy-seven, you start forgetting some things.  But I had literally had a multi-racial coalition staff, and it was fascinating 'cause as a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, one of the things the black caucus raised was the racism of many of our colleagues who did not have African Americans on their staff, okay?  So I remember a group of white members of Congress decided they were going to go to the offices of the Congressional Black Caucus to see if they had any white folks hired.  So they could say reverse racism, right?  So they walked into my office two African American staff, white staff, Asian staff, Latino staff, Jewish staff, Christian staff, you know, gays, straight. They said, "Wow, the guy really is, that's his politics."   And I said, "Yeah, and that's my district, okay, and that's America."  It's so--they left my office, you know sort of red faced 'cause they had nothing to say, because that's how everybody's staff ought to be, a staff that embraces the diversity of the country.
Story_ID: 672741
Speaker 1: Now you told a story, I think the last time, I don't know if you wanna tell it again, but--about trying to get respect on the floor when you were first elected.  You were seen as a radical and people wouldn't--would talk when you would talk and they wouldn't listen to you, and that sort of thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know all of this, you know all of the, you know the clamor you know it's the hyperbole you know, 'cause Berkeley [California] you know sort of became you know, like you know, Moscow, Moscow West, you know, when that whole Joe McCarthy [Joseph McCarthy] kind of thing, so Berkeley took on that era.  So any--so Berkeley became Berzerkley. Berkeley became you know the left wing capital of America, et cetera, et cetera.  Therefore, I was the commie pinko, dangerous guy.  I used to get up to speak on the floor and the noise level on the floor of [U.S.] Congress would start to rise.  And I found myself; you know having to like speak almost yelling to be heard.  And one day I'm on the floor speaking and that volume went up, and it just hit me, why you doing this?  Why do I have to scream, so I remember I stopped, and I turned to the chair of the full committee, where the speaker sits, and I said, "Sir, the House [U.S. House of Representatives] is not in order and I make point of order that the House is not in order."  He gaveled, "The gentleman is correct, the House is not in order, the House will be in order."  Then they kind of--but I decided I wasn't and he just, and then he would say, "The gentleman may proceed," I didn't proceed, I just stood there in absolute silence.  For well over a minute, just nothing happened, so everybody then became very quiet because they're seeing this drama unfold, 'cause I kept my back to the--and I kept looking at the chairman when he said, "The gentleman my[KS1] proceed," I could still hear noise.
Speaker 1: This is the speaker of the house you looking at, is that who?
Speaker 2: Well, when we were--we were debating, and when you go into what they call the committee of the whole [U.S. House of Representatives Committee of the Whole] the speaker appoints a chair who literally then becomes the chairman of the committee of the whole which is like the speaker of the house, but a substitute, right, who governs the debate.  So I turned around and he was saying, "The gentleman may proceed," but I could still hear noise, so I refused to speak, I just kept looking at 'em.  And he looked at me, "The gentleman may proceed," I said, "The House is still not in order and I persist on my point of order." Finally the whole place got very quiet and then he looked at me and he said, "The gentleman may proceed," and I said, "Thank you, Mr. Chairman."  I turned back around and that was the last time I ever had to experience that.  And then you know once they stopped to hear what I was trying to say, then they said, "Huh, you know, guy's not talking crazy," you know.  So they began to listen, and then it became easier and easier for me to speak, and at a certain point, it got to the point where whenever I get up to speak, the House would get very quiet.  Then I could communicate with them 'cause I decided at that point that it wasn't Ron Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] that was being disrespected on the floor, it was five hundred and--thousand [500,000] people whose voice that was being--their right to be heard was being disrespected.  And as a member of Congress, it wasn't about me it was about my right to stand there as an equal member of a body of 435 people and to be heard.  And that I always felt that it, my most important responsibility to--was to respect my colleagues in the greatest way you could respect a person even your adversary is to give them your undivided attention.  And I felt that I had the right to expect that back from them.
Story_ID: 672742
Speaker 1: Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the two biggest issues, I guess that you're involved in, in the beginning of your congressional career were Vietnam War--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and the creation of the Congressional Black Caucus.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I'm thinking--and there's something else, you know, please add it but that--can you tell us about, I don't know which one you want to take first, but--
Speaker 2: Well, you know and I think we talked some about the Vietnam War.  Obviously you know, I come to [U.S.] Congress against the backdrop of the Vietnam War and that we clearly from the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California] had expressed ourselves very powerfully in that regard.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now Richard Nixon's [President Richard Milhous Nixon] the president?
Speaker 2: Richard Nixon, yeah, was president, et cetera, right, exactly and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: The Vietnam War had escalated, had been--the My Lai Massacre had been--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in the news, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.  Now, it's interesting, because I just recently the other day, I was watching television and a young journalist had just written a book called, it was a book on the Vietnam War and the war crimes in Vietnam, okay?  And I listened to the interview that he did for public television, but it was fascinating that what he didn't ever articulate, and I've not seen the book, 'Kill Everything Moving' ['Kill Everything That Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam,' Nick Turse] or something like that is the title of the book, okay, just came out.  What he prob- what may not know, what maybe his research never took him to, was that a young black guy held war crimes hearings on Vietnam on Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.] to the chagrin and to the anger of many people.  I decided--I went to the speaker, Carl Albert was the speaker at the time, and I said, "I want to--I want to use the caucus room in the Cannon Building [Cannon House Office Building, Washington, D.C.]," they granted me permission.  And from that room over several days I held war crimes hearings on Vietnam and took testimony from West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York] graduates, from helicopter pilots, from troops from My Lai to other places who talked about the incredible atrocities of the Vietnam War.  I remember the pain--I think John Conyers [HistoryMaker John Conyers, Jr.] may have been the one guy that came and joined me in those--in those hearings.  And so I was virtually alone in those hearings.
Speaker 1: So I mean, of all the congressmen--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --in Congress? Of 430 something congressman, only John Conyers?
Speaker 2: That's the one that I recall, now there may have been one or two other people, but this was you know, talking about war crimes in the early '70s [1970s] right?  And I remember some of my colleagues felt that you know I should've been drummed out of the Congress.
Story_ID: 672743
Speaker 1: Now you had, I read, I don't know if it's true, but you know you read so many things on this information.  But that you had a display of some of the atrocities.
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and in my office, as part of that and my reason for calling the hearings on war crimes in Vietnam was not to have a show, was not to be showy, it was not to engage in demagoguery.  My effort was to be educative, 'cause I think that one of the most, perhaps the most important role of public official is to be part of the educative process.  So I wanted to be part of educating my colleagues and the country to what was really going on in Vietnam in their names.  And whether that was cutting off people's ears so that you had a body count or whether that was going into a village and killing up people, or whatever that was, that it was important for people to see the entire, the totality of the Vietnam War.  And I felt that I had a responsibility to deal with that, and nervous sometimes, scared to death sometimes, but I felt that it was important to do.  And I remember some of the testimony was so powerful that it brought me to tears.  Sometime I would just have to pause and walk out and I remember there was one, one man who I'm sure it was a nightmare for him every night, 'cause I could tell in the testimony that he relived those moments every day.  All I could do was walk out of the room and just walk up to him and just hold him; I didn't know what to say.  But I could feel his pain and I felt that coming from the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California] and who I represented and what I came to advocate that, that was a responsibility that I had.  Whether I personally was nervous, whether I personally felt fear, I had to get beyond that.  That I had a role beyond myself to play and that as long as I kept trying to do what was right, that I could get beyond.  'Cause I you know I decided that there were two things over which I absolutely had control.  Rest of the stuff you don't have control over, but the two things over which every individual has control: your fidelity, your faithfulness to what you believe in and your willingness to show up every day for the fight.  Those two things you have control over your faithfulness and your willingness to show up.  So I had to stay faithful to why I came to Washington [D.C.] and I had to be willing to show up every day for the fight, even times when I was worried, fearful, questioning, but I had to show up every day 'cause if you don't show up, you certainly can't win.
Story_ID: 672744
Speaker 1: So and you know and eventually you know, we you know we eventually dealt with the Vietnam War. One of the important things, remember the war crimes.  I mean not the war crimes, but the War Powers Act [War Powers Resolution of 1973], okay?  The War Powers Act comes to the floor of [U.S.] Congress as a way of trying to end the Vietnam War. And the War Powers Act was a effort--it was supposed to be a great liberal victory at, where the War Powers Act was an effort to put some parameters on the power of the presidency and bring the Congress into a role.  And sort of generally speaking, I remember there was a mechanism by which the president could, could put troops into you know a country.  Based on the president's definition of national security or threat to the country, and after sixty days, the president had to justify that to Congress.  And then you know, then after sixty days, the Congress could then act to withdraw the troops or whatever.  The day comes when we're gonna vote on the War Powers Act as a major instrument to end the Vietnam War. I walked into the well of the House [U.S. House of Representatives] and I'm one of the progressive guys, and I said in effect, "I am constrained to rise an opposition to this legislation."  Ah, across the floor, oh my god, where--is Ron [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] out of his mind?  Here's this progressive guy, and you're opposing the war--the War Powers Act?  And I said, "Let me tell you why. This War Powers Act waters down the Constitution of the United States, which states unequivocally the Congress shall have the power to declare war.  That's unequivocal, so why do you write legislation to water down your authority?  The Congress already gives us that right. Exercise that prerogative; the Congress shall have the right to declare war.  The framers of the Constitution were very clear and unequivocal on that," I said, "Number two, you have just written--if you pass this law, you will be writing into law a permanent Gulf of Tonkin Resolution."  Remember the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was supposed to be temporary that gave the United States the right to enter into the Gulf of Tonkin.  And I said, "Let me tell you why. Once the president introduces troops into another country for sixty days, how many of you in these chambers would have the courage to stand up and demand that the President withdraw those troops, how many of you?  Let's get real about this."
Speaker 2: Did you see any hands at all (laughter)?
Speaker 1: No.  "This is a permanent of Gulf Tonkin Resolution."  Now it was wonderful because one of my wonderful colleges, Bella Abzug of New York, and she and I came to Congress at the same time.  And Bella Abzug was this wonderful, brilliant you know progressive person and we became, you know like a team.  When I walked out of the well, she grabbed me and took me off the floor of Congress and she read me the riot act.  I mean, "Ron what, you know you broke ranks," you know the whole thing.  Fast forward, one day I'm giving a speech in New York [New York], Bella had retired from the Congress then, and so when I finished the speech when it was over, Bella Abzug walks up to me, "Ron," we hugged each other, 'cause I just loved Bella Abzug and she said, "Remember when I beat you up for about opposing the War Powers Act?"  I said, "Yeah, Bella, I'll never forget that whipping," she said, "You were right and I was wrong, and I came here tonight to tell you that.  We were wrong the War Powers Act watered down the Constitution and it has been inappropriately used."
Speaker 2: Ever since.
Speaker 1: Ever since.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 672745
Speaker 1: So you know, so along the way, eventually, you know we ended up, you know getting out of the Vietnam War, slide over Congressional Black Caucus, remember now, we came together.  We're sworn in, in January 1971 against the backdrop of the Civil Rights Movement, one of the arguments, you know was that you know we needed to be treated with justice and equity and there was thirteen of us and we felt that we would be stronger as a collective.  Stronger than one voice if we came together as thirteen voices.
Speaker 2: Now this is the largest contingent of black congressmen in--since Reconstruction?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: In [U.S.] Congress.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: We never had--so many years we had one or two.
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So suddenly there are thirteen of us you know and like--and for me part of it was, as I said, it was almost surreal because I kept thinking, man I'm part of this, you know, and we're here to, to, to not only make history but to try to change direction.  So we got together and we decided that we were going to organize into the Congressional Black Caucus.  Because we felt that collectively you know we would be stronger as one.
Speaker 2: Now let me say something else too Ron [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums], I thought about this in those days, is that there's thirteen of you in Congress, where there were four hundred and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Thirty-five.
Speaker 2: --thirty-five members, right.
Speaker 1: Plus a few delegates, yeah.
Speaker 2: The African American population in the country is like 11 percent?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So you represent maybe a little less than a fourth of the African American people, I guess in that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, somewhere between, somewhere between, yeah, third and a fourth yeah, absolutely.  And we--we never could of imagine, at least then we couldn't imagine forty some African American members of Congress, okay?  But we came together as thirteen and we felt that we had a responsibility--
Speaker 2: Now who, now once again, I'm sorry to interrupt, but who recognized, I mean who came up with the idea for you all to meet and get together, or which congressman?  I know what everybody idea--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I think Charles Diggs was very instrumental and important in that regard.  And Charlie Diggs, as you know they used to call him Mr. Africa, you know he was bright and discerning and--
Speaker 2: He was the chair of the House Committee on--
Speaker 1: Yeah at one point he was the chair of the District of Columbia Committee [U.S. House Committee on the District of Columbia; U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform] and I eventually took his place there.  He was a subcommittee chairman for Africa on the foreign affairs committee [U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs], you know.  And I think it was Charlie Diggs was instrumental in bringing us together, and I remember this was Charles Diggs, Bob Nix [Robert Nix Sr.], Shirley Chisholm, Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel], myself, Lou Stokes [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes], Bill Clay [HistoryMaker William Clay, Sr.], Walter Fauntroy [HistoryMaker Reverend Walter Fauntroy], Gus Hawkins [HistoryMaker Augustus F. "Gus" Hawkins]; we made up the Congressional Black Caucus then.
Story_ID: 672746
Speaker 1: There's something that I was asked to ask you about, and that was, Shirley Chisholm felt dissed somehow in this process.  Is there a story about that, that you--
Speaker 2: If I recall it was when Shirley Chisholm--okay, Shirley Chisholm was Harlem [New York, New York], Brooklyn [New York], you know, so Shirley Chisholm decides, this was before I got there.  That she wanted to be on the agriculture committee [U.S. House Committee on Agriculture] and these people are, what is this black woman from New York gon' be on the agriculture commi- this is our prerogative, right?  You're not growing any food in you know Harlem, you're not growing any food in Brooklyn, so who's this black woman who want to be on Agriculture?  Well it was wonderful 'cause Shirley Chisholm thi- was thinking like this.  She said, "The Food Stamp Program [Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program] and other--the nutrition programs are funded from the agriculture committee and the farm bill and somebody from urban America ought to be on that committee to talk about these priorities."  She was ahead of her time in that sense, okay?  That was the battle that Shirley Chisholm weighed, that was one of her battles.  I remember one day, she said poignantly, we were all meeting and you know Shirley Chisholm was a strong feminist as well.  And they said, "Well Shirley what's--is it harder being a woman or its harder being a Black person?"  And Shirley said, "That's a no brainer, it's hard to be a woman 'cause even you brothers oppress me," and I went ooh (laughter) ooh, okay.  And so that's the kind of person Shirley was, so I you know, I was with a small group of people but everybody brought something awesome to the table, and, and we agreed that our strength lied in our diversity.  Here's Bill Clay [HistoryMaker William Clay, Sr.] from the trade union movement you know, Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] from different--we all came from different places and so we all brought our different strengths to the table.  My first term I--they--I was on Foreign Affairs [U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs] and the District of Columbia--'cause the speaker looked at me and he said, "I heard you were on the Berkeley City Council?"  "Yes, sir."  "I'm putting you on the District of Columbia committee [U.S. House Committee on the District of Columbia; U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]."  Well, the speaker put you on the District of Columbia committee and it turns out that six years later, I became the chairman of the District of Columbia committee with least seniority than any member in the history.  'Cause after Charles Diggs got into difficulty, he left the [U.S.] Congress, then I took his place.
Story_ID: 672747
Speaker 1: But my main committee was foreign affairs committee [U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs], so I was gonna like follow you know in--
Speaker 2: I think like you joined foreign affairs in '73 [1973]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No I joined foreign affairs my first term, '71 [1971] but my second term, I sat down with my staff and I said, "Why shouldn't the peacenik be on the armed services committee [U.S. House Committee on Armed Services]?"  Everybody looked at me like, Ron, there's no way they gon' put Ron Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] from Oakland [California], Berkeley [California] on the armed services committee.  So I--we sat down and I said, "Well the only way we're gonna get on the for- on the armed services committee I've gotta get--," 'cause in the Black Caucus [Congressional Black Caucus] we came together and said we need to put one of us on every committee so that our perspective would be presented at on every committee, that was one of our guiding principles.  So I went to them and said, "Well, there's no black person on the armed services committee and I want to go on armed services committee."  Well, nobody else wanted to go on the armed services committee in the caucus so it wasn't--I wasn't rivaling anybody.  So I went to them and said, "I need you to write a letter to the leadership saying as the Congressional Black Caucus that you wanted to put someone black on the armed services committee and that you are nominating me to serve on the committee."  But that was the year, November 1973; Texas elected a wonderful African American woman Barbara Jordan to [U.S.] Congress.  And she was Texas, so I decided that the only way that I could be a member of the armed services committee is one, if the Black Caucus demanded that an African American person serve and that there would be no alternative to me.  Well, when Barbara Jordan was elected, I said, "If there's anybody that they would be willing to nominate, it would be Barbara Jordan."  So I picked up the phone and I called Barbara Jordan after she won and I congratulated her. "I look forward and I'd be honored to serve with you."  And I said, "I'm calling you because I would like to serve on the House [U.S. House of Representatives] armed services committee and I think that the only way I can be there, I have any chance is if I'm the only alternative.  I have a feeling that they would nominate you."  And she said, "First of all, you need to be on the armed services committee, you ought to be on the armed services committee, I support you being on the armed services committee and I don't want to be on the armed services committee.  As a matter of fact, I want to be on the judiciary committee [U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary] and when we get off the phone, I will write a letter to the speaker letting him know that."  Well, remember she got on the judiciary committee and as a member of the judiciary committee, in the context of the Watergate hearings, remember she gave a speech that went into history.  When she said with that wonderful voice, "The Constitution states," remember that speech?  It was brilliant and it was incredible.  And so the day comes when they're going to nominate members to serve on the--I'm sorry you need to quit?
Speaker 2: Well, we may as well, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Story_ID: 672748
Speaker 1: All right, so the Congressional Black Caucus writes the letter to the leadership but they're all looking at me like, "Ron [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums], this is wishful thinking there's no way they're gon' put you on armed services committee [U.S. House Committee on Armed Services].  Barbara Jordan she sent her letter.  Anyway, the day comes, I get this phone call from my representative on the committee on committees [U.S. House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee].  That's the committee that nominates people to these different committees.  They said, "Ron, couldn't get you on the armed services committee."  "Why not?"  They said, "The chairman of the armed services committee, F. Edward Hebert of Louisiana, said he literally called everybody on the committee last night and said do not put the Berkeley [California] radical on the armed services committee, period, I don't want him there that's it."  And he said, "So we're moving along very quickly Ron, what other committee do you want to serve on?"  I said, "Wanna serve on the armed services committee and I think it's improper that they denied me membership.  Simply on the strength of one person's determination to not have me serve."
Speaker 2: Now this is a Democrat too, right?
Speaker 1: This is Democrat.
Speaker 2: Hebert.
Speaker 1: F. Edward Hebert.  So I then went and found a friend from California who became--he was a legend in the [U.S.] Congress, Phil Burton [Phillip Burton] of San Francisco [California].  And I said, "Phil, you know this institution, I'm still the outside guy learning my way, they just denied membership on the foreign affairs--on the armed services committee, how do I fight back?"  He said, "Who chairs the Black Caucus?"  And I said, "Lou Stokes [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes]," he said, "Lou Stokes, great guy, nice guy but too nice."  He said, "Find Bill Clay [HistoryMaker William Clay, Sr.]."  Bill Clay's the militant brother from--okay.  He said, "Well find Bill Clay and get both of them, Lou Stokes as chairman of the armed services committee [sic.] and Bill Clay to seek an immediate meeting with the speaker of the House [U.S. House of Representatives] and demand; you know that they put you on the committee."  So I went and found Lou Stokes and Bill Clay that were actually having lunch together.  "You gotta get on the phone ask for an immediate meeting with the speaker."  We got the meeting, walked in, as soon as we walked in the door, you know, the speaker goes, "I did best I could for all you guys in the Black Caucus but couldn't do anything for Ron Dellums.  The chairman doesn't want him on the committee." He said, "Well sir, that's why we here, that's why we want to talk with you, because we think that it's wrong."  Lou Stokes wonderful guy, Lou Stokes, goes you know, "Mr. Speaker, it's a matter of principle," okay?  And Bill Clay is going, "And if you don't put the brother on the committee, we're gonna call a press conference and denounce this is as a racist institution."  So here's Lou Stokes, "A matter of principle that we place Ron Dellums who studied these issues," and Bill Clay going (makes sound).  So the speaker gets it that he's not gonna get out of this without you know a big national press conference denouncing the party and the Democratic Caucus [House Democratic Caucus] as a racist institution, (makes sound).  So anyway, Carl Albert goes, "Let me recons- let me see if I can get the committee to reconsider Ron's nomination.  Let me see what I can do on that." "All right Mr. Speaker."  So we start walking out, I say, "Hey you guys, it's over," they said, "What do you mean?"  I said, "When the speaker said he was gonna try to get them to reconsider;" I said, "it's over man, it will be reconsidered.  You're looking at the first African American on the House armed services committee."  Sure enough forty-five minutes later, get the call, I'm on.
Story_ID: 672749
Speaker 1: The day comes when we have our first organization meeting and I walked in the door, okay.  A woman from Denver, Colorado had been elected at the same time Barbara Jordan was elected and she was the Denver peacenik, okay?  So they refer to her to as the Denver bomb thrower and Ron Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] as the Berkeley [California] bomb thrower.  We're the two big peaceniks.
Speaker 2: So is this Pat Schrader [sic.]?
Speaker 1: Pat Schroeder.
Speaker 2: Schroeder, okay.
Speaker 1: Pat Schroeder.  So Pat Schroeder and I walked in the room, we're the new guys on the block.  She's a freshman, I'm second term, but we're the bottom row people.  Now I'm just in front of her, because as I said, I'm--this is my--my first meeting as member of the armed services committee [U.S. House Committee on Armed Services] but I'm in my second term.  Now, just to show you how petty they had only one chair at the bottom of the committee.
Speaker 2: A physical chair, we're talking about?
Speaker 1: One physical chair that you sit in. And two of us and Pat Schroeder looked at me and she was like livid, right?  And I'm upset, right?  She's going these sexist men and I'm going these racist, in my mind.  So we both sitting there--we're both standing there, and here's this one chair and I remembered, I swear this is the truth.  It hit me, my grandmother [Dellum's maternal grandmother, Estelle Poole Terry] trying to get me to understand how to discipline--handle anger, she said to me one time, "Never let the other guy get your goat cheaply, easily," okay?  And I said now, they want us to scream and yell, I know this, so they can say see, I told you, these are these crazy activists.  So I turned to Pat Schroeder and I said, "Ma'am, my name is Ron Dellums," she said, "Yeah, I know, I know."  I said, "My grandmother told me you know never let anybody get at you cheaply," and I said, "this is a cheap shot.  They want you and I to scream and yell." I said, "So if it's cool with you, it's cool with me.  Why don't the two of us sit down in this one chair together as if it's the most normal thing in the world and never raise our voice about it."  And she looked at me and she said, "That's cool with me."  So for an entire meeting, Ron Dellums and Pat Schroeder literally sat cheek to cheek in one chair and we never acted as if there was anything wrong with that.  They were pulling their hair out, 'cause they couldn't, you know.  Why aren't they screaming?  We never did, we just went through the meeting as if everything was normal, and we sitting like cheek to cheek.
Speaker 2: Well, who were some of the major figures on the armed services committee?
Speaker 1: Well as I said, F. Edward Hebert of Louisiana, was you know was one of them like I don't you know, it's hard to remember now all the names of those guys.  But nobody raised a voice; nobody raised their voice in defense of us at all.  Nobody said this is--why don't you get another chair in here. But the next meeting there was another chair, and we never spoke about it.
Speaker 2: Now--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So we won the fight without having to fight it; we made them be the small guy.
Story_ID: 672750
Speaker 1: People say and I saw this about three or four different things on--pieces on the Internet is that when you're on the armed services committee [U.S. House Committee on Armed Services], for the first time, there was actually debate about armed services (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: About spending and--'cause they didn't, they never had actual discussion about this.
Speaker 2: 'Cause nobody, nobody wanted to talk about--'cause that's why we went on.  Went on to raise our voices around peace and the beauty of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was he went beyond anti-war.  See 'cause I maintain that there's a difference between being anti-war and pro-peace, okay?  And--so Martin Luther King said that to me and I felt that voice need to be there.  Secondly, we talked about the priorities you know for the [U.S.] military.  What about the spending, what about the weapons systems, what about arms control, okay?  So on the money we spend, I said the question is not whether we spend money, we gonna spend money.  The question is how do we spend the money for what purpose do we spend the money?  What is a properly sized, properly trained, properly equipped military?  What is an appropriate role for us to play are all the problems of the world, problems that lend themselves to a military solution or do we stop and look at whether they are political and economic and cultural reasons why things happen? Martin Luther King's point, you know.  Peace is more than simply the absence of war, it's the absence of conditions that create war.  So we had to look at those kind of things.  Nuclear weapons, what's the role of a nuclear weapon when we all know that nuclear weapons have the capacity to destroy all human life on the planet, right?  So, yeah, we raised those kinds of questions.
Story_ID: 672751
Speaker 1: I remember I offered an amendment to end a weapon system called the MX missile [LGM-118 Peacekeeper].  Remember, our nuclear triad have air launch missiles, sea launch missiles and fixed based land missiles.  Well somebody in our intelligence gathering capabilities said the Soviet Union has the capacity to hit our land based missiles that were in fixed silos. Therefore, they're vulnerable. So the answer they came up with was then let's not make them--let's take them out of their stationary role and make them mobile, so they move around so that the Soviets would never know where these land based missiles are, meaning then that they would no longer be vulnerable.  So Ron Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] gets up on the floor one day and says, "The MX missile is tried to solve a problem that doesn't exist."  My colleagues go now what is he gon' say now?  I said, "Any Soviet planner looking at our land based missiles, in fixed silos and they know exactly where they are, if they hit those missiles, we would be able to retaliate against the Soviet Union with our sea launch missies and our air launch missiles with such audacity that they would never survive as a civilized society in modern times.  So would they be willing to risk that to go after one leg of our nuclear triad, when there're two other legs of our triad that would survive and cripple them forever?"  I said, "Therefore, Soviet planners have to look at the totality of our nuclear weapon system, not just that--so that there's no such thing as one leg that's vulnerable.  They have to look at the totality," and we called it synergism.  Because I went to some of the greatest scientist in America and I said, "Help me analyze this."  And so they said the concept of synergism, it would, okay.  Fast forward, Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] becomes president; they decide that they want to figure out what to do about the MX missile system.  So he puts together the Scowcroft commission [President's Commission on Strategic Forces] to study the question of, all right--naw, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I got off on the wrong issue.  But anyway with respect to the fixed based missiles, later on, my colleagues, sev- many years later, got upon the floor and said, "Ron Dellums offered the argument of synergism a decade ago and you guys are just catching up."  Because they never built the MX missile system, because they finally realized that they were building a solution to a problem that didn't exist.  And think about the tens of billions of dollars that we would've spent to build a mobile missile system that the Soviet Union never attacked.
Speaker 2: And they probably spent millions of dollars doing the research that you had been doing.
Speaker 1: Exactly.   So, so the role of questioning of creating the discourse, because my argument with my colleagues when I became chair, was look, you increase the potential for coming to the same conclusion, the extent of which you share the same information.  So let's--let's get on the same page, let's get the same information.  Maybe we're--you're looking at one piece of information, I'm looking at another, let's all look at the same information, and maybe we'll come to the same conclusion.  Well eventually that's what happened.  When people really started looking at the whole thing in its totality, members of [U.S.] Congress eventually said, "We don't need the MX missile."
Story_ID: 672752
Speaker 1: Now, this is [U.S.] Congress is the highest level of discourse about American policy and that sort of thing--it's a--to many of us when we hear stories about congressmen who don't even read their--I mean they don't get--they don't seem to get any information, they don't argue, they don't debate, they move after contracts, and the sort of thing way or another.  I mean it's just--did that trouble you when you, I mean in those kinds of meetings, the level, you know the low level of discussion?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you know and that was clearly there, but I decided that I wanted to challenge my colleagues to the extent which I could to a higher order of discourse.  Because remember, when I came there, they thought I was gonna be the loud mouth demagogue from Berkeley [California].  They had no idea that I would learn Pentagonese, to go on the armed services committee [U.S. House Committee on Armed Services], stay up to three or four o'clock in the morning reading briefing books.  So that I could be intelligent, okay?  Because what I learned was that members of Congress tended to respect the staffs because of their collective knowledge and the chairman, okay?  But most of time, members of Congress would really be very respectful of the staff people, Ph.D.'s and this that and the other, right?  So when I became chairman, I decided that instead of having the staff brief the members, I had the staff brief me then I briefed the members.  So then the members said, "Well he understand," and so that way we could engage with each other and lift the level of the discourse in the conversation.  One day--he's passed away, now, but Marvin Leath, Marvin Leath of Texas, he came up to me one day and this was in the context of the MX missile [LGM-118 Peacekeeper].  And so this guy from Texas comes up next to me on the floor of Congress and he said, "Ron Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums], I'm Marvin Leath of Texas," and I said, "Yes, sir."  And he said, "I just want to introduce myself to you and tell you that I just made a serious mistake." True story.  And I looked at him, you know and I said, "Mistake?"  And he said, "Yeah," he said, "I actually listened to you."  He said, "'Cause normally when you get--when you get on the floor to talk about your--the MX missile amendment, that was my cue to walk off the floor of Congress, get a cigarette and a cup of coffee and wait until you finish, you know, your, your tirade," or whatever he would call it.  He said, "But today, I decided, let me listen to this guy, see what he's really saying."  And he said, "That was a mistake."  I said, "Why do you say that?"  He said, "'Cause you made sense" (laughter). And he said, "This may sound weird to you," he said, "but I would like to invite you to my district in East Texas because I think my constituents ought to hear what you have to say, 'cause you making sense that I never understood, 'cause I never took the time to listen to you."  So that means that if you stay faithful to keep arguing the point, at some point maybe somebody stops to hear you and engage. And he actually, he actually took me to his district in East Texas and the only African American person in the room other than me was the brother that was pouring the drinks (laughter).  And all these guys there, these big Texas belts on, and money clips and whatever.  And the end of it, one guy go, "I--if somebody had told me 'bout this meeting, I would of told they was a lie," he said, "but this-this, you know," he said, "y'all, you need to take this on the road."  They didn't understand, so well he walked up to the mic [microphone] and said, "I know all of you--my good redneck friends are asking why do I have this black ultra liberal Berkeley [California] progressive guy in my district."  And they all said, "Yeah, we wanna know." You know what he said?  He said, "First of all I love this guy as my friend, but more importantly, he's saying something you need to hear."  So that started a relationship across a chasm that I never could have anticipated.  Here this conservative Democrat from Texas and this progressive guy from Oakland [California], Berkeley actually standing up in front of a conservative audience, that under normal circumstances would have rejected me out of pocket for him to say, "I want you to hear what this man has to say.  Because what he's saying about nuclear weapons and nuclear armaments and their danger to us and the political, the military and economic implication we need to understand." Amazing moment.
Speaker 1: Now there's a similar--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I don't know if that could happen nowadays (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of polarization nowadays, you know people are--congressmen are being urged to work together, I don't know what's gon' happen.
Story_ID: 672753
Speaker 1: In terms of the armed services com- I mean the service committee [U.S. House Committee on Armed Services] there two other projects.  The Peacekeeper missile [LGM-118 Peacekeepr] and the stealth bomber probably a lot of other things that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the B-2.
Speaker 1: B-2 bomber [Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and the B-2 bomber was a stealth bomber whose role was to fly in the context of a nuclear exchange and bomb the Soviet Union, fly these stealth bombers.  Well, I remember one day early evening, I was in the House [U.S. House of Representatives] gym working out and one of my colleagues, John Kasich, who is now the governor of Ohio.  He said, "Ron [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] why do you oppose the B-2 bomber?" And I said, "You don't need it, you can't afford it and there're alternatives."  I said, "You want me to explain it?"  He said, "Yeah."  I said, "You don't need it because this is a subsonic plane that flies so slow that by the time it got there, the nuclear exchange would've already happened.  And all you doing is rearranging the rubble, so you don't need this bomber.  Number two you can't afford it 'cause this bomber cost you over $40 billion at a time when we got other problems and other priorities.  And number three, if you want to have a bomber, you can--you got wide body planes like 747s [Boeing 747] and you got the B-1 [Rockwell B-1 Lancer], you got other--you could, you could reconfigure them and if you needed to have that mission, the whole lot cheaper.  So you don't need them, you can't afford it and they're alternatives."  That's what I was gonna say when they decided that they were gonna look at this issue, okay?  That's the conclusion they came to. Sam Nunn was my counterpart in the [U.S.] Senate, and he was a person of integrity.  We had different politics, we came together around the B-2, he was the proponent of the B-2 I was the opponent of the B-2.  Even my Republican colleagues said, "If Ron Dellums and Sam Nunn are in the room around the B-2, we don't need to be in the room, these are the two most articulate pro and opponents of the bill.  If they can work anything out between the two of them, everybody could live with that, okay, nobody stronger on either side."
Story_ID: 672754
Speaker 1: So I went in and I sat down with Senator Nunn [Sam Nunn] who was chairing this Senate armed services committee [U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services] and I said, "You think you're right," he said, "Yeah."  I said, "I think I'm right. So we need a third party to figure out who's right."  And you got this scientific committee of group of people who look at this objectively.  And I said, "I'm willing to live with that decision 'cause I think at the end of the day, I will be proven right, not needed, not necessary, can't afford it and there're alternatives."  And I said, "What is it that I need to agree to in this bill that will keep you comfortable, that I'm not trying to shade the funding of parts of this B-2 [Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit] so that it would be in my favor?  What do I do so that you will be clearly and unequivocally understanding that everything here will be totally fair?  No bias," okay?  He said, "Well I need this, this and this," I said, "I agree to it."  When I left the meeting, John Kasich said, "Ron [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums]," he said, "man he took your shirt."  And I said, "John, at some point you have to believe in whether you think you're right or you don't.  You and I put the Dellums/Kasich amendment together and offered it on the floor because we both thought that was right."  He said, "Yeah." I said, "So you gotta maintain the integrity of that."  Fast forward the report comes out, we don't need it, we can't afford it and there are alternatives.  And Sam Nunn, to his credit kept his word.  The press went to him and said, "Well you gonna keep fighting for the B-2?" He said, "No, I had a handshake deal with Chairman Dellums that we would fund these programs at a fair level and if the decision went his way, that would be it.  If it went my way, that would be the end of it. It went his way, and that's the end of it."  And John Kasich, when he took in his first state of the State in Ohio as the governor, he said, "Ron Dellums and I did something no one in modern--no member of [U.S.] Congress in modern history has ever done.  We stopped a major weapon system." And we stopped it and never went passed the twenty that they originally built. That was the end of it, it dropped.  Can I just say one other quick thing?  I misspoke myself on the MX missile [LGM-118 Peacekeeper], it was the Scowcroft commission [President's Commission on Strategic Forces] appointed by President Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan].  And they did come to the very same conclusion that no Soviet planner would attack our weapons.  Because we had two other legs that would survive and would inflict unacceptable damage, therefore, there's no such thing as one vulnerable leg of our nuclear tirade, it's in the totality.  And so I told my colleagues, I said, "You guys did a study, spent millions of dollars; I gave that to you a few years ago, free."
Speaker 2: Now who was Brent Scowcroft (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: Scowcroft.
Speaker 2: He was the--
Speaker 1: He was a general, yeah.  And so they appointed him because of his you know military creditability, and you know integrity on these issues and so.  I mean Scowcroft, yeah.  I think he was the--yeah, a general that became a national security advisor, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Right, right, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 672755
Speaker 1: Now, now did--it would seem to me that they would've immediately when you were appointed to this position [on the U.S. House Committee on Armed Services], say, "Well what does he know about the [U.S.] military, he--," and then they found out that you were a Marine (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Ex-Marine.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean did this happen, I'm sure it did.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  And (laughter) see it became--and I never played that up, you know. I didn't run as the former Marine who is a peacenik, I never tried to exploit it.  I did my job, okay and--I'll tell you another qui- another story about that, but so when they found out that I had been a Marine--and some of them, because I had, you know I had a master's degree from Cal Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], so they automatically assumed member of [U.S.] Congress, never that I grew up in the hood.  So they--it didn't dawn on them that I was an enlisted man, p- you know, private, you know, Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums], right from the boot camp.  They thought I was an officer, but they came up to me, "Ron," 'cause I'm the Berkeley [California] flower child, you know you throw flowers at the tanks, and that's, you know.  That's who I was supposed to be.  And they said, "We understand you was in the [U.S.] Marine Corps," you know.  I said, "Yeah," they couldn't believe it.  And overnight it changed their perspective, see, because in many of their mind's eye, the [U.S.] Marine Corps had a sacral sa- you know place, John Wayne you know. Man.  So they had to rethink me, because it didn't register, they didn't under--they couldn't comprehend that and as a former Marine, and which is why when I mentioned to you earlier that my mother [Willa Terry Dellums] called me up and said, "I told you that was a mistake.  That was one of the best things you ever did," 'cause one of the things she said to me was, "It protected you."  Because when the right wing came to attack, then other people said, "Yeah but, he was a Marine."  So they go (gesture) you know they had to--they had to hold back, because, because they didn't get that.  When I'm in basic training, now remember I go in the Marine Corps in 1954, I had never seen a black officer in my life.  I read about B. O. Davis [Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.] and you know these guys.  One day my drill instructor in boot camp comes to see me and he said, "Private Dellums, get in here."  I walked in, he says, "There are two officers from Officers Candidate School [sic. Officer Candidate School] who came here to interview you."  I'm all, "Interview me?" I said, "Why?"  He said, "Well you passed," you know all those tests they give you when you go in basic training.  He said, "You got the highest score of anybody in your training battalion and they came to interview you as a potential candidate for Officer's Candidate School."  I'm going me, a black officer?  (Makes sound) You know, and I'm like a boot you know, scared to death of the drill instructor.  Well, I run down to Quonset Hut A or whatever it was and I knocked on the door, "Sir, Private Dellums reporting as ordered, sir."  "Get in here, lad."  I stepped into the Quonset hut and there're two white guys down at the end of the Quonset hut standing behind--sitting behind desks, I stepped to up to them, smartly snapped to attention.  "Sir, Private Dellums reporting as ordered, sir."  This one guy looked at this piece of paper and he looked at me and he looked at the paper and he looked at me again and he handed it to the other guy.  He looked at the paper and he looked at me and he said, "What race are you lad?" Okay.  Now this is 1954, so we were Negros.  And my folks always said, "Not Nigro, Negro," okay?  So I had--they had me standing, and I stood at attention, "Sir, I'm a Negro, sir."  "That's what I thought man; get on back to your outfit son."  Summarily dismiss me. Man I walked out, I'm going like what was that all about?  It's obvious that they was surprised that I was black, but what was this?  Later, my drill instructor, I'll just finish real quick.  My drill instructor gets in touch with--he calls me to the office and he said, "I found out what happened.  When you were standing in line with your hair bald, no hair, they looked up and saw light skinned and Ronald V. Dellums 15605 Caucasian, everything else was the same except they had gotten the race wrong.  So when I showed up as a young black guy and not a white guy, Ron Dellums was dismissed."  And I used to jokingly tell Colin Powell [HistoryMaker General Colin L. Powell] if they hadn't made that mistake back in 1954 I would've been the first chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he used to laugh.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 672756
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about the National Black Political Assembly, the Gary [Indiana] convention--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --in 1972--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, oh my goodness.
Speaker 1: Now this is--we had been talking about you now these collaborative efforts and all this, but then at the same time in the country, we have like the black community trying to close ranks and gain power through you know pulling our resources together.  So this is the National Black Political Assembly with such a gathering in Gary.  I think hosted by mayor what is--I can't think of his name now, but the mayor of Gary--the black mayor of Gary in those days.
Speaker 2: I'm seeing him, right now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, like.
Speaker 2: We'll remember it.
Speaker 1: Yes, okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  [HistoryMaker] Richard Hatcher.
Speaker 1: Richard Hatcher (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dick Hatcher, that's right. Dick Hatcher.
Speaker 1: So did you attend that gathering?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You're not talking about the one where they wanted me to run for president?
Speaker 1: Well that was in '76 [1976] but they formed it in--they formed the National Black Political Assembly out of a convention in '72 [1972] in Gary.  And--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went to all of them--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It continued to grow--they went to Little Rock [Arkansas] next I think in '73 [1973] (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was there--I was there in Gary, I was there at Little Rock.
Story_ID: 672757
Speaker 1: Well, would you just, maybe just explain what your role was in the National Black Political Assembly and--leading up the '76 [1976] candidacy for president.
Speaker 2: Well you know, I mean, again you know I was one of the--I was one of the Young Turks that came out of the '60s [1960s] so now I'm elected to the United States Congress and I come from a district, that you know Berkeley Cal [California], Berkeley's there to--the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] been attacked by the president.  So there was a certain kind of visibility that was there, and then being a member of the Congressional Black Caucus so you know I'm invited to all of these things.  So we're the--we're the activists you know of those days.  And we came together as the politically elected official because more--more African Americans were being elected to different places than, you know any time in modern history.  So we were coming together, activists coming together.  In terms of my role specifically, one of the things that I felt was vitally important was to articulate the politics of coalition building.  'Cause you remember now, I'm elected from a predominately white congressional district and for twenty something years, my district was never lower than say 66, 67, 68 percent, okay?  And I felt that if we were going to expand our ranks, we needed to--we needed to be competitive.  And that number two if our politics were designed to simply organize 10 percent, that strategy by itself was not a winning strategy.  Organizing the 10 percent of us nationally was vitally important because it would maximize our strength, maximize our focus, but then ultimately we needed to be able to work with other people where our self interest overlapped (laughter) and I used to say--and I think I said in, I'm not sure if it was in Gary [Indiana] or Little Rock [Arkansas].  But I said, "Machiavelli [Niccolo Machiavelli] used to say that a midget never forms a coalition with a giant.  Because the midget was always worried about whether the giant would change his mind (laughter) you know and decide that, you know," okay?   So I said, "What's the answer to that?  Whole bunch of midgets coalesce into a giant.  And then you, you coalesce from strength." So we need to be able to talk with Latinos and Asians and Native Americans about racial and cultural injustice and pain, because we share part of that.  It comes at us in some slightly different, some different skewed ways, but overall, it's about oppression.  And what we should be about is building the egalitarian society, so let's figure out how to coalesce with each other.  Well interestingly at the Black Political Assembly, it was well received.  'Cause people say, "You gon' give a coalition speech at the Black Political Assembly?"  I said, "Yeah," you know.  I said, "Because there's nothing inconsistent. Nationalizing ourselves you know is very important.  But that's not the end, that's only the beginning, 'cause there you create your strength and you engage in coalition from strength not weakness, but we need to be able to bridge these gaps."  So part of my role was to, I felt was to talk about the power of coalition politics and later you know Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] was to coined [KS1]the phrase Rainbow Coalition.  But you know we were out there early on in you know in the late '60s [1960s] and early '70s [1970s] in the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California], around that whole concept of coalition building and coalition politics.  The second thing was to, was to try to be a voice of knowledge around certain issues.  You know I felt that Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] put out a whole lot of things out there and there's only gonna be one Martin Luther King.  So I decided to pick up the peace gauntlet and run with that one.  And so that was part of the role that I tried to play which was to say these are issues that we are as compelled and as interested in, because they speak to our self interest as powerfully.  So, so the peace movement is not white folks' business, arms control is not just white folks' business, the environment is not just white folks' business, okay.  So we have to--we have to broaden the definition of what ultimately is in our self interest.  So part of my being a member of [U.S.] Congress, look I'm gathering information that only a handful of people gather, so what's, what's your role?  Share the information, be part of the educative process. So that was part of what, what my effort was in that regard.
Story_ID: 672758
Speaker 1: And then one day I got up one, one morning and they said, "We wanna draft you from the National Black Political Assembly to run for president."  Oh my god and it wasn't something that I wanted to do.  I found a place from which to fight and I spilled my blood, paid my dues, okay?  And stood there against overwhelming opposition, but now I've got a place where I can speak, and speak with respect and speak with authority.  I wanna, I wanna fight my fight from here.  But I'm trying to figure how do I say that, you know, 'cause I had never been able to say no before and hadn't been able to say no since when people say, "We need you to serve." But some kind of way I knew that I did not want to seek the presidency and that I felt that was such an awesome and overwhelming role that, that should be something you want to do.  And I did not want to do it.  And I managed to get through that moment very painfully because people that know me know saying no is a difficult thing, when it comes to public service.  But I got up and I said to them that you know I'm--we're together, I'm with you, I'm one--you know, I'm there, hip to hip, shoulder to shoulder, in the fight.  But I found a place from which to fight that I now am, feel comfortable fighting.  I've got a place, and it took me a long time to get to be heard and now I'm being heard seriously and I wanna keep fighting.  If I need to fight, I wanna fight from this vantage point, I choose not to want to run for president.  And they kind of let me out. That was a hard one, and--'cause there were many sleepless nights.  I was trying to figure out how to say no when it was not something that I wanted to do.  I was willing to keep struggling, I was willing to keep fighting I was willing to put off my personal hopes and dreams that I had as a younger guy.  And stay in politics and keep fighting, but I didn't want to do it from there.  I felt comfortable more comfortable, not comfortable--more comfortable in a place that I had learned.  I learned the rules; I learned the environment, I learned how to fight from there.  And I decided why throw all that experience away, trying to do something else.  And the other thing, maybe in another part of my mind, I'm thinking, you know, you gotta decide what would happen if you won, (laughter) would you want to be the president?  And I didn't want to be the president.
Story_ID: 672759
Speaker 1: Now from those days, I was active in the NBPA [National Black Political Assembly] in those days, and not on a high level or anything, but I remember actual campaign posters for you being distributed by the NBPA.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Now this is unusual in those days for things to happen that are not necessarily in full coordination with--
Speaker 2: No, they were drafting me, see 'cause--I know 'cause they, "Hey, let's get 'em out there Ronald [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums]," you know.  And it was very difficult, because at one point, I remember, I don't know if you recall this, but it was Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.], President Carter running for reelection when Ted Kennedy [Edward M. Kennedy] ran against him?  I--they drafted me at the convention [1980 Democratic National Convention, New York, New York] and they actually had enough votes to put me on the ballot.  I actually got some votes, when it was Jimmy Carter and Ted Kennedy.
Speaker 1: This was 1980, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that, that was a difficult moment as well, but I got drafted.  I went there to try to find somebody to run for vice president to give the coalition a place--a voice. Anyway I won't go through the story.  But it ended up when everybody looked at me and said, "You represent the coalition, we're gon' put your name in for president."  And I went like, don't do me any favors.  Everybody went out the door, gathered the signatures, next thing I know, I'm standing up in front of a whole audience of people as the presidential candidate.  And I didn't know what I said until the next day when somebody came by and knocked on the door and said, "Hey Ron," from the organization, okay?  Said, "Here's the tape." I didn't know, the last thing I remember when they--all these banners and sign posts, Dellums for president, and this guy said at the convention, he said, "When you walk out there, adjust the mic [microphone]."  I just start walking when they called me, "Ron Dellums the next president of the United States," you know.  So I walked out there and I said oh god give me the strength.  And the only thing I could remember was adjust the mic, and then I just went on autopilot.  And I looked out, and it was an amazing thing man, I looked into those thousands of people and the first person I saw way out there, on my mother's [Willa Terry Dellums] grave, this is a true story.  Was my son, my oldest son [Brandy Dellums]. Then the California delegation, and from way out there, it was almost like we made a spiritual connection.  I saw my son, then I looked to my right, and way out there I saw Lou Stokes [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes], cross all these people.  And I gave--and there was a woman sitting right down in front was sitting like this (gesture) and scared to death.  I spoke to three people, I spoke to my son, I spoke to Lou Stokes and I spoke to that woman.  And I tried to tune out everybody else, 'cause I would've fainted (laughter).
Story_ID: 672760
Speaker 1: Well, in terms of NBPA [National Black Political Assembly] I think that those involved in that in those days didn't think you were gonna win, coming anywhere close to winning but I think your selection--your sig- the significance of your selection by the NBPA, I think is that more progressive minded African Americans saw you as a leader.  Somebody who embodied a progressive agenda that not all black politicians--
Speaker 2: No, I agree.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: Well was I both humbled and honored by that. It was overwhelming.  And you know for your--for your peers and your contemporaries to say we have enough faith and confidence in you that we would want to put you out there as our voice to the American people, that was an amazing thing.  I mean it was overwhelming, but it just wasn't what I wanted to do.  I wanted to keep fighting, and I felt that--and the other part of, part of it was as well that if I had done that, I--it didn't make any sense for me to try to running for two offices, that didn't seem to be legitimate.   And if you gon' run for president, run for president, but not--I'm running for [U.S.] Congress and I'm running for president simultaneous, who can take you seriously with that?  So I felt that I had--I had some more fights to fight that weren't complete.  One of them was anti-apartheid struggle, there were other--there were some other fights that I wanted to keep waging, that I felt that I could wage better in the Congress of the United States.  But it wasn't that I wasn't honored. I was honored, that I was humbled.  And see I think that was an amazing moment in American history.  Because when you look back on those moments as opposed to now, think about it.  It was a period when the politics of this country actually were in many ways responding to the will of the people, okay?  Unlike now, Civil Rights Movement, they passed civil rights law, anti-war movement, they ended the war, you know in Vietnam.  The women's liberation movement, they passed Equal Rights Amendment for women, Title IX for women. The environmental movement, they created the Environmental Protection Agency, passed clean air and clean water.  I mean it was a time when you actually--there was voices being raised from the streets as it were that were resonating.  Because people in the streets had representatives that took those battles from the streets to the chambers, and forced our colleagues to have to come to grips with it.  So the combination of the activism of the community and the elected people that they elected to do that job in the aggregate, a lot of things got done.  You know, I keep saying--I shouldn't say jokingly because that would be dismissive and I don't wanna do that at all, but it was a time when it worked.  See like to me it's like it's not working now, you know for a variety of reasons.  And one is I just think a lot people came here and didn't have that conversation with themselves.  Did they send me here to change the venue of my activism or did they ask me to come here and challenge the process to try to govern?  They're still activists, so they gave their speech, little government no taxes, get rid of this, and they came here and that's where they are.  And whether they should sit down from somebody from Berkeley [California] or Oakland [California] or somebody for Los Angeles [California], or somebody from Chicago [Illinois] or New York [New York], doesn't you know, no.  This is my perspective and my point of view, so the give and take of what ultimately is in our country's absolute best interest is not there.
Story_ID: 672761
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about--well this is a lead up to the--now in '72 [1972] you really started your anti-apartheid camp- well around '72 [1972] I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Really started the anti-apartheid campaign, it would take fourteen years you know for this to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --reach--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And how that happened in 1972, remember the Polaroid workers [Polaroid Revolutionary Workers Movement], 'cause the, the, the passbooks that black South Africans have to--had to carry with pictures were Polaroid pictures.  So one day, workers from New England working in Polaroid factory came down to Washington, D.C. and they wanted to meet with the Congressional Black Caucus.  These were the militant black workers of Polaroid in '72 [1972] I think it was.  And so they came on the day that the caucus had a meeting, and somebody sent the word in said that there's some militant black folks said they want to meet with the black caucus on anti-apartheid and so somebody said, "Well we have a meeting. Send Ron [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums]." (Laughter) I'm the Berkeley [California] radical, right?  So they said, "Well there's some militant people, send Ron to meet with them."  They said, "Ron will you go meet with them, 'cause we got an agenda we need--." I said, "Yeah, I'll go meet them."  So I get up to go and John Conyers [HistoryMaker John Conyers, Jr.] said, "I'll go with him."  And John Conyers got up and walked in the room with me with these Polaroid workers.  At the end of the day, the result of the meeting was I'd be honored to work with you, to draft the piece of legislation to bring sanctions against South Africa.  And the original bill that was introduced, the very first bill introduced to bring sanctions against South Africa was that bill that came out of that meeting and there were only two sponsors, Ron Dellums and John Conyers initially.
Speaker 1: Now this is something, I just want to chew on this for a minute.  Now this is the black workers of Polaroid making those--they were making the photo IDs for South Africa? (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: No.  They were--they worked in the factory that were making the cameras and et cetera, okay?
Speaker 1: For those photo IDs (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So what they were saying was, "We work for the company that is doing business with South Africa, so we want to end that business."  So they were saying, "Inadvertently, we're participating in this, and they were uncomfortable with that."  So they decided to elevate--escalate their activism and say, "Yeah, while we work for you every day and you know if you're selling cameras that're taking pictures of kids swinging and the family weddings, fine.   But this is also taking pictures of part of a system of oppression of our sisters and brothers in South Africa and that's unacceptable."  So they came down to us to get us to talk about sanction legislation.
Speaker 1: Now that's a story in itself too, I hope somebody--I don't know if anybody has written about it in detail, naming of those people were and what, what caused that kind of--
Speaker 2: No, I think it's a wonderful story--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --heroism, and consciousness, I mean who--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: It's really unbelievable.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and you know like they were just a big--there were a room full of people and tremendous energy.  And Conyers was right there you know he was right there with me.
Speaker 1: Something about John Conyers that--he seems to have a--I don't know, he seems to be very sensitive to things that, similar to yourself.  But other people would (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I appreciated John for that, you know and he's always you know had that, that sixth sense about him.  And 'cause I used to jokingly say whatever I--whatever I put out there on the floor, is gonna get at least get two votes,  (laughter) Ron Dellums and John Conyers.   Well no, Conyers was excellent in--over time, that bill evolved into the disinvestment bill [Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986] because that Polaroid--that whole thing was part of a early arousal of concern that became a movement.  And it was a student movement, a labor union movement, it was a faith based movement, okay, it was--this thing emerged.  Challenging apartheid. Well from the streets, from the communities, from the campuses, from the churches, people was saying disinvestment.  Which meant withdraw all American economic interest from South Africa. That became quote, the radical bill that would never see the light of day.
Story_ID: 672762
Speaker 1: Well finally at some--in 1986, the armed ser- I mean the foreign affairs committee [U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs] actually passed out a bill [Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986] bringing sanctions against South Africa.  And it was a strong bill but it wasn't a disinvestment bill but it had a number of sanctions that were very important. Bill Gray [HistoryMaker William H. Gray, III] played a very significant and vital role in that, Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] played a very significant role in that; he brought the taxing issue into it.  Well anyway, again going back to being faithful and showing up every day, when the bill was to come to the floor for debate, I felt that they ought to also have an opportunity to vote up or down on disinvestment.  So at least let's take the well of the House and be educative.  Be faithful what you believe and show for the fight.  So went to the rules committee [U.S. House Committee on Rules], the rules committee gives the Dellums bill on disinvestment a one hour debate, half an hour for the amendment, half hour opposing the amendment and once that's disposed of, they get back to the committee bill which had eleven hours of general debate.  So we come--the rules committee granted me out of respect, that opportunity.  So I figured maybe if we get 150 votes it will be a moral victory, but at least would give us an opportunity to talk about freeing Mandela [Nelson Mandela], freeing our sisters and brothers, challenging the system of apartheid, from the standpoint of economic disinvestment.   And if we loss, we loss be at least we contributed.  So at the end of the one hour, the chairman of the full committee says, "All time has expired on the amendment offered by the gentleman of California, Mr. Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums].  All in favor signify by saying aye." Well they may have been twelve members of [U.S.] Congress, twelve so people--Democrats on the floor, dozen to two dozen.  So they said, "Ron, we gon' give you, we gon' give you a temporary victory." So everybody goes, "Aye." So whatever twelve or twenty-four people sounded like three hundred, right?  "All opposed?" And there may have been seven or eight Republicans on the floor. "No." (Gesture) "In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it."  "Hey Ron we gave you a moral victory for a minute, at least you won for a minute."  'Cause they know that the Republican member was gonna get up and object to the vote on the grounds that a quorum was not present, and clearly a quorum was not present.  And you have the right to say, "I object to the vote on the quorum--on the grounds of, of the quorum is not present, and I demand a record vote," okay?  Then the bells go off and a record vote, and members come over and vote.  But nobody got up. So then he said, "I said the ayes have it." Nobody said anything.  So all of a sudden here's this drama, now my Democratic colleagues didn't wanna get up and ask for a record vote because they had already, "I'm giving you a moral victory Ron," and nobody would've been comfortable doing that, so the Democrats sat in silence.  The Republican whose job it was to call the vote, decided on his own, Mark Siljander [Mark D. Siljander] of Michigan, to not ask for the vote, so the chair--like he looks around like is somebody crazy, this is not--we supposed to get on with the committee bill for eleven hour, somebody demand a vote.  "The ayes have it, the ayes have it," and the amendment carries.  And by this incredible fluke the Dellums amendment actually passed.
Story_ID: 672763
Speaker 1: Now it was in the nature of a substitute, so as soon as the Dellums amendment passed, the committee bill went out the window, okay?  And everybody is in total consternation because what was not supposed to happen happened.  The Dellums bill passed.  We walked into the well and Mark Siljander [Mark D. Siljander] walks up to me and he said, "Ron [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums], I made you a hero for a minute." He said, "I respect you, I like you, you didn't lie to us and tell us you thought that this was gonna work, you said this was the only hope we had, and I appreciate the integrity of that."  He said, "But this bill is way too radical, nobody is gon' pass a disinvestment bill and my party controls the [U.S.] Senate and it's--it'll never see the light of day, it will die." See ya.  So he got ready to turn and walk away, and I said, "Mark, hold on."  I said, "Tomorrow morning the front page of every newspaper in America is gonna read House [U.S. House of Representatives] passes--okay--sanctions against South Africa.  Every news station tonight and tomorrow and during the rest of the day, House passes historic," okay?  I said, "Now, nothing succeeds like success and there's a movement out there and that movement will be strengthened by the fact that they actually won a battle.  So whatever you think the Senate, the Republican controlled Senate was gonna write, now that this bill is passed, and the movement will be strengthened and greater pressure will come to bear on the Senate, they will pass a bill a lot stronger than you think.  So I may have the last laugh." And he looked at me, his face kind of turned a little red, and that's the way it turned out.  The Senate passes a Senate version of the bill, now when you have a Senate version and a House version; you have to go to conference to reconcile the differences so you send one bill [Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986] to the president.  So my bill passed, I had the right to go to conference with the Senate and negotiate whatever we gon' end up with.  So Senator Lugar--
Speaker 2: Richard Lugar, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay?  And others, they had actually a big meeting, TransAfrica [TransAfrica Forum; TransAfrica] others, Senator Kennedy [Edward M. Kennedy], Dick Lugar, they all came into this one meeting and I'll never forget this, I'd never heard this before.  Senator Lugar said, "Ron, I don't wanna be ham fisted," and I had never heard the word before, that phrase before.  He said, "But Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] is gonna veto any sanctions against South Africa. But the Republican version of the bill that we passed out of the Senate, I can guarantee you override, guarantee.  But if we go to conference with the Dellums bill and change anything, I can't guarantee a veto override but I can guarantee an override of the Senate version.  So everybody went around the room, the activists, labor you know everybody.  I got the message. So at a certain point I got up and I said, "I respect everyone in this room and while deep in my heart on a personal level, I would love to go to conference with the Senate to fight for the integrity of this bill because progressive don't win many fights in this body.  But this not about Ron Dellums, and if I don't--if I go to conference and he override--and he doesn't--if he vetoes and doesn't override, the word will be sent to South Africa that the [U.S.] Congress failed.  That's not a good measure, so I will withdraw my right to go to conference and accept the Senate version of the bill.  And we accepted the Senate version of the bill, Reagan vetoed, they overrode the veto, rest is history.

Story_ID: 672765
Speaker 1: I think when we left off, we--you were nearing retirement from Congress and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what were the events that led up to your retirement?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I had no--I had no thought of retirement, so it wasn't that I was planning to retire.  A family emergency arose that I felt required my presence.  And one of the things that I may have shared with you is that you know politics in many ways is a jealous mistress.  And it takes a great deal of time and energy and more often than not, it takes it from your family.  Well, a health matter emerged in my family that I would like to just keep general.  That I felt required my presence and involvement and I didn't think that I could do that and continue to operate as a member of the United States Congress.  So I decided to retire before the end of my term.  And that was a difficult decision, at one level but at the family level for me it was a easy decision.   It was time to go and try to be--to be a family member and be supportive, and so I left.  And it just happened that a group of young African Americans had put--pulled together an international healthcare company [Healthcare International Management Company].  And they were going to focus in Africa generally, Southern Africa, little more specifically, and South Africa even more specific than that, begin the process.  And what they wanted to do was to help Nelson Mandela and the South Africans keep their commitment to national healthcare.  And so this healthcare management company hired me as their president and I had a Washington [D.C.] presence here and I traveled in and out of South Africa quite frequently.
Story_ID: 672766
Speaker 1: Before we get, get much further in that, I just want to ask you some questions about retirement because--
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: --I know there are--I know when Paul Simon retired from the [U.S.] Senate, in Illinois, he spoke of some outlandish figure that he would have to average to raise every day.  You know he was in the Senate to stay in the Senate.  He said he's spending more time raising money than he was actually doing the ideals thing--programs and ideas and legislation he had in his mind to do, you know.  You couldn't support any you know his real passion because he was raising money and constantly you know doing political you know appearances and things like that.  Did--how did--I mean what are--I mean how did you feel--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That never bothered me.
Speaker 1: --being a politician--
Speaker 2: Number one, it never bothered me because I never had to do that, okay?  Number one, I tried to keep fund raising separate and apart from myself. It never overwhelmed me.  It never was a part of my daily consciousness, I have to raise money, I can say to you very straight forward and very honestly that never occurred to me at all, okay?  People raise funds, I had a finance committee, I never signed any checks, I never engage--you know if--sometimes I had to you know appear at fund raisers but that was never this as you described, that was never overwhelming for me.  My overwhelming reality every day was dealing with issues and fighting the substantive fights.  Now whether that was because I came from and represented what I'd like to believe is a very enlightened intelligent community that didn't require me to engage in constant fundraising.  They sent me there to do battle over major issues and to stand up around those, those issues, that's what I did, that's how I tended to focus.  Now it was interesting because at a certain point, remember there came a time when direct mail became a big issue?  Well a group of left of center people came to me one day and said, "You have a national reputation, you have a national constituency, we think that the direct mailing has been primarily a conservative vehicle for fundraising but we think that people left of center can use it as well, we think you have a national constituency, and we'd like to demonstrate your capacity to raise funds in direct mailing."  Well--and they said, "We'll put up the--you know, first amount of money to test the idea."  Well it actually worked, and I remember there was a article at some point in The New York Times that shocked everybody.  They said Ron Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] is second only to Ted Kennedy [Edward M. Kennedy] in his ability to raise money.  And the most of the--a great deal of that money was raised in direct mail.  Like people would pay their monthly bills and send a monthly check to the Ron Dellums' campaign.  So I never really had to worry about raising funds, it never was an overwhelming thing.  As a matter of fact, I remember one time, it caused my staff to stop for a moment to say (makes sound) I think maybe, I think that's a little beyond the pale.  We were engaging in a conversation about campaign fundraising, and campaign strategy and I stopped everybody.  I was at home in my district with my staff.  And I stopped everybody and I said, "You know I need to know whether I'm winning these elections because of the brilliance of campaign strategy or whether or not I'm winning these elections because people support the record that I'm developing and the reputation that I'm providing them."  I said, "Frankly, I need to know that.  So why don't we not spend any money in this campaign, and let the other person spend money and we'll just run on our record, and not put any campaign funds out there."   Well my staff decided, that well we're not gon' go that far, but I forgot what year, but we did spend the lowest amount of money that we had spent in any reelection campaign because my view was that I should not be winning reelection based on fundraising and campaign strategy if I'm gonna win, I oughta be winning because I'm effectively representing the hopes and dreams and aspirations of my community.  And if I'm not, then they need to elect somebody else.   So fund raising, long story--to make a long story short, fund raising was never something that overwhelmed me, I never engaged in that process--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --directly where it kept me from doing my job.
Speaker 1: All right (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That would not be, that would not be honest if I said that.
Story_ID: 672767
Speaker 1: And the political climate you know in the Gingrich [U.S.] Congress and all of the obstructionism and the impeachment of--well they were getting ready to impeach Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] you know.  I don't know if they had started it in '98 [1998] or, I guess they started it in '99 [1999], the Monica Lewinsky scandal and all of that.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That didn't play a role I guess.
Speaker 2: No. No.  You know there was one point when the you know the Newt Gingrich revolution when Republicans won and they start talking about targeting Democrats, well I told them, I said, "Come to my district, I invite you to come campaign against me."  Now some people may be frightened by that, but I'm not.  And I said, "And I won't spend any money. Come bring a hundred, two--bring everybody you wanna bring, and come out to my district and campaign against me.  And if you win, you win and if I win, I win."  I said, "Because I don't think your politics fit the district that I represent.  So it's not about whether you could raise a lot of money to defeat me because it's not about money in my district."  And I really felt that way and I operated that way.
Story_ID: 672768
Speaker 1: Okay, now how did your constituents react to you retiring?  I mean it was kind of abrupt, right?  They didn't really--
Speaker 2: Yeah it was because as I said, it was personal and I didn't wanna--you know.  I mean there's some things that you know you need to keep personal.  And you know I was living you know a public life as it was, but the decision to leave was a family decision.  A decision I made that dealt with my family.  And it had nothing to do with the rest of my community.  Now was it difficult for me?  Absolutely, did it require my district to deal with special election and you know additional resources? Absolutely.  I remember one--one man actually attacked me.  And he said, "You know you retired and you caused me to spend some money on a special election."  And I said, "Sir, if my arithmetic is correct, this election is gonna cost you about a nickel.  I gave you twenty-seven plus years of my life, if that wasn't worth five cents, then I don't have anything to talk with you about," and walked away from him.  And but you know I mean my district had to find another person and I think they found a wonderful person.  People asked me, they said, "Well, you're leaving, who should represent you, what would in this progressive district, what would be a progressive step?"  I said, "Well in 1970, you elected an African American male feminist."  I said, "A progressive step would be to elect an African American woman progressive."  And I went home and I literally handed the baton to [HistoryMaker] Barbara Lee and said, "This would be an incredible voice to move the ball forward.  And I think history will record that my judge- my decision to endorse her and the community decision to elect her was a good decision."
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you left things in good--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I left things--I think I left things in very good shape, and I'm very proud of having stepped aside for this person.  And you know when I look back on it, there was at some point gonna be a time when I left and while--in my response to your question about thinking about retirement.  I never really thought about it, you know a great deal, except that I didn't wanna be around where they had to--where they had to wheelchair me into the floor to vote.  I didn't want you know, no.  I felt that I needed to stay there as long as I felt that I was making a contribution.  And that I wasn't a burden and it just happened that that was the time to go.  But it was based on personal matters, not my own, my--family matters rather than my own personal decision to leave.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so, so you were dealing with a family crisis and after that was over, you could move and do something else, right?  Which is this--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, no.  I felt that the reason why I left was so that I could be of ongoing support.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That I could not you know--'cause as I have said on more than one occasion, look, politics is a jealous mistress.  It takes, saps energy, okay?  And you know, the--you get up one morning and you realize that you don't know your family.  That you missed many things that your family could talk about things that you don't--you didn't know anything about.  That's very difficult because you're on the floor of [U.S.] Congress or you're trying to save the world and you don't know your own family.  And so they came a time when I needed to say, "Enough of this," if my family needs me at this moment, then I need to leave and be there for my family.  So that was the genesis for my leaving the Congress, it wasn't that I was tired of my job, it wasn't that I had made a decision that it was time to retire.  If I had done that, it would've been the normal course of things, but when I left a little after mid-term, it was because I was dealing with a crisis.
Story_ID: 672769
Speaker 1: So how long was it before you got involved with the healthcare mission in Africa?
Speaker 2: Well right after I left, I signed on, okay?  And so I started traveling in and out of South Africa and as I was moving in South Africa and Southern Africa, it became very, very clear to me that Africa was literally dying of AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome].  Thousands of people dying every day, and I remember I went to my CEO [at Healthcare International Management Company] and I said, "Look at the end of the day, I'm an advocate.  And if we really are here to assist in the healthcare of South Africa and Africa generally, we've gotta focus on AIDS.  Because it's a global pandemic and it is killing thousands of people every day in Africa and there's no way we can get around this.  If you're gonna--if you're gonna set up a health care delivery system in Africa you gotta at some point address the issue of AIDS.  And there're many impoverished countries in Africa that lack the resources and no one should have to die because they happened to be born in a poor country and they can't access the resources that would allow them to gain the treatment for HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] and AIDS."  So I said, "Sir you need to let me go and let me become an advocate for some--for this world doing something about the global nature of AIDS and the global pandemic and the fact that thousands of people are dying every day in Africa and the world is doing nothing about it."  So he let me go and I started to become an advocate, I said first let me learn as much as much as I can learn about HIV and AIDS.  I went to the World Health Organization; I met with activists I met with health providers, et cetera because it was important for me to learn as much as I could about AIDS.  And somewhere along the way, I went to [HistoryMaker] Barbara Lee, the woman who took my place [in the U.S. House of Representatives], and I said, "HIV and AIDS is a major issue. You work the inside and I'll work the outside."  And we can up with a piece of legislation that we called the AIDS Marshall Plan for Africa [World Bank AIDS Marshall Plan Trust Fund Act].  And Barbara Lee introduced it and I went around the country in different places advocating this Marshall Plan for Africa.  And it was based on a very simple idea that we need to bring together resources in order to empower countries to be able to deal with treating and screening HIV and AIDs, okay?
Story_ID: 672770
Speaker 1: Along the way, I thought about this idea that--I'm trying to remember which came first.  I said, "Well if I can go to the private sector and get the private sector to commit some millions of dollars," and I had you know some figure in my head.  That I would try to get commitments from major corporations to put up some money to combat HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] and AIDs [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] as part of the AIDS Marshall Plan [World Bank AIDS Marshall Plan Trust Fund Act].  Then I would go to my colleagues in the [U.S.] Congress and get them to pass a piece of legislation that would begin by equalizing the amount of money that the private sector put forth.  And that would create a global fund that would allow countries in Africa and impoverished countries to be able to access.  So the first corporation I went to was Bristol-Myers Squibb and at the end of my presentation, the guy said, "Have you made this presentation to any other corporations?"  And I said, "No this is the very first one that I've gone to."  And they said, "Well hold on we'd like to get you to come to Princeton, New Jersey and make this presentation to the--our national you know--our main office.  So I--they flew me up to Princeton, New Jersey, and I made the presentation and I remember they said--I was trying to raise five or whatever million.  So they said, "Well we'll put up"--instead of them putting up the five million dollars in the fund, they created a program called Secure the Future and they put up the five million dollars that included South Africa and several other southern African countries.  And they began a program that gave free medicines and treatment to people who were victims of HIV and AIDS.  So it was an experimental program that, that provided these resources free.  That became like the very first step toward some kind of mechanism that would allow free medical services and free medicines to flow.
Story_ID: 672771
Speaker 1: I then one day saw one of my Republican colleagues, this is when the Republicans--I had left the [U.S.] Congress, Republicans were in control, Marvin, Marvin Leach--I mean not Marvin Leach, but Jim Leach of Iowa.  Jim Leach of Iowa. And I saw him one day and he'd made the mistake of asking me what am I doing.  And I stopped and I said, "Africa, HIV [human immunodeficiency virus], AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome]," and I laid the whole thing on him.  Thousands of people dying, you know, people don't have the resources et cetera.  Well to my amazement, a few weeks later, I got this letter from Jim Leach of Iowa, my Republican colleague who was chair of the banking committee [U.S. House Committee on Financial Services]. And he said, "After I thought about our conversation, I knew that you weren't just asking me to co-sponsor [HistoryMaker] Barbara Lee's bill, I'm the chairman of a committee, you are asking me to pass some legislation to get this done.  So I'm accompanying this letter with my attempt at writing a piece of legislation that would create a global trust fund that we would contribute to that would deal with HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis." Trust fund, okay?  And it was--I think his bill called for it being run through the World Bank, I believe, I'm trying to remember.  At any rate, he said, "Give me a--give me your best thinking about it and get back to me."  So I called him back and I said, "I'm very honored that you heard me and I appreciate your effort to creating this global fund," I said, "let me tell you what I would--what I think would be a wonderful thing.   Barbara Lee, a Democrat, Jim Leach of Iowa a Republican, why don't the two of you come together with your best staff and reconcile your bill and her bill and reintroduce the best of both bills on a bipartisan basis? That would be awesome."  Republican chairman and an activist progressive Democrat on this issue. They--he agreed to do it.  And Barbara Lee and Jim Leach met together and they wrote a new bill and they reintroduced it called the Leach--the Leeth--the Leach Lee bill [Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000], which was Jim Leach and Barbara Lee. And that became the precursor to the global trust fund, okay?
Story_ID: 672772
Speaker 1: Then at some point along the way, President Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] appoints me chair of the President's Advisory Council on HIV and AIDS [Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS].  And he told me the reason that he did that was, because up until then there was a great deal of focus on our national program, but I was saying we need to focus on the global nature of this pandemic.  And so he said, "I would like for you to chair the President's Advisory Council on HIV and AIDS and expand that perspective of a global view of the HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] pandemic."
Speaker 2: So this is '99 [1999], 2000?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  And so I took over because I chaired for the last eighteen months of his second term, okay?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And our approach there was the sense of urgency and that we needed to have a global response.  That the United States needed to play a major role, they need to step up and assume a major level of responsibility, to galvanize, to put resources on the table, but to galvanize the global community in a global approach to HIV and AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome].  And that since the statistics in Africa were extraordinary, that we need to focus on that, but that it had the potential in China and India and other places to expand rapidly as well.  We need to get to get on top of this, and at the end of the day, this really is a national security issue.  Well that was our final report and then President Bush [President George Walker Bush] was elected.  My last job was to brief Secretary Tommy Thompson, who Bush appointed as the secretary of Health and Human Services [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services], on the final report of the, President Clinton's Advisory Council on HIV and AIDS.  Make a long story short; Tommy Thompson decides that he felt I should not go and that while he thought President Bush certainly would want to appoint his own chair, he felt that it was important for me to stay on.   And I remember he called me one day and he said, "If your ears were burning on Friday it was because I went to the White House [Washington, D.C.] and told President Bush he needed to reappoint you."  And President Bush reappointed me to the commission, okay?  So I was not only Clinton but--President Clinton but President Bush, as well.  At a certain point--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: This would have been in 2001 I guess--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 672773
Speaker 1: And right around that time, 2001, 2002, Tommy Thompson decides that he was going to make a trip to Africa to look at the impact of HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] on the continent of Africa.  And he asked me to travel with him.
Speaker 2: Now is this your first trip to--this isn't your first trip to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --Africa though?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: But that's his?
Speaker 1: That was his.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so I went with him.  And it was fascinating because, we went to several countries and I remember one point you know we go into different communities, people would ask a lot of different questions or whatever.  So I remember I walked up to him and I said, "Mr. Secretary, when we get on the ground you're gonna be asked questions from a lot of different directions, I got your left flank covered."  And he looked at me and he smiled and I said, "So if the questions come from that perspective, I'll try to field the questions, okay?  I'm there; I'm with you on this trip."  Well in some way that must have endeared us because on the way back, on the plane, he came and he sat down next to me and he said, "If you were me, what would you recommend to the president as to what he should do about the AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency virus] pandemic in Africa and the global pandemic?"  And I look at him and I said, "Sir, you're a Republican, I'm a Democrat, if you stayed in that role and I stayed in my role, I wouldn't tell you what I'm gonna tell you but this has nothing to do with partisanship.  It's life and death, it's a human tragedy and we need to deal with it in that regard.  So I'm gonna be very straight forward and candid with you about what I think you ought to do.  You ought to--," and I laid out a program that I felt that he should communicate to President Bush [President George Walker Bush].  And I said, "He ought to put up several billion dollars, he ought to make a big effort at HIV and AIDS and let the world know that the United States is taking a big leadership role in this regard and make it accessible to countries that need the resources, okay?"  And I said, "Now, do you think that if the press put a microphone in front of Ron Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] and said 'What do you think of President Bush's initiative?' and he did this that I would be critical of it?  Or do you think that if he went to the Congressional Black Caucus and said, 'What do you think about the president's AIDS initiative,' you know its impact, that they would be critical of it?"  He looked at me and he said, "I got you."  I said, "This is beyond partisanship."  I said, "He would be--he would be appreciated for that effort." Well, he's getting ready--if you recall he--he gave his State of the Union--he gave a State of the Union address where he outlined his AIDS initiative, well that day, I get a phone call from Secretary Tommy Thompson.  And he said, "Watch the speech, the shoe's gonna drop." And when I turned on the television that night, with rapt attention.  And President Bush laid out almost verbatim the conversation that we had on that plane, and that became you know their--President Bush's major AIDS initiative and I was very, very appreciative of that.
Story_ID: 672774
Speaker 1: So now this is--from what I understand George W. Bush [President George Walker Bush] of all of the things he did in office that a lot of people don't like, this was something that he did on a scale that's never been done before by anybody.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  It was, it was major. And so when I look back on that moment, you know I mean it's incredible you know I would tell young people.  You never know, just be in the moment and do your job, and the combination of everybody doing their job can, when it all comes together, work.  And I was happy that Secretary Thompson [Tommy Thompson] invited me on the trip, I went with him on that trip, we developed a respectful relationship.  Respectful enough that he asked my, my counsel on what he should tell the president.  I am grateful that he listened, he took it to President Bush, and apparently he was an extraordinary advocate because he got the president to accept it.  And the president stepped forward with a major, major AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] initiative, and that's how that whole thing evolved.  And at the end of the day, when you talk to Bush administration people that's one of the programs with which they have great pride.  I remember Secretary Condoleezza Rice said you know that was a program that they were very proud of.
Speaker 1: Right and it just, I think George W. Bush did--contributed more aid to Africa than any other president before or since.
Speaker 2: It was an amazing effort, absolutely.
Story_ID: 672775
Speaker 1: Now somewhere around this time did you start writing your book?
Speaker 2: Actually I wrote my book right after I left [U.S.] Congress.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my staff guy, Lee Halterman [H. Lee Halterman] and I we just went at it, crash.  And once we started writing, we went at it.  I mean with great intensity and you know we worked hard, we got the outline and we just worked night and day.  And then we just got it done.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  The book is called 'Lying Down with the Lions: A Public Life from the Streets of Oakland to the Halls of Power' [Ronald V. Dellums and H. Lee Halterman].
Speaker 2: Right.  And I just felt that--and my effort in that regard was simply you know I was trying to do several things.  Number one, to say to people you know what is the role of a progressive in the body politic?  You know is just to give speeches, or whatever.  And what I was trying to say was one could be a progressive, one could have principle and one could--one could succeed pragmatically and those things didn't necessarily have to be in conflict with each other.  That you could be a progressive you could be principled and you also could deal with pragmatic issues.  And because I came to the view that people elected me as a progressive person from the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California] and my job was to be true to that advocacy.  So when issues arose, I brought that perspective, you know to the floor.  But at the same time, I realized that 218 people didn't come from Berkeley [California] and fifty-one senators didn't come from Berkeley.  So I had to learn how to work with people from all over the country.  And I remember my colleagues said, "Ron [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] you know you could work with these guys."  And I said, "Look if I had 218 Berkeley votes, it would be my way, but that's not the way.  So I'm gonna fight my fight and if I win, I win, and if you win, you win, but let's figure out how we govern together with each other, it's called democracy."  That's how I approached the job, so that was one thing.  What is the role of a progressive and do you have to be a gadfly or can you be part of it?  And I felt that you know you couldn't--I didn't want to let anybody write me off as a gadfly.  People elected me to take my seat at the table and be part of the process and fight my battles and be part of it, okay?  And I tried to do that with as much integrity as I could.  Well at some point my colleagues elected me chair of the armed services committee [U.S. House Committee on Armed Services] and I never gave up my principles in that regard.  But I realized that I was dealing with 434 other people who were elected the same way I was, and we had to figure out how to govern and ultimately what's in the best interest of the people.
Story_ID: 672776
Speaker 1: Number two, I was trying to say that the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California] gave rise to not just Ron Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] but I think the Bay Area gave rise to a unique level of leadership.  And the reason why I say that is because unlike most other places in the country, if you look, maybe one issue, okay?  In the South maybe it was the Civil Rights Movement in some other place it was the peace movement, but if you look at the Bay Area in the '60s [1960s], virtually every movement emerged almost simultaneously and in very close proximity.  So if you look at the Bay Area, you had the Civil Rights Movement you had the women's liberation movement you had the gay liberation movement, you had the peace movement, you and the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party], the Brown Berets, the Gray Panthers, you know.  You had the environmentalists, you had the consumer movement.  You had all of these movements so you had--you had the socialists, you had the new left, so all of us literally emerged virtually in the same place.  So we had--we were able to hear each other's analysis, we were able to feel each other's pain we were able to--to hear each other's rage, all right?  So that blacks heard whites, whites heard Latinos, Latinos heard you know Asians.   Men--men heard women, gays heard--straights heard gays. We were back and forth so we--so our analysis really became a multi-dimensional analysis, all right?   So we came out of that with this huge political perspective, all right?  So we weren't just civil rights advocates in that one box, we were civil rights advocates, peace advocates, environmentalist you know liberation advocates, blah, blah, blah.  So here was a unique group of people and I wanted to try to make that point that the Bay Area gave rise to a very unique level of leadership.  Because you had so many movements and issues emerging simultaneously and in this very diverse community, we learned how to hear each other and work with each other.  And I think I remember saying to you, and it may be appropriate in this moment.  The day that Mandela came to the Bay Area and he came to the Oakland Coliseum [Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, Oakland, California] where Oakland A's [Oakland Athletics] play baseball, and the place was packed to receive Nelson Mandela who came to the Bay Area and I'm humbled by that.  He said, "I'm coming to your district to thank your constituency for your efforts on our--," I mean how could--it's amazing.  And it was so overwhelming and humbling and I walked out on the stage with Nelson Mandela, fifty some thousand people and he looked out and he saw this diversity that I'm talking about.  He saw every color, every creed, every culture every background out.  And he looked out there and he turned around and he looked at me, and he said, "Ronald, now I better understand you.  I better understand your politics. You represent the human family, you represent the future of South Africa."  If I lived to be a thousand, I would never forget that moment, 'cause he saw what I'm saying to you, he saw that diversity.  He saw the humanity, he saw people who had learned to live with each other through all of this.  And the honor that I had being in the [U.S.] Congress was that this incredible diversity sent a young black man to Washington [D.C.] to represent that diversity.  You know 71 percent white district, 29 percent total non-white, 18 percent African American, 11 percent divided among Latino, Asian community and that was 1970.
Story_ID: 672777
Speaker 1: Now, one of the is- the issues that you addressed in the book ['Lying Down with the Lions: A Public Life from the Streets of Oakland to the Halls of Power,' Ronald V. Dellums and H. Lee Halterman] was the fight against cynicism--the fight against cynicism.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And the fight--and that's in, you know--I think that's appropriate now even more so.  Remember, I served at a time when there was no twenty-four hour news service, there was no Internet, okay?  There was no social media, okay?  We came along at a time when people weren't in--and even then we had to fight cynicism.   What I think I learned from Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], what I think I learned from--from my mother [Willa Terry Dellums], what I think from my family, was change does not--cynics don't change the world.  If you ever been in the room with a cynic, and you planning to do something, the cynic always says, "Well, wait a minute, let me tell you three reasons why that's not gonna work."  Or, "Let me tell you five reasons why that's not gonna work," okay? Cynics don't change the world; cynics give you reasons why you can't do anything.  It's optimists and idealists that change the world, it's people who see the possibilities who change the world.  People who see that things could be better and that you can change things.  Now, 2013, you turn on the television, what are the young people in this generation what are they receiving?  The system's broken, you can't fix it, it's bought and paid for, it's out of your control, there's nothing you can do about it.  Now, if you're inundated with that 24/7, how do you then emerge to really change things when you are constantly bombarded with the notion that it's broken and you can't do anything about it.  Somebody else owns it, you see?  The beauty of our generation, the beauty of the generation that was stimulated by Martin Luther King and others was that we actually thought we could do it.  We not only wanted to change the world, we thought we could change the world.  And that we had a responsibility to try to change the world, so it was out of that hope and that optimism and that fire that we said no, we can change the world, we can do this.  Now what is happening, all day every day, people being inundated with cynicism. Cynicism destroys movement.  Cynicism destroys hope, cynicism in my opinion is a hindrance to change because once you in- once you internalize that cynicism, why try, you can't win anyway.
Story_ID: 672778
Speaker 1: One of the issues that often comes up in discussions with young people today is the disbelief that any of the--what they think of the system even works at all.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: They talk about the new world order, Trilateral Commission--all kinds of conspiracy theories around the way government works that kind of paralyze them so you know.
Speaker 2: Well you know and I appreciate you bringing that up because it goes back to the question of cynicism you know.  You can't do it, all right?  Now I fought hard to not engage in conspiracy theories. And I used to tell people I'm not a good conspiracy theorist because conspiracies give you a reason to not act.  Because the them could be so huge or the they could be so vague or the those could be so amorphous that it gives you an excuse to do nothing, it paralyzes you.  Why try? They're running things. Why try? Those people are in control you know, I mean.  So to me the danger of conspiracy theories and I'm not a, you know, I have great impatience with all of that and it just who I am.  Because I see it as a rationale for not acting you know. It's too big, it too amorphous and--then you could lay down these very specific you know very tightly knit you know logical strategies that say, gee, that makes sense, no wonder we can't change things, all right?  So based on that, you don't try, that's the danger of it, that's number one.  Number two and I would say this, people need to really learn how to the system really operates.  You know it's like some way along the way, I think social studies must've gone out the window, because we don't really know you know.  And I'm going, hey folks, you really need to understand how all this stuff really, really works.  And if you ask me what do I think is the difference between our generation and this generation of young people, I think we really changed the world, we didn't make it perfect, but we went out there to change the world in many ways, we changed the world.  And we did so because we thought it was necessary to do, all right.  One of the two in my opinion, two major differences: when we were out there, we never thought, my friend, we never thought about time, we never stopped to think about time.  We thought we had the luxury of time; we were out there trying to change the world.  But this generation does not have the luxury of time, the world is moving at lightning speed. Changes are taking place with speed that staggers the imagination.  Whether that's in cyberspace, cyber security, technological, you know evolutions, communications, climate change, et cetera, things are moving with great speed.  So we thought we had time, this generation does not have time.  So the urgency is now an important difference of going out there to try to really address the issue that confront us, you don't have time, there's an urgency.
Story_ID: 672779
Speaker 1: Number two, we fought for peace, freedom, justice, equality, respect, all that, because we thought and we said these are the right things to do.  Peace is a superior idea; freedom and justice are the right things to do, the moral thing to do.  This generation has to achieve those objectives and those goals because it's the only thing to do, they have no options.  War is--war is becoming so incredibly expensive in terms of human life and human tragedy, I mean it's becoming so incredibly dangerous that each day as we move forward that becomes less and less of an option.  Sitting back and not addressing the environmental realities that create climate change where today's bread basket could be tomorrow's desert and that changes the power relationships among nation states, that staggers the imagination. What is possible here, okay?  So what I'm saying is that when you put together the urgency of what needs to be done with the imperative that now has to become the challenge for this generation of young people.  And you cannot do it being a cynic; you cannot do it engaging in conspiracy theories that totally paralyze your capacity to act.  Somebody's got to act to preserve the integrity of this environment.  Somebody's--the global community, the young people around the world have gotta come together around the integrity of the economics of, of our world.  We gotta come together around a cyber security so that we don't end up destroying each other, all right, out there.  So there's an urgency here that is totally significant, but you gotta understand how it go.  Now maybe this is--I don't this is romantic and I tell this to young people.  In my humble opinion there is nothing inherent in the system itself that requires you to be a sellout.  There's nothing inherent in the system that requires you to throw away any sense of integrity.  If you do those things, you do those things because you choose to do them, all right?  But people who choose to be there based on their integrity and their principle, I believe can survive.  And, and if you--and if you can't do it on terms that are--that have dignity then why do it anyway?  I remember one guy said to me, "Well I thought you were gon' be, you know, right," it was your conservative position.  Said, "I thought you were gonna you know be over here."  Said, "I'm gonna work hard to defeat you, I'm gonna mobilize as many resources as I possibly can to defeat you."  And I looked at him, and I said, "Sir, that's not a threat, if you mean that I could go home and be with my family like a normal human being and not work seven days a week, you know and have to go through of this, that's not a threat my friend.  Do what you think you need to do, now if you threaten my life or you threaten my family you have my attention at a whole another level, but to threaten my job?"  You know I mean, I think we need to be--and I tell this to young people.  They look at me like wow.  And I said, "I don't--I'm not special, but I just think you have to have--you have to have the courage of your conviction, and if you're gonna go out there and represent, then represent, okay?"  You know, leadership is more than simply taking the pulse of the public, 'cause sometimes the public's opinion is unenlightened and uninformed, so what do you do then?  That means you gotta stand up and assume leadership and be willing to accept the responsibility of that.  If that means you're unelected, what that's the end of the world?  Were you born into the world to be an elected official? No, are there other options in the world that allow you to function as a human being? I think yes.  And so I think that our generation needs to say to this generation of young people, do not buy into the cynicism, do not buy into the conspiracy theories that put you in a position where you're totally paralyzed.  Because your future is at stake, and there is an urgency and there is an imperative that dictate that you get up and deal with it.  Because it's not gonna happen by osmosis.
Story_ID: 672780
Speaker 1: Can you address I think--one thing that Kwame Ture used to always mention was the necessity of organizing.  He said whatever you do, if you're the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], the Republican Party, whatever you're in, you better organize.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And he said--
Speaker 2: And I think that that's right and I think that that's right.  Now young people have a variety of different organizational tools at their disposal that we didn't have.  There're technology that still staggers my imagination, ability to communicate with each other, that is amazing.  I'm not sure from my vantage point whether that capacity is being fully realized as of--as of you know, as of now.  I think there's something to be said to this ability to reach out, but you have to be part--what I felt in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] was real passion, and my hope is that the computer doesn't take away the passion.  And that people still care and feel and some kind of way being distant and viewing the world through a screen, does that make you so detached that you can't see the humanity of the other person or feel the pain of the other person, because you're typing on a screen?  You know there's something to be said of being out there next to you know somebody who doesn't look like you, who feels the same sense of the need to organize and to mobilize, you know together.  Organization is important, this generation just has new tools, better tools in some ways, but they've gotta use that to organize, to mobilize.  But it just can't just be a big one shot kind of, you know, well we had a big fun thing, you know.  Freedom and peace and justice is a--is a daily struggle, it's, it goes on constantly.  You can't just do a dance and say man I did my thing and walk away, you gotta be there.
Story_ID: 672781
Speaker 1: --Issue in Africa.
Speaker 2: Two thousand and four [2004], yeah I was still I know, we were, 2004.
Speaker 1: Were you making you know--were you making progress in that regard in terms of AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency virus] education and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, you know the main thing--the main thing around that time was, was mounting the podium as an advocate, continuing to be out there trying to push the curve you know.  This is a global pandemic, you gotta begin to take a global perspective you know, and you gotta see it in the larger context, okay?  So you know, we continue to be part of that, the--one of the beautiful things about becoming the mayor of Oakland [California] it allowed me to go back to that issue in a different way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay?  Now, I remember on the trip with Secretary Thompson [Tommy Thompson], I forgot what country we were in, but this wonderful minister of health, a woman, she got up in front of this huge crowd and she said, "I got tested."  And this was controversial at that moment, at that time.  And she you know, she went about and she went about in such a wonderful way and I said, "Wow, that's powerful," okay?  Here's this--here's this national public official saying, "I got tested, I know my status, do you know yours," kind of thing.  Well I had no idea that in my future I would become the mayor of Oakland and be able to stand on the steps of the capitol, I mean the steps of city hall [Oakland City Hall, Oakland, California] having put together a public private partnership and became the face of that effort by saying I got tested, and I got tested on the steps of city hall.  So that young people all over the community could see the mayor get tested.  And say and at the end of the day if you know your status we could prevent this disease, okay?  'Cause I never forgot that incredible African woman who was the minister of health.  And I was so impressed with that effort and we put together a program to go all over the city in that regard.  So you know I never stopped trying to work on that issue.
Story_ID: 672782
Speaker 1: Were you drafted to run for mayor of Oakland [California], how did that come about (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was fascinating, people said, "We want you to come home to be the mayor of Oakland."  This started 2005, well in November 2005 I was gonna be seventy years old, as we sit here, I'm seventy-seven years old.  And I'm thinking what does a seventy year old guy need to be the mayor of Oakland?  So I had three responses, no, no and expletive deleted no, okay?  So I said, "I'm honored, I'm humbled, but no, that time in my life is over, I gave my community thirty-one years of my life.  I was on Berkeley City Council for nearly four years; I was a member of [U.S.] Congress for over twenty-seven years, so you know combination thirty-one years of my life, that's enough."  And I never wanted to be in politics, as I said, I wanted to be the black Sigmund Freud, I wanted to bring mental health to the hood.  I had no desire to be an elective office.  Well so people said, "Why don't you just write a letter," and I said, "These folks went out and gathered several thousand signatures in Oakland to try to convince me to come home and be the mayor, at least I owe them the respect of a face to face no."  It would not be me to just write a cold letter and say thanks, but no thanks.  Big mistake, big mistake, 'cause I went out there and, not a press conference, I said, "I'll speak to the community."  Well community people showed up at a community college auditorium, two thousand something people showed up, packed the auditorium, press from one wall to the other, cameras, everybody, standing room only.  And at a certain point you know I said, "Look.  I know what it is you know.  You ask me to run for mayor, you ask me to be the mayor I know what it is to be an elected official.  That would be the easy part, how would I run, what would I try to do, but the hard part is this, I know what it is to lose a family to politics, you know.   I know what it is to get up one morning and three little kids and heading off to Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.] and come home that night and they're grown people."  And I said, "I just left this morning, you were little people, you--, they said, 'Too late man, I'm out of here.'  And it is too late, you can't ever get those years back."  And I said, "So I know what it is to lose a family to politics.  Politics is a jealous mistress, I been blessed with another opportunity, I don't want to blow this on the altar of politics and my wife [Cynthia Lewis Dellums] was on the stage with me.  People started crying 'cause they said, "Ron's getting ready to say no."  I looked at my wife, she started crying, I started crying, the next thing I know this strange voice came out of me, "But if Ron Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] running for mayor gives you hope, let's get on with it," and that's how I got in the race.
Story_ID: 672783
Speaker 1: You know I said--the place went off and I had promised my wife [Cynthia Lewis Dellums], "I'm not gonna do this, trust me," she looked at me like, that wasn't the script. But we, when we looked at each other on the stage, it was almost like we both nonverbally realized that no was not an option in that moment.  That even though that wasn't something that I wanted to do, if there was even the slightest thought that I could be some slight help, who was I? I'm just a guy, who am--who am I to say no to shatter these folks' dreams?  And I didn't think that I was some grandiose guy, it wasn't an ego trip it wasn't personal aggrandizement it wasn't a career move.  I said, "This will haunt me for the rest of my life if I don't do this, I gotta step up."  And that's when I--that's when I did it, all right?  Then--I got ready to walk off the stage, I said, oh my god what have I done, you know, with life?  And we had to pack our house, move back to California, ran a four month campaign, we won the thing, had to get ready--but it was the most difficult and most painful thing I've ever done.  'Cause you know in one sense up until that time you know at least I had the feeling that people held me in some--with some regard being a mayor, (makes sound), that's a tough job.
Speaker 2: Now were you--had you kept up with local Oakland [California] politics you know from a distance?  I mean did you really--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well you know in one sense the answer is yes, the other sense you never quite get totally away, you know, you know what's going on.  And you know what the issues are and when people wanted me to run I kind of--you know you got the feeling you know for what it was.  And like the first year when I was campaigning, 145 murders, overwhelmingly African Americans and Latino young men for the most part.  People dying in drive-by shootings, so you know that crime and violence is a real thing, you know that education is a real thing, you know economic development is a real thing, you know so--
Speaker 2: What was--
Speaker 1: I understood at one level what--you know, yeah.
Speaker 2: So what--so that's part of the story--so Oakland in 2006 you know, it sound like a lot of urban areas of the same kind you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  And that was the point I was gonna make, is that you know it's many, many cities, okay, many, many cities.
Story_ID: 672784
Speaker 1: Now, I can now tell you a story that I could not tell in two thousand and--you know in my sec- in the third and fourth year of my being the mayor.  President Obama's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] elected in 2008, well before that, you know, President Bush [President George Walker Bush] is elected his you know--he's busy looking at the Middle East and you know et cetera. The cities were beginning--the cities were deteriorating.  There was no really heavy commitment there and as our economic started to turn down, we started to find ourselves in a global economic spiral.  It even became worse, as the cities began to lose more and more of its capacity to address its problems.  So here comes the Recovery Act [American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009], what we call the stimulus pro--I'm not talking about the bailout of the banks and that, I'm talking about the jobs, the effort that was focused at the state and city levels.
Speaker 2: Is this the Obama--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: The stimulus.
Speaker 2: --effort (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  One the [U.S.] Congress passed and all right. So President Obama gave the vice president, Joe Biden the stimulus effort.  I served with Biden when we were in the Congress.  So I called him up and I said, "I have a unique approach to stimulus, I'd like to come to Washington [D.C.] to share it with you."  So he had to go out of town on emergency, I think to New York [New York], but he left me with the stimulus czar [Edward Devaney] and the staff people, all the top staff.  And I--and so I said, "Look, I heard President Obama when he talked about stimulus," "Well what did you hear?"  "The President said this has never happened before it may never happen again, this is probably a onetime event," and they said, "You heard him right."  I said, "So your challenge as the Obama administration and my challenge as the Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] administration in Oakland [California] is the same challenge.  How do you take one time money and create long term solution?"  I said, "So I'm here to accept the challenge of trying to figure out how to take one time money create a long term solution.  So I wanna offer Oakland up as a city that will create the model that will allow you to develop national policy and export good ideas to other cities.  We're not New York; we're not Chicago [Illinois], okay?  We don't need billions, although we will take it, but some millions of dollars, we'll create models that you can extrapolate from.  So we gonna--we'll offer that up."  I said, "Number two, in Oakland, we won't engage in a grant writing process, so we'll look at a grant and say okay, how do we write a grant to qualify?"  I said, "I'm gonna bring the community together and we're gonna engage in a problem solving strategy and instead of saying how do we qualify for this grant, we gonna say what--what program--what problem do we wanna solve, and if we send you ten grants, sir you will be able to connect the dots, because those ten grants will be part of a problem solving strategy.  Thirdly, you don't create jobs in a vacuum, jobs are the byproduct of a community's commitment to solve a problem so we're gonna solve problems and that process will create employment, which is what you wanna do.  So we'll get problems solved, we'll get employment, both."  Anyway, and I said, "So we're gonna engage in that collaborative approach." So at a certain point, they said, "You actually think like that?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  They said, "Well I'm a tell you the truth, if you had come like many of the other mayors, I was gonna look at my watch and say you know, 'I have a very important meeting and I'm a have to leave and I'm gon' leave with you with my staff and I'm out of here,' but I'm not going anywhere."  He stood up he shook my hand, and said, "Deal."  Man my heart almost stopped, I said oh my god I got his deal for Oakland, right?  And he said, "But you can't go public to the press with this idea that we have this commitment."  And I said, "Why is that?" He said, "Well, we don't have enough money in case seven hundred other mayors figure out what you figured out, but we're gon' test this idea with you, okay?"
Story_ID: 672785
Speaker 1: And then about five minutes later, they said, "Well which cabinet level person would you like the Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] administration to appoint to oversee Oakland's unique approach to stimulus?"  Whew, I almost had a second heart attack, so I said, "Well I'll go back to Oakland [California] and think about that," I said, "but I'm honored that you asked." I said, "But in this room, off the top, give me Eric Holder [HistoryMaker Eric H. Holder, Jr.]."  Attorney general?  Everybody kind of looked up, they said, "Well we thought you'd say labor or education or you know health, but attorney general how did you get to that?"  I said, "Well public safety is priority one in Oakland; we take a multi-dimensional approach to public safety.  It has an economic dimension, justice dimension, education dimension, health dimension, environmental dimension, et cetera.  So it's in the aggregate of looking at all these dimensions that impact to create public safety issues so we're gonna have to deal with all these issues." I said, "So if we're gonna take a collaborative approach, wouldn't it be amazing if the top cop in America had to put together a task force to oversee what we're trying to do that not only included labor, education and health but also included the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency], Commerce [U.S. Department of Commerce] and other agencies."  He said, "Wow, I get you," okay?  Anyway make a long story short, by that time, we were able to get back and say I would like Eric Holder the attorney general. He was caught up in many other things.  So but what people didn't know was that they gave me HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] and for what Oakland didn't know was that out of HUD we had a person to oversee Oakland's unique approach to stimulus that was a problem solving strategy that generated employment based on a problem solving strategy.  And if you look at the amount of dollars that Oakland got, for a city of little of little four hundred thousand, we were, I think minimally in the top five, maybe higher than that.  But in the top 5 percent of cities in America in terms of per capita dollars that came to the city from the stimulus effort.  And we never wasted the resources, we created employment and we engaged in a problem solving strategy and I thank the Obama administra- on the way out the door, the last thing I did, I came to Washington [D.C.] and I went to the White House and I thanked them for their commitment to Oakland 'cause they maintained the integrity of that commitment during those two years and I said, "I'd like to hope that we maintained the integrity of our handshake agreement to you."  And they kept their agreement and they came to Oakland and--and we used those resources in a very powerful, powerful way.  I just happened to come there as mayor at a time when the local resources were diminishing, but had it not been for the stimulus, we would've been way down the river.
Story_ID: 672786
Speaker 1: So I know, I know crime was a big issue as you just, just referred a few minutes ago.  How did, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: How did that work?  Let me tell you, as I said, the year that I camp- the year that I was campaigning, 2006, if you look at the--at the end of the year, I think it was a 145 murders, that's a lot of people dying.  The year that we left, there were a little over seventy murders.  That's seventy some too many, but that was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --about half, okay?
Speaker 1: Right, that's 50 percent reduction.
Speaker 2: (Gesture) We brought it down.  And if you look at the three--if you look at the last three years, and particularly the last two years, we were able to garner the resources to come in.  For three years running, the crime rate dropped by double digit figures, three consecutive years in a row.  And we developed a program, a comprehensive approach where you know, as far as I'm concerned we're just scratching the surface of it in terms of time.  But we called it PIES, P-I-E-S.
Speaker 1: What does PIES stand for?
Speaker 2: Prevention, Intervention, Enforcement and Sustainability.  So we said if you're gonna solve the problem of crime, you gotta develop prevention programs.  So like an example of that, we got a grant to put street outreach workers on the street, prevention, all right?  To go out there to try to prevent a life of crime, get young people to in school or to training programs to job--all right?  So we had street outreach workers, all right?  So that's one form of prevention.  Intervention, how do you intervene, all right?  One of the--one of the statistics that our police chief gave me which I never forgot; he said, "Remember that 40 to 50 percent of the crime that's committed in Oakland [California] are committed by people reentering Oakland from penal institutions."  So it see--to me you didn't have to be a rocket scientist, if you gon' bring the crime rate, deal with reentry.  People who, you know come to the prison gate they give them two hundred dollars and say see you, and when the two hundred dollars is gone, then there's another crime statistic, okay?  So we said no, how do we engage folks before they come home or how do we engage people reentering in a way that gives them a stake in community, all right?  So that they weren't isolated that they had support services, that they had somebody there willing to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now, now--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --assist them.
Story_ID: 672787
Speaker 1: Now did Oakland [California] make it hard for people returning from prison to get a driver's license and to get--
Speaker 2: We, we--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --social security (unclear) and all that sort of thing--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well we tried--we had to try to deal with that, okay?  So like ban the box, all right?  So you know take--take it off of the public question, have you ever been imprisoned, all right?  We should not--let's stop asking that question.
Speaker 1: You're talking about the box on applications and--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Have you ever been incarcerated, you ever been--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Ban that that box.  We called it ban the box. That question, all right?  So make it easier for people.  Now everybody, you know there are a lot of jobs out there that are not working with kids (laughter) or working with finance--
Speaker 1: So you aren't suggesting that child abusers--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --be hired without knowing who they are (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: You got people that--that fix pot holes, you got people that take care of parks, okay?  You got people that paint signs, you got people that do a variety of different things in the city that are good jobs, that are paying jobs.  Open up the opportunity because if people come home and they have a stake in the community, they're less likely to rob you.  Because now they have a job, now they have support service, now--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So those kinds of jobs you would ban the box, but for another kind of job maybe--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It's a judgment call.
Speaker 1: Yes, depends on how--what kind of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  'Cause you know you can ascertain that information you know when you're interviewing people, okay?  'Cause you know you can talk to people, but see in the past, if that box was checked in, those just went out the window without ever inter- so you never got past just filling out the application.  We said, "No, wait a minute, you gotta be able to move people further down the road, okay?"  And you know with counseling and what have you.  I think that--that putting resources into reentry, very important.  One of the--one of the institutions decided to create a cellblock of guys who shortly getting ready to get out of you know get out of prison.  Maybe if few months from coming out, into one cell--cellblock.  So it created a community of people coming home to Oakland.  So here was a community of people not in many different cellblocks but in one place.
Speaker 1: So like a transition zone.
Speaker 2: Exactly, a transition zone, a sense of community and a place where you could--you could come to begin to make connections on support efforts and support services, all right?  Then you know it was--I come to work sometimes, 'cause our reentry specialist was worked out of the mayor's office.  So you think about somebody coming home from San Quentin [San Quentin State Prison, San Quentin, California] and they come to city hall [Oakland City Hall, Oakland, California], maybe never been to city hall, come to the mayor's office to have an appointment with the reentry specialist who's gonna try to help hook them up, right?  And the mayor walks in, you never met a mayor, and the mayor says, "How can I help you?" You see what I mean?  What I was trying to do was not ego trip, what I was trying to do was to say to them this is important enough that I'm--that this is working out of the mayor's office, it's at that level of significance that--you know so I--sometimes I come in and say, "Are you being helped?" they say, "You already helping, brother," you see what I mean?  So they sensed that there was a caring at a much higher level.
Story_ID: 672788
Speaker 1: So what I'm saying to you is that developing, developing preventive program, developing programs that actually intervene into people's lives to try to help change it.  And then how do you enforce?  We--we came up--we embrace the idea that many people in Oakland [California] embraced which was community policing, okay?  Where you assigned police officers routinely into a neighborhood, so they learn the neighborhood, the neighborhood learn the police officer, you develop communication you develop trust and confidence and accountability, all right?  So you actually working together with each other, community policing.  'Cause police can't do it all by themselves. Then finally, you gotta be able to sustain the effort.  Once you go down that road, you gotta be able to sustain it so that it makes sense.  'Cause you can do it for a little while and then your statistics come down, then you quit doing it, statistics go back up. So you gotta be able to sustain the effort (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I know one of the criticisms of community policing is that--is not sustained financially by the governments.  I mean it's--local or federal--over a period of time, so you may have a change for a period of time, then it'll go back to where it was.  Or departments see it as a flavor of the month and they keep--they go back to what they were doing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But got--you right but you have to have a commitment to it, you have to have a commitment to community policing and because I think that if the community understands that it's a partnership, okay, that it really truly is a--you know, to walk down the street and have a group of young men say to you, "Sir, I never felt as safe as I feel on these streets today."  Or an elderly woman walk up to you and say, "You know, I notice that the police are out there for the first time I can actually walk out my house and walk down the street and feel safe go to the grocery store and feel safe," 'cause then you know your action is very real, okay?  And for people to say I know this person instead of every day you got a new person driving through the community, don't know you.  But it can't be a flavor of the month, okay?  Community policing, policing cannot be seen as some kind of soft on crime approach.  No, it's a different way to patrol, it's a different way to relate, it's a different way to communicate with people.  You put all that together, I'm confident that, that that kind of comprehensive approach ultimately can bring down--bring down crime, but you gotta be willing to deal--look at it across the--across the board.
Speaker 2: Does Oakland still maintain a community policing strategy?
Speaker 1: Now the--I can't answer you on that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't really--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Did it last long, I mean--
Speaker 1: I like to hope that they still have and because the police chief that I inherited, Chief Tucker [Wayne Tucker] was a good guy and he said--I said you know, "Commit to community policing how do, you know, how do I build it?"  And he said, "First of all you gotta have accountability," so we created a--an accountability mechanism so that each region in the city had a captain who was fully accountable for everything that happened in that area, okay?  We called it geographic accountability so we created that, and on that basis, we started to go down the road embracing community policing.  The new police chief Batts [Anthony Batts] came in, he embraced the idea of community policing and it you know it just got stronger. And you know I just been away and you know dealing with my new post-mayor life and so I--I'm not sure.  But I'd like to hope that people are still committed to it because Oakland people were committed to it.
Story_ID: 672789
Speaker 1: Now would you say that crime was a major part--the major issue in Oakland [California] then in terms of--
Speaker 2: I think it still--you know it's a major issue.  Because anytime you have that many people dying, anytime you have that much you know gang violence or drug related violence or people for you know for whatever reason frustrated by what's going on, you know, and, yeah, it's an important issue.  Because in a civilized community, people should not have to fear for their safety, it's just you know civilized society we should not have to be worrying about thinking we are in the wild, Wild West.  So one of the important things is that always has to be priority, because if you can achieve a sense of humanness and peace in the community where people are not worrying about safety you know.  Well to get to that point you gonna solve a lot of problems, but then you can focus your energy on really probing deeply into many other things that improve the quality of life.  But safety, safety is very important.
Story_ID: 672790
Speaker 1: Now did you take a position on gun control, 'cause I know a lot of mayors have a strong position on gun control, even--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --Republican mayors.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  And that goes way back to Congress.  I remember one day, I was on the floor of Congress and I got a note, you may--you may be able to look up the speech.  But I got a note, okay?  That my sister's [Theresa Dellums Simmons] son had been murdered point blank. He worked in a fast food restaurant a guy walked in, the manager had left and so just had the--the guy said, "Take me to the safe," they said, "we don't know--we don't know the safe none of that."  They actually took him, walked him out of the fast food restaurant in a phone booth, trying to get him to you know bully him into telling them where the money was, which he didn't know, and shot him to death, point blank.  I learned that on the floor of the United States Congress that my beautiful, wonderful nephew had been murdered in a senseless robbery.  Point blank range and I remember I gathered myself and, if you paid me a million dollars to tell you what I said, I couldn't tell you.  But I gathered myself to the best of my ability and I walked into the well of the House [U.S. House of Representatives].  And I told my colleagues and I said, "How many of these stories do we have to hear and how many of us have to be personally touched to understand the insanity of this arms buildup that we have?"  And I remember a brother, an actor, an African American guy he came to Washington [D.C.] one day and apparently he was doing this film and he read this speech and he asked me who wrote the speech and I said, "I just got up." And he said (makes sound), okay.  I don't even, you know, I never went back to look at it, it was too painful.  But so I know firsthand. And so I've been out there and that was even before then.  But that just like reinvigorated when I was mayor I stood with the mayor of New York [New York], and the mayor of Chicago [Illinois] and others when we stood you know in strong support of gun control.
Speaker 1: That's Bloomberg [Michael Bloomberg] and Rahm Emanuel, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  When I was mayor, most you know during that, during that period as mayor of Oakland and I stood with then in a press conference on that, and stood shoulder to shoulder and said absolutely.  And no 'cause I not only do I know that from a distance, I know that up close and personal.  What guns, you know, what all that can do. And the sense of empowerment that that gives people to just take lives you know randomly or willy-nilly you know for a few bucks.  No, no.  Again as I said in a civilized society, we gotta move beyond all that (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 672791
Speaker 1: So were you able to have any--pass any legislation in the City of Oakland [California] and that curtailed you know the excess of arms--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, I think Oakland had already done that to the best of their ability, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It--it's still--it's a major, major problem.  There more and more guns in our community.  I was talking with a guy, and I tell you this last--I was talking with a guy a few weeks ago, who told me that he had sat down with some young people who described a program that he called Strap for the Hood [ph.].  Now this was just a few weeks ago, and Strap for the Hood, according to these young people, was gangs wanting to make sure that they had guns readily available to them, okay in convenient places that they knew about all over the hood.  They could be hidden here, hidden there, but people know where they are, okay?  And that interestingly enough according to these young people, these guns were being sold by people from rural and suburban areas and they used the term, who didn't look like me, so you understand what that means.  And who could buy guns in huge numbers and then come into urban areas and sell them at a profit into the hood so that more guns now are proliferated in the hood called Strap for the Hood.  So now you got gun--I know there guns so you come up and stop me, I don't have a gun, but I know where ten guns in this room are. You see what I'm saying?  And--and I thought about that and I said, "Oh my god, that's mind boggling," okay?  So weapons are--I don't know if we'll ever get there, my hope is that we will, you know these--these mass murders they grab--they grab us, but if you think about it, people being murdered every day, one by one, every day.  And if you think 145 murders in this city, two hundred in this city all over the country is like thousands of people being murdered, constantly.  We just get--we just get hit when it comes to the front page, but all the murders that don't reach the front page, every day.
Story_ID: 672792
Speaker 1: Sir, tell us them about how would you like sum- you were mayor of Oakland [California] until--
Speaker 2: January '11 [2011], 2011, so from January '07 [2007] to January '11 [2011] four years.  You know if you ask me you know I think at the end of the day, while difficult, and sometimes painful, I'm a stronger, better person for having done it, I think I know more. Somebody asked me the difference between being in the [U.S.] Congress and being the mayor.  And I said you know I chaired the armed services committee [U.S. House Committee on Armed Services] at one point, I sat on top of three hundred something billion dollars, nuclear weapons, and over the [U.S.] military, walk in the park compared to being a mayor.  Because it's in your face 24/7, it's relentless and in many ways thankless, you know?  Because as the executive, you, you know--there's levels of expectation that are enormous but I think I did the right thing for the right reason.  It wasn't that I thought that I had all the answers or whatever, but people said, "We need you to come and do this," and, as I said, "Who am I to say no if there's anything that I can do to be of, be of help."  I think that we tried some important and significant ideas; I'd like to think that many of them were good ideas that at the end of the day should not be dropped.  And I could walk away feeling that I did my very best.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know there's certainly an intense--four years, right?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  You know when you get up in the morning and somebody calls you and says you know there's been a drive by shooting and X number of people have been killed, or a woman has been murdered in a parking lot or a five year old kid's brains just got blown out.  Or four of your police officers have just been shot to death, you know.  On the one hand, on the other hand you've got several million dollars of deficits, so you gotta terminate the employment of these people; you got to cut this program you gotta do these things.  All of that is very difficult and if you care, you internalize every day of it.  And for me, ter- internalizing everyday of that it just takes a little bit out of you every single day. That was very difficult, very painful.
Story_ID: 672793
Speaker 1: One of the painful stories that I heard, or read about, and you were mayor when this was going on, was the murder of Chauncey Bailey [Chauncey Bailey Jr.] the journalist.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And this is something that all the journalists got excited about it and--he was--he worked at Maynard Institute [Robert C. Maynard Institute for Journalism Education, Oakland, California], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean.  You think about it, here's a guy writing a story and he gets murdered and I knew Chauncey Bailey you know we--you know we talked.  And no, that's--that's very painful because you know you'd like to think that people have you know.  If you've got disagreements, you can have disagreements you know in an open society but to murder you know, no.  Or the--or the young guy who happened to be riding Bay Area Rapid Transit, right, ends up being murdered because the guy made a decision on the spot, to do one thing as opposed to another.  Or somebody decides that they've got turf battles or somebody decides to shoot into a crowd or somebody decides to revenge.  You shot two of my guys; I'm a shoot two of your guys and you know back and forth.  Way too difficult, way too painful, and if you care about human life, each one of those deaths takes something out of you.  Each one of those disappointments takes something out of you. Very, very difficult, and, and sometimes lonely.
Speaker 1: You know that's one--that had something to do with a Muslim--Chauncey Bailey's case, I'm trying--I don't remember all of it.  But had something to do a Muslim bakery [Your Black Muslim Bakery, Oakland, California] or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: They had--he was investigating?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I don't remember all the details now; you know kind of little--little fuzzy but yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That kind of violence, it's very difficult to justify under any circumstances.
Story_ID: 672794
Speaker 1: So what were some of the other issues when you were mayor [of Oakland, California] development wise and housing wise, and what were some of the other big issues other than crime?
Speaker 2: Well as I said crime you deal with all of the issues, all right?  For example, we know and it's not rocket science, we know that if parents have good jobs, that bring in you know a livable wage and that have dignity that household tends to be a healthier household.  In a healthier household kids--children tend to do better in school.  Kids, who do better in school, tend to go further, okay, expand their capabilities.  So it's all connected you know, there's a--there's an ecology of it all.  It all kind of works together you know in that sense.  So place matters, where people live and what happens in their community matters.  If I live in some part of town that allows me to get up and go for a early morning walk or early morning jog and not worry about my safety or be able to engage in physical activity.  Or do I live in a community where there are no bicycles paths or no jogging paths or no opportunities for fitness, okay?  The health of--health of the young people in that community or the health of the adults in that community you know make a difference?  Yeah.  Do I live in a place where air is clearer, that there're lot of trees and open space or do I live in a place close to polluted factories, et cetera, et cetera, what does that do to my health?  Do I live in a place where the schools tend to be funded better, the ratio of teacher to student is--is effective that allows for good learning to take place, or am I operating in an environment that is much more--much more difficult, okay?  The race matters, okay, so we were trying to deal with all these issues, alright?
Story_ID: 672795
Speaker 1: We're trying to deal with housing issues, education issues, health issues--.  Specific example: I learned in the Dellums commission that I chaired looking at the plight of young men of color that the extent to which young people have to leave the school ground for services the higher potential of them not coming back.  If they don't come back, okay, then they're out there and then possibility being able to--being negative connection with the police, negative connection with the police, jail, in jail recidivism, okay.  So we work public private partnerships and we got foundations and others to contribute resources and we put wrap around healthcare services in all the middle schools in Oakland [California] as a three year pilot demonstration.  So you could get all the healthcare services that young people needed in the middle school.  And my hope was that we could demonstrate the val- the validity of these programs and that they would go to all the schools, so that they would be health care wrap around healthcare services, counseling and whatev- at all the schools.
Speaker 2: Now was that an idea that was generated by the, I guess (unclear) sites you were holding I guess (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And so we came up with--that was part of our recommendation, well out in Oakland went out there to get philanthropy and other to actually contribute to making that a reality.  But again we're in an economic environment where it's difficult once the--once those dollars go out the window for community with its own resources to pick up the tab to make this a reality across the con--so you got those kind of issues.  Well then it looks at how does the federal government contribute, so then we looking at (laughter) a time when the federal government is dealing with sequestration rather than problem solving and getting resources into communities to really solve actual problems.  So it's problematic, you see what I'm saying?  So you come with--you come with a good idea and you get people to finance a good idea and you show that a good idea makes sense, and then when those resources are gone, there's not resources to keep the good idea going forward for the health and vitality you know of the community.  So we tried to--we tried to look at the Oak--the Oakland port [Port of Oakland, Oakland, California], one of the fourth largest ports you know in--one of the fourth busiest ports in America we worked to try to get that port modernized.  We saw it as an economic engine that could generate tremendous employment in the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California], okay?  We got people working across the board, we got labor and business to come together and community to come together to write an economic development plan by identifying the economic strengths of our community and identifying new growth areas and bringing them together.  We had a task force that was set up; we had corporate leaders leading and labor union people co-chairing these different committees to set up a structure on how we generate employment.  And there was period and I can't--I can't give you the exact--there was a period at which jobs were being lost in the Bay Area, all around the Bay Area, but in Oakland, we actually gained 5,200 jobs at a time when other, other jurisdictions were actually losing employment, based on this model of expanding our areas of strength and new opportunities.  So what I'm saying to you is that it's possible to solve problems, but you need resources to do it.  And we're in an environment where everybody's looking at each other over you know who's gon' spend what and a very difficult proposition.  So my, my hope is that as the economy turns up--because I think there's the will in Oakland to get it done and I think there's the leadership there to get it done, just need the resources.  And I played a role at a moment when maybe my ability to access the federal government was needed.  So maybe that was a fortuitous role that I was able to play (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 672796
Speaker 1: I get a sense that you're not really satisfied with, with your term as mayor [of Oakland, California] 'cause--I mean or don't feel as--it was really appreciated in the way it should be.  You said earlier it was kind of a thankless job and people's expectations were so high is that why--is that why you didn't run again or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I didn't run again because like I said, the first time I ran, I was seventy years old.  And by the time I'm ready to leave, I'm seventy-five years old, getting ready to be seventy-five.  Well like someone said, why would you want to spend the rest of your seventies under that kind of stress?  No, it wasn't something that I wanted to do, but I stepped up to the plate and I accepted responsibility.  So I ended up doing something for thirty-five years that I never designed my life, and I never planned to do, never planned to be an elected official.  My education was in therapy and mental health, okay?  Under the best of circumstances, doing--going the next four so that you could actually carry out all of your efforts, but that wasn't in the cards for me, I--no, that's a young person's job and it was time for me to--no.  As I said, leading with my heart and not my head, I did the four years, but it didn't make sense for me to try to go for it for eight.  But people wanted me to do it for eight.
Story_ID: 672797
Speaker 1: Since that time, you've been basically consulting, right? Or how would you--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I've been doing--I've been doing some consulting, advising and some teaching, yeah.  And I've not had to do any lobbying at this point, and that's not that if I you know if I have to lobby to my bills, you know depends on what I'm lobbying about you know like some water you don't carry, but.
Speaker 1: Now what's the line of--fine line between lobbying and consulting--
Speaker 2: Well you have to register as a lobbyist, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There're no, there's legal you know.  You have to register as a lobbyist and this is where you actually going to people on somebody else's behalf.  But you know if I'm your lobbyist, I'm going to somebody else on your behalf lobbying for something you want.  If I'm your advisor, you're asking for what I think about something, well Ron [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums], what do you think I ought to do or what do you think is the best approach to this?  Then I can sit down with you and say you know I think you ought to be doing this or you ought to be doing that.  Or this is--this is something, okay?  That's the difference, so you asking for how I think about things my, my intellect my strategic thought from this about things, but you not asking me to go to the other guy and act on your behalf, that's lobbying.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you have to register to do that and I'm not a registered lobbyist.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And it's not that I haven't done that, 'cause I have been a lobbyist.
Story_ID: 672798
Speaker 1: So in the complex we're in today, the congressman--former Congressman Gray [HistoryMaker William H. Gray, III] is here, you're here.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I think Congressman Watt [HistoryMaker Melvin L. Watt] and I don't know how many others, but so--are you more comfortable in Washington, D.C. now than in Oakland [California]?
Speaker 2: Now, that's interesting.  Well, here I have a private life, out there; you don't have much of a private life.  I remember I took my wife [Cynthia Lewis Dellums] out to dinner one night and television crew come in the restaurant, lights on at the table where I'm eating and asked me a question.  And when they left, people said, "Do you have to live like this," and I said yes, they said, "I couldn't do it," okay?  So here people know me but there's you know Congressman Dellums or Mr. Chairman or Mr. Mayor and you could go on.  So I have a private life. And secondly you know wherever my wife and I are, that's home.  You know Oakland is always gon' be home, is always gon' be a place where I was born, always gon' be where family and friends are, but I'm peaceful being here, okay, and opening another chapter in my life.  Out there you know you always gon' be on front street, and you always gon' be, well what do you think about this, what do you think about that?  And you know at some point you need to be able to get off that and do something else.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And here I can teach, I can you know, I can do a number of other things.  And so again you have to remember, my wife and I along with the bank, own the home here when people ask me to come here.  So they have no idea the risk that they were asking me to take to go out there at a time when the bottom was falling out of our economy, okay?  But there is a God so, we were able to maintain it and I've learned at this point a very interesting phrase, happy life--happy wife, happy life.  So I wanted to see my wife smile again and we walked back into our home and we could smile and we could move on in our lives.  And so I am very pleased with where I am now, I did that and I'm, I'm honored that I, that I've done it.  And while it was difficult and sometimes extremely painful, I think I'm a better person for having done it.
Story_ID: 672799
Speaker 1: So sir, when you look back on everything you've done in your career to this point, what are you the most proud of or what do you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Legislatively you know it's like Joe Biden said, "Ron [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums], some people serve in the Congress for a lifetime and never experience what you just experienced tonight," when the Dellums bill [Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986] to bring disinvestment against South Africa actually passed the United States Congress.  Or when Nelson Mandela could embrace me and say, "You gave us hope, you kept us alive;" those are moments that I could never trade.  I remember when I came home from seeing Mandela sworn in as president of South Africa, and I knew that I played some small role in that.  When I went back home, I wherever I went in my district, I thanked my constituency for giving me the opportunity to serve and the opportunity to be part of that.  So you know that to me goes beyond anything else.  What I would like to be known for is that I wasn't about partisanship, that I tried to maintain the integrity of my politics.  I don't remember ever giving a partisan speech on the floor of Congress, I spoke for or against.  I stood for this or against that, but I never gave a Democrat, Republican speech on the floor of Congress.  I was against the MX missile [LGM-118 Peacekeeper], I was for justice, I was against B-2 bomber [Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit] I was for this you know.  I was for bringing, bringing disinvestment you know to South Africa, to bring South Africa to its senses you know, at a very important time, part of bringing justice.  So if there's anything that I'd like to be known for was that I went out there and fought the fight on the merit and on the substance of the issue.  And that I'd like to think that--that I maintained the integrity of who I was.
Story_ID: 672800
Speaker 1: I remember the day that I won--I think--I don't know if I mentioned this to you.  But the day that I became chair of the armed services committee [U.S. House Committee on Armed Services], I appointed a woman staff director of the armed services committee.  Never been done before in history in the House [U.S. House of Representatives] or the [U.S.] Senate, and to my knowledge, never been done again, okay?  I'm proud of that. But I asked her to call all the Republicans to a meeting that day, from the most senior Republican to the most junior Republican.  They all showed up, I walked in the room, I'm the only Democrat in the room, and I had just been elected chairman of the armed services committee.  And I said, "I know you wanna know why I asked you to come," it was that same afternoon.  And I said, "Look, I've been a minority all my life, so being in the majority party of the United State Congress is an aberration.  I have now been elected chairman of the armed services committee and I asked you to come to this room to tell you that I know that you have been a political minority for forty-two years in the United States Congress.  And if I used my leadership role to oppress you as a minority, I would make a mockery of my life; I would be a walking contradiction and a fundamental hypocrite.  So I came here to tell all of you to the most senior to the most junior member that you will be treated with dignity and respect.  I had to scream to be heard when I walked into the Congress.  You would not have to scream to be heard, there will be no secret meeting to which you will not be privy, it's called democracy.  And you will be treated with dignity and you will be treated with respect, if you win, you win, if I win, I win, and we march on."  I said, "I only have two caveats," they said, "What is that?"  I said, "If you shake my hand and say deal and you screw me, it will be the last time you ever shake my hand.  Or don't let me get up in the morning and look at The Washington Post and read that you communicating with me through the newspaper, because I'm here.  I'll meet you anytime anyplace to talk about any issue, are we cool?"  They gave it applause and that's how we went forward, all right?  So that what I try to say to the Republicans was look, I don't have 218 people from Berkeley [California] here.  So I gotta figure out how to deal with you from Bogalusa, Mississippi [sic. Louisiana] and you from Tennessee and you from New York, you from Alabama, you from Denver, Colorado and back and forth.  And I'm prepared to sit down and try to work it out, okay, failure is not an option.  So I'd like to think that that's my legacy, I tried to be honest, I tried to be fair, I tried to be straightforward and I wasn't a hypocrite and I wasn't a contradiction, okay?  Tom Foley, when he was speaker, he came up to me one day and he said, "Ron [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums], you're not gonna believe this, Newt Gingrich and the Republicans stormed into my office; they were angry about how the Rep- the Democrats were treating the Republicans."  And I said, "What's surprising about that?"  And he said, "Because they said you were the epitome of how they thought Democratic leadership ought to treat Republicans by how you treat the Republicans on the armed services committee, with respect, with dignity."  And we'll fight our fights on the substance, but it's not about all this other kind of--alright?  That's the legacy that I would like--that I was there and I'd like to think that I dealt with it clean, that I was straight forward and that I was honest and that I was who I was.  And I think that at the end of the day, I think for the most part my colleagues got that.  Read the last speech that I gave on the floor of Congress.  A Republican wrote me a letter from--I'm thinking if he was from Texas or wherever.  He said that he was on the floor when I gave my last speech to my colleagues and I said, "This is my last speech."  And he wrote me a letter and said, "I've had this speech reprinted and I sent it to every high school in my district as a shining example of democracy."   Now that was a Republican dude.  And I'm the radical guy, the radical black guy from Berkeley.  So it meant that people could understand you at a whole 'nother level if they could sense that you're for real about who you are.
Story_ID: 672801
Speaker 1: I--now this is quick question that just occurred to me, I don't know.  When you think about people who serve in [U.S.] Congress past and--past and present, who do you admire the most?
Speaker 2: That's a hard question 'cause you know I was talking earlier today before this interview.  There's a lot of people that I admire, okay?  You know my colleagues in the black caucus 'cause we were very intimate, we lived and died with each other, we laughed and cried with each other.  They're some great, great people, you know all the way from Charlie Diggs [Charles Diggs], Lou Stokes [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes], Bill Clay [HistoryMaker William Clay, Sr.], Shirley Chisholm, real fighters, you know.  And you know and really you know Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] you know Harlem [New York, New York], strong you know and confident.  Like I said, Shirley Chisholm you know, bantamweight person but tremendous fight you know, Barbara Jordan great power, you know great presence.  So my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus. Barney Frank who just you know retired, my brother from Massachusetts.  I used to come on the floor of Congress just to sit down and listen to Barney Frank speak and listen to him debate.  And I remember one day I told him, 'cause--in fact, when I left, they asked me who would I miss, I think it was The Hill newspaper, one of those Capitol Hill new- and I said Barney Frank he said--and he looked at me in shock and amazement, right?  And I told Barney, I said, "Barney listening to you is like listening to jazz."  And he stopped he said, "Wow, what a fantastic compliment."  I said, "No, man your mind," I said, "it's like you know it's like Charlie Parker man, like it's, it all made sense." But it's like he could think so fast on his feet.  It's like such a brilliant thinker, such a brilliant conceptualizer so you know people like Barney Frank.  You know Pat Schroeder you know, somebody that I miss; we fought many, many battles together.  Man I'm getting old, but there were so many larger than life, a lot of really very dramatic people.  And I think many of us came to Congress not because we became to be politicians, but we got elected to be fighters.  You know we came out of a movement so we sort of represented people's desire to change things, you know what I mean?  So it wasn't personal aggrandizement like man, I'm a congressman.  I'm in the Congress to carry the battle, you see what I mean?  Different point, you see what I'm saying? Very, very different point.  And so now you have so many people who have come--come to Congress who have simply changed the venue of their activism.  So, so they were at home saying, "Zero taxes and little government and by god come hell or high water that's gon' be the way it is."  So you come here, you got gigantic problems, you got poverty, you got hunger, you got inadequate--"No taxes, no government," you go, "wait a minute man.  We got infrastructure, we got bridges falling down," "No taxes, no government." All right.  Instead of saying, "Okay, that speech worked there, now I'm here, I got a responsibility, what's my job?  To keep carrying my, my sign, no taxes, no government or is it to put my sign down and come inside and sit down with everybody else and say okay, let's talk about the agenda and let's figure out together what's ultimately in the best interest of the American people."  How many--how many conversations do you think is taking place now that way?  Not many I don't think.  'Cause you don't see so many people willing to take the risk of governance because sometimes the risk of governance means you get defeated 'cause you take a position that's not popular, but you take a position 'cause you think it's the right to do not the expedient thing to do.  Remember that's what Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] said was what it ultimately is all about.
Speaker 1: That's right.

Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your family I know--I've met your son who's the actor--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know at some point.  Tell us about your children and your family.
Speaker 2: Well, short while ago, my oldest daughter [Pam Dellums] passed away, and she had many you know physical complications.  She was my first born and she passed away, which is not what life's journey is supposed to be about.  You're not supposed outlive your children, your children are supposed to outlive you.  And so she's--she's passed away and she was--she had difficulty in the last few years of her life.  She--she--that line from my daughter to a granddaughter to two great-grandchildren, 'cause her daughter, had two children.  So I have--I actually have two great-grandchildren, okay, which is amazing, okay.  And then my next, my oldest son [Brandy Dellums], he just--he just actually just wrote a book, actually.  A mystery, which is a wonderful book, I have a feeling that that's gonna open the door for him.  And he wrote it very, very well, in fact, I couldn't put it down, and I--a number of people who read it and it's a short book but it's a wonderfully constructed mystery.  But he's a guy that even when I saw him--as a kid, he was interested in movies and all that.  I bought him a camera, and the next thing I knew he had created his own little set of rockets and stuff.  And he was taking pictures of it you know, so I always knew he had this creative, you know side of him.  And so at this stage in his life, he's realizing that just as a quick aside, I remember while back last year, he said, "Hey Pop, in a couple of days I'm gonna be fifty," and that didn't hit me for a minute (laughter). I said, "Wait, wait, wait, what did you just say?"  And he said, "I'm gonna be fifty." And I said how did I get a son fifty, I'm not much older than fifty myself," he said, "No Pop, trust me."  So you know, but he's having a good time in his life, he's a great father and, great husband, just a wonderful guy.  My middle child, my--my tall--the tallest Dellums on the planet is Erik [Erik Dellums], he's the actor.  And he was the one in 'Homicide: Life in the Streets' [sic. 'Homicide: Life on the Street'], which was Baltimore [Maryland].  He still does some acting, in fact he was in an episode in one of the TV series, I forget the name of it.  The one where they flash back to the--the guy was seven years ago and then seven years now; it's like, okay the police commissioner or something like that, and he was in that.  He does some voiceovers and what--so he's still you know active.  And my youngest, my daughter she's--she's also a brilliant writer as well, and she had--she had done some acting, she went to Univ- Erik the actor, he went to Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island].  My daughter, my youngest daughter Piper [Piper Dellums], she went to University of California at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California].  So they're all you know, she has two children and they're in college now, so they're all doing very well.

Speaker 1: So you know, your question, looking back, well I can say this to you that I'd like to hope that, that last breath is, is one that I draw with saying you know, I did my best, I lived my life, I don't need to live one more second, okay?  No regrets, I did some things that I would love to have done differently you know, have changed.  But your hope is that the mistakes you made you learn from the lessons of life.  Some are more painful and more difficult than others, but hopefully you know I liked-I'd like to feel that I lived without, without regret which is not to say that you live a perfect life by no stretch.  But just hopefully that I learned from things and that I'm really mindful of the beauty of the journey of life, and when it's over, it's over.   I don't need to live one more second, you know, and like my son said, "Hey Pop, for a dude from the hood man, you had a good run."  And when I look back on my life and think about the opportunities that have been given me and the blessings that I've had it's been an enormous life.  When I think about the moments in history that I participated in it's almost, it's out of body experience.  If--if there's anything that--if you could go back and I could recalibrate or recalculate, do something different, I would've tried to figure out how to spend more time with my, with my kids.  That time goes by way too quickly. You know, I've walked down the street and I've seen young men and young women with their kids, having fun.  And sometimes I've even, unsolicited, walked up to them and said to them, "This may sound strange from a grey haired old guy, but I envy you, cherish these moments because they go by very quickly."  And they look at me like you know and I say you know, "Thank you for just letting me say that to you," walk away.  So if I could do anything that's, that's what it would be.  Because that time comes and goes and you can never get it back so you have figure out how to live with it to the best of your ability.  And my hope is that in the reconciling of the pluses and the minuses that some kind of way I would at least come out balanced even.  I'm not trying to have plus points and I certainly don't wanna have minus points, but I'd like at least come out even.  And that where the downside of not being there with and for my family when they needed me that maybe I was trying to do something where it was a different level of need that hopefully balances that whole thing out.  So you know I'm--I'm trying to be at peace with all that and I feel that you know at one level as my son said, for a brother from 1014 Wood Street, West Oakland [Oakland, California], I've had an amazing life.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Thank you very much for sharing with us.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
