Speaker 1: Okay, my name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with the HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Ma'am, can you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Trachette Levon Jackson.  T-R-A-C-H-E-T-T-E L-E-V-O-N J-A-C-K-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: And ma'am, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: July 24th, 1972, and I was born in Monroe, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is your title and occupation?
Speaker 2: I am a full professor of mathematics at the University of Michigan, and my occupation is educator, researcher, scholar.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you are uniquely a bio-mathematician, right?
Speaker 2: I am.
Speaker 1: Biology mathematician?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right--
Speaker 1: Alright--
Speaker 2: mathematical biologist.
Speaker 1: --okay, alright (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (laughter)
Speaker 1: --get it right (laughter).  And what it today's date?
Speaker 2: October 22nd, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are in the basement of my home (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five light-weight questions we ask as kind of a warm-up, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have several foods, I guess.  I'm a southern girl at heart so I love southern cooking, and that could be anything that is, you know, deep fried in (laughter) gravy, and all the good stuff that goes with it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I'd say my favorite color is probably mauve, like a deep purple (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: My favorite times of year are spring and fall.  I just think those are the times when the greatest changes happen in terms of the weather and the trees and the--sort of climate changes are beautiful at those two times of the year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Anywhere tropical.  I'm not particular (laughter).  Anywhere with sun and sand and ocean.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: A phrase that I, I sort of always go back to is, "no matter how far the river flows, it never forgets its source," and that kinda has meaning to me because I left home, went to college, and you know, struck out a path for a career for myself, but I never forget where I came from.
Story_ID: 23184
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side but separately so we can keep 'em straight.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Ernestine Jackson, E-R-N-E-S-T-I-N-E, her maiden name was Bernard B-E-R-N-A-R-D, and Jackson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born February 27th, 1954, and she was also born in Monroe, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them, and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Actually, I can't trace them very far back.  I know that her parents also are from the Louisiana area.  That would be my grandmother and grandfather.  My grandmother was a housekeeper maid for white families in the area, and my grandfather was part Indian and part African-American, and my mother is the oldest of eight children.  There--she has five sisters and two brothers.  Or, I'm sorry, four sisters and three brothers, and she's the fifth girl in the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories from that side of the family about--that go back to the--further than your grandparents?
Speaker 2: I did not know my great parent--grandparents on my mother's side, and given my upbringing which wasn't near them, I don't have any, you know, family stories that were sort of passed down, especially from her side of the family.  I just go on the memories that I have, you know, as a child.  And I only actually lived in the same state as them until I was two years old, so it--sort of a little bit of a gap in our history when it comes to that.  But certainly something that, you know, once I have time in my schedule would be wonderful to look into.  You know, trace that lineage back a little further.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So no stories have been passed down about the end of slavery or reconstruction or any of that kind of stuff or--
Speaker 2: No, not really, no.
Speaker 1: --land struggles, or--
Speaker 2: You know, my grandparents did own their own land and their own home, but I don't know how it came into their ownership.  I assume through my great grandparents who, I do believe, were sharecroppers.  But that's the extent of my knowledge of the side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you give us your grandparents' names?
Speaker 2: Mattie B. Bernard and William Bernard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so did your mother grow up in the City of Monroe?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she did.
Speaker 1: And did she have a chance to finish school and go to college herself?
Speaker 2: She did finish high school.  She did not go to college, and I--one story that I've heard from her is that she met my father when she was twelve and he was fourteen and apparently they knew immediately that they would, you know, be married and have a family, and they knew they would be together and that's actually what happened (laughter), so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they met when, okay when she was in--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Very young.
Speaker 1: --yeah, elementary school.  Now, did your mother pursue a vocation?
Speaker 2: Not really, she was--she had children young, she was a mother and homemaker.  When we started getting a little older, she began working in--my father was in the Air Force, so she worked on the Air Force base in some of the commissaries or convenient stores near the base and, you know, she was primarily our mother, you know, homemaker.
Story_ID: 23185
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright, well can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Isaiah Jackson, Jr., I-S-A-I-A-H Jackson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: February 7th, 1952, and he was also born in Monroe, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: So, his parents, my grandparents, are Melissa Jackson and Isaiah Jackson, Sr.  I did have the pleasure of knowing my great grandmother on my dad's side.  Her name was Ella Jackson, and again, I don't know much about their history before, you know, my coming on the scene as her grandchild, but I do know they--the families had very similar--had a lot of similarities.  My father is also the oldest of eight.  They lived on the opposite side of town as my mother and her side of the family, but their families sort of grew up together through school and that kind of thing.  My father, on his side, there are six brothers and two sisters so he's got two sisters and five brothers.  And my grandfather was very, very, very much into baseball at that time.  He was never actually a part of any Negro leagues but he did travel around the Louisiana area playing baseball on an adult team, and was really really interested in his sons picking up that love for baseball as well.  My grandmother worked in the schools for quite a long time, and my great grandmother, I don't know what her--if she had an occupation.  By the time I was born, she was--she was very--she was elderly and--but so very very much involved with her great grandkids and grandkids in terms of sort of--I think she wanted her role to be passing down traditions of cooking and baking and things like that that she has learned and wanted to make sure the children in the family were able to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But she didn't pass down any stories about how she grew up or anything like that?
Speaker 2: You know, she passed away, I think, before I was of age to ask about those things, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your father--did he like finish high school then join the Air Force?
Speaker 2: He did.  He finished high school and he joined the Air Force.  In the Air Force, he was able to take some college classes and get an associate's degree.  He was in the Air Force for a very long time and ended up retiring and we moved to Arizona where he again began working.  He at first worked for the Air Force Base, but not as part of the Air Force.  And then got jobs in the computer industry, and he and my mother raised us sort of off the base in Mesa, Arizona.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So then he retired from the Air Force?
Speaker 2: Em hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Then he started working as a--in the computer-related capacity with the Air Force?
Speaker 2: Em hm.
Story_ID: 23186
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you think about your parents' personalities, their interests, their looks, the mannerisms, and hobbies and everything else, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: You know, that's an interesting question.  I think I have definitely qualities of both of my parents so, when it comes to my father, he was just, you know, a very strong person, highly intelligent, and charismatic, and my mom very strong and spiritual, caring, loving, just, you know, really the kind of woman who would put you at ease when you meet her.  And I think I have qualities that come from both of them.  I think my analytical way of thinking definitely comes from my father, but my personality and my temperament I think comes from my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have siblings?
Speaker 2: I do.  I have two sisters and a brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you name 'em beginning with the oldest I guess?
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, my oldest sister is Angela Shepherd.  Do you need any spellings or anything for those?
Speaker 1: Yes I--I mean really--well, they ask us to do that.
Speaker 2: Okay so, A-N-G-E-L-A and S-H-E-P-H-E-R-D. She's two years older than I am and I am next in the line, and then my younger brother Isaiah Jackson, III, of course named after my father and grandfather, and then my youngest sister is Iesha Jackson, I-E-S-H-A Jackson.
Story_ID: 23187
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: You know, I do.  I have memories very early on, and I say I was probably four--three or four years old, and I remember that my parents got my sister and I a chalkboard and that's probably not what most kids would be excited about, but they got us a chalkboard and my sister being two years older would play school with me, and she was the teacher and we would, you know, write your alphabet and you know, our addition, subtraction on the chalkboard and it wasn't just the two of us.  My parents would get very involved and they would be down on their hands and knees in front of the chalkboard with us.  So I remember very early on without ever being told and it was never said explicitly, but from that memory, I came to understand that education was important and learning was fun, and it was something that my parents thought was valuable to--to sort of lead us in that way, to light that fire in us early I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's interesting, that's--I'm thinking about that now as a good idea for a little kid--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --get him a chalkboard.  And, alright.  Can you describe--you probably grew up in a number of different places, right?  (Unclear)(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous) I did.  We moved every couple of years so we--we weren't very stationary there for a long long time.  We lived in several different places.
Speaker 1: So you were born in Monroe [Louisiana]--
Speaker 2: (No audible response)
Speaker 1: --but--so at age two, you moved on to--
Speaker 2: To Texas was the first place, and we moved to Illinois.  We had a brief stint in Arizona before my father retired and came back years later.  We lived in Maine, we lived in Italy, and then back to the states and back to Arizona.  So, yeah, we moved around quite a bit until my dad retired from the Air Force.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you basically grow up in all these places?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I spent about two years in each one of those places, yeah.  But it was always an interesting experience because my personality--I'm more introverted and sort of what you think--might think of as a shyer child, and having to move every two years was challenging, I mean in terms of making new friends, leaving old ones behind, all of those things.  But on the other hand, I got to see a lot of different things, a lot of different places, a lot of different people.  And I think it helped to shape my views today, you know?  My sons are going to have the luxury of staying in one place for a long time.  But what they don't get is seeing that broader view of the world at a young age that I did, except through our, you know, vacations and that kind of travel.  So I really do value that part of my upbringing, even though at the time, I thought it was challenging.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We always ask this question like this. Can you describe some of the places you lived, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.  I have really, really distinct memories of living in Italy.  And I think because it was just so different from everything else.  So, the Air Force base that my father worked on in Brindisi [Italy] was full.  So we were not able to live on an Air Force base for one of the very first times in my life.  And so we lived in a high rise apartment that wasn't too far from the base and so, seeing these--and I'd never lived in anything like this before--so living in a tall building where, and I went to school where children actually spoke Italian.  I had to go to a separate classroom to, you know, to be able to speak English and they were teaching me Italian.  So, the sounds of, you know, laughter and Italian children and Italian people and the smells of, you know, fresh bread baking all the time and, you know, delicious sauces cooking and all of those things are still pretty vivid images for me.  The marketplaces and all of the things that I was able to see for the first time that just weren't a part of anything that I'd ever experienced, you know, really really did make an impression on me.  I think I still have those strong memories today.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in the other places, did you like live on the base?
Speaker 2: We did.  We lived on Air Force bases.  So it was very cookie-cutter homes all spaced out nicely and other Air Force children and other Air Force families.  So it was a lot of the same.  Everything was very uniform.  And I think that's, you know, part of military upbringing.  You know, there are a lot of--sort of--regulations and restrictions, and houses were kept a certain way and grass cut a certain length (laughter) and all of those kinds of things, so very very similar, uniform upbringing on Air Force bases I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So which one were you at in Texas?
Speaker 2: Oh geez, I don't remember the name of the one in Texas.  I'm sorry, I can (laughter) ask my father the name of the base, but it was in Fort Worth, Texas, and I don't remember the name of the Air Force base.
Speaker 1: What about Illinois:
Speaker 2: Chanute Air Force Base--
Speaker 1: Oh, Chanute, yeah.
Speaker 2: --and then Williams Air Force Base in Arizona.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Maine?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the name of the base in Maine either, but yeah, if you need that information, I can certainly get it --simultaneous
Speaker 1: --I'm asking (unclear) (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --oh, okay (laughter)
Speaker 1: --you know the places--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but, yeah, I'm familiar with Chanute.  At any rate, so you had to make new friends--
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: --all the time.  Now, did this make your nuclear family bond tighter because you had to--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  I think, for my brothers and sisters, we grew up being each other's friends.  I mean that's kind of how we grew up, and I think our parents sort of facilitated that and wanted that kind of really close bond between just our immediate family, and my most vivid memories as a child are, you know, playing with my own brothers and sisters.  Of course, you know, we would make friends with the other kids on the Air Force bases.  They were in the same situations we were.  But then going to public schools and all of that where you interact with people who aren't in your situation, and you have to do that over and over again every couple of years.  That's what I found challenging about growing up, but I definitely think one of the benefits was bonding our immediate family together 'cause we knew we had each other.  Even if we moved, you know, next year, we would still all be together.
Story_ID: 23188
Speaker 1: Okay.  So can you remember when you first had any inkling of becoming a scientist or mathematician?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think--I actually think that was kind of early on as well so, my father [Isaiah Jackson]  was a real sci-fi buff.  I mean science fiction was--he loved science fiction and he sort of shared that love with the family and we would watch science fiction-type movies and 'Star Trek' and all of these things, and not just watch.  We would talk about, you know, the things that we would see, and talk about "Will that really happen in the future?  Will man really do this, and will things really happen this way?"  So he would have conversations with us around those themes, and I very early on sort of fell in love with the whole science but through science fiction.  So I kinda had an inkling that I wanted to do something in that area.  It wasn't until later that I really got, you know, exposed to what that could really mean and actually thought I wanted to be, you know, an astronaut or an aerospace engineer, that kind of thing.  So I think--and that all really stemmed from early childhood, you know, seeing space travel and people going to other planets and looking at the stars and all of those things.  I really think that's where--of course, that's not what I ended up doing, but that's where my original thought for what my life would be came from, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now that I think about it, I mean it's almost like a golden age of science fiction movies when you were comin' along.
Speaker 2: It really was, I think.
Speaker 1: What were you, five when Star Wars came out?
Speaker 2: Ahhh, yeah.  I was about five years old.  And that really captured my attention, you know.  And it was--I think I was about five when that came out, and then all kinds of movies along that line kept coming out.  And so I think it really did shape my thinking as to what was possible, you know.
Speaker 1: As Steven Spielberg was king of Hollywood with (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --'ET' and (simultaneous_
Speaker 2: --absolutely.  'ET', all of those things, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  Now what about teaching?  Now you were in--I guess you must have started school in Illinois?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think I started kindergarten in Illinois, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any special teachers at the primary level that you remember?
Speaker 2: So, I do remember my kindergar--I have, you know, vague (unclear) memories of my kindergarten teacher, and I remember her I think because she was so shocked by me and I didn't understand it.  When we first, you know, went into school, I was excited, you know, never been out of the home and that kind of thing so I was excited to be in school, and they would do these little assessments to see where all of the students were, and they would ask you, "can you count?  Can you Read?"  "And can you do all of these things?"  And I could do all of those things.  And she just thought it was amazing that I was coming in doing all of these things and knowing these things, but I had an older sister and I had a chalkboard at home and all these things, so I didn't think it was so unusual.  So I definitely remember her taking me aside and really wanting to, I think, make sure I was challenged in kindergarten, which was great.  She also noticed that even--I was very good, I could read, I could already do certain mathematical things but I couldn't really cut or color in the lines (laughter) or do some of the more right-brained artistic things.  And one nice thing about her was she wanted me to be balanced; she wanted me to do--be able to do all of these things and explore all of these things.  So even though she knew I was good at certain things, she made sure I went the other direction too, and started making sure I was exposed to some things that I hadn't been exposed to like crafts and other things, which I also thought, you know, was fun and exciting and new for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  So the home chalkboard school really prepared you for--
Speaker 2: It really did.  Absolutely did.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  So you were in Illinois just a couple of years and then you moved on to Arizona and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  A couple of years out here.
Speaker 1: --is there a reason why Arizona was your father's favorite place?
Speaker 2: I don't know if it was more of where they needed him or where he was stationed or if he had much choice.  I do know he had a little bit of choice in moving to Italy.  I think that's one of the places he really wanted to be able to take the family.  He did actually end up being transferred to a couple of places that we didn't go.  So he went to Germany and we stayed in the states and I think that when it came to picking, I think Italy is where he chose.  Everything else I think was sort of where he was kind of assigned or stationed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But there wasn't any particular thing about Arizona that he liked?
Speaker 2: I think, you know I think there are certain things about Arizona that he liked then and still likes now.  There's something so different about desert beauty.  I mean it's--it's, it's just different than anything else on the planet to see some of the things that you can see in Arizona.  I think he was attracted to that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you said your father--was he much of a reader?
Speaker 2: He was.  He loved to read.  Of course, it was along the same lines of, you know, the kinds of things that captured his attention in the big screen.  He liked to read about those things as well.  He also--my father is a very talented man.  He could do almost anything that he put his mind to.  He just decided one--you know he's very into music also.  He decided he wanted to play the guitar, he got a guitar and started playing by ear and just picked up.  Never had a lesson and was amazing.  So he's just a very talented, special person who has those kinds of abilities.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you play any instruments yourself?
Speaker 2: You know I did play the flute for about six or seven years.  Haven't picked it up in a long, long time but yeah, that was the only instrument I attempted to play.  I really enjoyed it, was in--you know--a marching band and a little trio a Woodwind (ph.) trio, and that kinda thing.  But haven't done it in a while.  It's something I think--I keep saying this but--when I have time (laughter) I'll back to some of those old hobbies.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  So you're in--any memories of Maine?
Speaker 2: Maine.  Oh.  I remember, I remember snowmobiling for the first--we got to experience some things--real snow--for the first time.  I definitely remember that.  I was also kinda young then but snowmobiling I remember, eating seafood and that--I think that was a new experience.  The kind of really fresh crab, and lobster, and shrimp and all that stuff that you could get in Maine that was so delicious.  I think that was my first experience with that.  So Maine had a few firsts for me as well.  Real snow, real winter fun kind of things, and the food (laughter) I definitely remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any special teachers or mentors in Maine?
Speaker 2: You know, not that I--not that really, you know, stand out in my memory.
Speaker 1: You would have been about what, eight years old in Maine?
Speaker 2: Ahh, let's see.  Probably.  Probably around that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're gonna pause here.
Speaker 2: Oh.  Okay.
Story_ID: 23189
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how did you spend your time growing up, basically?
Speaker 2: So, I think that a lot of my time growing up was spent with my siblings.  We would, like I said, we played school and things like that, and that was one of the fun things that we did together as a family.  I also have-- loved to read, you know, my entire life.  I also, as a child, loved to read.  Listening to music and my father [Isaiah Jackson] would have us listen to the music of his generation from when he was a teenager and some of the old R&B [rhythm and blues] and Motown and all of that.  So, we had a very lively life to us, but on the outside looking in, you probably would think "that family is so close nit, they need to venture out."  But we, we really enjoyed our time together I think as a family unit. And we did things as a family unit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  So, now, any other stories about Italy before you get you (unclear)
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see--
Speaker 1: --now you were about ten in Italy?
Speaker 2: Ah, no, let's see.  I think I was probably more like six or seven in Italy.
Speaker 1: Oh, six or seven.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a little bit younger in Italy.  Yeah, I think I was around seven in Italy.  My little sister was born there, so--and that was exciting for our family to--and I think it was exciting for me because I was three--around three years old when my brother was born, and I was around seven years old when my baby sister was born.  And so I have very vivid memories of what bringing a new baby into the family was that were much different for a seven year old than a three year old.  So she was, you know, a real joy to bring into the family and that sort was a capstone for our Italy experience, was that our family happened to expand while we were there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so how old were you when your family finally moved back to Arizona for good?
Speaker 2: I was about twelve.  eleven or twelve years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what school did you go to when you came back?
Speaker 2: I went to Powell Junior High [Mesa, Arizona] in seventh grade, so we had--I had just finished sixth grade in Arizona.  The schools had their junior high they called it then.  It might be called middle school now in a lot of places, but it was just seventh and eighth grade.  And then high school was ninth through twelfth.
Story_ID: 23190
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: Mesa High.  Mesa High School.
Speaker 1: Mesa.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Mesa, Arizona.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I take it during all this time, you're making good grades.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was a good student.  I was a very conscientious student and I'd say that, you know, I was definitely getting good grades and I was enjoying what I was doing and it just all seemed to come very easy to me, and I think I see that now, especially being an educator and seeing children my children's age, and there are children who struggle.  And I think that probably just the way that I had been brought up, I always thought learning was fun.  And so I enjoyed it and it was something, you know, I wanted to do.  It was never something I was forced to come home and sit down and do three hours of homework or anything.  It was something I wanted to do.  And I think the fact that I wanted to even go beyond the questions written or the lesson given or the homework assigned and asked, you know, the next question below the surface, you know, also helped me sort of excel and to be a better student.
Speaker 1: Okay now, did your brothers and sisters keep the same kind of pace?
Speaker 2: Um, I'd say I have very intelligent brothers and sisters.,  They all have different academic interests though, even life interests so my brother always--the interesting thing is I was always the, the mathematical thinker, the mathematical one.  All three of them are very good writers.  Very very good writers.  In terms of poetry, in terms of, you know, just prose, they're just very good writers.  And so I think that although our interests are different, our level of pursuing what we love is probably the--about the same.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you were twelve, what's that 1984?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: 1984.  Okay.  Now, did you follow the space program?
Speaker 2: I did.  I did.  And I think, again I was thinking in the back of my mind that's the direction I would end up going, so I did keep tabs of what was going on and I knew what NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] was and (laughter) all of that, even as an eleven, twelve year-old, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now did you--were you interested in planes and the Air Force activities?  'Cause I know on a base, you see all kinds of planes coming--
Speaker 2: You do, and we did.  We got to go--we went to air shows, and my father [Isaiah Jackson] would take us on the base on the weekends and we could see the planes, and it was really really interesting and exciting and I loved seeing like the Blue Angels and all of the stunt flyers and all of those things, so those are also very rich memories for me.
Speaker 1: Now, had your father [Isaiah Jackson] gotten involved in computers by the time that you were--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  By the time I was about that age and moved back to Arizona, he was out of the Air Force and all of that, yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause this is like--the whole computer--computer technology is going through a transition at this period too.  The desktop computers and--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I definitely have some memories of seeing these big machines.  I didn't know what they were (laughter).  They were huge, huge computers.  My father was always interested in computers I think, and leaving the Air Force let him sort of explore all of that.  So yeah, it was a very big time for transition in technology and all of that and even things like video games were coming out.  Those very crude, old Atari games and all of those things were beginning to come out and my father was fascinated by every aspect of the technology behind everything that was sort of beginning to boom.  And actually, yeah, I think around--you asked if I followed the space program, so of course the big thing that happened in the, the '80's [1980's] was the Challenger disaster [Space Shuttle Challenger disaster occurred January 1986 when Space Shuttle Challenger (mission STS-51-L) broke apart 73 seconds into its flight, leading to the deaths of its seven crew members] and I remember that distinctly.  I was in school that morning, and they had brought TV's into the room.  And that was a rare occasion for us anyway.  They brought TV's into the room and everyone was gonna watch the Space Shuttle and so we witnessed the news coverage of what happened, and it was really really shocking and really really heartbreaking.  I remember thinking, you know, prior to the Shuttle's takeoff, you know, McNair's [Ronald E. McNair] on board and he's a physicist and he's an astronaut and he's African American and this is wonderful.  And they had, I think three women on board.  It was just--I was excited at that time.  I think I was probably in eighth grade, and it was just so exciting for me and then so devastating at the same time.  And I definitely remember people who knew that, you know, I was thinking along that line asking me "Do you still think you want to go that route?  Do you still wanna possibly be an astronaut or possibly get involved in the space program?"  And I did.  I still did.  But those are very vivid memories also of, you know, what can just go wrong in those situations.
Story_ID: 23191
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now at school, were you, as a young African American girl interested in math, were you a minority in most settings?
Speaker 2: Ah, yes, definitely.  I definitely was.  Especially--moving into junior high and high school, they place you on tracks, you know, depending on your interest in your--how you assess--your level of assessment.  And so I was put on a track where, you know, I would end up doing the advanced math in high school and I got put on that track early on in junior high, and I was the only African American period (laughter) in that track.  And it's something that I think I got used to early on.  I mean I really did.  And it was sort of--I think I was always accepted in that setting, but it was something that was always in the back of my mind.  "Why am I the only one?" (Laughter) "Why am I the only one?"  You know?
Speaker 1: Did you have any friends that were interested in math?
Speaker 2: African American friends?
Speaker 1: Yes, I guess--
Speaker 2: Em, no, I really didn't.  I really did not.  And that was surprising to me.  Especially because it was something that, you know, I really liked.  And I really thought was fun, and no one else really (laughter) shared that unfortunately (laughter).  And so, I think on one level it made me feel a little different.  Should I like this?  Should I be good at this?  Is this--it's making me different.  It was also one of the things in the back of my mind along with, you know, why am I the only one?  Maybe this isn't, you know, a direction for me.  You know?
Speaker 1: Em Hm.  Made you second-guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it did make me think, re-think and second-guess a little bit.
Speaker 1: Now, what about women?  Were there many women there?
Speaker 2: There were.  There were girls for sure.  In--all the way through in--you know, so we all bonded together and that kinda thing and I think that's what made it--I think that's one of the things that helped me stop second-guessing so much is that there were other female students who were very good, and very interested, and didn't think it was wrong or bad or made them different to be going along this track.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is an age when even white males felt like they were different or nerds or something because they're involved in--
Speaker 2: Right.  I think that is true too.  I think that is true too.  And--so there--especially when you're in high school, junior high, and they're the athletes and they're the cheerleaders, and they're the smart kids and, you know, you kind of get these labels put on you, and it was hard to be, you know you might think, "Oh, you know, I'm kind of athletic, or I'm--just 'cause I, you know, do math doesn't mean--" so it was hard to be more than one thing.  And people put those labels on you, put you in a bucket and that's where you were.  And once you were labeled one of the smart kinds, that's kind of, you know, that label.
Story_ID: 23192
Speaker 1: Now, you went to Mesa High School [Mesa, Arizona].
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Did they teach you all the way through to calculus?
Speaker 2: They did.  They did.  So they had a very good college prep advance placement program.  So we had--starting with--in your sophomore year you could take college preparatory English classes, biology, chemistry, you could be on the math track that led you to calculus by the time you finished, there was also advance prep and college prep chemistry, or I'm sorry, physics and AP [Advanced Placement] physics, so classes that get you ready for the AP exams.  So all of those offerings were there, which was really really great.  And you saw the same faces (laughter) in those classes so that community became, you know, sort of a community.  You knew--I would see that same group of people next year in the next class, and all of that kinda thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were there any special teachers or mentors in this--during this period?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I remember several special teachers, so Mrs.--my special English teachers I'd say were Mrs. Dowrimple (ph.) and Mrs. Fitzgerald.  They were really great at exposing students, especially like me, who--I loved to read, but I was very limited in what I had been reading and what I knew about.  So they opened my eyes to other types of literature, which was wonderful.  And my first experience with [William] Shakespeare.  My first real experiences with writing my own poetry, which I learned that, you know, I always thought "Oh, that's what my brothers and sister do, they write (laughter).  I'm not good at it."  But when I was introduced to it at that level in high school by these two great teachers, I realized, you know, it's something that I have a little bit of a knack for too and I really like being able to express myself in written word.  So I really credit my two high school English teachers for that.  I also had a great physics and--the calculus teacher I had, it was the same person for physics and calculus, and he never acted like I was different.  He never acted like--it was just, you know, you're one of my students, you're one of my good students and you belong here.  And he was very supportive and encouraging, which was wonderful, and so his name was Mr. Steiner, and I just have--I think he's one of the reasons I thought that I could go forward maybe in math.  I hadn't gotten to that point of thinking I would ever be a math major or anything, but he helped me to realize that I really loved calculus and I loved what I was learning and that maybe if there was something after calculus, perhaps maybe I could continue on, you know.  So I don't think I'd made the leap to thinking I would ever major in math or be a mathematician, but he opened my eyes to the fact that there could be more along that direction.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were you involved in any summer programs?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So the summer after my junior year of high school, I went to a program at Arizona State University [Glendale, Arizona] called the Math Science Honors Program at that time.  So I'd heard about it through a counselor at my school, and it was kind of labeled a math summer camp.  And so a lot of students were not interested (laugher), but I was.  So I applied to go this program.  It was a five-week residential program and, I didn't even know this until I got there, but everybody there was sort of like me, under-represented minority who was very very good at math and had an interest in it.  And so I think that was my first experienced of being in a room full of people who, you know, had brown skin and who liked talking about math and doing math problems and all of that, and we formed a really close-knit community and tight-knit bond over that five weeks.  And the following summer, I came back and I did it--I took another math course on campus with that group--with that summer program, and I think this is when it started percolating in my mind that mathematics could be a direction.  So I hadn't made the jump yet, but I was--it was starting to--like the ember was lit and it was just smoldering and I was, it was gonna become a full passion and fire, but it hadn't gotten there yet.  It was just the beginning of that I think, based on being involved in the summer program.
Speaker 1: Was there something else that you were interested in, maybe physics or some other (unclear)
Speaker 2: Yes.  So I thought I was gonna be an aerospace engineer and that was--my declared major was engineering, I had put it down on paper, I was bound and determined (laughter) to do that.  And I--even, I think it was probably halfway through my freshman year, maybe even three-quarters of the way through my freshman year, before I was called into the office of the director of the summer program.  So I ended up going to Arizona State University primarily because I felt so comfortable with this group of students that I had met in the summer program.  The other students at my high school were off to, you know, Cal Tech [California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California] and the University of Chicago [Illinois] and Stanford [University] and all these places, and I went to Arizona State University and I was happy and excited to be going there and I thought this was the place for me, honestly.  And even though my direction completely switched from thinking I was going to be an engineer to being invited to be a mathematician, and I put it that was because I really felt like I was invited by the director of this program.  He called me into his office, he said "Why are you majoring in engineering?"  And so I had to say "Well, I've always known I was gonna do that."  I really didn't have a great answer other than that's always what I knew I was gonna do.  And he said, "You know, you are--you're talented, you have a great mathematical aptitude.  I think you like math, and you could even love it, you know.  Why don't you think about this?"  And so, to me, that was my invitation to think about making that change and I ended up making that change.
Speaker 1: Okay now.  What was his name?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: That was Joaquin Bustoz
Speaker 1: Okay.  Joaquin Bustoz.  We have his name here.  Now, is there anything significant about high school graduation, when you graduated from Mesa [high school]?
Speaker 2: Ah.
Speaker 1: Were you involved in any other--in clubs and groups in high school and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: So, yeah, to some extent.  I was a part of the band for a while in high school and that kind of thing, and a part of the year book staff, and some of those kinds of extra-curricula's and the German club and things like that.  And when I graduated, let's see.  At that time--so Arizona would offer scholarships to every student who was in the top two percent or something like that of their graduating class.  So you could get a scholarship to any of the Arizona schools.  And so, in my school, we had a very--actually a very large high school.  I think my graduating class was probably over 800 students and so in order to determine--I was waiting on pens and needles to find out if, you know, I would get this scholarship so I could go to any Arizona school.  And so my final semester of my senior year, I found out that I was actually in the academic top twenty, which meant that I was one of the twenty students out of over 800 who had the highest GPAs, which meant that I would definitely get the scholarship, which was really great for a number of reasons.  The biggest reason being my parents weren't gonna be able to afford to send me to, you know, a college out of state.  And, you know, this took a huge financial burden off the family.
Story_ID: 23193
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so Arizona State [University].  This is 19--
Speaker 2: So I graduated in 1990.
Speaker 1: --1990.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Em hm.
Speaker 1: And, okay, so you're at Arizona State [University] and you've declared math as a major?
Speaker 2: Probably closer to the end of my freshman year--
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right.
Speaker 2: --beginning yeah.  My sophomore year.
Speaker 1: You had a conversation with Dr. [Joaquin] Bustoz.
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Right.  The summer program was called SUMS .  I just saw that. (Laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --I didn't realize that they had (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) they changed the name to SUMS a few years in, so when I went, it was just Math Science Honors program and then it became so big that they really really expanded it and then went out to the Native American reservations and brought in all kinds of students from the inner-cities and Phoenix and they changed the name to the SUMS Institute, so--Strengthening Understanding of Mathematical Sciences [sic, Strengthening Understanding of Mathematics and Science] I think, is the acronym for SUMS.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  I just saw that and I said, "Oh."
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Speaker 1: Okay. So Arizona State.  Now Arizona State, I found out in reading this outline--this is the largest university in terms of student population (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Student body--
Speaker 1: --in the United States.
Speaker 2: --yeah.  And at that time in the '90's [1990's], it was still, you know, top five.  Maybe in top three.  So it's always been a very big school in terms of population.  But to me it was familiar.  It was familiar.  I had lived on campus as a junior in high school and after my senior year, and it was--and it was easy to find a community there for me, even though it was so large.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So who were some of your mentors at Arizona State?
Speaker 2: So definitely Joaquin Bustoz is probably the--has been the greatest mentor of my life because I credit him for helping me to make that change into mathematics and not only that, through his program, the program he designed, the SUMS Institute, he was able to offer all kinds of support to the students who participated in that program.  Financial support, academic support, and just the fact that he was able to bring students together who were under-represented, and put us together and give us a sort of a critical mass, give us an opportunity to build a community, he provided all of that opportunity for us and it really made a huge difference and a huge impact on me.  So I think he's probably one of the greatest mentors of my life.  Also while there, I met a woman named Betty Tang and she was the first person I actually did research with and she helped me get interested in mathematics as applied to biology, so we worked on a project together that looked at how bacteria would grow in your body and so it was an abstraction of that, so they can't really study what's going on in your stomach maybe, but they can put bacteria in a tank that has flows like your stomach, and so we developed a mathematical model of that kind of system to see what kinds of interactions the bacteria would have and that kind of thing, and I found a way of making mathematics applicable to, you know, people outside of math.  And that was very stimulating and exciting for me.  So she is the reason I published my first paper, working with her.  So she's also a really great influence on the direction that my career ended up taking.  And then there were other teachers who just, you know, were very good good teachers, and (unclear) Eric Kostelich was one, and he taught my--sort of a dynamical systems course and he made it interesting and challenging and fun, and it really awakened me to that type of mathematics, and I kinda knew that's the kinda thing I would like to continue on with.  So there's been a few great great people that I met along the lines of my studies at Arizona State.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did anything significant happen at Arizona State while you were there otherwise, other than the work?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see.  So I was there from '90'[1990] to '94' [1994] and I think the most significant things for me were really seeing that, number one, mathematics could be more--that I could do more with mathematics than just teach, so I had always had in the back of my mind, "Well, you know, if I get a mathematical degree, what am I gonna do, teach high school?  Is that my only option?  You know, are there other options?"  And I think my eyes were opened to many many other options while I was there.  And I think my eyes were also opened to finally not being the only one.  And I didn't have to ask that question, "Why am I the only one?"  Because I wasn't.  There was a whole group and community of students like me there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  Now, in terms of applied mathematics, I guess a lot of us--I think we think of a mathematician, we think of someone who can, who knows the ultimate calculations, but we are not sure.  I mean if someone--we know that a chemist or a biologist or a physicist.  A physicist is an excellent mathematician.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: You know, it's applying math to solving problems.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So this was your first inkling that you could actually--
Speaker 2: Do something like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it really was.  So it was, I guess the real--a real significant thing that happened while I was an undergraduate at Arizona State was I saw flyers posted around the Math Department one day, and the flyers said someone was coming to give a talk.  And the title of his talk was 'How Did The Leopard Get Its Spots?'  And I said, "Well, this is the Math Department, this isn't biology, this isn't ecology.  How is this mathematician gonna tell me how the leopard got its spots?'  And I was intrigued.  And I went to this person's talk, even though he was an undergraduate and he talked about mathematics that I did not understand.  I got the idea--the main idea of his talk was you can use mathematics in these really unintuitive, important, exciting ways.  And so he went through the design of a mathematical model that showed that you can get these patterns of spots and stripes in every pattern that you see in nature.  And there was a mathematical underpinning and basis for the possibility of those kinds of patterns.  So I knew at that point--I had already worked on this, you know, little project about bacteria, but this was the big awakening for me that mathematics can do so much more than I'd ever dreamed.  And I think that was probably the point where I knew I was gonna go into--I had already changed my major to math, but at this point I think I knew I was gonna go into mathematics as it applies to biology for the direction of my future work.
Speaker 1: Just for the record now, how--okay, we'll pause here.  Let's pause here.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 23194
Speaker 1: Okay, now, can you kinda reassemble what James Murray was saying about the leopard spots?
Speaker 2: So, yeah.  He was talking about a touring mechanism.  So, it's an idea of if, in the absence of diffusion or spreading, you know, you might get a steady--say you would think chemicals would uniformly distribute in space, but if you add in diffusion, which is supposed to make things spread more, a counter-intuitive thing happens.  And that is that you can actually get these patterns in space, so these chemicals could set up patterns and the chemicals we're talking about for the development of pigment could set up patterns as the organism is developing.  And those patterns are where cells migrate to and where pigment ends up staying.  So you can get these patterns of spots, or stripes, or combinations of the two, and all of those things.  And he sort of had an underlying mathematical theory of when you would get spots versus stripes and what kind of geometries were conducive to these kinds of different patterns, and it was very exciting and interesting.  And even though I didn't understand much of the talk at the time, it later--you know, later I actually went to the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] where he was, he became my PhD advisor, and he really had a significant influence on me and my career.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you graduated in 1994, right?  From Arizona State [University]?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Is there anything significant about the graduation that we need--well let me just say that you graduated summa cum laude, so you don't have to say it.  And then--well, okay, anything else?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, I--graduation from college was really special for me and for my family.  I was the first one in our immediate family to do that with an actual four-year bachelor's degree, so it was--it was really really an exciting time and it meant a lot to have my family support.  And I think it was a time where I really really felt how proud my parents were of me.  So it was a special special time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, in college now, did math consume like most of your time in school?
Speaker 2: I think it did, I think it did.  We actually had what's--we called it a math house.  It was a part of the SUMS [Strengthening Understanding in Mathematics and Science] Institute that was right off campus and it was a little house that we could all go into and use it to study, and meet up and discuss problems and the night before an exam, we would all be there, we'd be up on the chalk boards and we'd be writing out problems, and it was a really big part of my life.  So I also, you know, worked as a tutor, I went out to Native American reservations and helped middle school children sort of with their math and tried to also help them develop an idea about math beyond the math they were doing.  So I did a lot of outreach in terms of--in the communities around Arizona State.  I did a lot of math just on campus in the course of my own studies, but also kind of for fun and to be with my friends in this community of people that I had.  So I would say that it was a huge part of my life.  It kinda consumed quite a bit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In terms of the Native Americans, I was reading in the outlines the person who prepared this pointed out that that part of 'Arizona used to be occupied by an ancient group of Indians called the Hohokam?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: They built canals and had intricate engineering projects.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's fascinating.  It's fascinating what was done and I think it's fascinating to look back at, you know, the history of the surroundings in Arizona and see how it relates to, you know, the present.  And the present being, you know, when I was there in the early '90's [1990's] was that a lot of Native Americans weren't in touch with how much math and engineering played a role in their heritage, and so we went and we tried to talk about some of these things to these young students and-- just to get them thinking that they could do math, and that they could be an engineer or a mathematician or a, you know, a scientist.  And spark that enthusiasm in them.
Story_ID: 23195
Speaker 1: Okay.  So after graduation, you go to the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington].  That's where Dr. James Murray is.
Speaker 2: Em hm.
Speaker 1: Now he's from Britain, right?
Speaker 2: He is.  Yeah, yeah.  He's from--he's actually Scottish.  But yeah.  He was at Oxford [University] for a long time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you get more immersed into the application of mathematics to biological sciences?
Speaker 2: I did.  So I was actually in an applied math department.  This is the first time I had ever been in a place where mathematics and applied mathematics were completely separate.  They were in different buildings, different department chairs, everything was completely separate from the mathematics department.  And so that meant that--it meant sort of your application was just as important so--and my application of course was biology so I got to delve into understanding, you know, cell biology, molecular biology, and my interests eventually led me to cancer so--learning about cancer biology.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now most of the scientists we talk to, when they go to graduate school, they don't really spend a lot of time on the Master's degree, I mean in terms of pausing to celebrate.  They just keep right on going.  Is that true, basically?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that's basically true.  And so--and that's kind of true in this situation as well.  So I have a Master's degree but it's sort of what happens after, you know, your two years of course work.  You kinda are given a Master's degree (laughter), but it was never a stopping point for me.  It was always, "okay, I guess I completed some level of requirements, but there's my goal down the road" (laughter).  So I always knew my goals a PhD and I never stopped to really pause at that Master's level.
Speaker 1: So what would have happened had you stopped and said, "Oh a Master's degree is fine?"  What would have been your options?
Speaker 2: That's interesting.  So I think at that point, I had a mathematical skill set and tool box that could have led me in a couple of different directions.  I certainly could have gone into education, in teaching, I could have gone back to sort of Arizona and sort of continued along the lines of the types of educational activities I was doing in teaching and that kind of thing.  But I also think that I could have probably gone into industry or even a government lob at that time because the mathematical skills that we were sort of learning and given through the course of our training at the University of Washington were pretty foundational, fundamental skills that could be universally applied in a lot of different areas.  So I think I would have some options.
Story_ID: 23196
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I hear that you published a paper, your first professional publication, in 1997 called Population Dynamics and Competition in Chemostat Models with Adaptive Nutrient Uptake.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  So this is the work that I started as an undergraduate at Arizona State University with Betty Tang, and it was sort of looking at a chemostat model of bacteria which was designed to, you know, look at-- sort of resemble what would happen in the stomach or in the gut in terms of bacteria uptake.  And so we did some different nutrient applications to see how the bacteria would survive and how they would thrive if they had different conditions within that setting, and that was my first publication.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were you then--like you're measuring the--you're trying to come up with a--I guess a rate of growth of bacteria?
Speaker 2: Right.  So one of the inputs into the model is how bacteria--the rate of bacteria growth, but there's all kinds of influences on that rate of growth.  And one thing is, you know, the space they have available, the amount of nutrients they have available, how many other bacteria are around them, so competition--all of these things feed into that eventual growth rate.  And so we were track and time the population's changes based on all of these influences on how the rate of change is affected.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  I know I've heard it said that some of these modern anti-bacterial applica--sprays and--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --and so (unclear) and all of--
Speaker 1: --yeah, create more space by killing general bacteria off, create more space for the more resistant bacteria --(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --that's actually--it is true.  So definitely they're a good thing to have, you know, these anti-bacteria's, but not to be used without caution I guess, because you are killing general bacteria and not all bacteria is bad.  There are some good bacteria's that even in your stomach, in the lining of your stomach and intestines, some of the bacteria that's there is good.  So you don't wanna kill off everything.  It's just certain bacteria's that are the dangerous ones that you don't need in your system.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Okay, so I guess--you finished your PhD and your work in '97' [1997]?  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Ah, '98' [1998].  I got my PhD in '98' [1998].
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) '98' [1998]?  Okay.  And tell us about your dissertation.  We have a title here.  I guess--this is the Theoretical Analysis of Conjugate Localization in Two-Step Cancer Chemotherapy, with a brief yet detailed description of how tumors can form an afflicted--in an afflicted person's body.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So my dissertation came about in actually kind of a strange way.  I was a graduate student looking around for different topics that I thought would be interesting to work on.  I knew I wanted to do something in cancer, and so I went and researched and looked around the Seattle [Washington] area to see who's doing cancer chemotherapy, who's doing something that might be amenable to mathematical modeling, and I found a group at a bio--pharmaceutical company, I guess.  And they were sort of developing these new drugs, a new drug targeting strategy for cancer chemotherapy, and they came in and the lead guy's name was Peter Center.  He came in and gave a talk in our Applied Math department, and immediately I knew, based on what he had said, that this is something that I thought I could use my skills as a mathematical model or mathematician, to sort of address.  So we started collaborating on trying to figure out the best way to administer these targeting strategies.  So what these are is--so traditional chemotherapy, you know, you inject some drug into your body.  This drug is supposed to act on cells that are rapidly dividing like cancer cells would be, but they cannot distinguish if those cells that are rapidly dividing are your hair cells or other cells in your body.  So it destroys cells in general.  The idea behind the mechanisms of the therapies they wanted to give were to target--sort of this magic bullet idea, of targeting the cancer cells specifically, and leaving all the other cells alone.  So what they wanted to do was give--first inject the patient with a pro drug, a drug that's not harmful to any other cells in the body, but that drug would find tumor cells.  So it would bind particular markers that only exist on tumor cells.  And then they would give an enzyme, again, completely non-toxic enzyme, that only when it found the pro drug would catalyze a reaction that made a drug.  So the idea is that the pro drug finds the cancer and marks it, highlights it in red, and then the enzyme goes directly there and only there does it catalyze a reaction that makes drug.  So you make drug at a tumor site instead of injecting drug throughout the body.  So we developed an extensive set of equations to model the delivery of these to anti-cancer agents, the reaction that makes the drug, the binding and targeting of the tumor cells, and we were able to come up with some special optimal situations where you get more drug created in the tumor than you do in the blood, and we could say what kinds of treatment strategies, you know, how much should you give, how long should you wait to give the next dose, all of those kinds of things based on these mathematical models.  So we could make predictions about those kinds of things.  So that was kinda the crux of my dissertation was modeling this new therapy for cancer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So you received your PhD in 1998, right?
Speaker 2: Em hm.
Speaker 1: And now, did you do a--your advisor was James Murray?
Speaker 2: He was, he was, yeah.
Story_ID: 23197
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  So you did a Postdoc at the University of Minnesota, right?
Speaker 2: I did.  So (simultaneous) yeah--
Speaker 1: --and yeah.  Tell us about that and will this extend what you were doing--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So this was very interesting.  So right around the time, 1996, 1997, 1998, this whole idea of mathematical biology was really starting to take shape and to boom as its own sub-discipline of applied mathematics.  So in 1998, the year I graduated from the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington], the IMA which is the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications at the University of Minnesota, was hosting its very first full emphasis year on mathematical biology.  So these mathematical institutes, I think there are probably around seven of them, they're funded by the government and they're at different places throughout the country.  And this one in Minnesota had the very first year focusing on math biology.  So they invited a lot of Postdocs to come and spend the full year there and, during the year, they invited all of the key players, just the world-renown people in math biology, to come and give talks, and lead seminars, and interact with the Postdocs and that kinda thing.  So this was an amazing networking year for me.  I got to meet everyone in the field of math biology, I got to see exciting new applications that I hadn't heard of before, or meet the people that I'd been reading about and all of that kind of thing.  So I did extend some of the work that I did on my dissertation but I also made new collaborations and was able to start new projects that would lead me to being an independent researcher.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you got married in 1998 too.
Speaker 2: I did.  Right after (laughter)--right after earning my PhD.  Just a few months later.
Speaker 1: Okay now did you meet your husband at the University of Arizona or--
Speaker 2: Arizona State [University], yes.
Speaker 1: --Arizona State.  Okay.
Speaker 2: We met in a partial differential equations class (laughter), and we both went to the University of Washington and we both graduated in '98' [1998] and were married after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So is he involved in applied mathematics as well?
Speaker 2: He is also an applied mathematician.  He is also a mathematical biologist.  His area is infectious disease modeling and sort of more disease pathogenesis modeling for him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So do you think it's helpful to have a mate that's also involved in the similar--
Speaker 2: You know we find it very helpful to bounce ideas off of each other.  We've actually never really worked together.  I think we might have one joint publication or something, but we don't really publish together but we certainly are a resource for each other, bouncing ideas off of each other, and it's nice to have someone who speaks your language who understands, you know, if you're at a challenging point in your work.  You have someone right there who can, you know, share ideas with.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now your first son was born in 1999.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now having two mathematicians as parents, is that really--has it really amplified his math capacity, or--
Speaker 2: You know he's a very smart little boy, always was.  And, you know, but I think (laughter) having two mathematicians as parents is leading him probably to go another direction (laughter).  I think it might be too much of a good thing, so he's like gonna veer out and do his own thing, which we com--we fully support.  He definitely has talents and--in the mathematical arena, but I really want him to come to love it on his own without, you know, too much parental influence, because I actually think it might backfire if we tried to influence that a little too much so I'm letting him find his way and feel his way and I--you know it is my hope that he comes to, comes to love the math and the science the way we do, but he's also very interested in art and mu--I mean he's just a really well-rounded kid who has potential in a lot of different areas.
Story_ID: 23198
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So you did another Postdoc at Duke [University in Durham, North Carolina], right, in '99' [1999]?
Speaker 2: I did, I did.
Speaker 1: Now this is--you received a prestigious Postdoc for Fellowship from--they don't say where from.  Oh, the--John Hope Franklin Postdoc--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I did, I did.  So after one year at the--special in mathematical biology, I could have stayed on there and worked in Minnesota, but the opportunity to go to Duke came up and I was very very excited to go and work with Mike Reed who was there at the time also doing wonderful things in mathematical physiology and he also--what really attracted me to Duke and to him as my next mentor was the connections he was willing to make.  So he knew that our particular areas of research weren't exactly the same but he had connections, and he connected me to people who were doing the kinds of cancer research that I was very very interested in.  So he was also probably one of the next great mentors in my life in terms of helping me to become an independent researcher, in terms of helping me understand what it would mean to have an academic career because when I left Duke, I was going to my first real tenure track job, so lots of conversations with him about what it means to be an academic and to be a professor, and to have this as your occupation, and to showing me the teaching aspect and the research aspect, and all of the tings in-between that come with really being successful in academia.
Speaker 1: What's his name again?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: That was Mike Reed, Michael Reed at Duke.
Speaker 1: Michael Reed.  Okay.  R-E-E-D?
Speaker 2: Uh Huh.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Okay.  Alright.  So after Duke, there are two important publications during this period I wanna ask you about.  One is Theoretical Analysis of Conjugate Localization in Two-Step Cancer Chemotherapy, which was published in a journal of math, and--well let's talk about that one first.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that is basically the publication of some of the major results from my thesis so my thesis was on that very topic of the localization of these drug conjugates, these antibody enzyme pro-drug combinations, and so of course the work is all there in my dissertation but what we do in our discipline, of course, is to publish these in mathematical journals.  So we wrote up parts of the major results from my dissertation into a couple of different papers and that's one of 'em.  And I think that one was the more mathematical one where we actually went through the details of deriving the mathematical model and sort of validating our assumptions in all of those things and showing what the model could do.  A subsequent paper was more on the biological side, sort of showing how useful those results could be in terms of predicting the outcome of the therapies.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  And that's the one, the mathematical and experimental analysis of localization of anti-tumor or antibody enzyme?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright.  So you were a visiting scientist at Duke from '99' [1999] until 2000 and--so that's separate from the fellowship?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) so, it was actually all together.  It was all sort of one position.  The difference is--so the research triangle is just a mecca of all kinds of opportunities.  So while I was a postdoc at Duke, Mike Reed introduced me to some researchers at the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, and so I was technically also a visiting scientist there working on some--a couple of different projects with some corroborators of the EPA, but my main research at Duke was continuing to publish things for my dissertation and move forward to the next phase of my research that I could sort of build a whole career research plan from.
Story_ID: 23199
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you joined the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] in 2000.  How did that come about?
Speaker 2: So I actually had a position at Duke [University] that would have lasted a couple of more years.  I decided to send out some feelers and just test the water applying for permanent positions at just a handful of places just to see what would happen.  It was--I knew I had a safety net, I knew I was able to stay at Duke, but I just wanted to see what some universities thought about my preparedness and readiness for a tenure track position.  So University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] was one of the places I sent my application materials and they responded with real interest, and they were very interested.  They had me interview and all of that here, and I was very pleasantly surprised to be offered a tenure track job earlier than I really had expected.  So this was again a time when I needed mentorship because I needed some advice as to what should I do?  Should I accept a tenure track job now, or should I continue my postdoc at Duke which I can stay there for another couple of years and continue to build my research.  And so these are things I talked to Mike Reed about, and another faculty member at Duke, Arlie Peters about, and really did a lot of soul-searching to decide, you know, "Am I ready to make this move now, or should I wait a couple of years?"  As you see, I decided to go ahead and make the leap into the tenure track position at the University of Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is in 2000--
Speaker 2: Em hm.
Speaker 1: --turn of the century--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and so now did you--how long was it-- now you started teaching introduction to mathematical biology, right?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: And how long was it before you formed the math biology research group?
Speaker 2: So when I got there, University of Michigan had had a mathematician who was interested in biology who had sort of started this course but it hadn't run for several years, so I sort of picked back up on this course, revamped it, made it my own and started offering it and it was--it was nice for me to be able to develop something based on a subject matter that, of course, I knew well, and to get students excited about math biology at Michigan.  That was one of the real things that attracted me to the job in the first place was the ability to shape the direction of math biology in a department, and so I was able to do that right from the start with developing this course.  And when I saw how popular the course was becoming, that students really were beginning to like it and began to interact with other faculty on campus, realized that there was a lot of interest around campus for math biology, we decided to form this research group where--very informal, where faculty and students--graduate students, undergraduates, would come together, give talks, have a seminar, discuss papers, and we even had a distinguished lecture series as a part of it, so we would invite some well-known mathematicians from around the country to interact with our group just to sort of raise awareness, give a forum to the interest of math biology.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the group--I mean the math biology group was formed in what year?
Speaker 2: So I'd say probably the grass roots efforts probably started in around 2001 and the group maybe got really off the bat around 2002.  So just--I mean it was something that happened relatively quickly after moving to Michigan and taking on the position just based on finding all this interest.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, it says that you published a couple of papers in 2002 that are significant here.  One is--I only know what's on the outline (laughter).  There's a lot goin' on I don't know--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but I know you're continuing to publish, but one paper is A Mechanical Model of Tumor Encapsulation and Transcapsular Spread. And now what is that about?
Speaker 2: So this is--this was actually an idea that had come to me, back as a graduate student, that I just didn't have time to work on for a while, but when I got into my tenure track position, I had more time to--to sort of focus on this, so this is the idea that, as a tumor grows as a sphere initially, I mean as a mathematician, we, you know, think of it as a growing sphere even though it has some irregularities in its shape.  Eventually, tumor cells can break through and begin to spread outside of that, you know, nodule of growing tissue.  So we developed a mathematical model of what the mechanics would say should happen if you've got this pressure of cells pushing out into tissue, and when can cells escape that and end up traveling beyond this initial--this initial capsule--encapsulated mass of cells.  So we had--we included things like cells breaking down the capsule and finding their way to start migrating on their own.  So it's sort of model that leads to how tumors began to metastasize, to go from benign to malignant.  That kind of transition is where we were focusing in that paper.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  We're gonna pause here, Okay?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 23200
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were explaining how tumors--that you were measuring, I guess, the--how tumors--the rate that tumors are able to break through this encapsalization [sic, encapsulation] process to spread (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in cancer cases.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so we would look--we would sort of look for the speed of their movement through the tissue and those were the things we'd sort of compare to experimental data, you know, the rate of tumor spread and those kinds of things.  So we try to always have something within the model that we can compare to actual data to make sure that our models are predicting the right biological scenario, and that was the one thing we were looking at at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is--anyone who's had a relative with cancer, or had cancer, has heard about, you know, different rates of what a cancer is spreading on some level or another, and just a general level--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --people tell you.  But I've never met anybody that actually measures this type of activity.  So how--I'm just like thinking here.  How--so you work with a biologist or such?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  Actually, experimental collaboration and collaborations from biologists is crucial to what I do.  It's the only way to make sure that, you know, the mathematics we're developing is really connected and really representative of the true biological situation.  And that's something that's very important to me, is to make sure we're capturing as much of the essential biology as we can.  Of course biology is so complex that we can't include every biological interaction that's going on within a cell or within a population of cells within a tissue, but we can include the essential biological features and mechanisms and--to make them mathematical--the foundation of the mathematical that we're building is strong as possible.
Speaker 1: How much biology do you have to actually know yourself to be able to do the job that you do?
Speaker 2: So that's a good question.  So my training was in mathematics, as you know, from early on.  And it wasn't really until graduate school that I started taking biology classes and learning the biology of the discipline that I eventually was moving into.  And I actually don't recommend, you know, waiting so long (laughter) to start, you know, uncovering some of the mysteries of biology or whatever you wanna apply math to.  And I think today's students have the option that I didn't have, which is to really get solid footing and solid foundation in both fields.  So they can be trained as really strong mathematicians and even, you know, starting as an undergraduate and even at that point, also take a lot of biology and chemistry and, you know, molecular biology, cell biology, all those kinds of courses, and see connections sooner than I did.  So yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now you received a Sloan Foundation Fellow--Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Research Fellowship in 2003.  Was that for something really specific, or just to aide your general work?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that that was not a very specific award.  It was a great award to get though.  It--my department had to nominate me and not everyone--I think they can only nominate two people, and so I was one of the two people they nominated and I was deeply honored to receive that award, which, you know, really helped at that particular point.  I had been at Michigan [the University of Michigan] for three years and I knew my tenure case was coming up in, you know, the next couple of years, so at that point having something--that kind of recognition and support, financial support that came with it, really helped me to be able to continue doing the research I was doing and I think it probably helped with the whole tenure process and all of that, to be recognized nationally that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  'Cause by 19--by 2003, you're an associate professor on your way to full professorship.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: In 2005, you received the James S. McDonnell Foundation Research Award, correct?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.  That's similar to the Sloan--
Speaker 2: Ah, this was actually for more specific research.  This is something I actually applied for by writing a research proposal, and I had proposed to work on a tumor angiogenesis problem, so angiogenesis is the formation of blood vessels from the existing supply, and tumors have to initiate this blood vessel formation process or they can't grow beyond a very small size.  So I submitted an application for a proposal to develop mathematical models of the angiogenic cascade within tumors and some new anti-angiogenesis treatments.  So instead of the chemotherapies that I describe before which attach cancer cells, looking at therapies that attack the blood vessels that cancer cells are trying to establish--the vasculature that they're trying to establish.  So I wrote the proposal to do this type of research, and that resulted in this James S. McDonnell Award.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I guess, in terms of tumors, just--I know you're not a doctor (simultaneous)--but I'm just interested in this in the sense that a--
Speaker 2: No, yeah.
Speaker 1: --so a benign tumor is not able to produce the capillaries to be able to grow and spread?
Speaker 2: So some benign tumors do grow beyond the size where angiogenesis is necessary.  They're just not spreading out into the bloodstream and that kinda thing.  They're very contained tumors.  And it's when tumors begin to initiate their own vascular supply that they become more dangerous because at that point, the cells can enter the bloodstream much more easily and then begin to metastasize.  So a malignant tumor is one that has the ability to spread and move out beyond its initial--its initial mass and spread into surrounding tissue and also spread to other sites in the body.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you'd be measuring the rate of the growth of these blood vessels in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we do.  So there's sort of two threads to that research.  One is sort of the basic science question of how do these blood vessels develop in the first place and how fast do they develop?  What is the vascular extension speed?  And all of that.  And so we do look at models of that that track the rate of formation, how fast the cells are moving, how fast blood vessels are forming, and all of that.  And then the other part is more of therapeutic question.  Once you have this vascular tumor, can you target the vascular cells shrinking the vasculature by sort of starving the tumor?  So those are two very very interesting questions that require two very different types of mathematics to describe and that are both very very interesting to me in my work.
Story_ID: 23201
Speaker 1: Okay.  There's one article where you described--this is a publication of the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  You described a typical and normal day for you.  Can you describe a normal day of activities for you?
Speaker 2: So usually I'm, you know, teaching a class which means preparing for a lecture, spending time in class with students, interacting with students outside of class.  I'm--I'm the kind of teacher who--or educator who is very hands-on and I love my students, and my door is usually open to them.  So that means spending time with them even outside of the classroom.  They come to my office hours and we talk about not only the class work and materials that are covered in the class, but I also have a lot of students who come to me for advice and mentorship so that's part of my day is talking to students about their career plans and paths and that kinda thing.  And then I also carve out time in my day for research, which is either with my own graduate students or undergraduates who are working with me on particular projects so they come in and give reports to me on how things are going.  We discuss developments and progress.  So that's another large part of my day.  And I am on several committees within our department and within the university.  So another part of my day would also be attending meetings associated with whatever committees I'm on.  For example, if--I happen on the Personnel Committee or the Recruiting and Retention Committee, those kinds of things, we have meetings that take up another little bit of time during my day.  But I'd say the most of my daily time is spent either in connection with my teaching and with my students, or in connection to my students who are actually doing research with me.  So it's a nice balance and a nice mix of the two.
Story_ID: 23202
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now in 2006, you received a National Science Foundation grant for University of Michigan SUBMERGE Program.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us what SUBMERGE [Supplying Undergraduate Biology and Mathematics Education and Research Group Experience] is about?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So SUBMERGE is about merging the subjects of mathematics and biology for undergraduates and this came about because of, you know, my love for undergraduate education and I'd had several undergraduate students who'd worked with me over the summers who were very very good.  And I just wanted a mechanism to support more students in this way, give more students the opportunity to really get a hands-on knowledge of mathematical biology early on.  So, together with some other faculty on campus, we put in a proposal to have a--to develop research groups of undergraduates where they would work in teams.  We would have students from mathematics and students from biology paired up with faculty from mathematics and faculty from biology, so we'd have this inter-disciplinary mix of students and faculty and they'd work together on long-term projects.  Not just during the summer but during the academic year, and really sort of get an idea of--give the students an idea of how to talk to each other from different disciplines, how to work together on an inter-disciplinary project, and how to make progress on something within math biology.  Hopefully, leading towards a publication for them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So that was (unclear) so did they publish--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so we had--we had cohorts of four to eight students come in every year, and the program has been really really successful.  Almost all teams that have worked through the program have published a paper.  Our first group that came through in around 2006, 2007, many of them went off to medical school.  The ones that didn't go to medical school got into very good graduate schools, we had several best poster prizes at national conferences, so the students and their research was very well-received and we're very proud of the students who came through the program.
Story_ID: 23203
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now it says here that in 2006, you received a CCMB [Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics] Pilot Grant for modeling NOTCH Inhibition of Cancer Stem Cells, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So around that time, I had a student come to me wanting to work on the cancer stem cell hypothesis.  This isn't a new hypothesis but it's the idea that cancer initiating cells have stem cell-like behaviors and quantities.  So we found an experimental collaborator in the Life Science Center who was also very interested in stem cells and cancer stem cells in particular, and applied for this pilot funding to sort of see if we could develop some kind of connections or collaborations between the mathematics and the data.  So my student Sarah Hysel (ph.) eventually married and became Sarah Gentry, began working on this project, it became her dissertation.  She's had a couple of publications based on it and, you know, it was a very, you know, exciting project to sort of work on and sort of connected my research group with the Life Science Center at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.  It also mentions here a CCMB Pilot Grant for the Mathematical Characterization of Septic Emboli.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So this is the idea that when a person develops sepsis, which is bacteria in the bloodstream, there are occasions when these bacteria will aggregate together and form something that's large enough to actually, you know, block a blood vessel.  So we were interested in developing some mathematical models along the lines of how do these bacteria aggregate in the blood stream, and so we were looking at particles coming together and forming larger particles, and they could also break off and become smaller, and so we developed a mathematical model that sort of captured some of these dynamics and wanted to look at the rate at which those things would get large enough that they could actually stop the blood flow in one of the smaller capillaries and that kind of thing.  And this was with a guy named John Younger who is an emergency medicine physician.  So, through these internal university pilot grants, I was able to make a lot of connections and collaborations with other people right here on campus.  But I may not have worked with otherwise because--especially a project like that is kinda far afield from my main area of research and interest, but it's a very interesting project that, you know, a mathematical toolset could be beneficial to.
Story_ID: 23204
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay now, tell us about SIAM, Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.
Speaker 2: So yeah.  It's one of the largest applied mathematics societies.  I am a member of SIAM and I serve on some of their diversity committees so they really have a mission where they want to increase the number of underrepresented minorities who are interested in mathematics and doing mathematics, and so they make sure that all of their meetings and conferences that they host and sponsor pay attention to diversity issues and try to make sure and highlight diversity whenever they can.  At their annual meeting, there is a diversity days conference where, you know, there's a full day long of mini-symposia where researchers are highlighted who come from underrepresented backgrounds.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  And you've been involved in that.  That's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --a long time.  Yeah, I've been involved for quite a while.
Speaker 1: --alright, and you were made full professor in 2008 [at the University of Michigan], and so you can do anything you want now, right (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Ah, you know, there is a little freedom that comes with it but with that comes a lotta responsibility.  I think that a lot of times when you're on the tenure track and definitely before you're tenured, you have to really focus your time and attention on research and promotion and making sure you're doing the right things for that.  Once you have tenure, then you still, you know, have that next milestone in mind of becoming a full professor but you can broaden out.  And when you're a full professor, you can start focusing on agendas that really mean something to you.  And so with that freedom of being able to figure out what I wanted to focus on came the responsibility of doing something about some of the issues that I wanted to make an impact on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In 2008, you began serving as Senior Editor of Mathematical Oncology for Cancer Research.  That's a publica--a journal.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it's probably the leading experimental journal for cancer research in the country and it's a journal for biologists and experimentalists.  And so around 2005 to 2008, there's probably a real surge in the interest of using computational tools in cancer and that's what I'd been doing my whole career, but a big community was being developed around the mid-2005 and 2010 I guess.  And so we decided to try to pitch this idea to one of the leading experimental journals that having a section in your journal where you publish some papers that have a quantitative component, a mathematical component, would be beneficial to readership.  And they were very excited by this idea of having, you know, mathematical oncology as part of one of their sections in the journal, and it's been going on now for a number of years and we're very excited that it's a section that's doing very well.  And I think it's been very well-received by their larger readership.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now also 2008, you were named Diverse Issues and Higher Education Standout Scholar.  So is this for your work with the SIAM and other--
Speaker 2: I think yeah.  I was very pleasantly surprised and honored to receive that type of recognition from this magazine.  I had looked and seen some of the other people that they had chosen as this emerging scholar and to be a mathematician and a female, getting this recognition was really really, you know, heart-warming for me.  And I think it was a combination of sort of the research and sort of the outreach and kinds of things I was attempting to do that led to that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you also became involved with the Diversity Committee for the Mathematical Biology Institute.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now where is the institute?
Speaker 2: That's at the Ohio State University [Columbus, Ohio].  It's actually--there are a number of these mathematical institutes that are funded by the National Science Foundation, and this was the very first one dedicated to mathematical biology.  And, again, just like I think probably every stem field that this institute is very interested in trying to make sure opportunities exist and that people are exposed--a diverse group of people are exposed to the exciting advances in math biology, and so I serve on a committee that's just designed to help make sure that the programs they support and the conferences and workshops and things that they support are, you know, keep in mind these issues of diversity and to make everything accessible to all people.
Story_ID: 23205
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you were also involved in something called NIMBIOS, which is the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So that is the newest center, which is funded by the National Science Foundation for Mathematical Biology, and it is designed to be a synthesis center, so you're taking a lot of information that we currently have available, data and other information that we currently have available, combining that with researchers in mathematics, computation, engineering, and trying to make progress in particular areas where there's a lot of data available, but maybe not a lot of understanding, or where there's room to increase the understanding.  And so I was on, I believe, sort of like the Scientific Advisory Board for that institute as well.  And I think it was the foundational--the very first scientific advisory board--this was, like I said, the newest center.  And so it was nice to be able to sort of shape the direction of the programs and the workshops and things that that center was going to support in its formative first years.  So I found that a very attractive opportunity to be there as it took its baby steps into existence and begin to make a name for itself as a center.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you were also on--in 2008--on the External Review Committee for Mount Holyoke College [South Hadley, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so were they getting involved in mathematical biology?
Speaker 2: A little bit, yeah.  And this was actually my first experience doing that, being on an external review board.  And it was very eye-opening and enlightening experience to go and see the inner-workings of another department.  Although I had been a part of other departments as an undergraduate in Arizona and a graduate student in University of Washington [Seattle, Washington], my only real experience as a faculty member, as a part of a department, was really University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  So seeing the inner-workings of another department and being able to offer advice and suggestions and looking at what they're doing really really well, and all of that stuff was a really eye-opening experience for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in 2010, you received the David--the Blackwell--Richard Tapia Prize.
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: And did you know David Blackwell?  He's sort of a--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --I did not know David Blackwell, unfortunately.  Yes, but his legacy, his legend, I mean certainly.
Speaker 1: --yeah, a legendary black mathematician (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --absolutely.
Speaker 1: --people--.  Now what about Richard Tapia?
Speaker 2: I do know Richard Tapia.  I have several opportunities to meet Richard Tapia.  His center at Rice [University in Houston, Texas] is amazing.  He is just an inspiring person and it was just an unbelievable honor to be selected for that award in particular because it's award for your research but also for the things that you try to do for the community as well.  And it was just wonderful to be recognized by those two, with an award named for those two, couldn't have meant more to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's see.  Where is--what exciting, you know, discoveries, are on the horizon in terms of mathematical biology, or where are we going now?  Are we close to being able to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So I think, especially in my field of math biology, there are some exciting things on the horizon.  The most exciting thing on the horizon, I think, is moving into individualized medicine.  Being able to use mathematics to say something about patient-specific medical care.  So right now, we're sort of looking at aspects at the intra-cellular, cellular tissue level of average general patient.  It would be nice to take in molecular data of a particular patient's genetics and be able to say something about what should be done for every specific patient.  We're not quite there yet, but a lot of mathematical modeling is trying to move towards connecting all of the information that we have into being able to say something about individual patient care and medical care.  Based on that person's physiology, based on that person's genetics, etc.  And I think there have been a few things, especially with imaging, so--this isn't my area, but just to give you an example, looking at abnormalities or problems that can happen with the heart, you can now take images of a particular person's heart, use those heart images to construct their anatomy on a computer, solve mathematical equations for blood flow on that computer, look at how blood flows through that particular person's anatomy, if there is a blockage or something like that, you can sort of see what would happen computationally by removing that, and where would the blood end up flowing?  What would be the consequences of such a surgery for that particular person's anatomy?  So we're getting there with some areas of math biology but moving there in my field with tumor growth I think is the next stage.  We're not there in cancer yet for individual patient-specific care, but I think that is definitely on the horizon.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Let's see.  What are you the proudest of I guess in terms of what you've done?
Speaker 2: Oh, um.  I think in terms of my academic work and publications and all of that, I'm proudest of the work that I've done on anti-Bcl2 therapy because there's a real clinical connection to that.  I think that's the part of my work that has the best chance of actually making a clinical impact, and so I'm very happy to have been involved with that.  I'm proud of the products that we're--and the results that we're coming up with for that.  It's leading our experimental collaborators to change the way they administer these drugs and how they're thinking about them.  So I'm very very proud of that.  In terms of sort of the other part of my job, which is more education and that kinda thing, I'm very proud to have now a bridge program to the PhD and applied mathematics at our university, which is aimed at underrepresented minorities and helping them to bridge from a--an undergraduate to a PhD through a well-supported Master's degree program in our department.  And I'm very proud of our cohorts.  We've had--we just accepted our second cohort of students into our program and they're all doing really really well, and it's sort of a labor of love for me directing that program and watching these students thrive in our program at [the University of] Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We have to pause here again.
Story_ID: 23206
Speaker 1: Ma'am, what would you advise young people today or--let's see, that's a normal question we ask, but I'm really--the question I have is really different that just popped into my head here. What would you advise a young mathematician who today--or how would you persuade a young mathematician to get involved in mathematical biology or into some applied form of mathematics?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think--I think through exposure to what mathematics can do in these other disciplines, it really is a powerful--it's powerful to see what mathematics can do.  One of the examples I often give students of the power of mathematics in a biological setting is that actually a Nobel Prize was won for the development of the mathematics associated with the electrical activity of the Squid Giant Axon [discovered by John Zachary Young in 1936: the very large axon that controls part of the water jet propulsion system in squid], and not only did these researchers win a Nobel Prize for the new understanding of how, you know, electrical information propagates in these neurons, it also sparked a whole new field of mathematics looking at excitable systems.  So there's these really huge challenges that can be both mathematically satisfying and push the envelope biologically and help our understanding of a real intriguing biological problem.  And to me, that's the best of both worlds, to be able to do something significant mathematically that just happens to also be really significant in terms of the application field.
Speaker 1: As you were describing what you do, I was thinking about how much--how similar it is to a physicist in a lotta ways, where they're trying to understand the mechanics of the natural world on a huge level--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --on a quantum level too, but you're actually trying to understand it on a biological level in a way.  I mean do you see a new--maybe a new specialty--well I guess it's already emerged, but now is it gonna--is it going the same way that physics is going in a sense that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so there's a lot of questions like that and analogies like that because, I guess, math and physics kind of grew up together, right?  I mean math--the calculus in mathematics was kinda developed for physics, right?  And not so much for biology; it was a long time later where it became okay to start thinking quantitatively, and even for the need to be recognized that quantitative approaches in thinking is what direction biology should be going in.  And so I do hear people saying, "Oh, we need to come up with the mathematics for biology like we already have the mathematics for physics."  And I don't know, I don't know if there will be a mathematics for biology.  I think it's--it's gonna continue to develop the way it has sort of at the grass roots looking at--everyone is looking at the biological problem that motivates them, and developing the mathematics associated with that problem within biology.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now we always this question.  If you could look--go back to any point in life and change something, and I know--I realize you're still young--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but what would you--is there anything you would go back and change, or--
Speaker 2: Hmm.  You know, I--when I first heard that question, it popped into my mind, "you know, I don't think I would change anything," I don't think I regret anything about the way everything has happened.  It didn't happen the way I thought it would, or even that I thought it should.  It just--everything just sort of transpired in my life.  But the one thing I might go back and actually do a little differently is I would take some biology courses earlier than I did, I really would.  I would start that much much much sooner than I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African-American community today?
Speaker 2: So I have lots of hopes, but I'll start with a concern.  It's a universal concern; I'm sure everyone has this concern, that our numbers aren't great in STEM disciplines.  So I, I'm definitely concerned about that.  I'm concerned about the pipeline, I wanna see it overflowing with students who are getting degrees--undergraduate degrees in STEM fields, especially in mathematics, and who are going on to PhD's in mathematics.  I wanna see the numbers start to shift so that we have full professors in math departments around the country who are African-American.  So that's one of my concerns, and I guess I can turn that into a hope.  I hoped--I hope that our future allows us to be in those positions and to continue to become a mainstay in academia, especially in the STEM fields--to have a community of African-Americans in STEM fields at the highest levels of academia.  And numbers large enough to really be impactful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you look back again at what you've done to this point--I know you have a lot to do.  In fact, I should ask you that first.  Like what's your next--I mean what's on the horizon for you next?  What do you see yourself doing or do you have a specific research goal you're trying to get to or--
Speaker 2: So yeah.  I think my future goals are to continue along the lines of sort of the research I'm doing.  I'm particularly interested in coming up with better ways of connecting intracellular, cellular and tissue level events, and because those are three very different scales, it's a challenging mathematical problem, so on the--my horizon is to continue to work towards developing a way to understand things that cuts across these kinds of scales.  As another little personal goal, I have yet to have written an actual book--a text book.  I think that's probably on my horizon.  I've taught classes in mathematical biology and mathematical modeling for a number of years.  I have lots of ideas to put down in textbook form, so I think that's on the horizon for me as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Right now, when you look back at everything, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh wow.  That's a--that's an interesting one.  I think my legacy will end up being the lives and careers of the students who I have encountered and who have--whose lives I have been able to be a part of, and those students include my own children.  Just Friday, a grandfather came up to me and introduced me to his granddaughter and he said, you know, "She loves math, she's really interested in math."  And he told his granddaughter, "She is a Professor of Math at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]."  And this little girl, probably around seven years old, said "Please don't retire until I get there.  Please don't retire until I get to your class."  And, you know, hearing something like that makes me think that my legacy will be students like that who go on and do great things. And the particular thing that touched me about this little girl is, being so young, she wanted to see an instructor, a professor, who looked like me and didn't want me to go anywhere.  She wanted to make sure there'd be one that looked like me when she got to that stage which, you know, was really really touching.
Story_ID: 23207
Speaker 1: Hm.  Okay.  Now tell us about your family.  Now we mentioned your marriage and your first son, and you have another son, right?
Speaker 2: I do.  I have two boys, thirteen and ten years old, yeah.  One's a freshman in high school and one's a fifth grader.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And are they intere--well, the first one you said--I asked you if he was interested in math (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I say he has math aptitude, but not necessarily math interest at this point (laughter).  And my younger son is--he is very very talented in a lot of areas as well.  He loves math, and we'll see how -- we'll see how it goes.  Again, I think our approach is more hands-off so that we don't, you know, over-influence 'cause it's very easy to over-influence them I think, given that there are two mathematicians in the family.  So I'm just letting them find their way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said your siblings are writers, right? (Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: They're very good writers.  They're all very good writers.  My younger sister is currently in graduate school at the Teacher's College in Columbia, and she is doing wonderful there; my brother is more of a song-writer poet, prose, that kinda thing that he does.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there--oh, what about your parents?  Your parents are still--are they still--
Speaker 2: My father's [Isaiah Jackson] still alive, my mother [Ernestine Jackson] passed away a couple of years ago, yeah--
Speaker 1: --Okay.  From--
Speaker 2: --and he's in Arizona still, and my older sister and her family and my brother are all still in Arizona, so we try to get back there.  I consider that my home town, you know my upbringing was a very nomadic life of moving every couple of years, but I consider Arizona my home.  That's kind of where we kinda settled down and lived the longest part of my life with my family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I always ask this question.  Can you come up with a problem for some young person watching this that they can solve but is hard enough for them to go look it up, I mean go do some research (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Oh.  Hmmm.  That's a tough one.  Let's think, ummm.  Umm, how 'bout "How long would it take for particles of nutrient or something outside of a cell, a chemical a cell needs or a nutrient a cell needs.  How long would it take for that nutrient to get to the center of a cell, to sort of make its way, diffuse to the center of a cell?  Assuming a cell is kind of a sphere, a circle, and there's lots of nutrient or something floating around outside.  Can you figure out how long it would take to get to the middle?
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Umm, let's see.  Anything that I think we should talk about?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Umm, I don't know.  I think it's been very thorough (laughter).  Yeah, I can't think of anything that I wanted to touch on that we haven't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I think I would like to be remembered--I would like to be remembered as--I think--I'm struggling with this a little bit because it's--there's two different things weighing on me.  One is sort of my research, which I would love to be remembered for having making--having made a great contribution to my scientific discipline, but I would also really love to be remembered for the educational pursuits for students that I've kind of spearheaded and wanted to push forward, and I really wanna be remembered as, you know, a good mentor, someone who, you know, helped shepherd in the new crop into the discipline.  And I actually think that outweighs the research contribution.  I would rather be remembered as someone who took seriously the role of mentor and role model, and who has a legacy of students whose lives she touched.  I think that's how I'd like to be remembered.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much.
