Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have any guesses as to when it might be, get us--
Speaker 2: Her date of, the year?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (unclear) year.

Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My, my sister knows that better than I--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause I never knew.
Speaker 1: Now, now what do you know about your mother's ancestors?  How far back can you trace the ancestors on that side of the family?
Speaker 2: Her grandfather, so my great-grandfather, was an Irish plantation owner in Kentucky.  And--
Speaker 1: Do you know what part of Kentucky?
Speaker 2: Not Kentucky, what am I saying.  In--
Speaker 1: Tennessee or--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, wait a minute.  Yes it was Kentucky, I'm sorry, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was Kentucky.  And I have no idea where in Kentucky.  And I don't know very much at all about her mother's family, the Johnson family, her mom was Susie Mae Johnson, oh, no not Susie Mae, Susie Ann Johnson [McAfee].  And I know very little about them.  I'm sure that there were, they had lots of Indian [Native American] blood in them and I think it was Blackfoot Indian.  But I, I don't know very much about, much more than that about them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But they, they came from Kentucky--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --her, her, her grandmother--
Speaker 2: Her--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) her grandfather's--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --family, I think is from Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  This is her grandfather on her mother's side or her father's [Luther McAfee] side?
Speaker 2: The grandfather is, the grandfather is on her father's side, the McAfee side.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you don't--
Speaker 2: And he was, she, I do know about my grandmother.  My grandmother was one of the first women, black graduates of, of a university, so I know we're a three generation, you know, college graduates.  She went to Wiley College [Wiley University, Marshall, Texas] and she was one of their first students.  She was honored many years ago before she died as, as being such, as being one of the first.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is that in Marshall?
Speaker 2: It's in Marshall.
Speaker 1: Well, okay, yeah (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it was the first black college established west of the Mississippi.  There were, there was Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and there was Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and all of those but Mar-- Wiley was the first west of the Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is there any, is there a story about how the family moved, got from Kentucky to Texas?
Speaker 2: If there is, I don't know it.  That's the sad thing about my particular family is that we didn't, they, you know, we didn't share or we haven't shared all of those stories.  And I'm hoping that before, you know, before it's too late we do, as much as my mom knows.  I don't even know how much my mother knows frankly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And sort of the same thing with my dad.  I mean, I know my, I know that my grandmother on my father's side was full-blooded Choctaw Indian but beyond that I don't, beyond that I don't know.
Story_ID: 270020
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now your, your [maternal] grandmother [Susie Johnson McAfee], though, was raised in, near Marshall [Texas], I guess--
Speaker 2: In, yes.
Speaker 1: --she, she went to school at Wiley [University; Wiley College, Marshall, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --was she raised in Texas?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And she--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) --met her husband [Luther McAfee] in Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was she raised in, in Marshall, you know?
Speaker 2: Just outside of Marshall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Just outside of, I think it's a place called Elysian Fields [Texas] is the name of the place.
Speaker 1: I've heard of that too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well did your mother [Velma McAfee Williams] talk about growing up what, what growing up for her was like in--
Speaker 2: She was the youngest girl of nine children.  There were, there was a tenth one but he died, her brother, Joseph [ph.].  So she was the youngest girl and she had a younger brother.  And they lived on a farm and everybody chipped in.  And, you know, before going to school each morning they all had a chore to do.  Hers was to, to, to, I think, to milk the cows.  And I think there was some cotton picking but, you know, very little of that to help earn income.  Most of their livelihood was based on the, you know, they were self-sufficient.  And then my, my, her father, so my grandfather was a carpenter.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and she went on to college too?
Speaker 2: She went on to college, she went to Wiley.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And as did my dad [John Williams] and that's how they met.
Speaker 1: Now what, what did your mother study in college?
Speaker 2: Math.  She has a Ph.D. in mathematics.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Does she teach math?
Speaker 2: No, she's retired at this point but she did teach at Texas Southern University [Houston, Texas] for, so, for many years and then also at, I think it's called Sam Houston [State] University in, in Houston [sic. Huntsville, Texas] as well.  And I know that she and my dad both, the State of Texas didn't allow black people to, to, you know, go to graduate schools, so they paid for them to go to Chicago [Illinois] and my mom got her, her master's degree at DePaul University [Chicago, Illinois].  And, and I'm not exactly sure where my dad, 'cause my dad was an optometrist, he's retired now, and I think he got his grad- his, his degree from the University of Chicago [sic. Illinois College of Optometry, Chicago, Illinois], but I know for a fact that my mom got hers from DePaul.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you said she got her master's from DePaul and--
Speaker 2: And then she got her Ph.D. from Rice University [Houston, Texas].  But--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and she was the first, they thought she was Asian.  She was the first black person in the Ph.D. program, certainly in, in math but I think period, at Rice University.  She was, and, and certainly the first black woman.

Speaker 2: His name is John Loggins Williams, J-O-H-N, L-O-G-G-I-N-S, W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His place of birth is Beaumont, Texas.  He was born October the 12th, and again, I have no idea, I think he's probably about seventy-eight, he's two years, if my mom [Velma McAfee Williams] is seventy-six, my dad is seventy-eight, I know he's two years older than my mother.
Speaker 1: So about 1926--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I guess, or so.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now what, what do you know about the ancestors on the Williams family?
Speaker 2: Just again, that my grandmother was full-blooded Choctaw Indian [Native American].  My dad's father, I think, had family in Louisiana and then migrated, you know, to Beaumont but I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is there, is there any stories from that side of the family that are passed down about--
Speaker 2: No, not really.  Just, just that my, my grandmother had an amazing voice and sang in the choir at church.  And I'm supposed to look and sound just like her.  That's all my dad ever said to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now he had a chance to go to college, I mean did, was that, was that typical in his family too for people to go to college and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he, he graduated from, he went to college, I think at fifteen or fourteen, no, maybe even younger than that.  I think he, he went to college, he went to, and then he for a year or so, then he went to the war [World War II, WWII] and he was stationed in Alaska and then he came back and that's when he met my mom.  And--
Speaker 1: Well did other people in his family go, I mean, was he the first or was there a tradition (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) His brothers, his brother went to college.  I don't think his--
Speaker 1: Did his father go?
Speaker 2: --his mother did not and I don't think his father did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So he was the first generation (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he's first generation in college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So did he grow up in Marshall [Texas] (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, he grew up in Beaumont.
Speaker 1: Beaumont, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right, Beaumont.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now Beaumont is, is famous for all these athletes there, all these football players that come out of Beaumont-
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: --Texas.  Yeah, a lot of 'em that, I mean, in that area they are supposed to be like the football--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --factory of the U.S., well, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Huh, well he's, my dad is 6'4", and, you know, I mean, the, they grew 'em big in his family.  They're big, big guys, thin but, but tall, statuesque.
Speaker 1: A lot of athletes come out of that area.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Beaumont.
Story_ID: 270022
Speaker 1: Does he [Adderley's father, John Williams] have any stories about growing up in Beaumont [Texas]?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I mean, just that he was, he was sort of ostracized because he's like a, a red bone, I guess, you would say.  So he, he had, he looked, he was very odd, he had freckles and, and red, red hair and, and, and he didn't look anybody in his family and so he was sort of ostracized for that but, but no, nothing telling, you know, historically or anything, I don't think.
Speaker 1: All right.  Nothing (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well nothing, I mean, in other words, I just, I, you know, sadly, my family is just, has not been a family that shared stories or at least not to me, my, you know, my sister would probably know better than I do but, but, but no.  I don't, I don't remember, you know, many things just that he was very proud of his dad.  His dad was a, you know, a chef and a very talented, you know, chef, and, and, you know, and all of that.  And then there were stories of he had some relatives that passed in Mississippi and actually are still passing, I guess, if their, if their lineage has continued.  And, and that was really about it.
Speaker 1: Are those related through his mother the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the Choctaw (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: There were a lot of Choctaws in Mississippi, I mean, that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that's where they, they are from (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And Greenwood, Mississippi is named after a Choctaw named Greenwood LeFlore.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: He had a plantation there--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --in Mississippi, yeah.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: That's interesting, I don't know.  So he had a lot of relatives that actually passed, huh?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I mean, yes, he did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So.
Speaker 1: Any, any good stories about them trying to come back or anything or--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No.  I just remember growing up my father would, would say because we, you know, you grow up and you watch John Wayne movies and you watch the cowboys and the Indians [Native Americans] and, of course, you're always voting for the cowboys.  And my father would, would, you know, shun us for that that that, you know, you're, you know, you know, you're, we're Indian and you shouldn't be voting for the cowboys.  And I just remember, I remember those sorts of stories.  But--
Speaker 1: How'd you feel when he'd say that?
Speaker 2: I don't know, it was, I don't, I, I grew up not actually feeling sort of, I felt like I was a person of the universe, if that makes any sense.  And so when he would say these things, they would register but it wasn't as if I, I had a, a chip or I had any sort of a, you know, anger or resentment toward, it was just a, it was an activity for me.  And so I would, I grew up seeing images on TV and, and, and associating with all of them.  And so, and it's probably how I ended up doing what I, I do.  I mean, I grew up seeing Judy Garland and she was a huge role model for me.  It didn't occur to me that I couldn't achieve what Judy Garland achieved because I was black or I, you know what I mean, I just, I didn't, we went to integrated schools very early on and there were incidences of racism but I was always able, able to overcome them and so then I would just become [HistoryMaker] Janet [Adderley].  I wouldn't become, I wouldn't be this black girl in an all-white school because I didn't perceive of myself that way and I wouldn't allow other people to perceive of me that way either.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Does that make sense?
Speaker 1: Well I'm just trying to figure out did, so did, did you ever identify with the Indians in the--
Speaker 2: Um--
Speaker 1: --'cause there's actually a struggle going on, on the screen between the cowboys and Indians.
Speaker 2: It's true but I just, well, you know what?  I, I didn't identify with either, I, I really didn't because I, I really just saw it as a, as fantasy.  Does that make sense?  I just saw it as fantasy.  I didn't, I didn't identify.  I wouldn't take sides, basically.
Story_ID: 270023
Speaker 1: Did he [Adderley's father, John Williams] ever talk about how he became a dentist or how, or why he wanted to be (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Why he became a--
Speaker 1: --become one?
Speaker 2: No, it was an optometrist.
Speaker 1: Optometrist, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: He, he just, I think at some point an opportunity presented itself that they were recruiting, you know, black people at his university into, into medical fields and he knew that it would make, earn him a great living.  I think at one point he was even thinking about being a pharmacist but then, you know, he knew he wanted to do something in sort of the, the medical realm and, and that's what he ended up doing.  My, on my mother's [Velma McAfee Williams] side, they were all mathematicians and doctors and scientists.  And it just, it, that was a tradition that started from my oldest uncle, Walter McAfee, who was at one point, one of the highest ranking scientists in America, period.  And was honored by President [Dwight David "Ike"] Eisenhower and developed the formula to bounce sound waves off the, off the moon, worked on the atomic bomb, all that stuff.  And so there was a huge tradition on my mother's side for, you know, people to be scientific and mathematical.
Speaker 1: Are, are you related to the [HistoryMaker] Charles McAfee in Wichita [Kansas]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Wait, Charles McAfee in Wichita (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) in Wichita, yeah.
Speaker 2: --no, my Uncle Charles McAfee lives in New Jersey (laughter).  I was gonna say, oh, my God.  Yeah, no, I have an Uncle Charles McAfee.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, but there's a Charles McAfee in Wichita who is an architect, well, well-known architect.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And he has two daughters [Cheryl McAfee-Mitchell and Charyl McAfee-Duncan] in New York [New York] that are architects too, they--
Speaker 2: Oh, fantastic.
Speaker 1: --they are very (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, my Charles, my Uncle Charles was a scientist and lives in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, so your father, that's, that's something though your father was the first gen- he decided to become an optometrist?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And he, he went to Wiley [College, Marshall, Texas] (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He went to Wiley.  He went to Wiley for a year, got drafted, went to Alaska, served I think a, a year, maybe two, and then came back to Wiley and graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And his brother is a musician who taught high school, was the high school band director at the school in Beaumont [Texas], whose name just went right in my head and right out but they were very well known for that, their music department under my Uncle Henry [ph.].  Who at one point was an aspiring jazz musician, played the trombone, he, he I think, even toured with Lionel Hampton at one point.  That was his biggest thing and then he decided he needed to be responsible and settle down and marry and have a family and so he ended up being the music teacher at that high school in Beaumont.
Story_ID: 270024
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: My mom [Velma McAfee Williams] was the secretary for the president of Wiley College [Marshall, Texas].  And my dad [John Williams] happened to go in for some meeting or something, he had to go and ask the, the, the president something and he saw her sitting there and she was, she was very young to be doing it and so he, he was intrigued about how somebody so young could be, have such an important job at the university.  And he asked her out and she said yes and they argued incessantly because she was, of course, very opinionated and I think a month later they married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And he calls her Tunia, which is short for Petunia because in my grandmother's front yard there were all of his petunias growing and he, she was as pretty as any of the petunias in his, in the garden.
Story_ID: 270025
Speaker 1: Do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I have an older brother who's a heart surgeon who, he went to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and is a heart surgeon and lives in Tennessee, married and has two, three boys.  And then I have a younger sister who is really more sort of the historian in our family, I, I feel terrible I didn't do my homework.  But at any rate, and she is a minister and lives in Pasadena [California], she's a Methodist minister.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Alta-- Altadena United Methodist Church [Altadena, California] is her church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's the three of you.  So, so when you grew up your household consisted of your mother [Velma McAfee Williams], your father [John Williams], your sister, and brother, and yourself?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Any, anybody else, any, any grandparents live with you or--
Speaker 2: Well my grandmother, her last year and a half of life lived with us, she suffered from, she died of cancer of the kidney and so she lived with us but basically it was just us.  And then when my mom would, well actually we had babysitters at one point but then also different cousins when my mom would work on her Ph.D. and go, you know, travel, she'd worked on part of it at the University of Wisconsin[-Madison] in Madison [Wisconsin].  And so some, we would go with her but then also cousins of ours would, would look after us as well to just give my mom sort of a break so she could pursue her, her own things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 270026
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And it's very late for most people, it was five.  I remember the day my brother brought home our dog Spot.  That I remember.  I remember I was in my mom's [Velma McAfee Williams] bed, she and I were, you know, having quality time, she was reading to me or something, and my brother came in and he had this little, sort of miniature collie and he named him Spot, which I thought was a silly name.  Of course, I wanted to name him Lassie which is even sillier (laughter) but don't, that was, you know.  But that's my first childhood memory, five years old.
Story_ID: 270027
Speaker 1: Can you describe where you lived and some, some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: We, the favorite part of my childhood was spending the summers in Marshall, Texas with my [maternal] grandmother [Susie Johnson McAfee] on her, at, she had a, a small farm, so she raised chickens and geese and I'd help her get the eggs in the morning.  And, you know, she grew collard greens and mustard greens and turnip greens and cabbage and she had, you know, four fruit trees.  And she lived in this cul-de-sac so that across the way were my aunt's Adelia [ph.] and Uncle Roscoe [ph.] and then their five children, our cousins.  And so it was, it was wonderful.  And I remember the lightning bugs and, and being able to stay outside until, you know, after dark, 'til nine o'clock at night.  And I remember peach cobbler, her making peach cobbler.  And Easter ham and, and having ham with pound cake for breakfast the day after Easter.  That was a, it's a Texas thing, the sweet and the savory, I don't know.  And I remember her stuffing with, and actually her stuffing has been, has gone as far as London [England].  We have friends that live in, in London who now use my Grandmother McAfee's turkey stuffing, Thanksgiving, you know, dressing recipe.  So those, those are my most intense memories of childhood.  In Houston [Texas] where I grew up, I remember going to Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas] every year would have an annual family banquet where all of the professors, all the teachers' families would come and have this wonderful dinner banquet to-- together.  And I remember parsley, I remember the part, there, there was always parsley on the, on the plate.  And, you know, that was a, a very important time for me.  I remember my church quite a lot.  And the, and the smell of my church, Holman United Methodist Church [Trinity United Methodist Church, Houston, Texas].  And Easter egg hunts at the church.  And I remember being very active in their youth organization and actually preaching on, on Youth Day.  I was very, you know, I've always been a nurturer.  And so I remember that was a fond memory.  Lemonade, I mean, the, all of the smells seem to have to do with food don't they?  But, (laughter) but that's the sort of the things that bring you right back, you know, macaroni and cheese, my grandmother's macaroni and cheese, I remember.
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned the church, you know, how the church smelled and now that probably wasn't about food, but--
Speaker 2: No.  It just the, there was, I don't know, and it wasn't, maybe it was even some sort of a cleanser but the church had its own sort of, if I smelled that smell again I would, it would remind me of, of Holman.  Other sights, I remember on the 4th of July the fireworks in Hermann Park [Houston, Texas].  And my dad's office, going to, going to visit my dad [John Williams] at his office and him giving us eye examinations and he'd put on this voice, it wasn't my dad's, he felt like he needed to have this professional voice and he'd say, you know, even to us, I'm his own daughter and he'd say, "Do you see better out of lens one or two, lens one or two" (laughter).  I remember, I remember that.  And I remember, here's another food thing, it's terrible, I remember every Friday having barbecue. Friday was barbecue day and we'd, you know, we'd, we'd either have barbecue or we'd have fish.  And I think somebody in his family must have been Catholic 'cause the whole fish thing on Friday was a thing for him.  And, and I remember going out for Baskin-Robbins ice cream, those sorts of things.
Story_ID: 270028
Speaker 1: Tell us about these Easter hats.
Speaker 2: Well, I just remember that, I mean, church [Trinity United Methodist Church, Houston, Texas] on a, on a every Sunday basis was, there were hats, of course, but Easter Sunday was the day.  And all of these women spent hours getting the perfect hat to coordinate with the, the perfect suit with the same shoes and the leopard skin, you know, purse, and I mean it was, it was hard core.  It was full, you, and as a little girl, each Easter we got a new pair of patent leather shoes, white patent leather shoes, and we got some lovely Easter bonnet that we would have to wear.  And then every Easter we'd stand out in our front yard and take a family photo, that was the, that was the, the, the photo that marked our, our growth each year was Easter Sunday.  And I remember then in high school [at The High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, Houston, Texas] my mom [Velma McAfee Williams] took me to see Alvin Ailey for the first time at [Jesse H.] Jones Hall [for the Performing Arts, Houston, Texas].  And there's 'Revelations,' there's the, there's the, the sequence, Wade in the Water, and the women with the fans and the, you know, and they all have these, you know, amazing hats and I thought, you know, black people all over the world obviously do this.  So black, you know, all over the United States that this is a, and it was just interesting to, to, to see connections and to start realizing that that that that there were connections that that we were as a people, we had traditions.  And I don't know that until then, until high school that ever occurred to me.  And then when I went on to college, I studied a lot of black history at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut].  And, and, and it was, it was really eye-opening to see that there were so many traditions and that so much of that came out of the church, that the church was the thing that, you know, really defined us and fortified us and, and all of that as people.

Speaker 1: Now what was the name of your school, your grade school?
Speaker 2: My grade school was [G.B.M.] Turner Elementary School [Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: And this is in Houston [Texas], right?
Speaker 2: In Houston.  And then my sixth grade year, I went to Poe Elementary School, Edgar Allan Poe Elementary School [Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Do you know who Turner was named after?
Speaker 2: Nope.  I have no idea.  I don't remember.  I'm sure we learned it in school but I have no, no idea (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was wondering if it was Henry McNeal Turner of the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church.  I don't know, I was just wondering.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Turner Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I will never forget my third grade teacher Vivian Vance [ph.].  She shaped my life.
Speaker 1: Vivian Vance, now that's the same name as Lucy's [Lucy Carmichael] sidekick on 'The Lucy Show,' her name was Vivian Vance, too.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But this is Vivian Vance is, was it, is this a black Vivian Vance?
Speaker 2: It was a black lady, tiny little pint-sized, little, tiny little thing.  And, you know, in the days we didn't call it corporal punishment in those days, but in the days when a paddle was, you know, a viable form of, of discipline, I, I always remember, 'cause she was so little that if she had to paddle somebody she'd, she'd get, she'd get the paddle and you'd lie across one leg and she'd put the other leg on top of you (laughter) so that she could, so that she, she could keep you there and then she'd, she'd paddle.  Of course, I never got paddled.  And I don't think she ever paddled the girls but to, the boys got paddled.  But she was, she was one of the most inspiring people next to my [maternal] grandmother [Susie Johnson McAfee] that I--
Speaker 1: And she was at Turner?
Speaker 2: This was at Turner Elementary School.  And I really do feel the whole sense in me that I could accomplish any and everything I wanted to in my life--
Speaker 1: Now how would you--
Speaker 2: --started with her.
Story_ID: 270030
Speaker 1: Well how did you describe yourself, would, would you describe yourself as a little girl?  What were you like and what did you like to do?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was incredibly, I was incredibly outgoing, sort of the center of the, the attention, very energetic.  I'm a middle child so I guess I needed to be, "Hello everybody look at me, what about me?"  And, you know, I had my older brother who was a genius, absolutely brilliant, and then my younger sister who, of course, is the apple of everybody's eye, so I really, from a very early age, developed a very distinct, big personality.  And, and I was a teacher.  I was, I remember going to visit my Uncle Walter [McAfee], my Great Uncle Walter who lived in Chicago [Illinois] one summer.  And I was seven years old and I had gone to a Catholic school the year prior because, because my birthday fell in September, I wasn't able to go into first grade so I stayed back and then skipped first grade and went to second grade and went, and started, went to a Catholic school in Marshall, Texas.  And I'll never forget then at seven years old on the steps of this brownstone, you know, preaching to everybody that, that, that, you know, we, we all have a will, we all have the right, you know, we all have the ability to choose to do right or to, to choose to do wrong but that it, that that that it is a choice and it was in our control and all of this.  And I had, you know, ten, eleven, twelve year old children listening to me, my, this little seven year old girl, you know, preaching everything she'd learned in catechism the former year.  And I knew--
Speaker 1: What was the name of the Catholic school?
Speaker 2: Holy Spirit Catholic Church [ph.]--
Speaker 1: Holy Spirit.
Speaker 2: --in Marshall, Texas.  It's still there.  And my, my Sister, Sister Mary Bernard Theresa [ph.], actually she was as, as powerful.  Those, I have, I have two or three teachers in early childhood that that really got in there and made me believe in myself really early.  And I think that that's the, that's what does it for people, that's what does it for children is that if there's somebody in their life, really early in their life that says to them, you can be, you know, whatever you choose to be, it, it makes all the difference in the world.  And so she was definitely that for me.  I mean, so much so that I wanted to convert to Catholicism, I was so, you know.  And she, they were black, these, this school was the, the priest was white but the nuns, many of them were, were black.  And, and maybe that too sort of shaped my whole sense of the world being sort of integrated that I didn't, I started out integrated, I started out in a place where, where white people and black people sort of commingled and it didn't, there was no talk about being different.  The only thing that was different was, and the, it was the first sort of discrimination I've ever felt and I felt it to the core, was I wasn't Catholic so on Ash Wednesday, they parade, everyone went into, to Mass and, and got the, the ash and I couldn't.  So everyone was sitting around with their lovely ash on their forehead and I didn't have one and couldn't get one because I wasn't Catholic.  So I remember going home and crying, at that time I lived with my [maternal] grandmother [Susie Johnson McAfee], crying to my grandmother I wanna be Catholic, I wanna be Catholic, I remember that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's, now see, so you started at [G.B.M.] Turner [Elementary School, Houston, Texas]?
Speaker 2: I started at Holy Spirit.
Speaker 1: Oh, you started school at Holy Spirit?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I started at Holy Spirit for second grade and then moved back home with my parents [Velma McAfee Williams and John Williams] in Houston [Texas] and, and went to Turner in third grade, third, fourth, and fifth grade.  And then I went on to Poe Elementary School, Edgar Allan Poe Elementary School [Houston, Texas] in sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So this is first, all right.  All right.  Now, now were you a good student pretty much?
Speaker 2: I was a great student.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I loved school.  Particularly English, literature, you know, the humanities.  But I was very good at math too, I was great in math until geometry in eleventh grade [at The High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, Houston, Texas] and geometry did me in.
Speaker 1: Yep (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But and then I took a little of calculus but then I stopped.  And, of course, my mom is still waiting for me to, to take a calculus class.  She says that you're not a, you're not an intelligent adult if you've not taken calculus, is what she feels.  You can't (laughter) so she's waiting, she's still waiting for me to do that.
Story_ID: 270031
Speaker 1: I went to the Performing Arts high school [The High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Again I was, I was in the first graduating class, and I was voted most outstanding female student.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the school was sort of fashioned after [The High School of] Music and Art [Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts] in New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  Now, okay.  Now had, did you have to audition to get into Performing Arts?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.  What had happened was, as a little girl, I guess, in third grade [at G.B.M. Turner Elementary School, Houston, Texas] it must have been, I was seven, how old are you in third grade?  Seven years old, seven or eight years old?
Speaker 2: Eight, eight, yeah, (unclear).
Speaker 1: My brother was this incredibly cerebral, incredibly thin, incredibly shy young man, and so my mother [Velma McAfee Williams] found a children's theater school in Houston [Texas] that was associated with that, with the Alley Theatre [Houston, Texas] which is the rep- repertory company there, and she enrolled him in this program in the hopes of helping him get over his shyness.  And it, he loved it and so one by one she then enrolled myself and my sister.  And at seven years old we did 'The Wizard of Oz' and I was Molly Munchkin I had two lines, "I'm Molly Munchkin," and "the Wicked Witch is dead."  And I knew at, immediately at that point that that's what I wanted to do with my life.  And so in high school when this, this opportunity, so I studied at the, at the Al- Alley, in their after school program for three years.  And then I went on to junior high school [at Edgar Allen Poe Elementary School, Houston, Texas] and did, sang in the chorus and was on the debate team and did things like that.  There wasn't a, a dramat to speak of or a drama club to speak of in junior high school.  But then they announced that they were creating this high school for the performing arts and one of my teachers at the, at the after school program, Ruth Denney, was going, was creating it and was gonna be the, the, the principal.  Ruth Denney then went on to become the head of the drama department at University of Texas [at Austin, Austin, Texas].  But at any rate, I, I jumped at the opportunity, I went in and I auditioned.  I did a monologue from 'Joan of Arc' ['Saint Joan,' George Bernard Shaw] and was accepted in the drama department.  And so I was, so the way it worked, there were no, there were no, you know, in normal high schools you have electives like where you take typing or you take home ec [home economics]or you take shop or whatever and then you have, you have P.E. [physical education].  We didn't have P.E.  We didn't have any of these electives, we, we had three hours of a creative major, three days a week, and three hours of a minor two days a week, so acting was my major and, and musical theater was my minor.  And then we had our, our regular academics.  And so it was a, it was a wonderful experience.  Actually, Beyonce Knowles I read, I read graduated from my, from the high school for Performing Arts in Houston.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now did, did, did you have any black history or culture in class or (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nope not until college [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].
Speaker 2: Not until--
Speaker 1: Not at all.  I mean, even, even February it was just an overview, I mean, of course, we, you know, read about [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] but that was about it.  I mean, it just, it was very sparse.  And only when I went to college did I then really delve into sort of black history.
Story_ID: 270032
Speaker 1: Now did you all live in a black community where you grew up?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was, it was, it was changing.  I mean in other words, it started out and it was half Jewish, half black as I discovered that many communities all, again, that there was that pattern.  And then the Jews once they, you know, made a certain amount of money, then they would move on and then the neighborhood then just became a, a black neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I lived in, I think it's called Third Ward [Houston, Texas] or is what, what people refer to my neighborhood.  It's just between University of Houston [Houston, Texas] on this side and Hermann Park [Houston, Texas] on this side.  It's a, a little community called Third Ward.
Story_ID: 270033
Speaker 1: You're majoring in acting and musical theater?
Speaker 2: At, in high school [The High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, Houston, Texas], yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At--okay.  And now what, what was your strength as a performer did you think at that point or, or--
Speaker 2: I, I was and remain a, a, a big old Broadway belter very much in the, the vein of Judy Garland or Liza Minnelli or Patti LuPone.
Speaker 1: So you got a big voice?
Speaker 2: Just big, big pipes, big voice, big booming voice.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, there's, you know, there are actors and there are personalities, does that make sense?  And I think that as--
Speaker 1: What would be, what would you (unclear).
Speaker 2: That's what I'm saying, as much as--
Speaker 1: --describe as a difference
Speaker 2: --as much as I, I, I am a good actress I'm a fine actress, I'm much more a personality.  And so I, I did a lot of cabaret performing, you know, very much, you know, a la, Josephine Baker or, you know, some, someone like that.
Speaker 1: Now she's a classic, I guess, example of that.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: People describe her, I, not ever, yeah I, I, I didn't come along where I could see her perform live or, I guess, neither, neither did you but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but she had that reputation of being someone who could take some material and get out and by force of personality--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --deliver.
Speaker 2: Make, just exactly, create, create something new--
Speaker 1: Her singing wasn't supposed to be that good (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and make it her own, exactly.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) dance really was--
Speaker 2: That, yeah.
Speaker 1: --she was untrained (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 1: --this (unclear).
Speaker 2: That's right.  But just the, the sheer power of her presence, of her personality.  And, you know, I mean, it sort of sounds (unclear) arrogant to say of oneself but that is what I've been known for.  And so consequently, I became the definition of nontraditional casting in Houston [Texas] because I, I would do these shows and theater directors would come and see me and they just wanted me, they didn't care that the role, like, you know, I did several shows at the Alley Theatre [Houston, Texas] that, and I played white roles.  In 'Kiss Me, Kate' I played Lois Lane who's normally, you know, a white actress, but they didn't care, they just wanted me.  Which is very similar to Pearl Bailey, it's that, it's that kind of you're the, it's all about that personality.  So, so I had advantages in that, in that regard because people didn't sort of see me as, oh, I'm looking for, you know, a black actress of a certain age of a, you know, it just, it just, my whole career was I sort of invented the wheel sort of.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You kind of refer to Pearl Bailey in--
Speaker 2: Pearl, exactly.
Speaker 1: --in '[Hello] Dolly!' (unclear) yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In 'Dolly' that's right, that's right.  She oh, fabulous.  That her singing 'Before the Parade Passes By' doesn't get any better.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: That's funny, you know, Carol Channing is (unclear) she just revealed that she's black but--
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) yes, yeah.
Speaker 2: You're kidding?
Speaker 1: No, she talked about it on 'The Today Show,' ['Today'] her, her mother [Adelaide Channing] was saying what do you think, why do you think you have those big eyes, she (laughter) was told this.
Speaker 2: And those lips.  I mean, I know Carol Channing, I've had dinner with Carol Channing.
Speaker 1: I mean it wasn't a, it wasn't a well-known thing but she, she would be, and it had, somebody passed in her family well at some point--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --and she's, yeah.
Speaker 2: Amazing.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Well there you go.  Well that's like Diana Shore [sic. Dinah Shore], everyone assumes that she's black.  You know, what I mean?
Speaker 1: Dinah Shore?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think she even acknowledged that she has some African blood in her, I think, she did at one point.  But--
Speaker 1: She seemed too cool not, not to be.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's too cool, she's too soulful.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 270034
Speaker 1: You have this big personality, big stage presence and--
Speaker 2: (Nodding head).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you were growing up probably, I would think funk music was the number one music and all that sort of thing, did you feel kind of odd being in a Broadway--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --you know?
Speaker 2: --very much so.  Very, very, very much so.  It's interesting.  And I may end up reviving it but I did a show back in New York [New York] called 'A Brief History of White Music in America' and it was three African American performers and the whole prem- it was fabulous.  And the whole premise was, you know, it's a well-known fact that all of, of, of or most of, or much of, all of, of contemporary pop white music gets its roots from the blues, you know, The [Rolling] Stones, and, you know, all of that.  And so for, you know, we've all sort of paid homage to the fact that, that, that, you know, white popular music is, is rooted in, in, in black musical traditions.  So this show that I did was a, a flip on that was, was having black musicians pay homage to all of the amazing music that's been created, you know, by white people or whatever.  And so there was a line in there, I sang, 'To Sir, with Love,' which is, one of the most memorable movies for me growing up, that and 'To Kill a Mockingbird' were two of my two favorite movies growing up as a child.  And, and so, I sang the, the theme 'To Sir, with Love' in this, in this particular show.  And I, I started, I introduced the song by saying most little black girls grew up wanting to be Diana Ross, well I never did, I grew up wanting to be Lulu.  And then I, I sang this song, and it wasn't that I wanted to be white, it was that this song, this movie, Sidney Poitier, this whole British thing really spoke to me and this, and I loved, you know, this song.  And so then I, and then I would sing the song.  And so I did feel like an odd bird because, of course, my parents [Velma McAfee Williams and John Williams] would, the only music that we were allowed to listen to, you know, pop music or R&B was Diana Ross and The Supremes and the Jackson 5.  My mom, we would have to sneak out of the house or be with friends to listen to, you know, Archie Bell and the Drells or Marvin Gaye, forget about it, you know what I mean, she just, we couldn't.  And so we, we grew up listening to opera.  My mom could tell you the libretto of, you know, nine, ten operas.  I mean she's a huge opera, we, we were members of the, of the, of the Houston Grand Opera, we'd go and see, you know, season subscribers, we thought, we went to the ballet, we went, you know, all of that and theater and all of that.  And so I did feel a, amongst my black friends, I did feel odd and I felt, and I led sort of a dua- you know, a, a double life.  I had my life with, with my white friends and then I had my life with my, my black friends because nobody black, nobody black was listening, nobody knew, no one black knew who Judy Garland was when I was growing up, and so I did.  And I remember, I remember watching 'Imitation of Life' and, and just losing it at, you know, crying, you know, hysterically, why is mom, why is the world like this, why do we have to, you know, why, why does it make any difference, why aren't we all the same.  I mean it was, it was a huge problem for me that that I just wouldn't take, I wouldn't take on.  I wouldn't accept that I was different.  And I remember even as recently as being ten, eleven years old, so like in the '60s [1960s], in the late '60s [1960s], in Marshall, Texas, you still, when I'd go to the movies with my cousins, they were, it wasn't like it was legalized, but it was inbred that the black people sat upstairs and watched the movie, and, and the white people went into the, you know, down stairs.  And I remember going in to the down stairs area and my cousins pulling me back and saying you can't do that, you can't go, you know, we, you know, we have to go, and being furious that that they were, you know, 'cause it was all, it, it had been abolished, segregation had been abolished by now but it was just all of these--
Speaker 1: It was custom.
Speaker 2: --customs, customs.  And so I, you know, I did, I early, early on felt incredibly odd because I had interests that that other black kids my age just didn't have.
Story_ID: 270035
Speaker 1: Now when you were in high school [The High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, Houston, Texas] did they have like clubs and class office and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did, did you participate in any of that kind of thing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  I was, well I was like the president of the senior class.
Speaker 1: I'll say that's participation.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I, I've always, I don't, you know, I think many, here again it's a paradox because on the one hand I didn't see myself as black I saw myself as a person of the universe, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but on the other hand, you know, I came from such a strong black family and it was instilled in us very early on from, you know, my, my parents [Velma McAfee Williams and John Williams], my grandparents that, that we were to make a difference in life.  That we were to be better than, that we had to be better than to, to get anywhere.  And so both myself and my sister, my brother did it in his own way, but the two of us were incredibly competitive, not with each other, well with each other but competitive in life, wanted to achieve, wanted to, to be the best, wanted to lead.  And so I've always been sort of that sort of a person, a person that, that steps up to the plate, a person that wants to lead, a person that wants to, to make a difference.  And so I was always it, very involved.  I was a Girl Scout and traveled the world, the first time I went to Europe was with my Girl Scout troop, I was fifteen, and then went to Switzerland and Mexico and, and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, now you were coming along at a time when, I know, the, the early '70s [1970s] there was like a black cultural kind of renaissance--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and people were talking about black is beautiful--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --there's more black history out than ever before--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --they were relating to that on a level but, but you're getting roles that were basically white people, right, I assume?
Speaker 2: Not all of them.  My, I mean, certainly [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was a huge hero for me and [HistoryMaker] Ruby Dee and [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis were huge role models for me.  Diana Sands, that's another, I mean that whole play '[A] Raisin In The Sun' was hugely important to me and, and Sidney Poitier was hugely important to me.  But, so but I would say that it, it, it was black people who, who weren't limited by their black.  I mean, Sidney Poitier every one of his movies, 'Lilies of the Field,' 'To Sir, with Love,' ray [ph.], you know, it, it was, it was the sense of my, the color of my skin is not going to define who I am.  So if I had black role models oh, and I did, the ones that I had were people who were living the same sort of life.  So yes, Sidney Poitier was a huge role model for me because he, he was an island, he was this, he was this, you know, lone black man in this sea of whiteness and he, he always, not only did he survive but he excelled.  He saved people, he helped people, he changed, you know, he effected change.  You know, when he, because he got this big opportunity in 'To Sir, with Love' to go and do the job that he wanted, I think he wanted engineering or something whatever, whatever, whatever, and instead, and he was about to, they gave him this big party and that's when they sing 'To Sir, with Love,' a going away party and then he's going to clear out his desk and this new crop of British yobs, British, you know, hooligan kids show up, oh, so you're Sir, you know what I mean and da, da, da, da, da.  And then he, he tears up the letter because he, he, he's found his, his passion, he's found his purpose and he doesn't go on to do this other thing that he thought he was supposed to do but he, he realizes that here, he's to stand, to stand up and to, you know, that these, that every child that every little, you know, poor, impoverished racist white child that that is, meets him will be forever, their opinion of black people will be forever changed.  And I sort of inadvertently, probably have taken on that banner myself in, in life.  Now, and, I mean, this studio [The Adderley School for the Performing Arts] certainly speaks to that, but not realizing that that's, that that's where it came from, that I wanted to be, to stand toe to toe, head to head with everybody and, and, and not feel like I had to do anything but be me and that I belonged.
Story_ID: 270036
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite teachers in high school [The High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, Houston, Texas]?
Speaker 2: I forget his name but he was my dance teacher and I adored him.  I actually probably even had a, a huge crush on him.  And he was the first, why can't I remember his name?  It'll come to me.  He was the first gay person that I ever knew.  I didn't, you know what I mean when I first went there, of course, I was madly in love with him and he just was so wonderful.  And maybe by my eleventh grade year Bill Chase- Bill Chaisson [William Chaisson], Bill Chaisson I think is his name.  He died of AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] many years ago.  But he was the first gay person I knew, which was really a good thing because I loved him before I knew he was gay and so that was my introduction into homosexuality.  And so I, there was never any kind of judgment or, or anything, anything like that because, because I loved him before I knew that he was gay, so not to love him because he was gay would, would be bigotry.  And so it was wonderful that the first gay person that I knew, I loved him before, before I knew he was gay.  So but at any rate he was a wonderful teacher.  And then my acting teacher Linda Shuler was phenomenal.  But I would say probably my most influential high school teacher was my English teacher who then taught a creative writing course.  And her name was Eileen Wiley [ph.], I think, Mrs., Miss Wiley was her name, Eileen, I'm not sure of, but I'm pretty sure that's her name.  And here again was somebody who, who inspired me to do things that I didn't know that I could do.  And, and because of her tutelage and, and care I started to write creatively and actually even sent in short stories that I had written and, you know, came in third place in some statewide thing and won $500.  And she, she's the one who inspired me to apply to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and wrote the most glowing recommendation for me.  And she just, she was hugely, she was so strong and kind and nurturing.  She really loved what she did.  She really loved teaching.
Speaker 1: Well now that's no mean feat winning $500 in a writing contest--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --as a senior in high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And being the senior class president and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but and you were I, I suppose a pretty good student to be able to apply to Yale.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, I wasn't--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --I had a, I, I had, I think, I probably ended up with a, a 3.9 [grade point average], maybe a 4.0 but there were kids, I was only, I was like number fifteen or something like that in my class.  There were kids, fourteen who had, you know, four point four, you know, grade point averages because of AP [Advanced Placement] classes and, and all of that.  I took AP classes but some of them I made Bs in so that, you know, shifted it.  But I was, I am a, I am a wonderfully well-rounded sort of person.  I'm a, I'm intellectual but I'm also creative and talented and I think that all of those things went together to, to get accepted at Yale.  It was, it was the whole person versus just somebody with this--
Story_ID: 270037
Speaker 1: Well this may sound like a dumb question, but why Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut]?
Speaker 2: It's a dumb, not a dumb answer but a, an answer you wouldn't expect.  I wanted, I knew I wanted to end up in New York [New York] and I was deathly afraid of Manhattan [New York, New York] so there was no way I was gonna go to college at NYU [New York University, New York, New York] or Columbia [University, New York, New York] or anything like that, coming from Texas, rural, southern girl, that scared the living daylights out of me.  So I wanted to go to a school that was nearby, near New York.  I ultimately wanted to go to Yale drama school [Yale School of Drama, New Haven, Connecticut] because I knew that that was the finest drama school in the country.  And then the unsuspec- the reason that you wouldn't suspect, is I was madly in love with Paul Newman, and Paul Newman was a fellow at Yale College.  And, and I thought well if I go to Yale, maybe I'll get to meet Paul Newman.  And sure enough my freshman year I did meet, he spoke at his college, Calhoun College [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], as a, a fellow there, and, and I did meet him.  So and had I not married, I probably would have gone on to the, to the drama school with Angela Bassett, who was a year younger than, than I was and came to Yale and didn't really know what she wanted to do.  But she came and she saw me in shows there and then she got very, she got very excited about drama seeing shows that I had done and we sang in the gospel choir together.  So but--
Speaker 1: Was, was [HistoryMaker] Lloyd Richards there?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was his first, his first year was the year after I graduated.  So if I had gone on to the drama school, he would have, nope that's not right, his first year, nope that is right.  His first year was the year after I graduated, had I gone on to the graduate school, I would have been in school with David Alan Grier and Angela Bassett and Roc Dutton [Charles S. Dutton]. It was a big, I mean there were more black people in that drama school, you know, he took on August Wilson, all of that was, was born out of, of Lloyd Richards' stay at the drama school.
Story_ID: 270038
Speaker 1: Well how did you like Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], did you, I guess you--
Speaker 2: I, I liked it.  My daughter, just graduate, my older daughter [Akina Adderley], just graduated and she did not care for it.  But I, I enjoyed being there.  I think that I got everything out of it that I needed in two years.  I think if I had it to do over again I probably, and my, my husband, my first husband, Nat [Adderley, Jr.], went to Yale too that's where we met, he says the same thing, because we were both, you know, here again this sort of dichotomy we were, we were intellectuals and academics but we were really artists at heart.  And two years was plenty.  And I, if I had it to do over again, I would have gone to New York [New York] and not finished.  But, you know--
Speaker 1: So you, you were there for two years?
Speaker 2: I was there, I was there for four years.
Speaker 1: Four years.
Speaker 2: No, I did graduate.  But if I had it to do over again, I probably would not have.  I would have been brave enough to leave and to, to go on to New York whereas I, there was no way, I mean, my mother's [Velma McAfee Williams] still waiting for me to get a master's degree.  So there was no way I was gonna quit college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I forgot to ask you, what, what year did you graduate from--
Speaker 2: Seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 1: --acting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From college?
Speaker 1: --from high school [The High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, Houston, Texas], high school (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh, from high school, '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: Seventy-four [1974].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And college, '78 [1978], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and I knew I wanted to go to an Ivy League school.  My brother, as I had said, had gone to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And that was something else that my parents had instilled in all of us that we were all going to go to Ivy League schools.  And I applied to Yale, to Harvard, Bryn Mawr [College, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania], Vassar [College, Poughkeepsie, New York], [Mount] Holyoke [College, South Hadley, Massachusetts], and Smith [College, Northampton, Massachusetts].  And I got accepted to all of them except Harvard, which I thought was the shoo-in because my brother was there and that was the one that rejected me.  So (laughter) and it was interesting because, and I didn't have a fallback.  I mean, I was very arrogant when you think about it.  I didn't have, I didn't apply to U, UT [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] or, you know, University of Houston [Houston, Texas] or I didn't have a fallback, I just applied to all of those schools.
Story_ID: 270039
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite instructor from Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut]?
Speaker 2: And here again I'm, names, you know, escape me but I had, I had a favorite, he was a, a documentary film director, his name was Michael [ph.] something, and I can't remember his last name, brilliant man, loved him.  There was William [R.] Ferris, Bill Ferris, do you know who he is?  He--
Speaker 1: Yes, right.
Speaker 2: --he--
Speaker 1: Tell us though (laughter).
Speaker 2: --was a huge favorite of mine.  And then I went on, as fate would have it, I taught his nephew.
Speaker 1: Now he's the, the anthropologist?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And black history and the whole, yeah.  I mean, from, from Atlanta [Georgia], he's from, I think, or--
Speaker 1: I think so.
Speaker 2: --some place though, yeah.
Speaker 1: William Ferris Thompson [sic. William H. Ferris], yeah, was that?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no, no.  That's a different one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's, that's the guy, William, and I don't think his middle is Ferris it's something, something, William something Thompson [sic. Robert Farris Thompson] is, that's a different person.  He, who I did not study under, he did teach there but, oh, no, you're talking, you're talking about William, you're talking about the, the, the African guy, the big anthropologist.  Yes, I did study under him.  And I did like him but those were, six hundred people, you know, it was a huge class.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Whereas Bill Ferris, who was also in that same, in the Afro-Am department, you know, taught classes of ten students.  William Tomlin [ph.], Thompson, Thomas [ph.], Thompson, I can't remember, Thomas--
Speaker 1: William Ferris Thompson taught (unclear) I think.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He--
Speaker 1: Thompson.
Speaker 2: --was the huge African historian.  And, and taught, taught us all about the Yoruba tribe and, and, and, and the various Yoruba gods and, and how Ntozake Shange got her name, she's named after the Yoruba [sic. Zulu], Yoruba god of fire [sic.], Shange [sic.].  I liked him but I didn't, as again, it was, you know, it was a huge class and that everyone took.  But Bill Ferris I really had an, an intimate relationship, a one on one sort of relationship with him.  And--
Speaker 1: Now Bill Ferris is, is he black?
Speaker 2: No, he's white.
Speaker 1: White, okay.  (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He's white.  That was what was very interesting.  I mean, Yale had, and still has as far I know, a really, really strong Afro, Afro, African American studies major.  And so there was, there was also [HistoryMaker Henry Louis] "Skip" Gates [Jr.], who, you know, was never a teacher but he was a good friend of, of ours.  He had graduated from Yale and then had gone on to teach there, and now he's at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: (Unclear) he's head of the W.E. Du Bois [sic. W.E.B. Du Bois Research] Institute at Harvard (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  So he, you know, he's someone that I remember fondly.
Speaker 1: There was a, I, if I'm wrong and I don't think I'm wrong, but I think, there's, well I know, there's a doctor, there was a William [Henry] Ferris who was active in [Marcus] Garvey's movement.  He was the first black graduate of Yale, I believe and the first black master's [degree] (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That rings a bell.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right.  That rings a bell.
Speaker 1: And there's a picture of him and he always has a, has a tuxedo on and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: He was a writer for the Negro World [sic. Negro Digest; Black World].
Speaker 2: Um-hum, um-hum.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) see that's why I asked if this was but he's not.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Unh-uh.  He's a, a country boy from Atlanta who just loves black history, loves, loves, loves.  I mean, he was one of the teachers that got me so interested in, in African American studies and I took a lot of courses there.  Which I think was a lovely balance for my childhood that I, I, I was so determined not to be limited by sex or color or race or any of that.  It was, it was an, I needed the, the balance to that, that I got in college.  So I'm very grateful for that.
Speaker 1: And so in other words it kind of balanced out the, what you perceived as the value of being black?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 270040
Speaker 1: Now when you were on the verge of graduating from Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --did, did you get married in college?
Speaker 2: I got married the year after college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were you a--
Speaker 2: We dated, we, he was my college sweetheart and so we dated--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you met--
Speaker 2: --and then we married.
Speaker 1: --this is, this is Nat Adderley, Jr.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he's from, tell, tell us about his family (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He, he is from Quincy, Florida.  And I actually know a little bit, I know probably about as much about his family as I know about my own.  His, the Adderley name, comes from Nassau [Bahamas] and there are loads of Adderley, there's not a lot of Adderleys in America, there's, her, every time you say Adderley, are you related to Herb Adderley or, you know, Nat Adderley, that, that's the, that's the only two families.  But apparently in, on Nassau it's like Smith.  And there's an [A.F.] Adderley High School [Nassau, Bahamas] there that someone in that, in his family it was named after him.  And so he comes from a family of, of academics, as well of educators.  And Pops [Julian C. Adderley], the picture that I showed you, he was a principal at Tallahassee High School [sic. guidance counselor, Leon High School, Tallahassee, Florida] for several years, many years before he retired.  And so, and they all went to FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University] in, in, in, in Tallahassee [Florida].  And then my, migrated to New York [New York] and with, you know, Bill Cosby and the, the two Adderley Brothers and this other guy that does a lot of commercials now, I forget his name, I'm losing his name, they were all roommates until they all became, you know, sort of big.  And--
Speaker 1: I didn't know that that's--
Speaker 2: --and then they ended up, Cannonball [Adderley] ended up in Bel Air [Los Angeles, California] out here.  And then Nat [Adderley] Sr., so my husband's dad, ended up in Teaneck.  So, so Nat was raised in Teaneck, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  So Nat Adderley is a trumpet player, Nat (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The cornet player.
Speaker 1: --Nat, Sr., Sr., cornet--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --and his brother Julius [sic. Julian] Cannonball Adderley--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --played the alto sax--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --oh, and the horns.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned Herb, is this Herb Adderley the football player?
Speaker 2: It's a football player.
Speaker 1: He, for the Green Bay Packers.  He is a--
Speaker 2: They're not related at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But people, because the family, because that name is so uncommon in America, when you say the name Adderley, that's, you'll get, that's what you get, oh, are you related to Herb Adderley, you know.
Speaker 1: And most men have heard of Herb--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as, as much as they've heard of Canonball--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and Nat--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, because they watch football.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And he, he was a quarterback for the Green Bay Packer championship teams of the '60s [1960s] with Vince Lombardi and all that.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So everybody knows him.
Speaker 2: But I mean, Nat was a, was a, a, a saving grace for me at Yale because he was, he was a black person that got me, do you know what I mean?  He, we were very similar.  He grew up, I mean, certainly he listened to jazz and all of that but he had a, a, a wider background.  He was a, you know, we had things in common and that was really, that was nice.
Speaker 1: Did you think, I don't know if I should ask this question, but did, from what, the way you described your, your high school life, did you think that you would end up marrying a black man at--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that, there was that issue.  I mean, in other words, I don't even know if it was an issue of, of black or white at that point, it was just a, who will I, if I go to Yale who will I marry?  Well you know what I mean?  If, if I don't marry somebody from Yale, will I be too threatening to, to a person, to a man, because of, of my college education which was, you know, really, I mean it is, and it isn't an issue but, but yeah.  No, I did.  I didn't, I dated white guys in high school [The High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, Houston, Texas] but it never occurred to me that I was gonna marry one.  And so I married Nat.
Story_ID: 270041
Speaker 1: So you got married a year after high school, I mean after, after Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now, now and your major in Yale was, I guess, in theater (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) American studies.
Speaker 1: I mean, American studies.
Speaker 2: American studies.
Speaker 1: That's right, not, not even theater, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: American studies.  And were you at any of the [HistoryMaker] Lloyd Richards play, plays when you were--
Speaker 2: No, because, I mean, that's the drama school [Yale School of Drama, New Haven, Connecticut] and they're, they're two separate entities.  And so the shows that I did were at, called the Yale Dramat [Yale Dramatic Association].  So various undergrad, you know, various people have gone to Yale as an undergraduate.  Dick Cavett graduated from Yale and did a lot of stuff for the Dramat.  Sam Waterston who's on 'Law and Order,' he was, graduated and from Yale undergrad and did lots of work at the Yale Dramat.  And so that's where I, I did most of my performing.
Story_ID: 270042
Speaker 1: After you graduated [from Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --now, you, you waited a year to get married but what did you do in that year?  Did you, did you try to get involved in shows (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was in New York [New York], we were in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were both in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you immediately get involved in the arts in New York or--
Speaker 2: No, I immediately got pregnant.  And so, (laughter) so at that time Nat [Adderley, Jr.] was musical directing a show, a woman named Vivian Reed, I don't know if you know her, she did 'Bubbling Brown Sugar'?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And she had a show in Europe, or that took her to Europe, and so he went on the road with her.  And so then I moved back to Houston [Texas] to have the baby with my, you know, with my mom [Velma McAfee Williams] there because he wasn't going to be there.  And then when he, but as fate would have it, he got back, the baby was a week late and he got back early so he was there for the birth of our first child.  And then we just, we stayed in Houston for several years and that's where I started, that's where I got my equity card, that's where I, you know, started performing professionally and that then led me back to New York.  I did shows in San Francisco [California] and Chicago [Illinois] and Florida.  And then the last show that I did was a show in Florida and my agent called me and said, you know, I've got an audition for you, it's a new Andrew Lloyd Webber Broadway musical and they're looking for an androgynous female actually, like a grace, a woman with a, a heavy, you know, sultry voice to be, to possibly play this androgynous character called Electra, the Electric Car.  And I went in and they said that you have to skate.  And I was like well I don't know how to skate.  And so I went in and they didn't see me for that part at all, they told me, they told me to go back, they didn't, they weren't interested in seeing me and wanted me to come back the next day to audition for a different character, Belle the Sleeping Car and that's the character that I ended up playing.  And she's very much sort of a Lena Horne, you know, like Lena Horne on a, on a column, she was Lena Horne in a, in a train dump.  She was a broken down sleeping car and that's what (laughter) I was.  So that was my Broadway debut.
Speaker 1: Now this is in 'Starlight Express,' right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Starlight Express,' yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now what, what year is this?  This is a--
Speaker 2: This was '80 [1980], '89 [1989], '90 [1990], it ran for two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 270043
Speaker 1: Seventy-nine [1979] to '90 [1990], you did a lot of shows all over the country?
Speaker 2: I did a lot of regional theater.
Speaker 1: Regional like--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Texas, and San Francisco [California] and Chicago [Illinois] and Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were these like a musical theater (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was all musical theater pre- predominantly, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I did a, I did legit plays or, or plays without music in high school [at The High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, Houston, Texas] and college [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] but my professional career has primarily been comprised of musical theater.
Speaker 1: Did you like do, do dinner theater type things or, or--
Speaker 2: No, it was always regional theater.  I never did that, I never did dinner theater.  It was, you know, like Arena Stage [Mead Center for American Theater] in [Washington] D.C. or the Alley Theatre in Houston [Texas] or--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: --do, do they still have the Kenley Players in Ohio, did you do any of that?
Speaker 2: I didn't do that.  I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: I didn't, I didn't.  So.
Speaker 1: They used to do shows, they'd go from Columbus [Ohio] to Indianapolis [Indiana] to Dayton [Ohio], and, you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --on a run and they would usually have some well-known star, you know, from a TV show or something.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, I don't know.  Elizabeth Montgomery or somebody might be--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the main star but the cast would go from town to town--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --in the Midwest, you know, that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you did, you did a lot, how many different kinds of, I mean, what are the different plays that you did in that ten year span?
Speaker 2: I did 'Little Shop of Horrors' a gazillion times, more times than I care to recount.  And I did a wonderful show, the show that got me to Broadway was a show called 'A... My Name is Alice' which was a musical revue where twenty-two different writers submitted material that ultimately was used.  I mean, more than that submitted it but twenty-two different writers material was, was, was used to create this revue that was sort of an, an overview of, of everything it is to, to be a woman, from birth to death.  And, and I did that several, I did it in Texas, I did it in San Francisco, then I did it in Chicago.  And that, that's what I sort of, that's the vehicle that got me to, to Broadway, that got me the recognition that then got me to New York [New York] was 'A... My Name is Alice.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did 'Kiss Me, Kate,' 'Bye Bye Birdie,' you know.  Those are some of the--
Speaker 1: And it's all the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) the leading parts that I did.
Speaker 1: --a lot of the, seem like a lot of the classic musicals.
Speaker 2: Right, that's what I'm saying.  I mean, and I played like in 'Bye Bye Birdie' I was Rose Alvarez which isn't too far of a stretch, I mean, theoretically she's supposed to be Spanish (laughter) even though she's often most, you know, played, I mean, Janet Leigh, ended up playing her in the, in the film because they said that Chita Rivera was too ethnic looking.
Speaker 1: To, these (unclear).
Speaker 2: Excuse me, (laughter) you know what I mean?  She was too ethnic looking to, to play a Spanish person.  She's Spanish, okay.  Go figure.  So but yeah, I mean, and so I had several roles where they were traditionally white roles but they, I had built a reputation and they didn't care so they just they hired me.
Speaker 1: I'm trying to think of the lady who, Juanita Moore [sic. Juanita Hall], the, the black woman that played, well maybe I have her name wrong, Juanita, I know--
Speaker 2: Juanita--
Speaker 1: --I know her first name is Juanita.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and what--
Speaker 1: And she played, she was in 'Flower Drum Song,' play, played the Chinese woman--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --plays, she was in 'South Pacific'--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --she played the lead [Bloody Mary].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Singing) "Keep talking Apita [ph.] talking about things you like to do" ['Happy Talk'].
Speaker 1: I know she was a black woman that--
Speaker 2: Yep, that's right.
Speaker 1: --most people never knew who she was.
Speaker 2: But, but exactly.  But, but here again, that's how my ma, I mean, 'cause my mom [Velma McAfee Williams] said see, you know, [HistoryMaker] Janet [Adderley], she's black and nobody, you know, she, you know, she plays all kinds of roles and this.  And so I was aware of those things be, because my mother made me aware of those things.  So then I then didn't define myself that way, I just thought, okay, well I'm just, I'm right for this part, period, and therefore you will give it to me, (laughter) you know.  Which had its blessings and its downside because then I would go in and audition for black roles and they would say that I wasn't ethnic enough and I don't think it had anything to do with my features, it had to do with this, you know, what I mean, oops, there's a microphone.  But you know what I mean, it just had, because I just, I didn't have that kind of a sensibility, I had an everyman sensibility.
Story_ID: 270044
Speaker 1: You had mainstreamed so much where you were--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --like--
Speaker 2: Right.  I, my daughter faces the same thing.  My, my younger daughter [Alana Adderley] who at this point is pursuing a career in, in music and theater, you know.  Well, it's thank God, for Halle Berry.  I mean, I really do feel like I was born ten years, fifteen years too soon.  And I'm so thrilled that the Halle Berrys and the Rosario Dawsons and the this, that and, you know what I mean?  That it, it isn't such an issue.  It isn't such a, you know, no, is it where it should be?  Absolutely not.  But there are all of these, you know, amazing, beautiful, vibrant black actresses that are hired because they're who they are.  That they want Halle Berry for this role, they don't care that this was written originally for, you know, this sort of person or that sort of person, or they want, you know, the girl on, on 'Friends' that was wonderful to see, and I can't remember that actress' name but she, she was a love interest for one of the, the, the three guys on, on, on 'Friends.'  That was fantastic.  So I--
Speaker 1: Oh, you're talking about Aisha Tyler?
Speaker 2: Aisha, fabulous.
Speaker 1: Aisha Tyler, yeah (unclear).
Speaker 2: Fabulous.
Speaker 1: You think that that does it ever matter?
Speaker 2: Does it ever matter?
Speaker 1: Does it matter, I mean, that who, who plays a role.  I, in terms of what they look like and, and, and their persona--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --does it ever matter?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I mean, yeah, yes, certain stories can't be told unless they're told, you know, through a certain lens.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, but so many stories are universal stories.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know.  So many and, and it shouldn't be, I mean here again, you know, the, the stories, that, that [HistoryMaker] Debra [Martin Chase] has told are, are universal stories, stories that are universal.  And so the fact that she's been able to then, you know, utilize nontraditional casting as much as she can.  I mean, that 'Cinderella' we told, we, we, that came out of conversations that she and I had about my career, it's a musical, it's a fantasy, why can't the fairy godmother be Whitney Houston?  (Laughter) Do you know what I mean?  She's a fairy godmother.  But until, you know, it took, it took a producer like Debra, who had the power to say, you know, what?  Cinderella can be a little girl of color and how wonderful that is then for little girls of color sitting there watching it seeing that that their story is, that they, that, that we are all the same.  So ultimately you look at it and you don't, you know, I have students at this school [The Adderley School for the Performing Arts]  that they look at Cinderella and they just see Cinderella, they don't see oh, that's a black Cinderella.  And, and I think that that is important, that's hugely important, that they just, that they just take the experience.  And that they, that everybody that a little white girl looking at, at, at Brandy as Cinderella totally relates to her, just like I as a black girl looked at Lesley Ann Warren and, and related.  I didn't, I didn't see that Lesley Ann Warren was different to me.  I just, you know what I mean?  And it's how wonderful it is that it's going the other way, that little white girls are seeing these amazing black role models and they just wanna be Halle Berry when they grow up, not a black Halle Berry, they just wanna be Halle Berry (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 270045
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now oh, well tell us about 'Starlight Express.' Now you, you did a lot of musical theater for--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --ten years all over the place.  Now did the, did the, was the travel tough on your marriage?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And that's why we divorced.  I mean, we were, we were babies having babies.  And on top of that, I mean, 'cause I, I, I had my first daughter, I had just turned twenty-two, and Nat [Adderley, Jr.] had just turned twenty-three, so just imagine yourself (laughter) at twenty-three.
Speaker 1: I couldn't imagine it--
Speaker 2: You know what I mean, a father.
Speaker 1: --I didn't have kids until I was thirty-two.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  So, so that was a huge part of it.  And also the fact that we were two struggling artists.  And as we've, you know, as history, you know, tells us, it's just very hard to have two artists in a, in a marriage.  Somebody's gotta take care of the other, you know, somebody's gotta be the one that's taking care of, of, of the other one.  And so when there's two artists, nobody's taking care of anybody, they're, you know.  So it did, it was hard.  And I'm happy to say that we are dear friends at this point and that's, that's a good thing.  And we have a, our family is intact, our girls, you know, we do things together as a family and his new wife [Ann Adderley] and two children are lovely and, you know, so that's good.  But I got 'Starlight,' interestingly enough, 'cause I had been in New York [New York] only a week and it was my first audition and I was hired as the standby for this girl named Sedgeway [ph.] who had, who had done it in London [England] but she was actually American who, and she'd never made any, she'd never had any success in America.  And so she was coming to Broadway to claim her own country in her own, you know, place finally because of the notoriety that she had gotten in London.  So I was hired as her standby.  And then--
Speaker 1: Now, now did she play the main role in the play?
Speaker 2: She played the, she played, in, in any musical there's a, an ingenue lead male, female, and there's probably a mature lead male, female, and Belle [the Sleeping Car] was the mature lead, female lead--
Story_ID: 270046
Speaker 1: This is the car the, the--
Speaker 2: The Sleeping Car [Belle]--
Speaker 1: --the sleeping car.
Speaker 2: --the broken down sleeping car.  Now when she was in London [England] she was sort of more a, a Tina Turner sleeping car which, you know, even though Tina is sixty, I mean, she is, in her glow, I mean she's unbelievable.  I mean she's a, I love her.  She's, this, this recent performing set that she's been doing, she said the, the, the skirt is as a short but the boots are taller, so she's, so she's not showing quite as much leg but I mean she's still an amazing specimen of a woman.  And so when it, it came here originally, Andrew Lloyd Webber, he, I was hired then he decided that he didn't even want that character in the show, he wrote that character out of the show all together.  And I was devastated, I had moved my family, put my, you know, daughters [Akina Adderley and Alana Adderley] in private school in New York [New York], you know, reconciled with my husband [Nat Adderley, Jr.], we were gonna be, you know, we were gonna do, and then they write this character out of the show.  And three weeks into the rehearsal process, Trevor Nunn, who was the director, was adamant with Andrew saying that they will rake us over the coals in the reviews if we don't have this character, the show really needs this moment where all the racing and everything stops and it is a true musical theater moment, not this rock and roll skating musical.  And so then Andrew said well I'll have to be convinced of that.  So he flew over and wanted to then audition himself any perspective Belles.  All the other casting had been done by Trevor Nunn and, and the, and Arlene Phillips, I think, was the choreography but Andrew wanted to fly over and hand pick his Belle.  And they weren't going to see me because he won't, at that point he wanted Belle to be sort of a cameo appearance ala, Grizaby [ph.], he wanted her to be the Grizabella ['Cats'] of 'Starlight [Express]' as it were.  So he wanted her to be much older and he wanted her to be a celebrity.  And I, again, the sort of strong person that I am, I was adamant.  I called my agent up and I said I don't care what he wants, they gave me the part, they gave me the standby, the least he can do is allow me to go in there and sing.  I don't care if he looks at his feet the whole time, you know, I, I, you can't do that.  I moved my whole family and now you're gonna tell me I can't even audition?  So they, they allowed me to go in and I sang and Trevor Nunn said to me, you know, you're really wonderful, we really enjoy you but you're really too young for this.  And you're, you're giving us Tina Turner and we need her to be more like Lena Horne.  And I said well all I'm doing is repeating what I thought you, you know, that's who she was in London, if you tell me you need Lena Horne then I'll give you Lena Horne.  So I left and he called my agent and gave me notes, he wanted me to go, come back in and recreate her with the, with these things in mind.  Instead of a woman in the, in her glory, in the prime of her life, he wanted to see a woman who's glory was behind her and she was reflecting and reminiscing about her days in, of glory, her days in the sun, a la Grizabella.  You know, memories, that's sort of thing.  So, you know, I changed, you know, I, I, I ratted my hair so that it was nice and frizzy.  I put, I put makeup on to, to give the illusion of, you know, dark circles and, and, and then, and instead of standing up and singing it, I sat on a stool and I sang it.  And, you know, very reflectively and, and all of that and, and when I left Andrew turned to Trevor and said, "If that girl sings my song you may have a Belle in your show."  And so I was hired.  And then--
Speaker 1: That's sounds just like him (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And I did it for two years.  And became his little sweetheart, he just adored, when Sarah Brightman came to town to do '[The] Phantom [of the Opera]' he, you know, [HistoryMaker] Janet [Adderley], and he had me come over and meet Sarah.  And, and there was all this brouhaha because, of course, the lyrics for the original Belle in England were Tina Turner lyrics.  So then he had to rewrite them more as a reflective Belle and so he rewrote the lyrics and then the, the lyricists had other lyrics that he wanted me to sing.  So I'll never forget the first, we had an invited audience preview, I was presented with three different sets of lyrics to sing.  And I asked my director, I said, "Well Trevor what, what should I do?  I, I have always been taught I do what the director tells me to do not what the writer, not what the, I don't care who they are."  So Trevor says, "You sing this, the lyrics that we've worked on all during rehearsal."  So I started to sing and then Andrew jumped up, "That's it, that's it, I'm pulling my show!"  I mean, and there was just this big, so then, that we had to stop the, the run through and there are people in the audience, we had to stop the run through and Trevor and Andrew and Richard Stilgoe, I think was his name, all went out into the lobby and had this huge catfight about whose, you know, whose, who was gonna be top dog basically, whose lyrics were going to stay.  And I was embroiled in this whole, you know, controversy, and it was wonderful.
Speaker 1: Controversy?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It was wonderful, it was good.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how long did you do that show?
Speaker 2: I did it for two years, it ran for two years and I did it the whole two years.  I missed one week to go to Hawaii with my family but I, I did it for two years.
Speaker 1: So this is '89 [1989] to--
Speaker 2: Eighty-nine [1989], it was actually, it opened in '88 [1988], I think, so, '88 [1988], '89 [1989], no '87 [1987], '88 [1988], '89 [1989] and it closed in, I think, February of, of 1990 [sic. March 1987 - January 1989], I think it did.
Story_ID: 270047
Speaker 1: How were your reviews, how did they review you?
Speaker 2: I got great reviews.  The, the show ['Starlight Express'] got mixed reviews but I got great reviews across the board.  And my favorite one was Liz Smith who's the gossip, gossip columnists for the paper.  She said, "And there's this one good old-fashioned, Broadway moment where Janet Williams Adderley [HistoryMaker Janet Adderley], playing Belle the Sleeping Car laments about her days of glory, spectacular, exclamation point," and that's how she ended her review.  So that was my favorite review.  And then I did, I did commercials.  Once the show closed I said I remained in New York [New York] for a year and did commercials and different things.  And was hired by this British company to do a, a, a Murphy's [Irish Stout] beer commercial which I think is an Irish beer, actually.  And British commercials are shot very much like mini films, not like American commercials are.  And I had such a great time and I had never any interest in doing TV or film, I was a, a theater actress.  But I had such a great time on that shoot that I decided that I wanted to come to California to, to see if I could get into film and TV.  And I also felt that, because by that time, Nat [Adderley, Jr.] and I had separated for the, you know, well actually that's not true, we reconciled again once I was out here, but we had, we had separated and I was a single mom with the two girls [Akina Adderley and Alana Adderley] and I just thought, this is a hard road for them in Manhattan [New York, New York] and so I wanted them to, to, to be in a, in a place where they could have a front yard.  So those are the two reasons that I moved out here.
Story_ID: 270048
Speaker 1: What year is that?
Speaker 2: That was nine, I wanna say '91 [1991], '90 [1990], '91 [1991].  And, and I continued to do theater from here.  And then I got a wonderful opportunity, I was hired for a television series called 'Sweet Justice,' that starred Cicely Tyson and Melissa Gilbert, 'Little House on the Prairie.'  And I played this character Ruby [ph.] who owned a supper club, very similar to in 'Ally McBeal.'  Are you familiar with that television series?  All the lawyers would go to this supper club and hang out and there was this woman, Vonda [Shepard] somebody that sang.  So that was basic, that was sort of the premise of, of, of the, we were the precursor to that, that, that the lawyers in Cicely's firm would come to my supper club, Ru-- Ruby's [ph.] and hang out.  And so it was a recurring role.  And if they, if it had been picked up for a second season, I was going to then become a season regular and actually even get to sing.  It, it would be sort of it like, there's a, there's a restaurant in New York [New York] called Chez Josephine's, which is owned by one of her adopted sons, Jean-Paul [sic. Jean-Claude Baker].
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And that's Josephine Baker, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and that's a, it was gonna be sort of like that, it was gonna be where they'd come in and I'd, I'd sing and entertain.  I was very excited about it.  And then they canceled the show.  And so it became, again, it, it just, I had these two daughters and either I was working, so I was providing for them but I was away from them or I wasn't working and I was with them and money was tight.  And so I had started a, a little class for my younger daughter because she was very, very shy, she was incredibly shy.  And I thought that, just like it had helped my brother get over his shyness, a theater class for my daughter would be great.  And so the combinat- the impetus for me doing it was to be a good mom and to help my daughter with some of her issues and it then became my livelihood and my second career.  So from one class of fifteen kids, you know, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, now what year is this when you started the class?
Speaker 2: I started it, Alana [Adderley] was, I wanna say she was nine or eight, so this was probably '94 [1994] or ninety--yeah, '94 [1994], ninety, ninety, ninety, somewhere around there.
Story_ID: 270049
Speaker 1: What venue did you use for your class?
Speaker 2: Well, I would rent studio space from various different dance schools or, you know, theaters and I would rent theater space to have the shows.  And one class then became two classes because my older daughter [Akina Adderley] wanted me to do a class for her friends.  And then two classes became three hundred students and so I got to the point that I was too big to keep renting space from other people and then we built, we built this, this studio space [for The Adderley School for the Performing Arts].  One of my parents was an architect and he designed it and, and built it for me.  And the rest is history.  So here, we're, now we're celebrating ten years in this space and I've opened another studio in Santa Barbara [California].
Speaker 1: Now, now, are, are you funded entirely by tuition from the parents?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah, it's not nonprofit or there's no grants or anything, it's all--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is a purely business--
Speaker 2: For profit, yes.
Speaker 1: --for profit.
Speaker 2: Business, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 270050
Speaker 1: What are all the subjects that you teach here [The Adderley School for the Performing Arts]?
Speaker 2: Strictly musical theater.  We have a dance program that is, runs in connection with the musical theater program but we are a musical theater school and we do abridged versions of Broadway musicals.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Well, what, what are some of the musicals you've done so far?
Speaker 2: Our favorites?  The kids love 'Guys and Dolls,' they love 'Grease,' they love 'Oklahoma!,' they love 'The Wiz,' they love 'Hello, Dolly!,' and 'Annie.'  'Annie' is hugely successful.  And then they love the, the new ones too, they love 'Hairspray,' and they love, what's another new one?  'Chicago' which is actually not new it's old but it's, it's currently on Broadway.  So things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have to do a lot of abridging for say something like 'Chicago' (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, abridging and tailor, I mean, you know, 'Grease,' of course, is very mature and we do 'Grease' with five years olds and so then we have to rewrite lyrics and edit things.  And so the shows, for the younger kids, the shows are anywhere from forty to forty-five minutes to an hour long.  And then we have four advanced classes that do, you know, the, the largest amount of a, of a script, where there's a first act and the intermission and then the second act.  And, and so those shows end up being two hours with an intermission.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now so you teach all aspects of musical theater?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, dance--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --acting, voice.  So we, we now have a vocal workshop studio that is strictly private vocal training.  I teach and coach kids privately on voice and acting.  And then I have a woman, Gabrielle Navin who's the head of our dance department and she is a phenomenal chorographer and is, I mean, she should be choreographing for Broadway but I'm lucky enough to have her.  And she has an amazing gift to make non-dancers look amazing, you know, kids.
Speaker 1: Not, not every Broadway performer can actually dance (unclear)--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --though it's required?
Speaker 2: Right.  I mean, it--
Speaker 1: And you--
Speaker 2: --you should, if you're gonna do it correctly, you should be a triple threat, you should have, be equally trained in dance, voice, and acting.  If, to have the widest hirability, widest range of hirability.
Story_ID: 270051
Speaker 1: Do you have a certain teaching philosophy that you use, 'cause I know sometimes theater and can be, well it can be, it can be, there are some tough teach, teachers--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know.  I mean, you can make the little kids cry or you can--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and I don't know how you (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I've seen grown people cry doing a show.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Me, me one of 'em.  I, my teaching technique it, it sounds really sort of silly but Mary Poppins, which is just, it's tough love.  If you, if you dissect how Mary Poppins got those children to, to evolve and to grow it's, it's tough love, it's my, it's grand, it's what my [maternal] grandmother [Susie Johnson McAfee] taught me.  So in, so in other words, you're incredibly nurturing and a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down, but the, but the medicine is gonna go down, you understand what I'm saying?  And so I have a, and I think it's something that, that, that many of these children because most of my clientele are, are white children, they, they don't have that strong grandmother, you know, figure in their life.  And it's a, it's a different way of approach, I, I demand nothing less, less than excellence.  That's what my grandmother always used to say to me, "I demand nothing less than excellence" and therefore we gave it to her.  And you, you get from children what you expect of children.  And so I absolutely expect that they will, will do their absolute best and strive to be their best selves.  And so consequently they do.  And when, when reprimanding or criticism or any of that is required, I, I do it but for every negative or critical thing that I say to a child, I make sure that before they leave the door I say ten amazingly embracing or positive supportive things.  And, and because, yes this is a theater school [The Adderley School for the Performing Arts], yes we teach musical theater, yes we teach dance, but these kids aren't coming to us because they, they wanna be, you know, musical theater performers when they grow up, not, there is a, there is a percentage of them absolutely, but that's not why they're here.  It really is more about empowerment and, and confidence and, and instilling these kids with the, with the ability to step into their own life whatever they, wherever they choose to live it or however they choose to live it, knowing that they, that they're in control, that that the power is within them.  That's one of the things that I always say to the kids that '[Star Wars] Return of the Jedi' that the guy says, "May the force be with you," and I say to them, no, may the force be in you.  And so, so on that side of it, it's, that's my teaching technique.  As a, as an actor, my teacher technique is, is inside out, is dealing with subtext.  I feel, therefore I speak.  So if, you know, if I say something, why have I said it, it's because I felt thus and so, this, and, you know what I mean, and, and kids are very, that's, that's a very clear way of getting children to understand dialogue.  It's, it's how they feel, what, why would you say that?  And so it, so I work from the inside out, which is the outside in.  But sometimes you have to work from the outside in.  This, this girl, Alicia [ph.], was not a natural actress, just not a natural actress at all.  And there were times, and it was an interesting exercise for me because I am so internal, where I had to figure out how the camera would read an exterior action and, and they would, it would, it would parade itself or, or, or, you know, it would reflect as an emo- as a certain emotion even though it was a mannerism that I was having her do.  But that was a, that's, it's not the way I like to work.  I, I really like to work from the inside out.
Story_ID: 270052
Speaker 1: How do you, now, I know this probably has to pop up, it pops up with adults so, and I would think with immature kids it would pop up--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) since they are not mature yet--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --how do you deal with, deal with young divas and people that have--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --attitudes about--
Speaker 2: --dear, dear, dear, dear (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, you know, you--
Speaker 2: And they--
Speaker 1: --you, you see kids have tantrums in just playing with toys and games and stuff with each other, do they ever really (unclear)--
Speaker 2: It, it goes back to, you, the power is within them.  In other words, that is inacceptable, unacceptable behavior.  And so I lay that down and then if they choose to, to be that way, then they choose to reap the, you know, the outcome of, of their behavior.  And so I'm, I really am very much a, you know, accountability person.  I, I instill accountability in children very early on.  So that they do know that they have, that they, you know, like there was an example, there was a little five year old girl and her mother said goodbye and left but the mother forgot to kiss her, so the little girl is screaming and crying and just having a good old temper tantrum in the middle of the class.  And so I said to her, I said, "Big girl," I said, "you can't do this in this room."  I said, "If you want to cry, you're gonna need to go outside."  I said, "You're gonna have to make a choice."  I said, "Your mother is not coming back.  She'll be, she'll be back in an hour and a half.  She's not gonna be back before that.  So that's not going to change.  So what do you have control over?  You can cry out in the hall for an hour and a half and not have any fun and sit there by yourself or you can stop crying, engage with us, have a wonderful time and, and, and have something to show for your hour and a half and then your mother will pick you up but either way she's not gonna come back for an hour and a half."  So it's that kind of absolutely reasoning with them.  And this is a community of incredibly entitled people.  This, the school [The Adderley School for the Performing Arts] base reads like a who's who of, of the most powerful people in Hollywood.  And so yes, there are a lot of entitled diva type young people that that come through here, but I instill the idea that we are an ensemble that that's, that is the, the beauty of being an actor, that's the beauty of being in theater, is that you come together as this unit, as this family, we call it a, an ensemble is a fancy French word for team is what I say to them.  And it, and the sum is always gonna be, the whole is always gonna be greater than the sum of its part, that's a mantra that I, that I always have with them.  And I will say to them, you know, repeat after me, I'm not the center of the universe, I'm not the center of the universe.  The sooner I learn that, the sooner I learn that, the healthier I'll be, the healthier I'll be.  I mean, and we, it really is about them learning that it, that it's about teamwork.  And so each, each class is double cast.  So every single child that comes through the door experiences what it is to be the, the lead or the, the, you know, to plant their feet and, and hello world here I am.  And equally important on their second performance they're ensemble, to give their, their, their buddy, the person sitting next to them, their fellow man, the opportunity to do just the same thing and to be, to support their efforts in that.  And so that's one of the things that we really work on here is, is just, is, is, is, is living in grace, living a, a, a grace full life.  And that's very important so it's interesting that you would, you would mention that but we-
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --we, we don't, we don't have divas and we don't put with up divas.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And we've had to lose a couple.  I mean, you know, that, because the parents are bigger divas sometimes than the children are and they don't appreciate my sense of teamwork and so they move on.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's interesting.  (Unclear) I know theater does develop a, it can develop like a self-confidence that goes beyond--
Speaker 2: (Nodding head).
Speaker 1: --I mean, that, that's the value of--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There's, there's a huge difference between self-confidence--
Speaker 1: And being (unclear), yeah.
Speaker 2: --and self-centeredness.
Speaker 1: And it also does develop that teamwork (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --to put on, especially a musical show--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --people have to play roles and they have to, they have to know what role they're playing and do the best they can and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely, absolutely.  And it's just, that's where the joy is.  It's the big production numbers where they're all together and their voices are ringing out and, and they just, they sound like a million bucks.
Story_ID: 270053
Speaker 1: Now as you said you were, you deal with mostly affluent people--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --with money and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and are there any, do, do you have any scholarships available for those--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --who--
Speaker 2: Well I just don't charge them, that's my scholarship.  I mean, at one point I tried, I looked into grants and having a, a foundation or something and I, it just never happened.  And so I just, I just don't charge them.  I--
Speaker 1: So do you base the scholarships on, on talent or on need to--
Speaker 2: Both.
Speaker 1: --develop a--
Speaker 2: Both.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Both.  I mean, I'm, I am completely dedicated to defer- diversifying my student body and it's not easy in the [Pacific] Palisades [Los Angeles, California] to do that.  I mean, I think, I may have four African American kids in the whole school [The Adderley School for the Performing Arts].  And, and one of the four has been scholarshipped the entire time she's been here practically because I know, I mean, she, she is talented but even if she weren't, I know that her family doesn't have the means to, to do this on an ongoing basis and she just loves it and so that's important to me--
Story_ID: 270054
Speaker 1: So now--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you have two schools [of The Adderley School for the Performing Arts]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you've expanded, you've been, you know, been going since 1991--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --right?  You got two schools, now?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: One in--
Speaker 2: Here in the [Pacific] Palisades [Los Angeles, California] and one in Santa Barbara [California].
Speaker 1: In Santa Barbara.
Speaker 2: And I, I want to open a third that I would own, I think, if I have enough energy and then I wanna franchise.
Speaker 1: Where would the third one be?
Speaker 2: Either Pasadena [California] where my sister is and my niece is there or some place like Manhattan Beach [California].  But because the school to support itself needs to be in a certain, it needs to be in a, in affluent communities or, or communities where there are affluent people that are, it's easily accessible to them.  And I don't want it to get to big that I couldn't manage it so that's why, and I like beach communities, so that's why Santa Barbara, Palisades, Manhattan Beach would be perfect for me but also Pasadena would be good because again I have relatives there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we always ask this question--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Oh, before I ask this, are you, do, do you have any plans to do any more performing yourself, I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's interesting that you would say that.
Speaker 1: --you're young, you're still young, you're not (unclear)--
Speaker 2: That, that's interesting that you would say that, yes I do.  I'd love too.  And I just, I've just come to that conclusion recently so it's interesting that you ask.  But I'm thinking in the months to come I'm gonna mount a, a, you know, a one woman Josephine Baker, cabaret show, I mean, that's how I got my start in the first place.  And, and because of, of the relationships that I've built with the, the community here, I, I have a ready-made audience base.  So it's just about me doing it at this point and it's something that I definitely now know that I wanna do and I miss.  I, it was important to me, I said that once upon a time to a friend of mine, that my primary job at one point in my life was nurturing, I had two children [Akina Adderley and Alana Adderley] and that was my job was so I thought well if that's my primary job then I will just nurture for a living.  And that is when I finally was able to give up my own career to, to go full force into this, to, to the school because it was, it was so simpatico with what my real purpose was.  And so now that my daughters are, are grown and very successful or on the way to being successful but successful in themselves, very happy people, maybe there is time to, to at least, you know, start where I left off.  I mean, huge career, I, I can't, I don't know, but performing, absolutely.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Oh, dear God.  I hope, I hope there's a law that makes rap music illegal.  That is the biggest, biggest tragedy I feel in our culture because, because our music has been, has always been such an important component of who and what we are, so that if our music is sitting around talking about "B" this and "F" that and guns this and shoot that and da, da, da, you know, the, the kids, just where are they gonna go with that, where, what are the, what are gonna be their role models, what are gonna be their aspirations, are they gonna aspire to be gangbangers or are they gonna to aspire to be, you know, president of the United States?  The, the, the chances are that it's gonna be more of the former verses the latter.  And that's, it's a, it's a tragedy.  It's, I would love to see, to continue to see strong, black leaders coming to the forefront in politics and education.  I mean, you know, and I can never remember how to pronounce his name but O, O, Obama--
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Barack Obama, yeah.
Speaker 2: But Obama, yes.  I pray that he's president of the United States, you know, some day or certainly continues on the path that he's on.  That's hugely, hugely important.  Yeah, that, I mean, my biggest concern is youth and education and, and instilling in them, having, you know, it's wonderful what, you know, Jada Pinkett [Smith] is doing, she's written a book ['Girls Hold Up This World,' Jada Pinkett Smith] now, a book for, for girls to inspire girls and I don't know that she's, I don't know that she's even isolated it to, to black, to girls of color, she's just to girls period but the whole concept that that you can achieve whatever you set out for.  And, and if there were, just were more celebrities that were, celebrities and athletes that were continuing to, to, to go into the neighborhoods and to, to, to be a balance at least for this horrible music that these kids listen to.  Because, you know, children, many of the, many of the things like Mary Poppins, many of the things that, that have, have shaped who I am as a human being are, are things that my parents [Velma McAfee Williams and John Williams] knew, knew nothing about.  You know, your parents are absolutely a strong force for you but your social environment is, is equally as strong.  And that stuff becomes like a bible and they're just, so the, it's almost like when we were growing up in the '60s [1960s] all of that, you gotta be better than, you've gotta strive, you gotta, we've lost sense of that as a, as a people.  And so fewer and fewer or fewer and fewer people are striving and, and, and, and attaining and achieving and more and more of the, of the populous of, of who we are as a, as a, as a people, are struggling and feeling bleak and feeling like opportunity is not there.  So I'd love to get a handle on that.  I'd love to, to, to hopefully turn that around in some way.
Story_ID: 270056
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I would have applied myself more in college.  College for me was a lot, was, as it is for many people, was really about growing up and I would have applied myself academically more in college.  So if I had it to do over again, I'd love to go back to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and study or some other university and study.  I, I don't know, I would, I would be closer to my family because I'm not as you could tell (laughter) in the beginning of this interview.  I would, I--
Speaker 1: In what sense, meaning, meaning your, your nuclear family or your--
Speaker 2: My nuc- my, my, my parents [Velma McAfee Williams and John Williams].  I'm incredibly close with my two daughters [Akina Adderley and Alana Adderley] but I'm not as close to my parents as, as I would have liked to have been.  I was very close, extremely close with my [Maternal] grandmother [Susie Johnson McAfee] but I'm not as close to my parents as I would have liked to have been.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I feel, I, I had a sense you were very close to your daughters.
Speaker 2: I'm extremely close to my daughters.
Speaker 1: But, but in that regard your mother's a mathematician, don't that, that doesn't necessarily define who she is but she's a mathematician--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --your father, an optometrist.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now how do they feel about a daughter being involved in the arts, I mean, were they, did they have like a lot of fear in the beginning?
Speaker 2: Oh, huge.  My father didn't want me to at all.  He was, he was adamantly opposed to me pursuing a career in theater.  My mom was my biggest fan.  She, you know, even though she's a, a mathematician and, and, and an intellectual, she, as I said, we were members of the, we had seasons tickets to the opera and the ballet, and the symphony and the Alley Theatre [Houston, Texas] and, and all of that, and so the arts were, you know, were always hugely important to her.  So the fact that I was pursuing a career in the arts was, she was excited about.  She wanted me to, to go to college and to go to grad school but she, but she was excited about my choice, you know, to pursue an acting career.  I don't know, if I had it to do over again, I probably would have, nope, I was gonna say, continue with my career but there, but I don't know that I could have, I just don't know that I could have continued with my career and been the, the mother to my daughters that I, that I am, so, so no.  I think, applied myself more in college and been closer to my parents.
Story_ID: 270057
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done, what, what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well this school is my legacy.  The, the children that I've touched.  My own two children [Akina Adderley and Alana Adderley] are my legacy.  I'm choked up but, yeah.  I'm very, I'm very grateful that I, that this fell in my lap, it was, it was, I, I always knew as I said I've, I've been a teacher since I was seven on the steps of the brownstone in Chicago [Illinois], I always knew that I wanted to, to teach what I know to kids about theater, I just thought it would be later on in life and I certainly did not think it was gonna be to this scale.  And so I'm really grateful that this obviously was a part of my destiny.  And, and I do feel like I've, I've left my mark in all of the people's lives that have been changed or been touched by the time that they've spent here and what they will then go on to do on all sorts of levels, on creative levels on, on the 'To Sir, with Love' level.  In many ways I feel like I've been Sir to this community, not because, not because these children were lacking in financial support and, and all of that but, but in maybe the whole sense of entitlement.  I, I have come in and, and these children have, have gone out of this more gracious, more tolerant, more inquisitive about different because their, their vehicle, their, their, their vehicle for learning is different to them.  And so hopefully then their, their ability to, to interact and to embrace different is greater because they've known me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I didn't ask this, I should have probably asked this question, what, was it difficult to get this started?
Speaker 2: No, not at all.
Speaker 1: I mean to get financing or--
Speaker 2: No.  I mean, that's what I'm saying it was obviously a part of my destiny.  It just, I mean, as I said, I, I, I rented space from people.  And, you know, and when I opened, when I opened this studio I had $5,000 in my pocket or in the bank, saved in the bank.  And one of my parents who is an architect designed it.  I had various, you know, Michael Crichton was a huge supporter and wrote all sorts of letters of recommendation and this one and that one and the other.  And I had another parent who just gave me $10,000 to help build, it cost $80,000 to build the studio.  And it, it really, it really did take on a life of its own and was, was very easy to, to, to build.  And I had been a gypsy, you know, Broadway gypsy, I didn't have to be any place at any point for any length of time that I didn't want to, and when I signed this lease for five years, it was like, oh, my God, God I have to do this, this is who I am for five years at least, this is who I've gotta be so I can pay the rent.  And it, it was daunting.  It was frightening for me because I, I, I hadn't gone to business school, I hadn't, I wasn't a business person, I was an artist.  And we opened to capacity.  We opened the studio February the 15th or, or 17th, ten years ago--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and opened to capacity.  And then I had to hire parents, you know, teachers, I had been the only teacher, and I was like, oh, my God, I can't teach all these kids.  And so then I had to hire a staff and I had to, so, you know, I, I made my little mistakes along the way but, but all in all, it, it's just, this is, and it's, it's, it's almost like this is a vortex in this, in this community [Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California], it's a creative vortex that that the whole community has, has grown from and has value, has benefited from.  So it's bigger than me.  It's, it's, yeah.
Speaker 1: It's something who that, that, well it's time had come, I guess.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the same thing has happened in Santa Barbara [California].  I mean, it was just a fluke.  I had a, a student who used to live here and last year moved to Montecito [California] and was, was, his nanny was schlepping him to the Palisades to, to study here because he wanted to, he wanted to go to [The] Adderley [School for the Performing Arts], he wanted to go to Adderley.  So when I found out that he was doing that, I thought oh, that's terrible.  I'll just, and I live in Santa Barbara so I that oh, I'll start a class for Jack [ph.], this little four year old boy.  And the idea to start the class for him, three and a half weeks later became sixty kids and my own, and a new, another studio, built another studio there and, and we opened there, I, to capacity.  We have classes Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and all of them filled up.  So the time had come.
Story_ID: 270058
Speaker 1: Is there anything I have not asked you, that you think we need to talk about or you need to address.  I know we can't cover everything (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I guess, but, but is there something (unclear) that's (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I just, I, I, I wanna say something for, for clarification, I think, which is it is wonderful the, the way we all pick our battles, do you know what I mean, as black, as black people, as people of color.  It is, it, it has been a, a valuable lesson to me to learn that there are all sorts of, of banners that you can take up.  That the fact that my banner for whatever reasons, by my own design, by, by fate, by whatever, has, has, has been sort of to be the Sidney Poitier, has been to be the, the, the lone black face in a, in a, in a white community that, that teaches, you know, gives insight to this community that they would not necessarily have had about black people were it not for their interaction with me.  I used to, there was a time in my life where I felt guilty about that.  There was a time in my life where I felt, you know, am I a sellout.  And to the contrary, it is, it is, there is, there is room for all of those experiences, there is room for, for, there is room to carry different banners and each of the banners is equally important at hopefully making things better for our children and our children's children in the future.  And so I, I know, I know, I, I've invented the wheel here, but I'm proud of the fact that I've invented the wheel.
Story_ID: 270059
Speaker 1: Well, last question is similar to legacy--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but a little bit different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a good mother, a great mother.  I'd like to be remembered as a, as a good friend.  I'd like to be remembered as someone who cared and felt that it was important to, to take care of each other, to take care of, of who we are as, as human beings.  I'd like to be remembered for someone who tried to live her life in grace.
Story_ID: 270060
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my two daughters, Akina Jalan [ph.] Adderley, and Alana Susan [ph.] Adderley when we lived in Houston, Texas.  I think, Akina, the older one, is probably four or five and Alana is about sixteen months, wait a sec, no, I'm sorry.  Akina, the older one, is probably four and Alana is, is almost two.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  All right.  And tell us about this, please.
Speaker 2: That's me, probably at the age of seven in my very first tap recital.  And it was--
Speaker 1: That's you.
Speaker 2: That's me right there.  And my sister is there, you can't see her, she's sort of tweaked over there behind that little guy there, turn with her head.  And it was our, my first tap recital and I was, the tap instructor thought I was one of the best tappers so he had me, you know, down front and center and all the kids were looking at me and it was just, it was a great time.
Speaker 1: This is in Houston, right?
Speaker 2: In Houston, Texas.  I, I think his name is, I can't remember what his name was but he had tapped with the Nicholas Brothers [HistoryMaker Fayard Nicholas and Harold Nicholas] and all of that and stuff and he was in Houston.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Once again, (unclear).  All right.  Okay.  Thank you.
Speaker 2: These are three of my darling girls.  The one to the, to the right, Alicia Morton, played Annie in the Disney remake of 'Annie' and I was her onset acting coach.  And prior to doing 'Annie,' she had played young Cosette in 'Les Miserables' on Broadway.  And she was replaced by the little sweet Euro-Asian girl in the middle, Stephanie Cohen, who happened to be one of my students here at The Adderley School [for the Performing Arts] which was just an interesting stroke of fate and destiny.  And then the third young Cosette is Alexis Kalehoff.  And her mom is Andrea McArdle who was my roommate in 'Starlight Express' on Broadway, and so I was at Alexis' christening and, and I'm sort of like a mini godmother to her.  And so the three of them, or actually Stephanie's mom had taken this picture of Stephanie when she went to New York [New York] to audition and then a year and a half later, she then replaced Alicia.  And so Stephanie's mom framed this, and, and, and gave it to me, which was very sweet.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: One of the, one of the wonderful things about having this theater school, it's afforded us the opportunity to do lots of performing for fundraisers, for the City of Hope, for the Carousel [of Hope] ball which, which raises money for diabetes and, and MS [multiple sclerosis].  And this was a performance at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] for the race to erase MS.  And Natalie Cole sang 'The Star Spangled Banner' and about thirty of our kids performed with her.  And it, it was hugely rewarding for them to meet her, to be a part of this big fundraiser, and so that's us with the big finish, we call that the big finish.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, talk about being a proud mom, I was, this is one of the proudest days of my life.  This is my older daughter, Akina's graduation from high school.  She graduated from Music and Art [Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York], which is actually her dad's [Nat Adderley, Jr.] alma mater, he graduated from Music and Art, and she was the valedictorian and spoke at the, at the commencement service.  And then went on to, to go to Yale University [New Haven, Connecticut].  And I think we made history in that, I think, Akina, is the first person of color, certainly girl of color, but I think first African American descendant of two Yale graduates who then went on to Yale herself, so that was a very proud moment for her father and me.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Oh, Pops [Julian C. Adderley]. That is my younger daughter, Alana, when she was five at Christmastime.  We had a huge tradition of going to the Adderley's to spend Christmas in Florida or they would come to our home in, in Houston.  And Pops is Alana's great-grandfather, so the, the dad of Cannonball [Adderley] and Nat Adderley.  And he was so loved and so respected in his community.  He was the principal of the high school [sic. guidance counselor, Leon High School] there in Tallahassee [Florida].  And my children couldn't, could not have asked for a better great-grandfather.  He loved them dearly, he loved them madly, and, and he is, he is missed to this day.
