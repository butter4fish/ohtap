Speaker 1: Alright. First thing we do is slate it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe and I'm the interviewer today for the HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Sterns.  Sir, can you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: All right.  Hello world. (Laughter)  I'm D'Army Bailey, and my name is spelled D apostrophe-Capital-A-R-M-Y.  And the last name is Bailey, B-A-I-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: And do you have a middle name?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  I was named after my grandfather.  And I'm not quite sure where he got the name from.  I was told, there was some mention that he had been delivered by a gypsy midwife in Mississippi who named him.  But I honestly don't the voracity of that.  But he spelled it D-A-R-M-Y, Darmy, and that's the way people would call me sometimes, although he went by the initials D.A. Bailey.  And so when I was in the 9th grade in high school, I put the apostrophe in there and made the A big in hopes that people would pronounce it D'Army because that's the way it was pronounced.  And it wasn't until, oh, I came back to Memphis in '76 -- came back in '74, actually, and I got my files from the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] that they'd kept on me.  And the listing on one of the files had Darmy Bailey, D-A-R-M-Y, a.k.a D'Army Bailey and it dawned on me for the first time that in the eyes of the government, I'm actually going around as an alias.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: November 29, 1941 and I was born in Wicks Street in a little, on a street over in South Memphis, right off the corner of Mississippi and Walker.  It's right in the heart of, of the Memphis Black area, but I was born in a shotgun house over there in '41.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Presently, I'm a Circuit Court Judge and that's a State trial judge of civil jurisdiction.  So I handle civil jury trials, non-jury trials on car wrecks.  In fact, medical malpractice.  Just as we speak been carrying on a, into the 5th week of a lawsuit where four doctors and two medical care groups are being sued by a patient who claims that he was injured by their negligence.  And so we have a jury in the box that's been hearing that.  And maybe a car wreck.  I handle divorces, workers compensation, that's non-jury.  And by law, in Tennessee, you cannot sue the State or the Gov -- City or County and have a jury trial.  So whenever there's a lawsuit involving the City, County or State, then that also comes before me without a jury to be heard and along with worker's comps which don't have juries and, and divorces don't have juries.  And, of course, from there it's up to the litigants whether they want a jury or not in our court.  But our jurisdiction is unlimited.  I tried a, here recently, a lawsuit involving Leggett -- not Leggett and Myers, Brown and Williamson, Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds, one of the tobacco litigation suits.  It lasted 4 months where 5 people who had died from smoking, their estates sued the tobacco companies.  And it was a very major lawsuit.  The tobacco industry prevailed in the final analysis for various reasons with those 5 cases.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, we don't want to get too deep into the career, but that's, that tells us what you do.  And, now, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: We're now at June the 24th, ninth, 2003.
Speaker 1: All right.  And where are we at the present time.  And don't give your address.
Speaker 2: Okay, we're at my home in, in Memphis in a beautiful area of Midtown, right near both Rhodes College and the Memphis Zoo.
Story_ID: 624462
Speaker 1: Okay, before we go into depth, there are five People Magazine-ish type questions I'm compelled to ask you.  And they just require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is --
Speaker 2: And don't hesitate to tell me short cause I'm a lawyer by training, you know (laughter).  We get paid by the word.
Speaker 1: Some of them are the shorter answerers.
Speaker 2: That's because they didn't get paid too much.  (Laughter)
Speaker 1: Okay.  Sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I like, I like neck bones.  I like catfish, barbeque, chitterlings.  I guess those probably rank among my favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do --
Speaker 2: Now, that's not good for me.  (laughter)  But you asked me favorite food.
Speaker 1: You're doing all right so far, (unclear).  What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: It's either red or blue.  And I hadn't really given it a lot of thought, but I think since I'm wearing a blue suit, I'll say blue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yes, I love the Autumn.  And I love how you get relief from the heat of the summer and the leaves begin to change and people tend to sort of mellow out a little bit during that period, making the transition before winter.  And it's not as hurried because there's more relaxation coming out of the summer.  So that's my favorite time, although winters are nice, not spectacular here in the South.  Now, when I was in Massachusetts winters were very distinctive because of the deep snow.  In California where I lived six years, you didn't really get many changes of seasons.  It's kind of all the same.  And, in fact, that's what I missed when I lived out there about the South.  I, I love the change of seasons.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see.  Probably all the places I haven't been.  Among the ones that I have been to--it just depends on what period and what time in my life.  I loved Ocho Rios [Jamaica] when my wife and I went there for our honeymoon.  I loved London [England] when I went there for the first time.  And I had a chance to meet Michael X who was the equivalent of Malcolm X in this country and had a chance to meet some radical Journalists over there and go to a couple of, of community-type meetings in London.  I enjoyed Copenhagen.  I enjoyed partying in, in Copenhagen [Denmark] when I was traveling through Europe alone as, just learning the world as best I could with what I could financially.  But Jamaica I love because of the tone and the laid-back environment, I guess.  Mexico is nice, but probably Jamaica is probably one of my favorite places.  Of course, as I said, there are a lot of places in the world I haven't been that I'd love to go.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite phrase or saying? Well, that's it.  Well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 624463
Speaker 1: Alright. Well, let's, let's -- tell me about your -- what you know about your family history?  How, how far can you (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: That gives me time by the way, when I say, well.  That fills in the void while I think about what I'm going to say.  I'm sorry.  What was the --
Speaker 1: Tell me about your family history.  How far back can you trace your family?
Speaker 2: Well, I went on a very nice outing about, over the Memorial Day weekend, up about, oh, sixty miles from Memphis, a little area called LaGrange, Tennessee and met some family folks from along the Bailey line.  My paternal grandfather's family up in LaGrange, Moscow, Tennessee area.  And went to a cemetery, and it's interesting, we couldn't -- we had to park our cars and get in pick-up trucks.  And there were about five pick-up trucks.  And we went through this field and, and this hunting grounds.  And we went back into this field that was farm area that, where, where they'd planted, I guess, otherwise.  And then back in the middle of it is a cemetery that probably had fifty graves.  And the tombstones are around there and at a little small gathering.  And, and there were about, oh, eight or , about eight tombstones of Bailey's there in this little gathering of, you know, this little plot, plot of a cemetery.  And one of them was my great grandfather.  And I was just fascinated.  His name was Feri Bailey F-E-R-I, I think it was.  And so that was the first time that I'd ever been that far to track my grandfather's father up there.  And his tombstone had a Masonic sign on it.  He died in 1922.  And so I've gone at least that far back.  And then we're going to try to see what else we can find past that because we know the town that this lodge was in.  On my maternal, rather on my father's mother's side, my -- which would be my faternal grandmother -- or paternal grandmother, we go periodically my boys -- I have two sons, Justin and Merit.  And we've gone to Gary, Indiana to some of the family reunions of the Johnson-Sease family.  And so that part of the family has a lot of people in Gary and some in Indiana that comes along the line of my father's mother.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Sease?
Speaker 2: S-E-A-S-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And now, I've got to start working on my mother's side because I don't really have a lot of, of history on that.  I, I know her mother, Lorena Robinson, whose, of course, deceased now, that was a -- frankly, I never knew her to really work as such, having a job, but her husband that I did know as my grandfather, step-grandfather actually, had been a chauffeur I think at one time.  And my natural grandfather I never knew and I barely remembered him because when we were born, I just basically remember my mother's mother.  So I don't really have a lot of information going back beyond my grandmother on that side, although that's one of the things I'd like to get more information on.
Story_ID: 624464
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories passed down through your family about what life was like during slavery or, or the Civil War or during Reconstruction?
Speaker 2: No, and that's an interesting question because we've never really talked about it.  I guess being born on the asphalt streets of a developing Southern town like Memphis and South Memphis, the only stories I guess that looked back that far were the ones of the present.  And they were quite interesting.  I remember that the bus used to come down the street where we grew up in South Memphis and pick up people and take them to the cotton field at about 4:00 in the morning each day.  And they would come back at about 6:00 o'clock, take them over to Arkansas and Mississippi.  We were in school then, kids, my brother [Walter Lee Bailey, Jr., HM] and I.  But they -- people didn't sit around and talk much, not in my family --
Speaker 1: About the past?
Speaker 2: No, neither my family nor any of the people around the neighborhood.  They were -- everything was in the present.  I really hadn't thought about why or even put it into any perspective.  I guess we were so preoccupied with looking ahead and surviving that -- and, of course, we knew we didn't need a history lesson to tell us about racism because we were living in the midst of it.  And so, and there was enough going on when I was a kid.  Emmett Till had been killed.  I was about his age in [1954] '54 or whenever -- or somewhere there about.  I think it was maybe in [1955] '55.  A fourteen-year-old Black kid from Chicago died in Mississippi.  I was the age of the kids over at Central High School in Little Rock who were fighting to get into that school against the mobs.  And I used to be a, a delivery boy at a drugstore in the Black community after school.  I had a bicycle with a little basket in front and the people would call and get their prescriptions and ice cream and things like that.  And I'd get on the bike and take it out to their house.  And this was a drugstore owned by a Black pharmacist over at the corner of Mississippi and Walker, which is kind of a landmark area of the Memphis Black community.  Probably I would say, the most prominent intersection of Black life in America, I mean in, in, in the City of Memphis.  And the drugstore that I worked at was called People's Drugstore.  And right down the, down the street, about a block, was the Black college, LeMoyne College at the time it was known as.  It later became LeMoyne-Owen College [Memphis, Tennessee].  But I used to work there at the People's Drugstore.  Now, I later learned that the People's Drugstore was where Ida B. Wells, that site, not the drugstore itself, where she had published her papers from when she was in Memphis.  And so I suspect that the name People's Drugstore came out of that sense of activism connecting it to the history of that site, to wit, Ida B. Wells.  Of course, I didn't know that when I was a kid there at the drugstore.  But when I wasn't making deliveries, I could sit around, they -- it, it had a little sundry where people would come and have ice cream and sit around, cokes.  And I could sit around and watch the -- read the newspapers.  He had a newspaper rack there, and there'd be newspapers that came to the drugstore from all over America, Black America.  So I would read the Pittsburgh Courier and the Chicago Defender and the Atlanta Daily World.  And he would have the magazines, Ebony and JET and Sepia and Bronze Thrills.  I mean I, I mean my parents didn't know I was looking at that, you know (laughter).  But, but I could sit there and read that.  And, and so history to me was reading what the Black Press all over America in the '50's was saying.  And it was learning what the actual real life experiences of my fellow Blacks were all around me.  And then in Memphis, as I neared my graduation from high school, Blacks started organizing to run candidates and to support, you know, white candidates who were not supporting racial segregation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 624465
Speaker 1: I want to go back to-we always ask about your parents.  Can, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother's first name is Will, W-I-L-L.  Her middle name was Ella, E-L-L-A and the last name is Bailey.  My father is Walter [Lee Bailey, Sr.] --
Speaker 1: Wait a minute, I'll, I'll ask about him.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Let's cover her first.  What is her date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Well, now she just celebrated her birthday this past Sunday which would have been the 20th, 20th anyway.  The day's catching up on me, but June the 20th.  And, and I'm going to say it because I'm having trouble keeping up with the precise year, but it must be -- she must have turned 78 and, if you take 78 from 2003, that --
Speaker 1: 1925.
Speaker 2: Thereabouts.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right, now, where was she born?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, is it in Mississippi too or do you suspect Memphis?
Speaker 2: But I'll find out the next time I see her (laughter).  Again, that's the part that I've been planning on asking her, looking back into my mother's side of the history.  I don't think it was Mississippi because part of her family comes out of Beaumont, Texas area and there're probably a few family members down in Louisiana.  But -- so that's about -- I know that part of the family's from down in Texas and part is from Louisiana.  And I don't know any more than that in terms of location.
Speaker 1: Now, do you know much about how she grew up?  (Unclear) she maybe talked about that.
Speaker 2: Not a whole lot.  I mean she probably did and, and -- but recalling it now would probably not be -- I could not offer a lot of information.
Speaker 1: But do you know things like, did she have like names or was she (unclear) or did she go to school or did she have -- you know, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes, she went to school.  She went as far as the 11th grade of high school, and as did my father [Walter Lee Bailey, Sr.].  And then they got married.  And I guess they both then dropped out because she later went to school and got her, her GED.
Speaker 1: Did she go to school here in Memphis?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Booker T. Washington High School, the same school that I went to.  And I know that she came through Washington in the -- just around the 1940 because my brother was born then.  And so she was at Booker Washington High School here around '39 [1939] and '40 [1940].  And I think that must be when my brother was born when she left Booker Washington.
Speaker 1: Do you know how she came to come to Memphis in the first place?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 624466
Speaker 1: Okay. Does she [Will Ella Bailey, mother] have brothers and sisters here or family?
Speaker 2: Well, mama had -- let's see, Aunt Bessie, my -- one of my mother's -- that was my mother's oldest sister.  And she just died about a year ago.  That was, her name is Bessie Anderson.  She was a cook at a church, one of the best cooks that you could ever have, excellent cuisine.  And then my mother had a second sister who was my Aunt Georgia.  And I don't remember what Aunt Georgia did.  She was a wonderful lady.  She died in the early '70's [1970s] of cancer.  That was my mother's younger sister.  Her husband had worked at a plant here, International Harvester, and we used to travel to Detroit, my brother [Walter Lee Bailey, Jr., HM] and I, with them because we'd have family that used to live around Grand and Charleroi in Detroit.  And so that was my Uncle John D and my Aunt Georgia, Aint Georgia as we used to call her.  And then my mother had a brother, Uncle James, James Jefferson.  And he was married to -- it'll come back to me.  But anyway, Uncle James was killed in an industrial accident.  He worked at a plant here and got crushed in a machine.  And that must have happened, oh, I think I was out of town at the time.  So that was probably in the early '70's.  So she had two brothers -- I mean two sisters and one brother.  And so all of three of them are deceased.  And she's still here and fortunately, pretty healthy.
Story_ID: 624467
Speaker 1: Yeah. Well, what was your mother [Will Ella Bailey] like when you were coming up and what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: Initially, as we were very young, and I say very young, elementary school, she was a, she worked as a maid in a white doctor's office in, near downtown Memphis.  Dr. E.C. Seagerson.  And she also answered the phone and did kind of very light managerial-type work, but that wasn't her job, but she was competent to do that.  And so she did some of that at the clinic where she worked or the doctor's office.  And -- but her primary job was keeping the place clean and whatever other ancillary duties went with that.  She left that, and she went back and got her GED.  And then she went to barber college down on Beale Street.  And she became a barber.  And she went to work as probably one of the first Black women barbers -- in fact, probably one of the first women barbers -- she wasn't the first, in Memphis.  And that was in the mid-'50's [1950s], a barbershop right up there on Mississippi and Walker called Yarborough's Barbershop, which was right next to a poolroom called the Curve C-U-R-V-E, run by Mr. Heavy who was a business-type that owned the pool hall.
Speaker 1: Mr. Heavy?
Speaker 2: Yeah, (laughter).  He lived on the same street that we lived on which was a block away from the pool -- a block away from Mississippi and Walker from the pool hall.  And so there was the pool hall, there was the barber shop that my mother worked in and next to that was the Four-Way Grill or restaurant, which was a very prominent, historic Black restaurant here at the corner of Mississippi and Walker where people would come from all over the country, Blacks, distinguished Blacks and just regular people to eat.  It had some of the finest food as a Soul food restaurant, you could get.  So she went to work there cutting hair.  And after probably two or three years at Four-Way, I mean at Yarborough's Barbershop, she went back and got her license as a nurse.  And so she then went to work at John Gaston which was the City's public hospital at the time.  And she worked at John Gaston for a number of years, transferred to Baptist Hospital here in Memphis, from which she retired.  So she ultimately retired as a Licensed Practical Nurse, having worked, had by then, in the rehabilitation section of the hospital.  So she really had a, what for her, was a very rewarding ending part of her career, working with her rehab patients over there at the Baptist Rehab Center.
Story_ID: 624468
Speaker 1: You know, it sounds, it sounds like she was very determined to, you know, keep moving up?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And, and, and that was the example, of course, that, that we all, my brother [Walter Lee Bailey, Jr., HM] and I, had to see.  My mother [Will Ella Bailey] was not one to, and, and nor was my father for that matter, but was not one to complain or, or make bad about our situation.  I always grew up feeling very fortunate.  When -- in fact, when my brother and I -- and if I talk too much, you tell me and I'll stop cause I'm not embarrassed to stop.  But when my brother and I went to -- started school, we went to a private school.  And that was because my grandfather didn't want us to go to the public schools.  And this was -- well, I was, let's see.  I was born in '41 [1941] and started, in 5th grade, thereabouts, kindergarten anyway, so about '46 [1946].  And there was a private school here in Memphis run by two Black women called Rosebud Kindergarten.  And it started kids in the Kindergarten and the school went up through the 5th grade.  And the teachers there were a Black woman by the name of Sally Florence Jordan, she was the Principal, and another Black woman by the name of Mrs. Williams.  I think her first name was Bernice.  But it was actually about like a two or three-story schoolhouse where all of the classes were.  And my grandfather didn't want us to go to the public schools.  So he paid -- I think it ran about $5.00 a week for my brother and me, a piece to go to Rosebud.  And so we went there for the first -- well, when my brother finished the 5th grade and I the 4th, then I followed him into the public school, public school system.  But I, and as far as my mother was concerned and, and my father [Walter Lee, Bailey, Sr.], of course, -- well, I'll talk more about him as I talk about my grandfather because initially, they worked together.  My grandfather used to build and repair houses.
Story_ID: 624469
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father.  What was his full name and can, can you spell his name for us?
Speaker 2: Walter, W-A-L-T-E-R, Lee, L-E-E, Bailey, B-A-I-L-E-Y, Sr.
Speaker 1: And what is date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  I don't know where Daddy was born.
Speaker 1: Not Holly Springs?
Speaker 2: Holly Springs, that's right.  I have to go back and read -- but
Speaker 1: That's Mississippi, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Daddy was born in Holly Springs and he died at fifty-nine years of age -- I'm sorry sixty-nine years of age.  And he died, let's see, it's now been about thirteen years ago which would have been 1990.  I think it must have been '89.  And so he must have been born then in 1920 or thereabouts.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) 1920.  All right, now, tell me about your father.  How did he grow up?
Speaker 2: Well, Daddy's mother died very young.  I think he hardly knew her.  So my grandfather, after whom I'm named, married the only grand -- paternal grandmother that I knew, Mary Bailey.  And we used to call her sister.  And Daddy had no siblings so he was an only child.  And I just have to go I guess from most of my memory.  At the time that I was growing up, he was working with his father, Papa, who did contracting work, building and repairing houses and painting, plus my grandfather had a little sundry store, a little small store selling bread and ice cream and coal oil.  And so my father was, as I recall in my earliest years, sort of working with Papa.  And then later he went, as we got in our early teens, he went to work with the railroad as a Pullman Porter.  Now, if I back up in terms of his early life and -- I can't really say a whole lot about it.  I don't know much about his childhood.
Speaker 1: Did he spend it in Memphis?
Speaker 2: Yes, he grew up for the most part in Memphis.
Speaker 1: Okay. He did go to Booker T. Washington [High School, Memphis, Tennessee] (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yes, he went to Booker Washington also.
Story_ID: 624470
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how he [Walter Lee Bailey, Sr., father] and your mother [Will Ella Bailey] met?
Speaker 2: There is, and I don't know it.  But, you know, all of us would like to get a transcript of this interview cause it can be a guide for me now to, so I can get the answers on some things that I really need to know or would like to know while my mother is still well enough to answer them for me.  And I've been putting, saying it -- you know, it's a funny thing.  I see my mother every week and we talk, but I never get around to asking her about this family history and, and I don't know quite why I don't do that.  She went with me up to this visit to the cemetery, she and my son and I.  And I suppose that part of it is laziness, intellectual laziness in taking the time to ask questions.  Part of it is, you know things and you forget them.  And then part of it is I'm so impressed with the experience of the now, even as a child, that I was not very prone to look back at my history.  I learned everybody's else's, and not everybody in terms of individuals, but the societal history around me.
Speaker 1: Black History, the history of Black people in this country, and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Well, of course, we studied the ordinary, I mean the Mary McCloud Bethune's and the Ralph Bunches and the like, but there wasn't a tradition of kind pass -- sitting around and passing on family history or stories that, that I can recall.  Now, if you had asked if the conversation came up, but outside of that, so that's why when it comes to my father's childhood, I really don't know much about it.  I know the -- Walter Bailey, the man that I knew.
Speaker 1: Now, your, your parents did meet in high school or (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And they got, got married shortly after (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes, probably (unclear) I imagine that either before my brother [Walter Lee Bailey, Jr., HM] was conceived or, or after, but somewhere in relationship to my brother whose sixty, sixty-two.
Story_ID: 624471
Speaker 1: Okay, now, your father [Walter Lee Bailey, Sr.] worked with his father in a constru -- contracting job (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, but eventually, he worked, for a period of time he worked for the Illinois Central Railroad?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, that, that was his first -- that I recall anyway, regular kind of job with a business as such.  And he went to work for Illinois Central and that would have been mid to late '50's.  And initially, he started as a mail handler.  He would go down to the train station and unload the mail from the train cars to, to the pulley carts that they had out on the railroad dock, and take them inside to be unloaded.  So that was his first position with the railroad, and then after having done that for probably three or four years, he was lucky to get hired as a train porter with Illinois Central Railroad.  And initially, as a train porter for the first few years, he was kind of a sub, on call, to fill in.  And then after doing that for three or four years, he became a permanent porter.  And so he worked the line from Chicago to New Orleans.  And my brother [Walter Lee Bailey, Jr., HM] and I, or my mother [Will Ella Bailey] or I, or my mother, would drive him down to the train station and let him off.  And he would then take off, either to Chicago to meet the train or and to take it back to New Orleans and then back to Memphis.
Speaker 1: Was that the famous City of New Orleans train?
Speaker 2: The City of New Orleans, that's right.  And then sometimes he'd take the, the sleeping car.  They had a separate car.  I think there was some sleeping, sleeper coach that came through too.  But mainly it was the City of, City of New Orleans that he ran on.  And he did that from the mid-'50's -- from the late '50's [1950s] rather up until he retired from the railroad.  And that would have been, oh, I'd guess, let's see, I became a judge in '90 [1990] and say I guess Daddy had been retired about five years or so.  So I think he retired from the railroad around 1985 or the mid-'80's [1980s], that he retired.  But it was a -- it was really a wonderful experience having a Daddy who was a train porter because we could -- the whole family could ride free on the train.  And so we could go all over the country basically free, and, and Daddy was a wonderful, giving father to my brother and I, and would take us to the sporting events.  We would go, my mother and my father and I to the Black baseball park here in Memphis, Martin Stadium, back in our early childhood.  But also Daddy would take us, my brother and me, to St. Louis, and we'd see some of the professional baseball games there.  We'd also take the train and go to Chicago and Detroit to see baseball games there.  In fact, growing up I had the chance to see players like Roy Compa -- Campanella and Don Newcomb and Jackie Robinson, playing actually in, in those early years because our father took us when we'd stay overnight in one of the local black hotels to those, to those games.  And, of course, in addition, it was just nice to be able to get on the train and ride for free.  And that helped me when I was going through college and law school.
Speaker 1: That sounds like a wonderful bonus, I guess (unclear) --
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear). That's a perk I don't think a lot of people are cognizant of, you know, who have never been associated with the trains.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Story_ID: 624472
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, the Memphis team here is the Memphis Black Red Sox or what is --
Speaker 2: The Memphis Red Sox.
Speaker 1: Red Sox, okay, but the call them Black Red Sox (unclear) (laughter).  Okay, all right.  Now, tell me some more about growing up.  What are some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, and I was talking about going with my Daddy [Walter Lee Bailey, Sr.] and my mother [Will Ella Bailey] after church over to the Martin Stadium ballpark, but -- and, and people would come.  They weren't dressed with suits and ties, but they were casual but very nicely dressed families that would come over there and individuals and the -- and have our hot dogs and soda pops, and the ball teams would be well dressed.  You know, it was really the same thing that the white community was experiencing, same quality even.  I mean we were not second-class within the environment of our own experiences.  We really had some wonderful experiences like that.  Now, even though in the neighborhood where I grew up -- I grew up on 4th Place right near Mississippi and Walker, and the house that we grew up in was a duplex that my grandfather built from the ground up.  And, and it was right next to the little sort of shotgun sundry store that, that, that he and my grandmother operated.  But Mississippi Boulevard is a main thoroughfare through the heart of the black community, and we lived one block away from that, parallel to it, east of it.  And then the following block was Porter Street, and that was where the biggest housing project, probably at the time, was here in Memphis.  The LeMoyne Gardens.  And so we were a block away from the housing project.  And so, of course, many of my friends and, and running buddies were kids who lived over in LeMoyne Gardens.  We all went to the same school.  When my brother [Walter Lee Bailey, Jr., HM] and I left Rosebud Kindergarten [sic, Rosebud Elementary School], the private school, and went to the public school, over in that area, the Rose kids were coming from as far as the LeMoyne Gardens on that side of, of South Memphis.  So they were schoolmates of our, and we would visit over in the Gardens and they'd visit us over on 4th Place.  So it was a mixed - I mean, but by the same token, interestingly, about four blocks from where I was living, there lived the richest Black men in town at the time.  And that was Dr. J. E. Walker who had started Universal Life Insurance Company here in Memphis and was a physician.  And he lived in the neighborhood.  And as I mentioned, the, the People's Grocery right, two blocks from where we lived.  The college, LeMoyne-Owen College, it was then LeMoyne College.  It's now LeMoyne-Owen was three blocks from where we were.  So it was in the heart.  There was a black movie theater right up on the corner of Mississippi and Walker and a laundry, dry cleaners. And So when you grew up in a community like that, there was a stability.  There were families.  There weren't all two-parent families.  And then, of course, you got more families in the LeMoyne Gardens that were from single-parent homes than in the neighboring streets such as where I lived, where there were single homes or duplexes or some occasional two-story apartments, maybe with about four to six units.  So I had a real good mix of kids that I could shoot marbles with when we went to the, out to recess at the Rosebud Kindergarten [sic, Rosebud Elementary School], the private school, and when we were at the public school, that I could walk to school with and play with after school.  And even though Memphis was completely segregated at that time in the early to mid-'50's [1950s] and late '50's [1950s] for that matter, we were not -- at least I did not feel oppressed by the omnipresence of racial segregation.  We took it, I guess, as a matter of reality and our community serviced the basic needs.  And there was a swimming pool, public swimming pool.  Now, it was a little distance from where we lived, but you could get there.  You could -- if you really felt it, you could walk or you could take the bus and get over to swim in the Black swimming pool.  As I said, we had a movie theater.  We had school, playgrounds, a little boy scout troop that I was a member of for a short while, nightclubs, not for me as a kid, but there were some nightclubs that Blacks had to go to here.  We had a nice little supermarket there a block from where we lived, right there on Porter, bordering the LeMoyne Gardens.  Some pretty little school girls that I could try to flirt with, unsuccessfully, most of the time; and fellows that I could get into fights with on the streets sometimes over nothing.
Story_ID: 624473
Speaker 1: I had one time I, I was in I guess early high school, maybe in late elementary, I used to work for a black doctor as -- I'd go -- it was high school.  I'd go down to his office and work after school and answer the phone and help him, really as his nurse assistant cause the nurse went off at 3:00 o'clock and we'd be there until 10:00 at night.  But some kid had some gripe with me, and I was going down the street carrying a ladder.  And I was going to do some painting at the doctor's office because I -- since my granddaddy painted and my daddy [Walter Lee Bailey, Sr.] painted, I could paint.  I sometimes worked with him and helped paint houses.  And my granddaddy had a crew of probably a dozen people, men that worked for him.  And he'd pay him, pay them a $1.00 an hour, and they'd be on the roofs putting down roofing, painting the houses and things like that.  His brother, Uncle Albert, was a, a brick mason so he could take, like a house like this, he could take his plasterer and he could make all of these designs patterns in the, in the plaster of homes.  And with the old lathen that they had, and he also did the brickwork.  So he and my grandfather worked together, Albert Bailey.  And so, and in summertimes, my brother and I could work with them, and I'd get the same thing that the other workers would get, a $1.00 an hour.  But I, but I did the same kind of work.  And so because I was working with Dr. Hurst, this Black doctor, I was going to paint one day, and carrying my ladder down the street.  And some, and for some reason this fellow and I got into an argument about nothing.  I don't even remember the subject.  All I remember is that it ended him throwing bricks and rocks at me, and I tried to throw back at him, but I was not -- well, I was headed to work, not out to throw rocks.  And I caught one in the back of the head, big heavy rock, knocked me down, and a gnash in my head of about an inch.  And I never will forget because I was trying to jump out the way of the, of the brick -- it wasn't a full brick.  It was just a large rock.  And when it hit me, I was (unclear) and it knocked me down onto the pavement.  And suddenly, it looked like my -- I, I looked down at my hands and they were not in the same place when I, as I saw them, as they were as I felt them.  And I guess my consciousness was just readjusting itself having taken such a blow to the head, you know.  But, but that was -- the fellow's name was Stepter, James Stepter.  And, but he left me with a permanent scar.  But that was life with growing up in the hood, you know, you fight and get into fights and things like that happen.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 624474
Speaker 1: Would you consider the community a cohesive community when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, very much so.  Yes, now, that is that -- that's not to say that we weren't rent by the same problems.  There were people, not a lot, in the neighborhood who maybe drank too much sometimes and didn't meet their family responsibilities, husbands and wives that would fight sometimes.  But it really was not -- even in the [LeMoyne] Gardens, and I say even in the Gardens because, to the extent that one could perhaps try to isolate a, a concentration of potential problem residents, it would have been in the Gardens.  But I felt very comfortable as a kid, going over into the housing projects.  Now, the city was kind of divided up by areas because Memphis is such a large city.  And so I was in South Memphis which is the, the largest area of Blacks, but Blacks were in an area called Binghampton which is a bit farther to the Northeast.  And then North Memphis, on the North side of downtown as opposed to South Memphis where we were on the South side.  And, and then so you could go into Binghampton if you didn't know people and get into, get jumped on.  And perhaps in North Memphis, but my brother and I -- my brother [Walter Lee Bailey, Sr., HM] played football in high school and was a very good player.  And I did a lot of different little things.  I had a radio show as a teenager in high school and wrote for the, two Black newspapers.  And I had, was in a couple of social clubs.
Story_ID: 624475
Speaker 1: Were you a real good student in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, one of the things that, that I am really honored by -- my, my high school Principal was a man named Blair T. Hunt.  And Mr. Hunt's dead now, but he was a Pastor of a church, Mississippi Boulevard, which actually was back-to-back with the house where we lived.  But we didn't go to the church.  And Professor Hunt as we called him was also politically active in addition to being a preacher at Mississippi Boulevard.  He was one of the Lieutenants from the Crump Machine which is the White politician that controlled Memphis in the '40's [1940s], early '50's [1950s].  And Professor Hunt was the long-time Principal of Booker Washington and ruled it with a great deal of control and vision.  And so there's a great example of Black manhood even though he was in cahoots with the White political establishment.  And he was being interviewed after he had retired as Principal of Booker Washington, and he retired the same year that I graduated in '59 [1959].  And the reporter asked him about some notable students and my brother, Walter [Lee Bailey, Jr., HM] and me, he said, the Bailey brothers, D'Army and Walter Bailey, I remember very well from Booker Washington.  And, and so, of the thousands of students that had gone through that school, for Professor Hunt to have singled Walter and me out among maybe three or four others that he mentioned in that interview, I was just extremely flattered.
Story_ID: 624476
Speaker 1: But as far as my grades were concerned, I was a good student.  In fact, I was -- I didn't know this at the time, but you see when we went from the private school to the public school system, we were actually ahead of the public school students academically.  And traditionally, they would put students coming to the public school from private school back a year.  You'd lose a year.  So my parents doctored -- or my mother or, or one of them or both of them or somebody did, my transcript to have it appear that I was a grade higher for both my brother [Walter Lee Bailey, HM] and me when we went into the public schools on the expectation that when we got put back, we'd be in the correct grade.  Well, so I started in the 6th as opposed to the 5th, but I, I was quite comfortable and capable in that farther grade.  But one young lady who had come and done the same thing as a transfer, got caught and told on us.  So we got put back to what turned out to be our correct grades.  But for my initial entry into the public school system, I was always very capable of handling the information and the material, and was fortunate to have good teachers.  I didn't know until actually recent years that there was tracking going on and that I had been put into a class category of the brighter students, going into high school.  And so for the next four years the grades that I was being moved from each year were into this select group.  They'd have something, if you were 9th grade, you'd have either 9A or 9 -- then it was 9-1-A or 9A, 9B, 9 whatever.  And so I went through that process without even knowing it.  I just knew that I had some very good teachers.  I was a B student, and I came out of high school with about a B average.  And when I got to Southern which is where I went leaving high school, I was again placed into an honors group that they had there at the University.
Speaker 2: Now, I want -- before we get to Southern I want to close out high school (unclear).  Who were some of the teachers in high school that influenced you the most?
Speaker 1: Well, of course, one of the most influential was my English teacher, Annette Hubbard Roberts, who was also my 9th grade, 9th or 10th -- 9th grade homeroom teacher.  But Annette Hubbard Roberts was a tall, standing black woman who took bullshit.  She, she was very gentle in a way, but she was very stern about her expectations from us as students.  And so she expected us to be prepared in her classes in English, be gentlemanly and, and proper in our home rooms.  I remember (laughter) I guess I was always kind of a little bit on the edge in terms of following the rules, not really bad, but just my own way of doing things.  And I came late to class one morning and walked up to Ms. Roberts' desk to try to offer her some weak excuse about being late, and she leaned from me and looked at me in her stern way.  And she said, he's -- you smell like my grandfather's pipe.  And I just remember that because that was just for a teacher in the 9th grade to tell a teenager, I mean that was -- you respected them to the point that, that they could call you down.  They didn't, they didn't have to say a whole lot and, and embarrass you with just a few gestures.  And you knew to get in line.  I remember we used to have and pass around, not for any lengthy period of time, these little sex books.  They would be these little handbooks, oh, I guess three or four inches in length and a couple of inches wide.  And there would be these drawings, cartoon-like of people doing all kinds of sex acts and sex pictures and elongated penises and all that kind of thing.  And I don't know where, but, but somebody would occasionally get a hold of one and, and they would get passed around in the school.
Story_ID: 624477
Speaker 1: Sir, well, tell us the story now about Mrs. Rulack and your teacher and this book you all were passing around?
Speaker 2: Ms. Rulack and the sex book.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, as we kids, you know, somebody would come across -- I honestly don't know how they'd get these books, these books that had these black and white drawn pictures of, of people doing sex acts, men and women.  And it was just as out there as you could get, you know, with the long, hard penises and all that, and they would get passed around, you know, obviously, one kid's got it.  So some other kid would get it.  And so it ended up in my hands.  And I was somewhere and I showed it to one of the girls in the class.  (Laughter)  And from there it wound itself into the hands of Ms. Rulack.  And so (laughter) I came back from recess one day and as the whole class got assembled there in the classroom, there was this moment of silence.  And she stared at me with glare that you could just, like a laser.  And she said, and I don't remember the exact words, but she said something to the effect that how dare you bring this trash into my classroom.  That was the attitude, I don't know what the words were, you know.  And one of the -- and, and she severeley chastised, and appropriately so, but I just remember how stern she was. And, of course, I'd never expected it was going to end up in the teacher's hands because (laughter) it was pretty shocking.
Story_ID: 624478
Speaker 1: But so be it, but Mrs. Rulack was at that time the National President of the Jack and Jill's.  I didn't know much about the social hierarchy of Black America.  I knew what the Jack and Jill's were, but I never traveled along those paths, my -- me and my family.  Memphis, the area I described where we lived, there weren't any Jack and Jill's in that part of Memphis.  They congregated in another area of Memphis, sort of along Parkway and a little farther South, the professionals, mostly school teachers, insurance executives and some others.  But -- and funeral directors, a couple of doctors and one lawyer, A. A. Ladding.  A. A. Ladding. But so we weren't viewed by the Jack and Jill class.  We weren't the children of doctors and lawyers and school teachers.  So we weren't viewed as being in that social environment.  It didn't -- even though we knew kids and people of criss-cross and that, but there was that kind of deep social demarcation as there continues to be in Black America as you know.
Speaker 2: Maybe even increasing now.
Speaker 1: Well, and, and, of course, I never, even with my kids did not have them go through Jack and Jill and my wife was at one time in the Girlfriends and the Jugs and the Links and she's gotten out of all of them.  She -- she just doesn't relate to the, the fraternity of that kind of social arrangement.  But, but Ms. Rulack was -- so I didn't -- I, I knew what Jack and Jill was, but I, you know, didn't know who they were.  But, and so I guess that perhaps was a little strange.  But I think that it was -- obviously, I remember it, and, and it was a good experience for me.  It was a classy experience in a way.  It was an encounter of a, a somewhat innocent, I mean innocent in terms of, you know, we were men, kids, teenagers and we did bad, sometimes raunchy things as children do.  Usually, you don't get caught, and I got caught.  But the cau -- getting caught brought the mixture of cultures.  You know, how horrified this lady was that, at this book.  I mean and, and I guess that I'd have it, and that I'd give it to a girl because to me giving it to a girl, we weren't that -- I mean that wasn't any stratification of the sexes like that.  I mean boys and girls did interact and share things.
Speaker 2: Now, now, did, did you feel that, I guess there was a word in Memphis they use, I don't know, but I heard it -- did you feel that Ms. Rulack was sort of a saditty person?
Speaker 1: Well, if I use the word saditty, I don't think that would be fair to her because, I mean the answer could be yes.  I could say she was saditty.  She came from, she, she exuded a, a class, a proper way attitude.  And, and she was tall, light-skinned, attractive woman with curly hair.  But I don't think that -- I, I mean there were lots of people that would have fit her characterization.  And there's nothing wrong with a woman being saditty.  I mean, you know, you ought to to do it in a way that makes you appealing.
Speaker 2: I was wondering if the chastisement coming from her was worse than if it had come from somebody else?
Speaker 1: I don't so -- that's a good question, but I don't think it was.  I'm not usually that sensitive to transfer one rebuff into another realm to try to understand, you know, why I got caught or why I've been chastised.  If I'm wrong, I'm wrong.  And so in Ms. Rulack's case, I -- no, I think she was, I thought her sternness reflected her proper class attitude, I mean, but I didn't take it personal.  I mean it was just the kind of person she was.  But she was -- but the good thing about that was that I thought she deserved to handle it the way that she did because it drove home to me and the other kids in the class that there's a level of expectation of how you ought to carry yourself.  And it doesn't mean we all meet it.  It doesn't mean that I even say that you ought to always meet it.  Life would be rather boring if you did.  But I think she reasserted the norm of, of expected behavior.  And I think it was proper for her to do that, and I thought she did in an effective way.
Speaker 2: Okay, but she didn't like, she wasn't real, she wasn't, she didn't like, take you to the Principal or do anything like that?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Story_ID: 624479
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know, now. Now I might have --
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: I don't recall that I -- I don't -- I'd been to the Principal on a couple of occasions, but I don't think that that was one of them.  I went there for fighting and something else.  And it (unclear) because I remember he gave me a spanking one day.
Speaker 2: Now, this was when -- when this was --
Speaker 1: That was elementary school.  That was probably, let's see, we started it in the 5th after I left the Kindergarten, Rosebud [Elementary School, Memphis, Tennessee], and so I must have been at that time, say, what, 5th grade, and left in 8th, after the 8th, probably the 7th grade, 6th or 7th grade.  I thought she [Mrs. Rulack] kind of overreacted in a way.  I, I mean I, you know, I mean, but it was not nice, I mean--
Speaker 2: But the book didn't originate with you.
Speaker 1: It didn't originate with me.
Speaker 2: You just, you just had --
Speaker 1: I think I actually had had it over night though to be honest.  I think I (laughter) I think I'd carried it home and bought it back to the class, but I was going to pass it on to somebody else.
Story_ID: 624480
Speaker 1: Okay, well, let's move, move past though, let's go on to high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee].  Now, when -- you talk about some of your high school activities, (unclear) and some of the teachers, did you -- were you, did you know you were going to college and did you have a career objective when you were a Senior?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I didn't turn the sound system off upstairs.  Is that bothering you sound-wise, cause if so I'll --
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  No. It's not coming up -- the mic isn't picking it up.
Speaker 2: Okay, you know, when I was coming through high school, even when I was in elementary school, and even before that in grade school, I knew that I was destined to be somebody.  Our high school Principal, Blair T. Hunt, used to, in the gymnasium, one of his slogans, and he was noted for telling the kids in assembly, was, "you are somebody".  And he would say that in his baritone voice in the assemblies.
Speaker 1: And this is pre-Jesse Jackson [HM]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Jesse could have learned a lot from Blair T. Hunt.  But he would say, "you are somebody" (louder, singing tone).  And it would just ring to all of us.  And so from, you know, I, I worked for a Black doctor, Dr. Hose, answering telephones, checking in his patients, helping him with his patients at night, closing down the clinic with him, and then getting in his long, black, fishtail Cadillac when we closed the clinic at 10:00 o'clock at night, and riding with him to a couple of home where he'd stop and make visits.  And then he would drop me off at my house and go on home.  So I, I interacted in high school with a man like that, with a man like Dr. Pippen, the Black pharmacist up there on the corner of Mississippi and Walker who would always talk with me and treated me respectfully.  And, and his wife was a school teacher. My father [Walter Lee Bailey, Sr.] who always was proud of my brother [Walter Lee Bailey, Jr., HM] and me and always backed us.
Story_ID: 624481
Speaker 1: The exposure that I had, my mother [Will Ella Bailey] and the calm, determined kind of support that she was always providing me, so when I would -- again, and this goes back to the Civil Rights images, those kids were going through those march for something.
Speaker 2: Did you all discuss it ever at home, I mean --
Speaker 1: Not really that much.  But I always watched the news.  We had a television a little earlier than most in the neighborhood.  And--a little black and white, and, and so I would watch, watch the television, watch the news.  And the -- it didn't take a rocket scientist to see that these people were saying that what we took as everyday norm was really, something was wrong with it.  We thought and felt that it was okay.  It didn't oppress us.  I grew up, I, as I said, I had everything I needed in the Black environment.  But the -- when, when the kids at Greensboro [North Carolina] and the kids in Little Rock [Arkansas], when White people started saying to Blacks that, and saying it openly, that yet, no, you do not get this.  You're not entitled to be in this school or in this swimming pool or college, or sit at this lunch counter, when that became so dramatized to me, then my world of sharing the American dream on the parallel side with the White boy when he was watching Pillsbury Pancakes and all that and ads, Ajax and Tide and everything on television and showing us the images of good America, they included me.  I, I mean I, I made the mental transition from the White faces in the commercials and D'Army Bailey and D'Army Bailey's wife and children were there at the washing machine and in the nice house.  And, and, and so I never expected, once I saw all of these images of culture that it didn't include me.  I had a certain internal arrogance that could not accept the thought that I wasn't supposed to be there.
Story_ID: 624482
Speaker 1: All right. Okay, So--
Speaker 2: So as far as my sense of career development, by the time I got into the high school, the black community in 1957 in Memphis started organizing to, first of all, voter registration campaigns to get Black registered.  One thing about Memphis, is that because Memphis was controlled by a White political machine, the Crump machine in the '40's [1940s] and early '50's [1950s], E. H. Crump, one of the basis of his politics was the Black community.  And, excuse me, one of the things that history shows is that W. C. Handy, one of the tunes that he wrote was for Mr. Handy, in one of his political campaigns.  And so, Handy's organization knew how to use Blacks, as I mentioned my high school Principal.  Well, part of what they would do would be to help organize the Black vote, to vote for Crump's candidates.  And so there was never really a problem in those years of Blacks being able to vote.  So we didn't have the same problem as Mississippi and other parts of the South of Blacks getting the right to vote.  The problem had been that the vote was controlled, mani, manipulated by the Crump machine.  And so when the Crump machine dissolved in the mid-'50's, Blacks began to form political organizations to use that vote to support White candidates who were not segregationists.  I remember a white ran for Senator, Ross Bass.  I think he got elected.  George Grider ran for Congress and got elected, a white man.  And so, and, and where I became involved was that I was in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee], my brother Walter [Lee Bailey, Jr., HM]  and me.  And we would go down to the Shelby County Democratic Club where there was the organization her that had formed to back these candidates.  And they were working in collaboration with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and a handful of Black lawyers.  And organizing these political efforts through registration campaigns, finding White candidates that were running for Congress or for the Senate who were not segregationists and bringing them in.  And they would be interviewed.  We'd sit in a meeting, and they'd be interviewed about their position on Black issues.  And (unclear) end up endorsing them, and then therefore, they would funnel money from their campaign organizations into the Black organization to run the campaigns.  We'd, for the bumper stickers and for the leaflets and for the get-out-the-vote crews and, and so by knowing how important the, the voting process was, being involved at that process, but all becoming involved then working with the leadership of some of the NCAAP people and the Black lawyers.  And so I began to see, by the time I was coming out of high school, through these kinds of Black political efforts, that, that there was a cohesion of vision in terms of Blacks working together to promote racial progress, in this case, in the political arena.  And, and at the same time meet some Black lawyers, Russell Sherman, Black lawyer here. A. W. Willis, Ben Hooks [HM] was in the same office with A. W. Willis but he was a Republican.  These guys were active in the Democratic party, and so he wasn't as much involved in the strategizing of this Democratic club, in fact, not at all.  There was another Black lawyer, S.A. Wilburn, a little bit more (unclear), primarily Willis and Sugarman as Black lawyers.  I became knowledgeable about.  And then there was a Black lawyer, H. T. Lockett who was the President of NAACP.  So I, at that point, also say the role Black lawyers were playing in our community.
Story_ID: 624483
Speaker 1: And then when I left Memphis in '59 [1959], went down to Southern University in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] as a first-year student, I went there because my brother, Walter [Lee Bailey, HM], had gotten a football scholarship the year before me.  And he was playing on the Southern team, and so I went down there.  And most of my contemporaries were going to Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee] in '59.  So I went down to Southern, ran for President of the Freshman class.  One interesting thing just as a diversion was that when I got to Southern, they had put me in a woman's dormitory.  They had looked at my first name and didn't, a-apparently they have a section for identification on the form or something.  And so I -- (unclear) from the first night, they had me assigned to one of the female dormitories which is where I went first, you know, after registering.
Speaker 2: You enjoyed (unclear).
Speaker 1: Only in the most brief instance I might say, but I started at Southern, and Southern was the largest all-Black university in the country.  It had about 5,000 students, beautiful campus, beautiful women.  And, and so in my Freshman year, of course, I didn't talk about -- I'd gotten kind of media involved back in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee] doing a radio program on a T, on a Black radio station and then doing some newspaper columns and being involved with some social groups.  So I, by the time I got to Southern, I was acculturated to the process of kind of avid involvement.  So I, in my first year, I ran President of the Freshman Class, and I was elected President down there, my first year of class at Southern.  And so then I started a whole different life path as a collegian.
Speaker 2: Okay, alright.  Well, now your experience at Southern, you were there how many years?
Speaker 1: Two and a half.
Speaker 2: Two and a half, okay.  And --
Speaker 1: That seems to be about the length of time in some of my experiences.
Speaker 2: Did you have any mentors at Southern?
Speaker 1: Yes, absolutely.
Story_ID: 624484
Speaker 1: And, and by the way, I -- let me race back to your question about people in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee] who influenced me, there's a man that I dare not pass up mentioning.  I talked about Blair T. Hunt, our Principal, Annette Hubbard Roberts.  Nat Dee Williams.  N-A-T, D-E-E, Williams W-I-L-L-I-A-M.  Natt Dee was a dark-skinned, Black man, kind of short, eyeglasses with lenses probably a half an inch thick.  I mean they just -- they were goggles.  And Nat Dee was one of the most brilliant Black men to come through the South.  He wrote a column for the Tri-State Defender Newspaper.  He was one of the first Blacks here on radio here in Memphis, Radio Station WDIA.  And he used to on Sundays have a show called Brown America Speaks, in which they would have discussions about issues affecting the Black community.  And so, but he also simultaneous with his radio career was a school teacher.  And so he taught Tennessee History at Booker [T.] Washington [High School], where I was a student.  And so Nat Dee was my -- I want to say 9th grade, but he was -- I, I took Tennessee history from Nat Dee Williams.  And I remember sitting in the classrooms, sun beaming through the window, across the desk chairs and the students, and Nat Dee standing up at the front of the room beaming as he always did with a smile, teeth showing.  He always showed his teeth, white teeth, nice white teeth.  And face was not greasy, but always a little bit partially shining.  And he would kind lecture to us, kind of in a rock back forth standing way a lot.  And he would talk about history.  And he had a slogan that he'd tell us as a illustration of Tennessee history.  And he'd say that -- and of history itself, he'd say the Indian fought and died.  The Negro grinned and multiplied.  And for a history teacher to sort of capsule the legacy of two victim races that way was history in itself.  And that was how important and magnetic Nat Dee's perception and presentation on radio and in the classroom was.  And so he had a lot of influence on me.  A very conscientious and conscious Black man.
Speaker 2: That, that message can be taken in a--well, Negro grin and multiplying, is that implying that we didn't fight?
Speaker 1: I think that his, I think that what he meant by that, and what I took it to mean was not that we were Uncle Tomming, grinning and skinning.  He wasn't that kind of a person.  What he meant was that we had to strategically wise in our struggles, at least that's how I interpreted it, that you don't just make Custer's last stand, and stand there before the White man arrogantly without strategy and say here I am, come on.  But that you grin, you maneuver, you retreat, you go under, you go over, but you keep going.
Speaker 2: Like Dunbar's poem, let the world think otherwise, while we wear the mask.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 624485
Speaker 1: Let's -- at Southern University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana] you had, you had a bad experience, well, it was a struggle experience is what it was.  I guess I won't say it was necessarily bad, but it was struggle experience, not the kind of experience you hope for in college.  But you were kicked out of college or expelled.  And over, over political activity, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about that?  What happened?
Speaker 2: But to me that wasn't a bad experience.  I enjoyed it.  I had a wonderful time at Southern.  I look back on those years with great joy and great exposure.  I had great opportunity.  I went down to Southern, and by becoming President of the Freshman class, I had a little bit of leadership around on the campus.  But one important thing -- well, first of all, in my first year, in 1960, the Spring, was when the students at Greensboro [North Carolina] went and sat in and were arrested.  And that was around -- I remember because I used to be down in the Student Union.  As I said, Southern was a beautiful campus, and the Union was beautiful and I would sit around in the lobby with the manager, talking and different people.  And it was a nice, bright day, afternoon.  It must have been February, perhaps March.  We're just sitting around passing the time.  And suddenly someone comes in and tells us that some of our students have been arrested downtown in Baton Rouge for sitting in at one of the restaurants.  And we didn't know anything about it.  We didn't know anything about any planning, any talk about it or anything.  But this was after Greensboro.  And so then they were put in jail.  And the campus immediately was activated about what, what is this?  What is going on?  And that night we all were drawn to the center of campus and two cars came up, driven one by a Black, leading Black preacher in Baton Rouge, Dr. T. J. Jemison, who later became President of the National Baptist Convention, prominent minister in Baton Rouge.  He drove up with these, some of these students that were arrested.  And they got out of his car.  And that electrified the crowd and they stood and they talked and gave speeches because this was the first introduction of the [Civil Rights] Movement to our campus.
Story_ID: 624486
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now the students had returned to campus and they're getting ready to speak.
Speaker 2: Yes, and so, suddenly our sheltered world is exploding.  I mean here I am, have left Memphis, gone to Baton Rouge to get a college degree, just following my path, and I never had any notion when I left here in September of '59 that suddenly I was going to be in the middle of a, what became a National race fight, until these kids did that, that day and brought that movement to the Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] campus.  And then the President threw them out, which happened at a number of the Black colleges.  When kids were arrested, black college Presidents didn't have the guts -- well, I won't -- well, it was guts because they had to be willing to lose their jobs or get rid of the student leaders.  Now, they rationalize, they say, well, I can do more while I'm here, and they stay.
Speaker 1: And kick the students out.
Speaker 2: And kick the students out.  And we fought against the University that first year and -- of course, you can't win.  I mean we protested, before I got in classes, the kids were gone.  One interesting thing happened to me that year, aside from this exposure, I was -- Southern was a member of the United States National Student Association.  And it was an organization headquartered in Philadelphia that had chapters at schools around America.  Really vibrant group of active students, testifying before Congress.  It had a National Affairs office, an International Affairs office, and a convention each summer.  And Southern sent two delegates my Freshman year.  Traditionally, the incoming President of the Student Body would go.  And for the first time, I was selected as a Freshman, finishing Freshman, to go.  And so Paul Lewis and I went to Minneapolis in the summer of 1960 as delegates from Southern to the U.S. NSA [National Student Association] Conference.  And at that time the sit-in's had happened with Greensboro and other campuses and the National Student Association office headed by its National Affairs Director, Curt Gans, issued a public statement endorsing the sit-in protests.  And so at the convention, student chapters from different parts of the country wanted to rescind that endorsement and chastise the National leadership.
Speaker 1: Now, is Curt Gans, is that G-A-N-Z?
Speaker 2: G-A-N-S.  Curtis.  And, and so they wanted to rebuke Gans for having done that, endorsed the protest and rescind it.  And the chapters, particularly in the South, were fighting hard to have that done.  And one of the speakers that came up to Minneapolis, we were on the campus of the University of Minnesota on the banks of the Mississippi, was Donald Moss, one of the students that had been expelled from Southern.  And I went to the meeting hall where Donald spoke.  And you must imagine that you've got here a thousand college delegates where for two days or so the only subject at the National Conference is this fight to rescind the endorsement of the sit-ins.  And I saw Donald Moss give a speech to these students.  This kid that had -- wasn't but a couple of year older than me, come from Southern, kicked out while I was there.  And he electrified the crowd with his speech about the courage and the drive there.  And then when we were back in the dorms where we were staying, the debate went on into the halls that night, heated debate about this Movement.  And so not only had I been hit in the face with the protest movement with the sit-in's that Spring, but that summer, the discussion was broader and became National as to what this fight was all about.  And so when I went back to Southern, my Sophomore year, excuse me, I was a writer for the school newspaper.  And then it wasn't until my Junior year that I became more actively involved in, again, protest-type activities.
Story_ID: 624487
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was the incident that led up to your expulsion (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well, by the time that my Junior year had started in '61, things were quiet again at Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  And there was a young Black student that transferred into the campus from Atlanta by the name of Patricia Tate.  And I was-- I had my own world.  Things were pretty well for me there.  I, I had this nice little gig, didn't pay me anything, but it had nice fringe benefits.  I was the announcer at the football games for the ROTC Drill Team's performance.  And so as a result, when the Team traveled with the football team, I could travel too as the announcer.  And so in my Junior year, I was doing all right, doing that.  I had written a column in the Southern paper, Southern Digest.  The President had made, had censored my column, President Clark, and -- because he didn't like something I had written about some racial issue.  And, and so all of them had to be cleared through his office that I was writing.  But I got sought out by this preacher, student preacher, Ronnie Moore, who lived in New Orleans.  He was on the campus, and he came to me and said they wanted to organize a protest about something.  They were planning something, and they wanted me to announce from the mic during the football game something about this protest.  So I said, now, look Ronnie, I said, I don't know, you know, what this is all about, but I'm not going to do this.  Now, well, if you want to come up there into the stands, I'll give you the mic, and you can say whatever you want.  Well, whatever it was, they started doing it.  They started organizing on the campus.  And then history repeats.  Two years now after 1960, another bunch of kids at Southern go down and sit in at the lunch counter downtown and get arrested.  That galvanizes students' sentiment and we all get excited about it.  And we're going to have a march to the jail.  So we marche down one day, one cold, damp day.  And from Southern's campus to downtown Baton Rouge is about 10 miles.  So we didn't really walk all that distance, the cab drivers, the bus drivers, people in the community -- private bus drivers, not city bus drivers, helped to ferry the kids downtown to the, to the jailhouse, where we were going to protest out, those students being in jail.  And then they turned tear gas on us.  We were standing out there in front of the East Baton Rouge Parish Jail.  I was at the head of the march, as was my brother [Walter Lee Bailey, Jr., HM].  And we were there with a Field Secretary, that's what they called the -- have you heard of the Field Secretary?  F-I-E-L-D.  Well, this was a CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] Field Secretary, that's what they called the organizers that they sent out.  So we had one, had two actually and one was Dave Dennis.  Dave was a, later went to Mississippi and did some organizing for them.  It was his station wagon that was burned out when the three Civil Rights workers were abducted and killed because he had been working with them that, on that project.  But anyway, they were two CORE Field Secretaries that were sent to Baton Rouge.
Speaker 1: Dave Dennis and who --
Speaker 2: B. Elton Cox. B as Boy -E-L-T-O-N, Cox.  He's now up around Jackson, Tennessee living I think.  But, and, and would be well a person to, to talk with.
Story_ID: 624488
Speaker 1: But Reverend [B. Elton] Cox was the-- leading the march because the student leaders, Reverend Ronnie Moore, had been arrested.  What happened was, that as we were trying to get organized to get the March into downtown Baton Rouge, they were using a sound car with loudspeakers on the roof.  And so the police arrested some of the leaders, in, including Ronnie Moore and charged them with unlawful use of a microphone.  And so by the time we actually got there, some of our leaders were already arrested.  So Reverend Cox and my brother [Walter Lee Bailey, HM] and I were at the head of the line.  So Cox told the march, let's go to the jailhouse.  We first assembled around the old State Capitol there in downtown [Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  And we started to walk off toward the jail, and the Police Director came over and stopped us, and told Reverend Cox that he was going to allow us so many minutes of time to go down there and get our business done and be gone.  So we went on down to the jailhouse, about two and a half blocks away and lined up in front it, and started our rally.  In front us was a line of Sheriff's Deputies.  Behind them were White onlookers.  And behind them was the jail.  And we started the rally with speakers, and then up in the third-floor window, some of the students who were arrested started singing out and hollering out to us.  And we started singing back to them.  And then Reverend Cox looked at his watch after some remarks, and he said, children, it's now twelve o'clock and we all hungry.  Let's go get some lunch, and there're plenty restaurants in downtown Baton Rouge here.  And we're just going to go wherever we feel -- get nearest to and have lunch.  And when Cox said that, the head police officer, uniformed officer, stepped out from the ranks and threw a tear gas grenade.  And he threw it at Cox or at where Cox was standing.  And the grenade hit Cox on the ankle and bounced onto the pavement.  And when the grenade hit Cox, the rest of the deputies moved in on our line, started throwing their tear gas canisters.  And they had dogs on leashes and they started chasing us through downtown Baton Rouge.  And we would disperse in small groups to try to regroup to get back to Scotlandville.  And they would drive up in cars and jump out with tear gas guns to aim at us.  Finally, most of us made it back to a church in Scotlandville.  And the church was filled with sudden tear gas.  And I was in the back offices where Cox was.  And the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff Department came into the back hallway of the church, to the back office.  And they asked for Reverend Cox.  And they had an arrest warrant for him, and they lifted him up because the gas canister had injured his ankle and he couldn't walk.  And so they carried him out of the back hallway to jail.  And so there was really no leader left at that point, but me.  They had arrested the other leaders earlier that day, Cox, they'd just hauled out.  We had a church full protesters, tired, tear gas all on us.  And nobody but me (laughter).
Story_ID: 624489
Speaker 1: So I walked out to the pulpit and spoke to the students and told them about -- recounted the experience we'd had.  And people were all outside on the steps.  They had to have (unclear), the students.  And there was this, I, I could feel the warm embrace of the crowd around me.  And it wasn't personal to me.  It was the internalization of the determination and spirit of that day's experience.  And I just happened to be in the center of it and could feel it all around.  And so I said, well, let's march to the President's house, back on the campus and tell him that we don't want him to do what he did two years ago.  So we marched up to Dr. Clark's house.  And he came out after a while and promised that he wasn't going to expel these students, which he reneged on and did expel them.  But, that's kind of how I kind of moved from, from my level of noninvolvement to ending up being in the center of the thing at that point.
Speaker 2: Well, you're saying that by being in it, you emerged to lead it by default at some point?
Speaker 1: Yes, somebody had to speak to that crowd in that church that day.  And I was, I mean it was just, it was -- I mean I was, by my own sense of destiny of the moment, I was the only one that could do it and should it.  But, of course, by being put out there then, I then was looked on to speak and appear at the other rallies.
Story_ID: 624490
Speaker 1: And the university [Southern University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] was being pressured to -- because they did turn around and expel these students who had been arrested, and then we then called a class boycott.  And the University's response to that was ultimately to expel me and to close the school.  But before they'd gotten to that point, they had called me over to the Dean of Men's Office, and one of the things that they would do is with the Civil Rights protesters like me and some of the others, is they'd have us in and, and while they were talking to us, the President or the Dean of Students, Dean of Men, whoever, usually it was the Dean of Students, Dean of Men, Resident Advisor, tried to persuade you that you're on the wrong course.  Back off.  And they would even call your folks and they had called my folks.  They didn't put me on the phone with them, but they had called my folks in Memphis and had my brother [Walter Lee Bailey, Jr., HM] over to the Dean of Men's House to tell the two of us that I wasn't to speak at a rally scheduled the next day, which I went ahead and spoke at because, I mean, it doesn't -- you, you know, I don't want to sound falsely modest, nor do I want to sound like a hero because I'm really not.  I have my own fears, anxieties, insecurities and faults that every, everybody else has.  But nevertheless, you reach these, these points in, in these experiences where if they say, well, if you speak tomorrow, we're going to expel you, that you don't have a choice.  It's not like -- I mean for me to, you know, with the momentum and the commitment that I'd made, to stop and say well, I'm not going to show up, is the ultimate destruction of a human being.  And so I went the next day and I spoke.  And they called me to the Dean of Men's Office, gave me a letter, said I'm out of there.  And the same time they had this meeting with me, they called a campus-wide assembly in the gymnasium and told all the other kids that they were going to close the University and that you had -- they had to be off campus -- this was noon, by five o'clock that day or they would be subject to be arrested.  This is the entire Southern University campus.  I said there were 5 or 6,000 students, probably at least 3,000 were living on campus.  And they were on the phone trying to reach home, trying to make arrangements, foot lockers dragging out of dormitories, trying to get out to Scotlandville in cars, along the roads, just to get off campus by the curfew.
Speaker 2: Was--what was the -- was there any, any reprisal against the President for his behavior by alumni, you know, or people of that region or maybe?  How, did, did he have to face the music for this from anybody eventually or did he just continue on?
Speaker 1: No, he just continued on.  No accountability at all.  There was one courageous Black teacher that had a profound influence on me down there and a number of other students, my brother as well, Walter, taught me Political Science.  His name was Adolph Reed.  I think he has a son now that's up at Harvard or somewhere up East.
Story_ID: 624491
Speaker 1: All right.  All right, now, tell us the story about Dr. Reed?
Speaker 2: Adolph Reed taught Political Science, very arching brow, light brown-skinned man, handsome, drank a lot, I mean not in class, but I knew that he did.  But he would stand in that class, tall man, the Political Science, and he would talk about the hypocrisy of American war history and involvements and escapades of venture and, of course, that was - [President Dwight D.] Eisenhower had already warned us about the military industrial complex and the military and hypocrisy.  But Reed was, I was thinking a few minutes, he was kind -- I guess he must have been to me what Herbert Marcuse must have been to Angela [Davis, HM].  And I don't think that Reed -- Marcuse was a (unclear) a communist, but Reed, I don't think -- he never had any of that kind of political party affiliation.  But his ideology was so challenging and contrary to American government assumptions of what was right and wrong.  And he used to talk about how all these wars were fought in the name of religion and they would do the "X" sign and then send the troops out to kill people.  And, and, he just pointed out all the contradictions.  One of the world's great professors he was there at Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], this jewel, that I just happened to be in the class with.  And so when the movement came, and we were kicked out, Reed was the only professor that spoke out.  He wrote a letter, about fifteen pages, open letter to President Clark.  And it was of the most beautiful treatises.  I still have a copy of that about the challenge facing Black and the failure of Black leadership and Clark and the strength of this [Civil Rights] Movement and the embarrassment that was coming from what Clark was doing and the way he handled this thing.  Reed got fired.  And before he recently passed, he last taught I think over at University of Arkansas, Pine Bluff.  But that was a college professor.  The others at Southern, upper middle-class, college teachers, nice houses in Southern Heights, they were supportive.  They'd tell you on the side, "I really support what you're doing, what you kids are doing is really a good thing".  But Reed was the one that challenged, that stood there in front of the authority, gave up his job.  And so when you say, what were others doing when Clark was doing all this stuff?  Most of them, nothing, but waiting to enjoy the fruits of that young people's revolution, as they do today.
Story_ID: 624492
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now in terms of yourself, now, how did your, your parents take this and (unclear)?  Was it a big shock or did you, or did you see it coming?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't a big shock.  I knew that this was, expulsion was coming.  I hadn't talked to my parents about it because I'd preferred not to alert them in advance.  But when I -- the night that I was expelled I called home, talked to my mother [Will Ella Bailey].  I remember I went down to the first-floor lounge of my dormitory, little small, three-story place and got on the pay phone and called home.  And I said, mama, I've been expelled from school.  I've got to leave the campus.  And she said, I know, son, I saw it on television.  And I said, well, we're going to, we're going to have a place to stay.  I think initially we were moving to a Black hotel in downtown Baton Rouge, Lorraine -- not Lorraine, the Lincoln Hotel.  And she said, well, just be careful.  And if you need anything or, and when you need to call me, call me.  It wasn't any outrage.  It wasn't any fear.  It was support.
Speaker 1: That's, that was a good thing.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 624493
Speaker 1: How did you wind up at, at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts?
Speaker 2: I got into Clark because student leaders at several of the black colleges in the South were being expelled, and so students at some of the schools in the North wanted to help.  And they raised a scholarship fund by washing cars and having bake sales at Clark in Worcester.  A thousand kids, one Black undergraduate student.  And, and so they raised this money, and they -- Worcester is about forty-five miles outside of Boston [Massachusetts].  And it was always a progressive school, a lot of New York kids come there.  It was the first, and maybe the only place, Sigmund Freud lectured at. It kind of looked on in the town as being a little bit on the left of the political spectrum.  And very renowned in certain areas and so they offered the scholarship to the President, Black kid, of Jackson State in Mississippi, who had been kicked out.  And I'd met him, Walter Williams, at a Race Relations Seminar of students at Wisconsin in the summer before.  When we -- again, as I mentioned going to NSA [National Student Association]  in the summer of my Freshman to Jun -- Sophomore year, and the summer of my Sophomore to Junior year, I was at another NSA meeting in, in Wisconsin for about three weeks, of Black and White students looking at the Civil Rights issues.  And so one of those was this fellow, Walter Williams, who had been thrown out or was going to be thrown out at Jackson State.  After he was expelled, they contacted him about coming to Clark to get this scholarship.  Walter said, I'm going into the Service, but here's somebody I know.  And they contacted me at this mo -- hotel in downtown Baton Rouge where we were staying, asked me if I was interested.  And I, of course, I was interested.  I knew they weren't going to let me back in Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] even though we sued them to get back in, but the President had -- was determined that I would not be readmitted.  So, so that's how I got up to Worcester was that they gave me a scholarship.  Then I got up there in Massachusetts and, of course, I didn't know what to expect with the weather.  I went to the Army Surplus and bought flight boots and spiked shoes and stuff like that, which I never used, but I thought that I was going to need while I was up there (laughter).  So anyway I was there at Clark, and, 200,000 people in Worcester at the time, 10,000 Blacks.  The Black, little small Black community, but they had many jobs.  One factor, big factory had 2,000, no 1,800 workers, eighteen Blacks.  They were all janitors.  But when I first got to Clark and I'd be walking around the campus, kids would want to talk to me about the South.  This was '62 [1962] and what was happening with James Meredith -
Story_ID: 624494
Speaker 1: We're in Worcester, Massachusetts [Clark University].  And students are asking you about life in South --
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: And you know they were nice, and you know, there was one Black girl on the campus, beautiful Black girl from Detroit.  And I couldn't make it to first base with her, so in time, well, as soon as I got a girlfriend, it was a White young lady, a very nice girl that was from up in Massachusetts.  So I was -- and they had, and they'd, I'd gotten a couple of White guys as roommates in an apartment on the campus.  So everything was lovely.  But I, suddenly I began to say, well, now, something's wrong with this picture.  I'm walking all around on this campus.  I'm being treated so nicely, but they all would keep talking about the South.  And so I said, well, let me talk to them about Worcester, what's the black community doing here?  So we organized a group, and we started tutoring kids in the black community.  And that plant where they, which they had eighteen Blacks and they were all janitors, we picketed them.  And we brought in speakers.  I brought Malcolm X to speak.  I, I called him personally, just me and Malcolm on the telephone.
Speaker 1: Just called Temple [Mosque] Number 7.  He, he was in New York then, right?
Speaker 2: He was in New York.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And I called him [Malcom X] at his home, and asked him to come speak at Clark.  And he agreed to do it, very nice accommodating man.  I didn't have to go through a lot of rigamaroll.  This was when I went to Clark in '62 [1962].  I think I brought Malcolm in '63 [1963].  And when some of my group people heard that Malcolm was going to come, that I was bringing Malcolm, they threatened to resign from my Board unless I brought in somebody to give the other side.  And so I called Malcolm back, and again, the guy was very accessible to me.  Here I was just a college student, trying to put this program together.  And I said, well, they said I've got to have somebody to present the other side.  So he said, well, I'll debate Martin Luther King [Jr.].  So I said, well, let me see if I can arrange that.  So I called Atlanta, and I said, I'm D'Army Bailey.  I'm a student here at Clark in Worcester and we're having this program.  And we're bringing Malcolm X and we want to have a debate.  We want to have Dr. King there.  Would Dr. King come?  And they told me, no, Dr. King wasn't available.  And said, and we suggest instead, Bayard Rustin.  So, of course, that didn't sound too appealing to me.  I mean why should I bring Bayard Rustin to Worcester to debate Malcolm X.  I mean Bayard Rustin, even though he had organized -- in fact, by that time, I don't know that he'd actually organized the March on Washington.  That came in the summer of '63 [1963].  And he was well known, but that wasn't anybody that I felt deserved to be put on the stage debating Malcolm X.  Malcolm X was a major, ideological, political, intellectual challenge to America.  And so I think Malcolm was right.  If he was going to debate, he wanted to debate Dr. King.  So I called Malcolm though, and I said, well, they said that you, they want you to debate Bayard Rustin.  And he said, well, I knew Dr. King wasn't going to debate me, but I'm not going to debate Bayard Rustin.  So then I told the folks at Worcester, I said, well, Malcolm won't do that.  And so I went ahead and brought him without any debate at all.  But in, in doing that I had the chance to meet him, and he didn't tell me when he was going to get to town.  He just said he'd let me know when he got there.  And I got a call about 7:00 in the morning saying he was in town, and I went and met with him and -- with my girlfriend, a White girl, and drove him, she and I, around town.  And he was -- she sat in the back seat and Malcolm and I sat in the two front seats.  And he didn't seem in the least bit bothered or out of turn because this Black student here has got this White girlfriend in the back seat.  He was there as a guest doing his job, and did it superbly that day.  We took him to a radio station for an on-air interview that he and I did.  He did all the talking.  They tried to get me to get into a little debate with him, which I wouldn't do.  And he had an interview with the Editorial Board of the paper.  It wasn't scheduled.  They just listened to him at the radio station which was combined with the newspaper.  And then we had dinner that night with some, a small group of faculty people and supporters of my group.  And then we had his speech that night.  And then we went -- from there, we went to the basement of the, one of the student dormitories and he spent about an hour answering questions and engaging in repartee with a group, mostly of White students.  Muslims came in from Boston and New Haven for the occasion, especially a larger group (unclear).  When it was all over with, I walked back over to my dormitory, not dormitory, but apartment across the street from the dormitory, second floor.  And we went upstairs, and I thanked him, and I gave him a check for $75.00.  And that covered the cost of his trip.  And he was gone.  But that was one very exciting and insightful opportunity for me, spending that time at Clark, having organized or worked to organize this group in Worcester.

Speaker 1: And then, after I finished Clark [University, Worcester, Massachusetts], I did a year at Boston University Law School [Boston University School of Law, Boston, Massachusetts], which was '64 and '65.  And the climate of America then was Vietnam.  [President] Lyndon Johnson had forced Congress to pass the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in the Fall of 1964.  And the United States expanded the war.  And so protests expanded.  Boston was one center of it, along with other places on the East coast.  So I would go to some of these protest meetings where they would have all night, what they called "teach-in's" where they would engage in lengthy analyses, intellectually of the fallacy of U.S. venturism in Vietnam against the back drop of the French failure of Dien Bien Phu, and their withdrawal.  And so I became intellectually broadened by the criticisms of the United States foreign policy as it developed around Vietnam during that, beginning that year in '64 in Boston, my first year of law school, and then on when I moved to Yale [Law School, New Haven, Connecticut] as a transfer student for my second and third year.  And the anti-war debate was continuing to rage.  Now, in the process, I did some Civil Rights work in the summers.  I became involved with a National organization of Law students.  They were doing Civil Rights work when I moved to -- well, actually, when I was at Boston and then when I moved to Yale.
Speaker 2: [OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION]
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was -- are there are law school experiences -- you know, I know there are -- there's got to be a couple of stories briefly about law school (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, when I got to New Haven [Connecticut], and Yale [Law School, New Haven, Connecticut] had been my goal once I got to the East Coast.  When I -- and, and when I graduated from Clark [University, Worcester, Massachusetts], I, as I say, I was never the brilliant student.  I was brilliant.  I just didn't show it in the grades, you know.  (Laugh)  And so because of my not showing it in the grades and test scores --
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Hold it sir, could you start that sentence over again?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I was not among the brilliant students in school, so I got turned down by Yale, Columbia Law Schools [New York City, New York], and Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], when I applied coming out of undergraduate.  I got accepted at Boston University [School of Law, Boston, Massachusetts].  So I was coming through New Haven one day, and I said, well, I'm going to stop over there anyway.  They turned me down, but let me see what I can do.  So I went to the Dean of Students' office, not Dean of Students, Dean of Admissions, walk into his office, and it's a one-armed White man, sitting behind the desk; nice enough to let me barge in and see him, through his secretary, of course.  And I sit down and talk with him, and it turns out he's from up the country, eighty miles from Memphis, Baldwin, Tennessee.  And so he took a liking to me, Jack Tate and also my involvement in Civil Rights that I brought with me.  And so he said, let me see if we can get you in.  Well, they'd already filled the class, and he got me on the waiting list and couldn't get me in.  So he said, well, you go on and to another school, and you can come here afterwards.  So I did my first year at Boston University.  Well, in the summer of '65 [1965], at the end of my first year, I went to New Orleans.  The NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Legal Defenses Fund office in New York, that was the summer that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act became effective, which had put a ban on racial discrimination in employment.
Story_ID: 624496
Speaker 1: So the, in the summer of '65 [1965], the, they sent one Black law student -- it wasn't just Black law students, but as it turned out, I think it was all Blacks, to each of the deep Southern states to start organizing workers' complaints under Title VII which just had become effective.  So I went in the summer of '65 [1965].  And I was in the office of Ernest Morial, who was one of the Black lawyers in New Orleans doing Civil Rights, later to become mayor.  And I worked that summer and, organizing workers in filing discrimination complaints under Title VII.  And then under, and, and then after I went back to Yale and after my second year of law school, I took a summer job.  There was a national organization of law students -- because there were so many legal cases in the South, a few lawyers, Black and White, who would handle race cases, were overwhelmed.  And so the thought came up that we can service these lawyers if we can get law students to go down to the South and work with them.  And so this organization was formed called, called the Law Students Civil Rights Research Council.  And some White lawyers and Senators, Senator Javits, I think was involved in New York and some peo, some people from the Kennedy administration and some lawyers to form this national group that was going to help to recruit law students.  And they called it Law Students Civil Rights Research Council and they got offices in the National headquarters of the American Civil Liberties Union.  And so that organization had, in the summer of '66, about eighty law students in the South.  And I was assigned to supervise them.  So I had to travel that summer to all of these places in the South, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, where these Civil Rights activities were going on to supervise these law students.  So I did that, and then my third year, when I graduated, I was elected to be the Director of this organization.  And so I went to New York from, from Yale, as the National Director of this organization, LSCRRC, we called it for short.  And I did that for a year.  We had chapters at about forty law schools around the country, all of the major schools.  And we recruited each year up to 200 law students and sent them South.  We raised our money from private foundations.  And they did volunteer Civil Rights work with lawyers and with some community activists.  I had a student, Ron Kessler, for example, that was assigned to work with Fannie Lou Hamer in Louisville.  Some worked with Marian Wright [Edelman, HM].  The same organization, when Hillary Clinton finished law school, was her first job, was through this organization that I'm talking about, LSCRRC.  But, and some of the people that had gone through the organization, many of them, are now in some of the leading and most progressive lawyers, judges around the country.
Speaker 2: Julius Chambers [HM] (unclear).
Speaker 1: Julius was, in fact, we used to send law students to work with Julius, Julius Chambers and people like that.  So I did that for that year, out of Yale.  And then I -- it was a one-year job, and I had to decide do I stay in New York?  I had several job offers and an offer to come back to Memphis.  One to go to New Orleans, one to go to Columbus, Indiana with Cummins Engine Foundation, which was doing some progressive Civil Rights kind of things out there.  The head of it was Phil Sorensen, brother of Ted Sorensen.  Chris Hadley, who later -- who had just left as Assistant Director to become head of the United Negro College Fund, and they were looking for his replacement.  And they brought me out for an interview, and I -- but I decided -- I had an offer to go to San Francisco.  And I'd been out there, and -- a couple of times on my job because we had law students in, at Hastings, Bolt and up -- and down in Southern.  So I chose to -- when I finished that year, go to San Francisco.  So after a year in New York, out of Yale [Law School, New Haven, Connecticut], I then went to San Francisco to join the staff of the San Francisco Neighborhood Legal Services [San Francisco Neighborhood Legal Assistance Foundation].  And that was in 1968.
Story_ID: 624497
Speaker 1: That's when San Francisco [California] was a center for counter cultural, you know, the counter cultural (unclear) --
Speaker 2: San Francisco was very definitely the center of counter cultural revolution.
Speaker 1: (Unclear), yeah. (laughter)
Speaker 2: One of the things I just mentioned as a high, as a sidelight, just reflecting back to Worcester [Massachusetts], one of the people that I met there was [Abbot] Abbie Hoffman.  And Abbie had graduated from Brandeis [University, Waltham, Massachusetts], but Worcester was his home.  And so when I was there [Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts], and I was in my group, Worcester Student Movement, we were the only focus for organized agitation in town.  So Abbie joined our group, and he became our Public Relations Officer.  And so I used to, he used to kind of work for me and, in terms of that level.  In fact, he mentions me in one of his books, I think still, this movie.  But moving on back from Abbie because he was an extraordinarily interesting person, in his total rejection of the organized system of proper values of dialogue, discourse, often to authentication and protests.  And I'll give you one example, and it's just very minor.  But he wrote something in our newsletter that was completely made up, untrue.  And I called Abbie.  I said, Abbie, they said that you wrote this thing about such and such had happened in this (unclear).  That never happened. He said, no, Bailey, look. He said, when you're just writing, they'll believe anything.  But he was, it was nothing to him, that he was just -- he was that kind of counter culturalist.  But anyway, that's a, a sideline on Abbie.
Story_ID: 624498
Speaker 1: But I went on to California to start practicing with Legal Services in San Francisco [San Francisco Neighborhood Legal Assistance Foundation].  And I went to their Central Office to work on test cases dealing with large, schemes that were exploiting consumers.  I spent a lot of time against a big auto dealer out there that was -- closed him down, actually, in a lawsuit that we filed.  But that's how I ended up traversing from West -- I mean from the East coast there in Massachusetts to Connecticut at law school and then to New York.  And then out to, to California.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, at the Legal Services Offices, now, you, you're having, you had some conflicts in the Legal Services Offices --
Speaker 1: (Laughter)
Speaker 2: -- which resulted in --
Speaker 1: Well, conflict follows me, you know.  The, and, you know, it's really -- for me, you know, my brother [Walter Lee Bailey, Jr., HM], he loves golf.  (Laughter)
Speaker 2: You're sort of an agitator?
Speaker 1: Well, yeah (unclear) (laughter).
Speaker 2: So you, and you can't leave stuff alone when it looks like it's wrong?
Speaker 1: No, I mean, you know, then what's the point in life.  You know, I mean it's a hobby to me, making trouble, making agitation.  But you do it deliberately.  I mean that's like any other hobby.  You don't just do it helter skelter.  You have a cause.  And you have an objective.  You have adversaries.  You take hits.  You try to survive.  So to me it's politics and Civil Rights and challenge and intrigue.  So when I got to Legal Services out there, the man that hired me, nice, liberal White man, Jerome Collin, very well respected in the Legal Services community.  But he hired a hot-shot White lawyer to come in, Sid Wolinsky, and he had told me, Jerome had, that they were going to give me latitude to keep up some of my outside activities and, and let me do some things as I saw them at Legal Services.  But Wolinsky came in and wanted to be my boss, tell me some things to do, and I didn't adjust to that.  Well, that wasn't why I got in trouble.  That was part of it, but the bigger part was that I took my agitation away from me to other people in the office, staff.  We had Hispanics on the staff that were grumbling.  We had Black lawyers out in the neighborhood offices that were grumbling.  And so rather than let myself be the lone target, sitting there in the Central Office, I started orchestrating the grumbling.
Speaker 2: Kind of rubbed the sores of discontent?
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  I have to laugh.  So, of course, the Blacks heading the -- I remember Ed Dall, a Black lawyer headed one of the neighborhood offices and Ben Travis whose still out in the Bay area, a lawyer -- he's a judge now, headed another one.  Ben was in Fillmore, and Ed Dall was out at Hunter's Point.  And, of course, they supported me and agreed with me, but, you know, they didn't -- I mean, again, it's kind of going back to Southern, you know, man, you're doing the right thing, kind of like, you know.  But anyway, I went to a Board meeting and demanded that the head of Legal Services, Director, resign in this conflict that I had stirred up or helped to stir up.  And so he did.  But I was the center of all of this agitation that led to that.  So they hired a Black lawyer, brought him in from one of the outlying offices, John Stewart, nice guy, apparently, very capable, reasonably capable.  Well, the first thing he did was to fire me; called me in and said, (unclear) (simultaneous) --
Speaker 2: I'm tempted to think that there was some collusion behind the scenes, you know, before he was hired.  Did you, did you suspect that?
Speaker 1: Well, I knew that he knew, when he took the job, that he and I couldn't stay in the same office, whether somebody told him that or whether that was his own strategy.  So I knew and I expected and that's, that's fair game.  That's, that's, that's the game of politics and struggle.  I mean I, I can't cry foul.
Story_ID: 624499
Speaker 1: So what did you do next?
Speaker 2: Then I didn't work for a little while because while I was with Legal Services [San Francisco Neighborhood Legal Assistance Foundation], a White fellow came up to me and volunteered to help me and it turned out, he was a millionaire, he and his wife.  And he said to me, he said, look my wife and I got quite a lot of money.  We -- our families are rich from back East.  And we don't, we don't deserve the money, and we want to do some decent things, progressive.  They were politically progressive.  He had been a prestigious school back East.  So he said, Bailey, what can I do with the money.  He's in my office.  I said, well, you can give me a million dollars and didn't blink.  I was serious about that.  He said, well, let me talk to my wife and I'll talk back with you.  So he called -- he came back, sat down with me again.  He said, well, my wife and I talked and we're not going to give you a million dollars.  He said, but we will bring a million dollars out here from the East coast and set up a trust fund.  And we'll allow you to administer it and you can -- he said, because we want to support politically progressive causes.  So you can take all of the interests on the money.  You can't invade the principal.  You can, you can invade up to a $100,000 of the principal without our permission, but the rest of it has to be the earnings, and up to $100,000.  And you can give to causes that you see fit.  And we'll pay you $10,000 a year to do that.  And so I had that deal and I had an ad, advisory job with the Field Foundation in New York, which comes out of the Marshall Field money out of Chicago.  And the Field Foundation was one of the groups that I'd worked with when I was in New York.  And they are one of the biggest, well, one of the financiers behind the Civil Rights Movement.  And they were headed by a very noble White man by the name of Leslie Dunbar.  And Leslie had supported John Lewis [HM], Vernon Jordan [HM], George Riley with the National Welfare Rights Organization, Cesar Chavez, and [Andrew] Andy Young [HM] was on their Board, as was Ruth Field, who was the Chairperson of it.  And so they hired me as a consultant, and I would fly back to New York to meet with their Board and when they were reviewing grant applications, and have input on that.  So with what I made from the Field Foundation and what my friends were paying me to administer this trust for them excuse me, I, as a single person was able to keep my nice little cottage and drive my BMW convertible around the Bay area and not really worry about working for the time being.
Speaker 1: And maybe more importantly, you didn't worry about what you said or did in terms of job security (unclear).
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So they've, they've un-unleashed a tiger.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Speaker 1: The genie's out of the bottle.  So --
Speaker 2: I hadn't looked at it like that.
Speaker 1: Is that how you felt, though? You must have felt free.
Speaker 2: I did.
Story_ID: 624500
Speaker 1: All right, where was I on that sentence -- oh, I was talking about bringing my friend in from, and, and the Legal Services in Berkeley [California].  And that'll be important so, am I continuing now with my friend Howard Simons, who'd been practicing law in San Fran -- no, he wasn't practicing.  He was servicing as a Legislative Aide in Sacrament to [Mervyn] Merv Dymally [HM], who was then big in the California Assembly.  And I'd urged him to come to Berkeley.  He joined the staff of Legal Services in Berkeley, and while I served as Chairperson of that Board, there were conflicts.  The woman who ran it, a White woman, Carol Ruth Silver, later became a Board of Supervisors member there in San Francisco.  But she ran it with an iron hand, and I supported my friend Ira, and a White radical guy, a White radical guy, Steve Bingham, who was a lawyer on our staff.  And he and my friend, Ira, were both fired.  And I helped fight to try to keep them, keep their jobs.  Steve, interestingly, was the individual who was accused of going to visit George Jackson as his lawyer, when George Jackson was in San Quentin.  And they accused Steve of being the lawyer that smuggled the gun, during the lawyer visit, in to George Jackson.  And they say that when George Jackson was returning from the lawyer visit, that he pulled the gun, and there was a shootout and he was killed.  And so when that happened at San Quentin, they started looking for Steve, Steve Bingham.  And the nice guy lawyer that I had known, and had fixed dinner for me in his apartment and drove a motorcycle around, suddenly disappeared.  And Steve stayed disappeared for several years as a prime suspect in that, in that case.  He eventually was apprehended and brought back and was sentenced out there.  But he was on the Board, I mean on the staff of Legal -- Berkeley Legal Services when I was Chairman of the Board.  But as we were out there, and my friend Ira, was there now with me in Berkeley, nice, handsome, young Black man I was, twenty-eight, twenty-nine years old, nice, beautiful little cabin that I had with Hi-Fi, and I had a plastic case that I made with translucent plastic and colored lights underneath that would vibrate to the music.  And I'd have parties, man, with strobe lights going.  (Laughter).  So I was having a ball, you know.  And Ira and I were sitting around one day talking and Ron, [Ronald] Ron Dellums [HM] had just gotten elected to Congress.  And so we knew there was a vacancy on City Council.
Story_ID: 624501
Speaker 1: Okay, well, we're rolling.  This is, can you explain a little bit about--we're talking about you running for City Council, getting the idea to fill the vacancy left by [Ronald] Ron Dellums [HM] in City Council.  And what was Berkeley like?  Was there a Black population in Berkeley [California] of any sig, significance?
Speaker 2: Well, there was.  Berkeley's population was 125,000 and twenty-five percent of it was black.  Now, I was--I went, as I said, I went out there to practice in San Francisco--practice law in San Francisco.  And I went all over town for about two weeks, apartment hunting, Chinatown, everywhere.  And people wouldn't rent to me.  I mean they'd--I mean it wasn't just always that.  Sometimes it was, been rented or price too high, something.  But there was a lot of racial discrimination in San Francisco in the housing.  In fact, I later, I served as a consultant to the National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing and helped them in one or two lawsuits against racial discrimination out there in the Bay area.  But we got--we, meaning my girlfriend and I, Judy Dunner, had moved from New York when I moved.  And we lived together for a year and a half.  And the problems of getting housing, I was with Legal Services. [San Francisco Neighborhood Legal Assistance Foundation]  I was over in the Bay area, up with Jerry Collin, the Director at his home one night.  And woke up and looked at the paper the next morning, and there was a little cabin, a little cottage offered for rent so I ended renting on the East Bay side, even though I was working in San Francisco.  So every day I would drive across the bridge to practice and then come back to the East Bay.  So by being in the East Bay, I became more aware of the politics of that side of the Bay.  San Francisco's politics--San Francisco was only 10 percent black.  So it had one of the lowest of the black populations in the Bay area.  Well, I didn't really move over there to live in Berkeley.  I was living in a little bedroom community called Kensington, right next to Berkeley, until I decided to run for City Council.  Berkeley, itself, 125,000, the blacks--Berkeley starts at the Freeway, which borders the Bay on the West side.  And then it goes into town, past the University of California and then uphill into the Berkeley Hills, which is the higher income area.  So in the flatter area, between the University going back toward the Freeway, is where most of your black population was living, the flatlands, as we called it.  And they were homeowners, most of them, blacks, and very proud of who they were and where they were.  Politically, not very aggressive.  There was one black that had originally been the first black on the City Council, Wilmont Sweeney.  And when he was elected, that was nirvana.  And everybody was excited about it, the first black elected.  A few years later, they elected Ron Dellums and another black, Warren Widener.  So, but the Mayor of Berkeley was a Republican white man because, you really have to understand that, 125,000 people.  Well, now, in '71' [1971], when I ran for the Council, it was just beginning to be where they said that students could register to vote in the places that they went to school.  And so until then, that whole University campus was essentially disenfranchised, except for the faculty.  So even though one had the image of Berkeley and Clark Kerr and the riots and activism and Telegraph Avenue and the Street people, the really political part of Berkeley was conservative, Ronald Reagan-type Republicans.  And that's who controlled the town, and they were in the league with the business community in Berkeley.
Story_ID: 624502
Speaker 1: And so when I ran in '71' [1971], it was the first real challenge to that control of Berkeley [California].  I didn't know it all to be that at the time that I fell into it because that literally is what happened.  Ira and I were sitting up in his apartment one night smoking dope and having a good time listening to music, bullshitting around as we would do sometimes.  There were Eucalyptus trees around, deck outside, redwood, two-story house, having a ball.  And we just got to talking about where were we and what we were going to do.  And we said, well, let's run for the City Council.  And so we made that decision that night, sitting on the floor in his apartment listening to music, smoking dope.  Well, where do you go from there?  I mean, I didn't even live in Berkeley.  I lived in Kensington.  Nobody really knew me.  I was a little active in the Berkeley black caucus, became more active.  I still had my friends' funds that I was giving out, and so I gave the Caucus $500.00 to open an office, went to their meetings and gave [Ronald] Ron Dellums' [HM] campaign $500.00.  Well, single-black man walking around giving $500.00 here and $500.00 there.  (Laughter)
Speaker 2: That made you popular
Speaker 1: (Laugher) There you go.
Speaker 2: But there's another point here I wanted to raise.  We, we interviewed Ron Dellums in D.C. and--well, his wife.  And we--Dellums was elected by a non-black majority.  There're only eighteen percent of the voters that were black that elected Dellums.  So there's a signal that, you know, wasn't that called a sign-post for you that you could get elected in Berkeley without--he was elected to Congress with a black minority.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, oh yeah.  And you see, what happened was that--and we didn't know this, Ira and I.  We were just, we were new there.  I mean we were just young people--I, you know, part of the reason I had gone to California was the partying.  I'd seen "The Graduate" with Dustin Hoffman and just, you know, challenging authority and so, you know, if not then, when?  I mean I was young and time to enjoy life.  So we came out of that Berkeley Hills there with our plan to run for the Council.  And I got more active in the Black Caucus.  Well, there were--the election was coming up in April of '71' [1971].  Now, the white radicals, the University people, the alternative cultures, the free-speech types, the Socialists types, the Women's Libs, the community activists, all formed into kind of a collective called the "April Coalition", looking toward the April elections.  And they had started well before '71' [1971] in meetings and plannings and platform discussions with radicals and activists in gymnasiums and stuff all over town.  Well, I didn't really know anything about all this.  I hadn't been to any of that stuff, you know, and that's what they were doing.  So they, the white coalition of activists, went to the Berkeley Black Caucus.  Now, this was a group of-it was run by two established Berkeley black progressive leaders, Maudelle Shirek, who to this day is on the Berkeley Council.  She's in her 80's, I think, and Matt Crawford, who had been active years before in the Communist or left-wing politics.  And they were running the Berkeley Black Caucus.  And Dellums had gotten, was, was a close alliance with Maudelle and Matt and Joe Brooks, a black, younger black activist in, in Berkeley.  And some of the, and then some black business, young black business people who, that were Berkeley, and a few in Oakland.  They had their own kind of coalition of blacks going too.
Story_ID: 624503
Speaker 1: And so [Ronald] Dellums [HM] was kind of the centerpiece because he was the prize of the radical left, the white radical left.  He had just gotten elected on an anti-war campaign, so he was their darling.  Blacks were happy to have him.  He, he was a social worker in Berkeley before he became a Congressman in Oakland.  And so they made a deal through Dellums, that the Black Caucus--there were four seats up for the Berkeley City Council.  And they'd run two blacks and two whites.  Black Caucus would pick two and the April Coalition would pick two.  And there would be a slate for the four seats.  And Berkeley has no run-off.  The top four will--top four vote getters win.  And so, and then the agreement was that when the ticket is put together, Ron Dellums would endorse it.  That was the trump card, that it was going to be the Dellums-led, endorsed slate.  And so I think our first campaign picture was the four of us with Dellums in the center holding our hands up on the Alameda County Court, Courthouse steps, not Alameda County, but the Federal Building where his office was as a Congressman.  And, and so with that deal having been planned between the blacks and whites, Ira and I knew that all we needed to do to position ourselves for this race was to get the endorsement of the Berkeley Black Caucus.  And so by beginning to go actively to the Caucus meetings, even before we had talked about running, as something to do, then we told them that we were gonna run.  Well, they already had in mind who they wanted to run, a black woman named Margo Dashiell and a black businessman named Ken Simmons.  And so that took them aback when we said we wanted to run for the two seats for the blacks.  And we were going to run together.  We didn't say for the two seats.  We didn't necessarily peg it to the deal.  So they said, well, no, said, we already got our candidates.  We said, well, that's fine.  We're going to run anyway.  Well, you got two black lawyers, young.  I got a Yale law degree.  Ira's got a Howard law degree, articulate, and money.  So they said, well, don't both of yall run.  We'll let one of yawl run, and we'll take one of our two people, and that'll be our ticket.  Well, the call is gonna be mine because I had the funds and control of the deal from our side because of that.  Well, I knew that if I went with that deal, then I would have to throw Ira aside because he wouldn't have been bringing any resources to the table.  And I didn't wanna get involved in a split between, on our deal.  And because--I didn't want--I already knew that only ally I had was an out-of-town like me.  And I just didn't feel comfortable walking into the waters by ditching the only ally that I had.  And that--and so I said, no.  You either take both of us or neither.  So they then ended up having to drop both of their candidates which led to some long-term resentment, not only among the candidates, but among some of the people of the Caucus.  But we then funded the opening of a campaign office.  They capitulated and gave us their endorsement.  And then suddenly we were on a ticket with the white radicals who didn't even know who we were.
Story_ID: 624504
Speaker 1: Now, they also had made a deal with the [Black] Panthers, that the Panthers were gonna be part of this, supporting the ticket too.  And then we all were committed to support a basic ballot proposition that was on the same ballot with us, that was to divide the Berkeley Police Department into four districts and have elected representatives in each district.  And they would run the Police Department, decentralization of police, and which we all endorsed.  And that was the running point, and that was on the ballot.  That lost, by the way.  Well, with that ticket put together, now, the conserv--I mean the whites said, all right, we're together as a ticket now.  Now, here's our campaign platform, and here's our strategy.  We've been working on this for all this time.  And I said, wait a minute.  I said, yall got yall's strategy and we got ours (laughter).  I said, now, we got our campaign office down here, and we're gonna hire our own staff.  And we'll campaign with you all in the black community, once we get known in the black community.  But until then, we're not going to start bringing you all into the black community as part of the ticket because the black community traditionally, even though it had to, had the common interests in some ways with the white Left, was more conservative and suspicious of the white Left.  So we said, no, we, we're not gonna to embrace your platform all together either.  We'll embrace the largest parts of it.  So here they suddenly had two people they didn't know on their ticket who weren't gonna buy into these months of pre-planning that they'd done, and had the resources to open our own campaign office, which was my friends' money because what I did, what I did was when, when Ira and I made the decision, I went to my friend, and I said, look, I need to use some of this money to run for--I says, I and Ira have decided to run for City Council, and I need to use some of this money to do it.  And I told him I needed $25,000.  And I spent a little bit more than, probably thirty [$30,000], but he agreed, and so I had some money.  Now, we started, and we hired a black guy because we didn't know the community.  It turned out he was a reformed heroin addict that we fired for theft.  And then he had a press conference attacking me and Ira because--and some of the Black Caucus people were grumbling with him because they were mad at us anyway because we had pulled the rug out from under their deal, co-opted their seats.  Whites were mad at us because we weren't going along with the pre-planned program which was to run as two blacks on their ticket and their agenda.  And so we were fighting.  Before the election, we had some bitter fights.  They would put out campaign literature, and wouldn't sometimes even have us, and vice versa.  We kept it quiet till the election.  [Ronald] Ron Dellums [HM] was caught in the middle.  He couldn't quell it.  He had no real power.  He never has had--I mean he's had power image wise, but at the bottom level of deciding the priorities and for us, he was powerless in this conflict, couldn't control us and couldn't control them.  And yet, he was endorsing both sides.  And so, in fact, when I filed to run I wasn't even registered.  I didn't--I'd never been to a Council meeting.  And so I went up to City Hall to register and went to the clerk's office, and she asked for my registration.  And I had to go down the hall and register before I could even sign up as a candidate.  Now, you had to be a resident of Berkeley under the regulations, ninety days.  So I moved into Berkeley from Kensington, took me an apartment, about ninety-five, ninety-six days before the election in order to qualify.  Now, Ira was already living in Berkeley and had to register to vote.  And then I signed up as a candidate.  In fact, that was one of the accusations against me during the election.  They called me and they said, I was a carpetbagger, said both of us were carpetbaggers.  In fact, when we would have televised debates, KQED would carry one or two of the candidates.  I'd go through the initial candidate presentations, and one of them--or two of them that I knew were particularly hot and prominent, and I knew there would be conservative plants in the audience.  And I'd leave before the question period 'cause they had plants to jump up, and the first question was gonna be, "how long have you lived in Berkeley", which I was trying to ditch, trying to avoid that question and did successfully as an issue.
Story_ID: 624505
Speaker 1: When the election came, 33-- 33 candidates, top four go-getters win.  I was Number two.  My friend, Ira, the other black, was Number three, and the white woman was Number four.  Now, the fifth person was a student that was on our ticket, white student that was from U-C [University of California] Berkeley.  There was a deal.  There would be a student, a woman, two blacks.  Now, the lead candidate was a white man, Ed Kallgren, who was a Democrat--moderate Democrat.  The only reason he came ahead of all of us was because of the thirty-three candidates, well, all of the conservative organizations in Berkeley, across the Republican and Democratic margins supported Kallgren.  But they split on all the other candidates.  So because he had the strength of the united vote, he was the lead vote getter because we were never a majority.  But with our coalition, we took the second, third and fourth seats because we had that big block.  And so at--
Speaker 2: The student didn't get elected?
Speaker 1: So he lost.  He was fifth.  So they weren't too happy.  And so the conservatives said the day after the election that they were going to recall the three of us that were elected.  They couldn't accept that defeat.  And so they started from the day after the election to undermine us.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, what was it like being a City Council member?  What were you able to do?
Speaker 1: It was a wonderful experience, a learning experience.  Berkeley had a nine-member council.  We'd just elected the first black mayor to replace the Republican.
Speaker 2: That's [Warren] Widener?
Speaker 1: Widener.  And Widener was a fence sitter.  He'd be on our side one day and the conservatives another.  And Sweeney, the other black was a conservative black that we--so the first fight that I had on the Berkeley was to pass an affirmative action program.  We had two big fights.  The first one was the affirmative action, and about the same time was the city budget because once I got elected, remember, the whites are now at our throats.  I mean we're at each other's throats.  I mean not really as bitterly, but politically because they had run into--see, while we were running, we came upon a sharp white boy who was a law student at Boalt [University of California, Berkeley, School of Law].  His name was Eugene Sydnor, S-Y-D-N-O-R.  And he was from Indiana.  And he had done political campaigning with Birch Bayh.  And so he knew politics.  He was a law student.  So we hired him after going through two unsuccessful black managers.  And he and his wife, Nancy, ran our campaign.  And Beau was one of the few white people that was extremely skilled that clashed and ran roughshod over other whites in the April Coalition on our behalf as blacks.  His objective--his allegiance was to us and to help us win.  And he knew political organizing.  And it was during that campaign that this spy came along and infiltrated our campaign that was apparently a plant of the California authorities that tried to ultimately discredit Ira and me as allies of his.  But at that time, he was just what we thought was a drunk volunteer that had come in--not drunk, but some guy that had come in off the street that we tolerated.  But we had Eugene Sydnor who was a tremendous force to help us win that election.  And so here we were out of nowhere.  So then we're elected.
Story_ID: 624506
Speaker 1: So I told Beau, I said, well, now, you put together a staff for me now that we're council people.  So he ended up--he and his wife had rented a two-story house that they leased or we paid rent to.  And he had--between him and his wife, we had 13 people, graduate students, public relations person that I hired to be a part of our staff once we were elected.  Now, this job paid $300 a month.  That's all, no expenses, no subsidy.  So I paid the people.  I paid everything out of my pocket.  And this staff that Beau put together was one of the most talented staffs that you could ever assemble.  We had some graduate students, some law students from U-C Boalt [University of California, Berkeley, School of Law] and others.  And their job was to look at all elements of city government, research every agenda item, talk to all of the community groups and bring us back and agenda, which is what they did.  I came under criticism.  Who's paying for this big staff?  And that, when the word went out in the newspaper that we'd spent $30,000 to run and $25,000 was anonymous--you could report anonymous contributions under California law.  Well, my friends, we'd go over--he and I and his wife and their children--I'd visit him in San Francisco.  We'd have a wonderful dinner, sit around and drink wine and smoke pot after dinner, beautiful couple.  And we'd talk about things all over the world.  And, but when the newspapers started asking questions, the news media, who is this fellow that's popping up here with this anonymous money, and has just gotten elected?  Then my friend got nervous.  And he said, well, D'Army, I didn't expect all this.  I mean I--when I told you you could use the money.  So I said, well, you can't leave me out here high and dry.  I mean I'm using this money to do this.  So he said, I'm--we don't want any publicity.  We don't want any exposure.  We don't want people to know who we are.  So I said, well, fine.  I said, I'll tell you what.  I said, I'm not gonna reveal who you are, said, but now, I'm out here now.  You gotta give me something to (unclear).  So they said, they'll, give me $100,000.  So they gave me a check for $100,000, paid the taxes on it, so it was tax free.  And that was for me to use that to carry on my political activities and to live.  And, of course, I had different ways of cutting my economies with my staff.  I had Eddie Williams [HM] at the Joint Center for Political Studies that sent me a full-time intern out of Washington to work with me.  So I had patched together quite an effective team.
Story_ID: 624507
Speaker 1: We were in Berkeley, were we?
Speaker 2: Yeah, city--now, we--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And we were talking about the staff that I had put together--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --of thirteen people which I immediately got criticized for by members of the Black Caucus at a press conference.  They--because once we were elected, the Caucus wanted to call us in and have us respond to an agenda that they had.
Speaker 2: And debrief you about their own agenda, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and which we did, but we said, well, we're not gonna buy that agenda either.  We will support the main components of it.  And so we found ourselves quickly on the outs with both groups that had--we'd won on.  And the conservatives, after our scalps.
Story_ID: 624508
Speaker 1: Now, at this moment--I just wanted to ask this.  Had you had any community organizing training or anything at this moment in your life, at this point in your life, previous to this or any political organizing training?
Speaker 2: Well, not really.  I had been in a lot of community efforts though.  I had spent the summer of '63' [1963] doing some community organizing myself in Washington.  We ran, organized a group and tutored some kids at, I think it was Carnegie High School there.  And we protested against Bobby Kennedy and when they indicted some kids in Albany, Georgia, Civil Rights people, and Riggs Bank over employment issues.  And so--
Speaker 1: Not really at that kind of grassroots level 'cause what I'm implying is, it sounds like you got yourself in a fix now, with these people.  And you don't have a--you were elected, but you don't really have a base now.  Your base is completely split.
Speaker 2: That's absolutely true.
Speaker 1: Which is not a thing, a political, I mean it's not politically wise position to be in. So.
Speaker 2: It isn't.  And, and, of course, it didn't matter to me.  I mean, it was in a way kind of theater.  And I don't mean to trivialize it by saying that.  I mean I--it was theater motivated from the heart and from the mind of rebellion.
Story_ID: 624509
Speaker 1: It's interesting you should say that because the written materials about that time, you're often portrayed as someone who used, from your seat on [Berkeley] City Council, were able to, you know, once again, agitate and try to change and in a very theatrical kind of way.  That's how you're always described as someone who, you know, get everybody all riled up in City Council and make--some said, some opponents have said, you made it impossible for them to conduct their normal business, which is good agitation (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, and that's very true.  And, and you really put your finger on it, which I didn't.  I mean I was, I hadn't analyzed it top to bottom with a strategy going into this thing, and I, and things developed so fast when I found myself in it that it goes back to when Dean Jones asked me, "Don't speak at the rally tomorrow".  You're in the middle of it.  And that's the way I was when I was elected.  And I had the resources to at least organize a strategic assault because City manager's office was all white, thirteen people working in there, police department, 175 officers.  I think there were five to ten blacks, fire department, five blacks, 125 firemen.  Garbage people, all black, and this is Berkeley [California].  And so--
Speaker 1: It doesn't paint a liberal picture.
Speaker 2: No. And so I had said when I ran that my first priority is to the interests of the black community.  And that, no one, I don't think, really took seriously because no one talked black community as a politician.  [Black] Panthers talked it, but not the elected officials because the idea was--and certainly not Ron [Ronald Dellums, HM] and Willie Brown, ten percent black in San Francisco, but I came out of the South where the politicians' commitment was supposed to be first to the black community.  We ran as people from a deprived nation to use the political strength to make change.  So that's what I said.  I said it when I ran.  But when I started saying that in the Council, some black conservatives said that was racists.  The women's libbers and some of them said that it was narrow.  I had a big fight with the white women's movement--not all of it, when I pushed an affirmative action program because I said, well, it'll have women, but black women in our program that give special preference, but not white women unless they're responsible for themselves and one dependent at least because then it would give them an economic equivalency to being treated in my judgment as a minority.  But just being a white woman in Berkeley and putting them in the same affirmative action program with blacks, I wasn't for because I knew you had highly educated white women out there, single, and they'd have gotten all of the good positions in our affirmative action program, when we were the ones--black people, that needed it.  Well, that didn't sit too well with a lot of the white women's libbers in Berkeley, and I got some opposition to that.  Now, the extreme white left agreed with me.  Dan Siegel, who had been president of the University, the U-C [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] student body that kind of started the riot at People's Park one day and real activists and some of those people on the far left, Thom Hayden and his people that were living there in the commune in Berkeley.  They were kind of supportive.  But the moderate, white radicals were chagrined.  The--
Speaker 1: I think you said something, the "moderate" white radicals.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So there's shadings of radicals even in this, right?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Left has the different shadings of radicals.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  And my presence really carved those divisions out between the whites who supported me on the radical left and those who opposed me.  I ran into Harry Bridges, who had been a longshoreman leader in the Bay area for many years at the airport one time.  I never met him before.  And this was after I had been recalled in the special election.  And I didn't know Harry Bridges, and he walked over to me because what happened was, that when they got the signatures to recall me in a special election in Berkeley, to get recalled, which they'd announced the day after election, it only takes 25 percent of the people who voted in the last election to sign a petition.  Well, the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I--before you get into that, I just wanted to keep it chronological.  In a sense that we get through it smoother (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Okay, thank you.
Story_ID: 624510
Speaker 1: Let's--First of all, can you--you started talking about your accomplishments, some of the problems you solved.  But you accomplished quite a bit in [Berkeley] City Council.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: What were some of those things, first?  Then we'll talk about the (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, first we forced the passage of the affirmative action program.  Now, the black member of the Council, Wilmont Sweeney said that's discrimination against white folks.  And so I had, I needed five votes.  I had me, my black, lawyer friend that was elected with me, Ira, and Alana (ph.) Hancock, the white woman elected with me--even though we had these internal fights on that affirmative action question, and the black mayor, Warren Widener, who was a fence sitter most of the time.  So I needed one more vote, and so we kept the city from passing a budget because they didn't have five votes to pass a budget.  They needed the mayor to break ranks or somebody.  And so the city operated under emergency appropriations month-to-month while we fought to pass an affirmative action program.  And I went to one moderate, white Republican known there, Gordon somebody, and I can't remember his last name yet.  And I said, look, I said, why don't you help us get this program passed, went to his office, a lawyer.  And the nice man said, yes, he'd vote with us.  And so we broke one of the conservatives from the ranks, and that gave us five votes to pass an affirmative action program in Berkeley.  And, now, what else did we do?  Well, we had a white city manager that had been presiding over the previous regimes that, and represented the powers that be.  Well, now, once I had the power of the microphone, as a council member, in the council session, and the press covered our council meetings from San Francisco and wherever.  And they would usually be filled with students and interest group people.  The chambers would always be high drama themselves.  And so I would (unclear) this theatrical stage that was our council chamber, question city officials, grill them under the glare of the lights and make life impossible for them.  At one point, one of the black officials said, well, you're berating our city officials.  I think it was the city manager had gotten a black man, and I said, I move we fire the city manager.  Wherever the opposition came, I turned the fire, even against the black mayor, Warren Widener, when he broke ranks with us and voted a white conservative to fill a vacancy that gave the conservatives then dominant power in the council.  I called him--and rushed out of the chamber.  And I couldn't think of anything to summarize my political outrage at him, having done that and sneaking out the gymnasium at a side corridor, then to say in my microphone, "There goes the city's chief pig".  I didn't hate him and it wasn't as bitter as it sounded, but it did capsule my political evaluation of this man and what he did.
Speaker 1: Quoted quite a bit too.  They--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --quoted that a lot and, but go on with the accomplishments.  (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: So the city manager resigned, and we replaced him with a black city manager.  The city attorney would sit up there and give opinions that were contrary to what we were trying to do, and by asking questions.  Remember, I had this staff.  They had every--I had a thick notebook of talking points on every issue.  So I could wear anybody out that came before the council.  That also had input from neighborhood people into my briefing books.
Speaker 1: City government wasn't used to this.
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 624511
Speaker 1: And so the city attorney resigned.  We replaced him with a black man.  Then there was a strike while I was on the council of the garbage workers, the police, and fire people, over wages.  Now, we had a professional negotiator in executive session to talk to us, tell us what the positions were.  And we'd tell him what positions we wanted him to take.  He'd go on back and negotiate with the union.  Well, I pushed in the executive, back in the quiet, said, look, let's give the garbage workers more money.  They're the lowest on the totem pole.  Well, he didn't take that point directly back.  So the garbage workers didn't know that we were pushing--that I was, to give 'em more money.  So they went on strike.  And then the negotiations broke down.  There was a garbage strike, black workers in the city.  Bobby Seale of the Panthers [Black Panther Party] and some others who were always kind of on the sidelines, wanting to be in the center of the political action, jumped into the center and accused me and Ira of not being interested in black workers in the breakdown of the negotiations.  So it was a black labor leader out there, Curt McClain, who had been a long-time, very experienced black labor organizer in San Francisco.  And he came to me, and he said, D'Army, he says, no negotiations going on, said, what you need to do is go and call for the resumption of negotiations and you go to participate.  So, so I went to the meeting, and I told--and Ira and I, and we said, look, we're gonna go back and we're gonna appear at such and such a time at the negotiating table.  I'm gonna ask the mayor to be there, and Paul Berry Kelly from the union, and our labor negotiator, but we're gonna be there.  So we got the negotiations started back.  So we were sitting around the conference table, and we got an impasse on the issues, wages and whatever.  So I said to the black garbage workers at the table, along with the white crafts people and all--but the black garbage workers are the only ones on strike; said, look, let's, let's talk.  So we went off into another room.  And I said, do you all understand that we've been pushing to give you guys a bigger increase than the rest of 'em?  They didn't know that.  I said, now, you all are holding up settling this strike and if yawl go ahead and settle this strike, yawl gonna come out ahead of these guys.  Now, they also had demanded that Martin Luther King's birthday be a holiday in the city.  Well, I threw it back at 'em, threw 'em a curve.  Instead of Martin Luther King [Jr.], I threw the counter offer of Malcolm X, which they accepted.  And Malcolm X's birthday became a holiday in Berkeley because of that.  But because I pulled that ploy with those black workers, they went back to the negotiating table and told those white guys, let's settle the strike 'cause they knew that they were gonna get more money.  And that's how we settled the sanitation strike in Berkeley.  And while at one time, when Bobby Seale and others were whipping the fervor against us, it transformed, and I became the hero of Local 390.
Story_ID: 624512
Speaker 1: And we got community groups, child care money.  We, and we had to organize, get people in there to the council chambers, black mothers and things, disruptive sometimes.  I would, issues come up from the council, and if I didn't have the votes, I'd filibuster.  I'd start talking, and then the mayor would rule me--he chaired the meeting, "Out of order", and I'd keep talking.  And they'd order that my microphone be turned off.  And I'd keep talking and some council member would be so exasperated by the confusion, he throw his hands up and leave the meeting.  But what I was trying to do was make enough of 'em exasperated enough that they'd leave, and then we'd no longer have a quorum, so that'd lose the vote.  And so I would deliberately string things out and make things stressful and filibuster, use parliamentary procedure.  And I remember one night I even manipulated a riot--I mean I didn't actually know it was gonna be a riot, but I knew it was close to it.  When the bombing of North Vietnam, and the crowds were so big, we had to move the council meeting to the school auditorium, and the conservatives kept voting on motions to condemn the bombing.  I said to myself, this ain't gonna work.  They see all, they see all these people out.  Now, they wanna look progressive.  So I kept pushing the votes more extreme, and one after the other until I could pull the covers off of 'em.  So I finally put a motion on the table for us to send money to rebuild a hospital in North Vietnam which they voted down.  And the minute the vote came on that, the radicals stormed the stage and chased the council out of the--I mean they stormed right past us, and chased others.  There was actually a line of police behind the curtains that stopped them, and we retreated across the street to City Hall, and then they took out--the masses took out to the streets and broke windows and burned things into the streets of Berkeley.  Well, I knew that I was pushing it to the edge.  But why should I let them comfortably pull the curtain, the shroud over their collaboration with Ronald Reagan who was then governor, and all of these folks that had been fighting us on every front anyway, when I suddenly had a crowd that I could turn against them.  That was all a part of the process.
Story_ID: 624513
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what about the recall?  I think the recall was led by Wilton--
Speaker 2: Wilmont, Wilmont Sweeney.
Speaker 1: Wilmont Sweeney, yeah, Wilmont Sweeney.  Now, he was the vice mayor--
Speaker 2: Vice mayor.
Speaker 1: --of the City of Berkeley [California], and he claimed that you had called him an Uncle Tom or something like that.
Speaker 2: Well, that's true.  Wilmont was the first black elected to the council, and, of course, black people, I'm sure, were very proud of him.  White people thought he was well, and, you know, there're some blacks, once they get into a position, they take white people's adoration seriously.  And they think that, ooh, this really makes me somebody.  And so he took great esteem in being thought well of, and so he felt himself kind of the keeper of decorum on the politics, on the council of the black community.  And we clashed when he fought me on affirmative action.  And so I knew that--and he voted with the conservative Democrats and Republicans.  So sometimes we'd have executive meetings in our council, behind the council chambers before we'd go into the real meeting.  And we'd be sitting around the table.  We'd have a little buffet dinner and talking about the issues on the council.  And sometimes I'd walk into the meeting, and I'd shuffle my feet and scratch my head and bend a little bit when I passed Sweeney.  And I'd say, "Yes, sir, boss, what do you want me to do today?"  And there were these white council people sitting around.  I know they didn't know what to make of it, and Sweeney would furious at me, wanna fight, cuss me.  And I don't know, I probably--I don't remember really.  I didn't need to.  I might have, probably did cuss him back.  But this was all behind the scenes.  Well, what I was trying to do was, I was trying to--I was like a matador, waving a red banner in front of him, see, get him mad enough at me so that he'd say things and be so hot and mad that I could still get some of these things passed 'cause he'd be off balance fighting me.  And so some of those things were true.  I, I didn't really personally dislike Sweeney.  But he was on the wrong side.  And I just had to do and say some things to him that were demeaning to him.  And I knew it would leave deep scars.  I said some things to the mayor, to [Warren] Widener.  But you don't make these changes without hitting deeply, wounding.
Story_ID: 624514
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, they-- but, you know, they launched this recall campaign.  Now, this was something that hadn't been done very much--well, it had--
Speaker 2: Never has been done in the history of Berkeley [California].  They tried it before with some blacks on the Berkeley school board over the school bussing, not just some blacks.  I think it was black and white.  But it failed.  But they had tried a recall in Berkeley, but there'd never been a successful one.
Speaker 1: And interestingly enough today, yeah, people trying to recall Governor Gray Davis of California, but it's an innovative state, I guess, for these kind of things (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, and one of the concerns, one of the undertones of my recall in Berkeley was whether or not this was gonna be an intimidation of outspoken black radicals who had entered into the political process.  But there weren't that many of us.  And I hadn't really gotten into this process with any grand design about deciding that this is gonna be the new strategy of black progressives.  We're gonna become political.  I'd kind of stumbled into it.  And so while the media had kind of created this picture that radicals are now shifting to work within the system.  Some had, came after us and been elected in Wisconsin.  Then the recall kind of raised the question, if radicals are gonna be going into the system, particularly, black radicals, are we going to be eliminated because of our politics through this kind of mechanism?  Now, it hasn't happened very much since because there haven't been very many blacks that have pushed to the level that I pushed to, that have deliberately sort of challenged the white community to knock me off.  But once I was able to put that challenge out to them, I took up their challenge of recall.  I knew during my two and a half years on the council that they were working steadily to build the support to recall me.
Speaker 1: Now, the way Vice Mayor [Wilmont] Sweeney framed the recall was that other black people wanted to call you back, and he was acting on behalf of the black community, right?  That's--
Speaker 2: That's the way he put it.  He--and, and, you know, that stepped on some toes with the Berkeley Black Caucus, with the black mayor.  I was an out of towner.  So, but that was not an honest, true statement.  And, in fact, in the recall, I won every black precinct in Berkeley.  I got beat in the white areas.  But thye put him out there.  It was the white Republicans and the conservatives and the business people that financed the recall and organized it and got all those signatures.  It wasn't the black community.  They put Sweeney in front of it.  And he was so mad and hostile at me that he was glad to do it.  I had a bitter, mortal enemy out there.  In fact, I visited California some times after and I called to see how he was doing and wanted to meet him, and hadn't seen him in decades.  And he wouldn't see me.  I mean I, I guess I shouldn't have been surprised, but I was disappointed that--I mean he was an adversary.  I mean I'm the one that should have been grudging.  He wanted me, he knocked me out of office, became a judge after that, got appointed by, I think it was Jerry Brown, 'cause Jerry Brown was governor during the recall.  And he sat on his hands, didn't raise a sound to try to help me, and he knew what was going on in Berkeley.

Speaker 1: Now, but you did have help nationally, I mean [Ronald] Ron Dellums [HM] stood by you, I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, he did on the surface.  He couldn't really help, but, but Ron didn't, wasn't really against the recall.  I mean these were his--see, the white left, at least the part of it that split, and I had part of it with me and part of it against me.  And the part of it that was against me was the part, the bigger part that was, that Ron was beholding to.
Speaker 1: What about Tom Hayden?  Did he help?
Speaker 2: Tom Hayden didn't do anything because, actually, before the recall, I think Tom had fallen out with his colleagues in the commune, the Red Family was the group, they named themselves.  They were living in Berkeley at the time, mostly women, and they had a women's revolt and threw Tom out of the commune.  Women took it over.  So he left, he was having his own problems, and ended up leaving Berkeley and going to Los Angeles.  So he wasn't a factor.
Speaker 1: Okay, Jesse Jackson [Rev. Jesse Jackson, HM] came down.
Speaker 2: Jesse Jackson came in and spoke for me at a rally.  I went to the National Black Lawyers Convention, which was in San Francisco during the recall, and they endorsed me, raised money for me.  Myrlie Evers, the widow of Medgar Evers, came and campaigned for me.  Julian Bond [HM] made messages for me.  But the numbers weren't there.  I remember a good friend of mine, an old man, now dead, Roger Baldwin, who formed the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union].  And he told me one night--he was visiting out.  They said, if you don't tell these people where your money is coming from, you're gonna lose this election.  He says I've been talking to people up here in the white Berkeley Hills.  And they don't like not knowing where your money is coming from.  So I had all kinds of influences working.

Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers project.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please.
Speaker 2: I am D'Army Bailey.  That's spelled D-apostrophe, capital A-R-M-Y, Bailey, B-A-I-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: And, sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born in Memphis, November 29, 1941.
Speaker 1: And, sir, what's your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am an attorney.
Speaker 1: All right, and you have been a judge and--
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I served as a State, a Circuit Court judge which is a civil trial court here in Memphis for three terms--well, two and a half terms.  I was elected three times for eight-year terms, but I retired September of 2009 in the fourth year of my term, my third term and went into law practice with a firm here, the Wilkes and McCue law firm, which is, has its main office in Florida.  We have eight offices, and it's a plaintiffs' civil litigation firm dealing primarily with medical malpractice, major injuries in accidents and nursing home liability cases.  And so I, after nineteen years decided to step down from the bench and, and pick up a briefcase.  In fact, I've picked up the old briefcase, it's near rotting leather that I had when I was practicing (laughter).
Story_ID: 624517
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I just wanted to establish who you are and we also have to point out, and, you know, please just affirm this, that you were a legitimate student activist back in the '60's [1960s] and activist politician as well, in California at a certain point.
Speaker 2: Indeed, what I--and when I grew up in Memphis in the late '50's [1950s], we were beginning the battles for blacks to get into public office, to fight against racial segregation.  And I was then a teenager in high school, but I got to know some of the local leaders who were involved in those campaigns, including leaders of the local NAACP.  And so when I left Memphis at the age of 17 to start college at Southern University in Baton Rouge, it was the same year that the student protest movement broke out in February, 1960, at North Carolina [Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina].  And so my first year of college [Southern University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] was the first year of the sit-in movement, and it came to our campus, and I was involved as one of the student demonstrators, not a leader at that time, of the protest, but active in it.  I was the president of the Freshman class at Southern.  Southern was the largest, all-black university in the country.  And things quieted down.  The leaders were expelled from the school, at the urging of state officials.  And two years later, things broke out again at Southern.  In my junior year, students again went to protest against segregation.  I again got involved, this time more deeply involved as one of the leaders of the protest.  Some of my fellow students were arrested for protesting and the university was going to expel, and we started a boycott of classes at the university, and I was given an ultimatum to cease and desist or I was going to be expelled.  And I was expelled from Southern in my junior year, along with some of the other student leaders.  And some students in Massachusetts at Clark University in Worchester [Massachusetts] raised a scholarship fund and gave me a grant to continue my education there as there were a lot of black college student leaders at schools across the South who were being expelled for political activism.
Speaker 1: And the expulsions had to do with the State control of those black schools.
Speaker 2: Correct.  So the university, being a state school and right there in the state capital of Baton Rouge, so the president of Southern, Felton Clark, capitulated to the pressure from the state, and probably also was concerned that his own rule and authority over the university was being undermined by the continuing turmoil in the campus.  And so he acted quell the student unrest.  And, and that was the case at several of these state schools in the South.  They were, even though run by black administrations, the black administrators were appointed by the state boards and by the governors, and so they had to dance to the tune of the legislature and the governor and the State Board of Education.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, we don't have to recapitulate everything that we covered the last time, but I just wanted to establish that you, you know, in addition to being a lawyer and a judge, had a significance historically as a student leader and activist, politician in Berkeley [California].  Now, we kind of left the story off there, but before we do that, just can you tell me what is today's date?
Speaker 2: This is July 29, 2010.  Today is Thursday.
Speaker 1: And we're completing an interview--hopefully, we'll complete it today, an interview that we started back in August of 2003.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It doesn't seem that long ago.
Speaker 1: It doesn't, it doesn't.
Story_ID: 624518
Speaker 1: When we ended last time, we had just finished with the council wars at Berkeley [California], and the recall election where they actually had a recall election that pulled you back from your council seat.  And so take us to that place and tell us what you decided to do after that recall election?
Speaker 2: Well, because my two and a half years on the Berkeley Council had involved interaction, not just with the white left, but also with some of the Black Panthers, Huey Newton and other political forces around the Bay Area, I was in a rather difficult position.  I had to decide whether, having been in that high-visibility role as a, as a voice of change in the Bay area, to stay there and practice law, which I had the opportunity to do.  Don McCollum, who was a black lawyer in Oakland and also at that time, the Berkeley City Attorney, had offered a position to join his office, or to go elsewhere.  And I had only really planned to stay in California a couple of years when I moved there in '68' [1968] and got involved in politics and things just escalated in my involvement.  But I was concerned that if I remained in Northern California, Huey Newton was then very, still active in the Oakland community.
Speaker 1: Now, what year is this now?
Speaker 2: This was 1973.
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-three [1973], okay.
Speaker 2: And, and Huey was a bully, and we had--I had worked with the [Black] Panthers, and I had interacted with both the rank and file Panthers, with whom I'd gotten along very well, Bobby Seale, with whom I got along well.  But Huey was a different personality.  He was explosive.  And in a couple of our meetings, he had made some threats to me because I had, at least my reading of it was that I did not dance to Huey's tune.  Huey wanted everybody to kind of be under his control.
Speaker 1: Now, Huey Newton had just been released from--
Speaker 2: Yes, he was out of--
Speaker 1: --incarceration, right?
Speaker 2: --jail.  He had been incarcerated for, at least, probably, nearly a couple of years after, growing out of a shooting in which an Oakland police officer was killed.  And, and I would, I was supportive as a council member of some of the [Black] Panther programs.  And so I would meet periodically with Huey, but he wanted me to hook up formally with the Panthers, put my office in their office, which I declined to do.  And then he asked me for some money, which I declined to give him.  I had a benefactor when I was in politics in Oakland, I mean in Berkeley that made available to me some funds that helped me to do the political work that I did.  And Huey had asked me for money, and I told him no.  And at one point, he said I intimidated him and threatened me.  And during my last year or two years in Berkeley, I had gotten a gun permit from the chief of police.  And he had given me lessons on shooting, and not just because of differences with Huey, but other political elements out there which were pretty explosive.  And so Huey would be out in the streets at night sometimes at clubs as would I periodically, and I knew that I was subject to run into him.  And I didn't want to into--and if you went--and I did run into Huey a couple of times, once in, once in a nightclub and once at a wedding.  And both times, he got rather agitated and it was about to lead to a confrontation.  So quite frankly, I had a concern in my analysis of whether I was gonna remain in the Bay area, that because of the chemistry between Huey and me that that was problematic because if I were to stay in the Bay area, I'd have to move into Oakland, somewhat politically in order to organize because Berkeley was too small in number in terms of the African American population.
Story_ID: 624519
Speaker 1: Also, I had just lost the recall election, and so I knew that the conservative white majority in Berkeley [California] would not be a base for me to have long-term effectiveness politically.  I had done what I could do in making significant change as a council member.  Also, I looked at the geography.  I was not excited to remain so distant from the rest of the country by being out in Northern California.  The African American population was significantly smaller than what I was used to in the South and in the, and even on the East coast in the time that I spent in New York City.  So, I had the chance to come back to Memphis, and I'd always really wanted to get back into a battlefield where blacks were significantly larger in number.  And I was given an offer--I had other offers to go to other places, but I decided to come here and start practicing law with my brother, Walter [Lee Bailey, Jr., HM].  He was then in office with a law firm of about eight lawyers, about half black and half white, the first integrated law firm here in Memphis.  And they had offered me a position with that firm, and so I came, I decided, made the decision to come back to Memphis.  I thought that at that point in my life, that it was time to leave California. And I thought that Memphis would be a good place to come back to and carry on, both my legal practice--I came back and took the bar exam and got my license here.  But instead of going with the firm, my brother opted to leave the firm, and the two of us opened a law office together.  And so from 1974 when I came back to Memphis, I practiced law from '74' [1974] until 1990 when I was elected Circuit Judge.  At the same time, shortly after I got back to Memphis in '74' [1974], an opportunity came to write an Op-Ed column, a weekly column in the morning newspaper, "The Commercial Appeal".  And so for seven years, I wrote a column in the morning paper every Monday.  And it was very well read by, across racial lines.  Often people would say that that was the first thing that they would turn to on Monday mornings.  And that gave me the opportunity to talk about social and political issues and racial issues.  And it also gave me the opportunity to sort of counteract probably the image that people would have of me coming from the volatile battles of California, as a radical, that I could, by writing this column, present a broader view of my thought processes.  And it gave me that opportunity.  So I practiced law, I wrote this column, and for a brief period, I did a weekly, a monthly TV show.  And so, and I got married.  I met a wonderful woman, Adrienne Leslie, who was then living in Nashville and two years after I returned to Memphis, we married and started raising a family.  And I've been here ever since.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 624520
Speaker 1: Now, what station was your TV show on?
Speaker 2: WPTY, Channel 24.  And it was a weekly, I'm sorry, a monthly show called "Memphis Forum" where I would invite different guests, and we would talk about political and/or social issues and sometimes cultural issues.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you plunged yourself right into the political life of the city almost right away, with a column and a TV show.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was important--well, of course, people knew me because, I mean a lot of the people did because even as I was living on the West Coast and going to school elsewhere, I would come back and visit.  And so I kept associations that I had.  And then when I was in the [Civil Rights] Movement in Louisiana, there were periodic news stories, and because I was local, people would read about that.  And, of course, when I was in California, there were stories that would be carried periodically by the Memphis press.  And so--
Speaker 1: Did you have a sense of what people thought about you, you know?  I know you say one of the reasons for writing the column was to really, you know, I guess get your ideas out, and what they really were about.  But what was the popular culture image of who you were here, and--
Speaker 2: Well, I saw a lawyer friend just a couple of days ago, Bruce Claimor (ph.) who is the top civil liberties lawyer here in Memphis.  And he was having lunch, and he said, you know, I remember when you came back here.  And everybody was thinking, we got this wild-eyed radical coming back from California.  So that was one image that, that I was outspoken and fiery, and which was true.  But that wasn't the entire D'Army Bailey.  Others who knew me from years back knew me as pretty level-headed, I think, and, and well poised and respectful person who was a hard worker and studious.  I mean I wasn't any egghead, but, but so there was of sort, I think a balance view of me, depending upon whether people knew me well from high school and the years where I kept in contact with people or whether they knew me more from the media image.  But I think that overall, in fact, I know overall, the impression that people had of me was very positive.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 624521
Speaker 1: So, now, I have a note here that you handled a lot of first-degree murder cases when you got back.
Speaker 2: Yes, when I came back and started practicing in '74' [1974], I took a job part time as an assistant public defender.  And my first assignment in that job was working at juvenile court here in Memphis, representing juveniles who were charged with serious crimes.  And I did that for a couple of years.  And it was, for me, a very important opportunity to get to know these troubled youth, to try to help them, to try to understand something about their lives and what brought them into the problems that they had.  Well, I was also writing this column, and the juvenile court judge at the time, he had a lot of respect for me.  He said, he would say well, he ever needed a lawyer, he'd want me to represent him.  But he also had a attitude of handling his court where he didn't feel that juveniles were entitled to all of the legal protections that I felt the Constitution afforded them.  So we would often clash in the courtroom, but respectfully.  Well, Judge Turner, Kenneth Turner, who was the judge, decided to run for city mayor.  And he was running against a black candidate, Otis Higgs, an attorney, who's now a judge in Memphis.  And a couple of the juvenile court employees, African American, came to me and said, look, we've got these letters from Judge Turner saying that we're to work in his campaign and to pick out what days and polls we wanna work.  And so I wrote about it in my column.  I didn't tell who these employees were, and have never revealed that, but I wrote about how the judge had assigned these employees to work.  And the morning that that column appeared, I was in his courtroom in my routine duty.  And I could tell he was so furious that he just got up and stormed off the bench.  And he demanded of the public defender's office, which had assigned me to juvenile court, that I be moved promptly.  And so the public defender's office transferred me from juvenile court to adult criminal matters.
Story_ID: 624522
Speaker 1: And I did that.  Well, a year or so after doing that, the county executive appointed me to be the Chief Public Defender for Shelby County.  And, but it was subject to approval--
Speaker 2: What year was that?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Oh, I think that must have been around 1970--right, around 1980, probably.
Speaker 2: 1980? Okay.
Speaker 1: Sometime between '78' [1978] and '80' [1980]. Bill Morris, subject to approval of the County Commission.  Well, when it got to the County Commission for approval, they voted it down.  And to show you about the politics of Memphis, and my brother [Walter Lee Bailey, Jr., HM] was then serving on the County Commission, three or four of the black commissioners voted to turn down my appointment.  Now, there was really no reason in terms of anything except that, I think they argued that it was a conflict because my brother was on the commission, but they were really political issues.  But the ones who did it were two of the long-time political leaders, Jesse Turner and Vasco Smith and another woman who was mad at the county executive, not me, and this was her way of, I guess, taking a stab at him.  She was angry with him about another issue and that was Minerva Johnican.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, Jesse Turner has been head of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] at one time, right?
Speaker 1: That's right.  In fact, he was head of it at the time.
Speaker 2: Okay, and Vasco Smith, he's also--
Speaker 1: Had been active.
Speaker 2: --active in the NAACP.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and, in fact, he was one of the leaders that I had worked with as a kid when I was helping these civil rights efforts.  But the politics of Memphis is that if you--there's some of these old-line black leaders, if you're not part of their clique, they'll cut you, cut you up if they can.  You have to go to them and sort of plead your servitude.  In fact, my brother had come to me and said, before the vote, that there may be some problems, that Johnican was mad at the county mayor, and that I needed to contact her and try to smooth things over and get her support.  Well, I didn't do that because I felt that, that I had sufficient merit for the position without having to politic for approval of the County Commission.  And, of course, they voted it down.  Well, as a result of that the County Executive then appointed me as a part of this capital defense team which was to represent defendants who were charged with first-degree murder, who were facing the chair [electric chair].
Story_ID: 624523
Speaker 1: And so I, and two other lawyers, became members of the capital defense team with the sole responsibility of representing those people here in Shelby County who were facing the [electric] chair.  And so I did that from the time of the public defender appointment matter up until the time that I resigned or retired from that position and stopped my private practice, and that was when I was elected judge in 1990.  So in my position as a member of the capital defense team, and I had a private law practice at the same time.  This was a part-time position all the time.  I had to represent defendants, mostly black, mostly male, who had killed someone.  Usually, it had been a murder in the perpetration of a robbery.  Somebody had gone into a store and, and with a pistol and the store owner tried to grab his pistol and got shot and killed or someone had jumped into the car of a victim and pulled the pistol on them, and the victim tried to resist.  Typically, these homicides occurred during robberies where the victim had made some attempt to resist.
Speaker 2: Were these typically in the black community?
Speaker 1: About half and half.  The store robbery case was an Asian grocer.  I handled one case where it was a white business owner.  The case of black man who was in his car, and the robbers got into the back of his car at a supermarket.  The only case where my client received the death penalty was a black victim--actually, I'm sorry, it was a white victim.  It was a so-called murder-for-hire where they said that my client had been hired by this man's wife to kill the husband.  And both the wife and my client were given the death penalty and put on death row.  Actually, the district attorney had offered both of them the option to plead guilty and take a life sentence.  The woman wanted to do it.  The man did not.  As his counsel, I didn't have control over that decision.  Each person has the right to make their own decision, and my thought on it was not necessarily the same as his, but, but that was his choice, and the jury convicted both of them.  In fact, the governor just recently commuted the woman's death sentence to life, but Sidney Porterfield, who's the black male that I represented is still on death row.  But it was, I enjoyed the practice, the capital defense practice.  Obviously, it's the most critical type of law you can practice where your client's life is on the line.  And it's tough because not only do you have to fight with the jury as to whether your client is guilty of first-degree murder, but if the jury comes back and says that your client is guilty of first-degree murder, then you go into what is known as the second phase, the penalty phase.  It's a bifurcated or split up trial, and in that second phase, the prosecutor's put on proof as to whether the defendant ought to get the death penalty, and you have to fight at that second phase with any proof you have to offer as to why the person should not.  So it's a very wrenching, tough job, but at the same time, it's a rewarding job.
Story_ID: 624524
Speaker 1: What percentage, I guess, in a city like Memphis, in those days, the black and white population was about 50-50, would you say?
Speaker 2: When I first came back in '74' [1974], I think that the black population of Memphis was probably near, somewhere between 46 and 50 percent.  It was just under a majority.  I think around 48 percent.
Speaker 1: Today it's about 60 [percent], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, today it's grown to where it's somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 percent African American, at least, I would say, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But the majority of the murder cases, you were saying were like black males killing someone?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I did represent two or three white defendants who were facing the chair [electric chair], in first-degree murder cases.  But nine out of 10 were blacks.  And, of course, that's probably still true today.  I mean we're, we're just--too many of our people don't have, I mean the ones who commit these crimes don't have a great deal of respect for themselves, that they're willing to take the risk of destroying their own lives in the criminal justice system, and don't have a high regard for the life of others, that they would jeopardize someone's life by pulling a pistol and putting their finger on the pistol.  They may not have intended to shoot the person, but as I said earlier, often the victim will make a false move, and these, these people who are committing these crimes, they'll pull that trigger, I mean instinctively.
Speaker 1: Well, were they, could they be typified as mostly first-time offenders, people that--
Speaker 2: No, no.  Ordinarily, they, they've had some involvement with the criminal justice system.
Speaker 1: I mean in terms of killing someone or shooting someone.
Speaker 2: Most of the defendants that I represented in these cases were first-time defendants in homicides.  But they would have been working up to that in robberies, burglaries.  Generally, some of them started as kids, burglarizing cars or a home.  And they'd be in the juvenile justice system.  And then they would graduate to aggravated robbery with guns and, of course, once you start robbery with guns, then you're on the cusp of murder in the perpetration of a robbery, depending upon what happens at that particular time.
Story_ID: 624525
Speaker 1: Okay, in your position, and I know you've got to be professional about all this, but do you--I'm sure you've defended people that you obviously, that actually did the--you knew they did the crime, right?
Speaker 2: Well, when I would go to interview a defendant in a homicide case, the first thing I'd tell the person when I'd sit down in the jail and talk to him is, look, before we get to talking, I want you to know you can't tell me anything here and now that you would expect later on to get into a courtroom and testify differently because as a lawyer, you cannot let a defendant confess to you about a crime and then put that defendant on the stand to say that I didn't do it.  Now, you can have the defendant not testify, but your hands are tied in terms of the defendant if he tells you that he's guilty and then he gets on the stand and says that he's not.  So that's the first I would tell my clients, is to alert them that, don't give me one thing here and then expect that you're gonna get on the witness stand and say another.  And so the cases that would go to trial, the first-degree murder cases, were typically cases where the defendant was denying it.  And so they would not admit it to me.  Now, the--that doesn't mean that I didn't feel conclusively in my own mind that they were, that the evidence was good and that they were guilty, but my job was not to evaluate whether they were guilty or not.  Now, it was to evaluate the evidence and tell them, look, this proof is pretty strong, and you put this before a jury, you're gonna get convicted.  But, but it was their choice whether they would wanna go to trial.  Now, there were some cases where they didn't have a choice.  If the district attorney said, well, no, we're gonna go for the death penalty, and we're not gonna make you an offer, then all we could do was go to trial.  And I would typically fight against the prosecution's case.  I didn't usually have evidence to present of my own on behalf of my client, just to poke holes in the prosecution's case.  And I was always successful, with that one exception at least in keeping my client out of the [electric] chair or having the jury come back with something less than first-degree murder, perhaps murder second degree, which didn't involve the death penalty or negligent or reckless homicide or voluntary manslaughter.  But I rarely had a case where I felt that the, that they were improperly prosecuting an innocent person.  If, if I had some convincing reason to think that my client was actually innocent, normally, I could sit down with the district attorney and present that evidence and get the district attorney to back off.  I mean, but by the time I got into the case, the police would already have investigated it.  They would probably already have talked to the defendant, taken statements, statements of witnesses.  And they've turned all of that over to the district attorney.  So I'd come into the case basically when the police have it wrapped up.  And then I've got to come in there and try to unwrap it.
Story_ID: 624526
Speaker 1: So a confession, say the police has-- take me down in the basement and I sign a confession, and then I plead not guilty.  That's possible, right, I can plead not guilty to the crime even though I've signed a confession, and it goes to court and then--
Speaker 2: Yes, in fact, a case that I had, Mr. [Sidney] Porterfield, who's now on death row, the police, they say that they took a statement from him.  They had a written statement that they typed and say that he signed in which he admits in the statement that he killed the victim.  Now, he gives an explanation in the statement which was problematic in terms of a defense.  But in his, in his case, he took and positioned it well, no, I didn't say that.  The police made that up or they made me sign it.  That's not a statement.  So you'll get a situation where the person may have given a statement or at least the police say that they gave a statement.  And, and the defendant tells you, well, I didn't say that.  They made it up or they forced me to make it.  And, of course, I, as that person's lawyer, I have to take the position that this is their position and this is true.  That's why I say that they can't say, well, I really did say it, but I'm not gonna admit that on the stand.  The only option you've got is don't put him on the stand, and then you can argue to the jury all you want that they made this up, even if the person told you that they didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me, as someone who was around this for a number of years, do you believe that the death penalty is a deterrent to crime?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think the death penalty deters crime.  And I'm not generally a supporter of the death penalty because I think that it lowers us in our values to take lives when we're trying to penalize for not taking lives.
Story_ID: 624527
Speaker 1: Is there a specific case that really stands out that you can talk about, I guess, from that period of time, something that--
Speaker 2: Well, the, of course, the one that I remember most is the one where my client is on death row now, and that's Sidney Porterfield.  And that case was bothersome for me as an attorney.  I guess the tough, tough part of that was that when the man who was killed was dying in his home, his two children came into the house, kids and discovered the body.  And one of the kids testified against the mother and my client.  And that was just really a tough thing to deal with, is a kid testifying against his mother about his father's homicide.  But--
Speaker 1: Now, that's the one where the mother paid--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for the assassination of her husband?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Allegedly.
Speaker 2: But the, all of these cases where you're dealing with the death penalty are tough, and they're especially tough for me as the defense lawyer because in Memphis, for example, where you have a significant number of blacks, and therefore, in your jury pool you get a number of blacks that get called in for the selection process.  But once they get into the jury box, and you get to questioning them, well, you know that the prosecutor typically in a death penalty case wants as few blacks as they can get because they know that blacks, more often than not, are not that supportive of the death penalty and are not typically as harsh in their judgments in these cases.  And so the prosecution uses any device often that they can use to get blacks off from serving.  And black people during the selection process, they'll often question them about, well, how do you feel about the death penalty.  And blacks will say well, I'm against it.  Well, the law is that you can still serve on a death penalty case even if you're against the death penalty, but you have to be willing to set aside your personal opinion and say that you're willing to consider it.  So here I am, I'm the defense counsel.  I'm sitting there, and I'm trying to get as many blacks as I can to stay on the jury.  The prosecution is trying to get 'em off, and he's hanging out to them this bait about well, you know you'd have to be willing to impose the death penalty if the case justifies it.  I'm trying to keep 'em on by saying, well, set aside your belief.  Can you consider it?  And that's a really tough job because you end up with losing a lot of blacks who ought to serve on these juries, and sometimes, they say, well, I don't wanna be bothered with that.  I don't wanna spend two weeks in a lock-up case where I can't go home.  And it's not my problem.  But it's a serious issue when you're handling these cases, trying to make sure that you can keep people whose experience and understanding is important to your defense work in the case.  And so that's a handicap in many of these capital cases, is that people are not willing to consider setting aside their beliefs.  It doesn't matter that you are against the death penalty.  If the court, if the prosecution proves the issues that they have to prove in order for the death penalty to be imposed, it doesn't mean you have to say I'll do it.  You have to say that I'll "consider" doing it.  And so that's a tough part in those, the toughest part is picking that jury.  But all of those cases are memorable.  I remember the case of a white business owner, where my client pulled a shotgun on him when he was closing his store, and put the shotgun on him.  And he made a grab at the gun or, and got blown away.  And the jury came back with either, I think it was voluntary manslaughter.  Well, that was a matter that I remember because I could empathize with the family and with the victim in terms of what the jury did.  But it was my job to defend that man, and, and we were successful in doing it.  So sometimes you do remember cases where, what the jury did is perhaps not in your heart what you think is the right thing, but that's the way the system of justice works.  And it depends on whether the prosecution does their job effectively.
Story_ID: 624528
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was asking how long you served as a public defender in these kinds of cases?
Speaker 2: I did the capital defense work for a bit over a decade to about ten or eleven years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in that process I probably tried a dozen first-degree murder cases, probably handled over a hundred because most of them were cases where you go into them and the prosecution is seeking the death penalty, but you end up working with the prosecution and working with your client and reaching a compromise settlement on it.  And it's just as tough working with your client in many of those cases as it is the prosecutor in getting--because they come into these cases, many of them, hyped up and hostile with an attitude.  And you have to sort of try to work with them--I don't say all of them.  But, but probably half of your clients in those kind of cases, when you first them.  They're not hostile to you.  They're just hostile and defensive, and, of course, you can imagine.  I mean if you had been involved as a claim in killing somebody that you're dealing with someone who's a pretty rough character. And I had to deal with some of those.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your service as a defender lasts until, through about 1983 or--
Speaker 2: Through 1990 when I was-
Speaker 1: Through 1990, oh, okay. I guess.
Story_ID: 624529
Speaker 1: Okay, up until the time that you actually became a judge?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, also during this time, following my work building the Civil Rights Museum, I was appointed by the city mayor to serve on the Board of Commissioners of our local utility company, Memphis Light, Gas and Water.  And so I did that at the same time for about two and a half years, as one of five commissioners on the utility company.
Speaker 1: Beginning about what time did you serve on the Board of Memphis Light?
Speaker 2: Let's see, I, again, I had to resign in '90' [1990].  So I started on the Board of Light, Gas and Water in 1987, about.
Story_ID: 624530
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I wanna go back to '83' [1983] and ask you about the beginnings of your involvement with the [National] Civil Rights Museum, and the old, the former Lorraine Motel.
Speaker 2: Well, when I was a kid growing up in Memphis, people often thought that my family owned the Lorraine Motel because the owner of the Lorraine Motel was a man by the name of Walter L. Bailey who was, which was also my father's name, Walter L. Bailey [Sr.].  And they were both black men here in the City of Memphis.  And so people frequently thought my family was the owner.  I would get, we'd get calls at the house sometimes for people looking for Mr. Bailey. Sometimes they were bill collectors; sometimes just others calling.  And so I had this awareness of Mr. Bailey coming from being a kid.  Well, when I came back to Memphis from California in '74' [1974], the Lorraine Motel where [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was killed was just a run-down motel.  It had three large buildings on the site, two-story buildings, motel, hotel buildings, two of which were inoperable as hotels and one of which was continuing to operate, which was the more modern of the three buildings, which was where Dr. King was standing where he was shot.  And by my return in '74' [1974], the Lorraine was--downtown had deteriorated further since the assassination.  The businesses around that area, small businesses, had closed and left.  And the Lorraine Motel itself was declining.  And the building was getting worse, in physical shape.
Story_ID: 624531
Speaker 1: Well, what was that area like before, when you were growing up?  I mean was that like the heart of the black community?  In those days or would you--what would you consider that to be like?
Speaker 2: No, where the Lorraine [Motel] was, was in sort of a small, commercial, industrial area.  There was sort of a large warehouse, foundry-type building that was adjacent to it.  In fact, a couple of them on either side of it, one behind it and one next to it.  In the front of it were the rears of small commercial buildings that were white, small businesses, a restaurant or so, a warehouse-type place or a supply place.  That area of downtown was not a busily populated area in terms of traffic, even as I was growing up.  The main--because it was sort of on the edge of the main downtown section of Memphis, and it was between the main downtown area and the black community, which was bordered by a public housing project primarily.  And--
Speaker 1: Was it even the main black-owned motel or hotel in Memphis, when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, not when, not necessarily when I was growing up.  There was the Lincoln Hotel, which was probably the most well known at the time and may have been just a little bit older.  I, I certainly remember the Lincoln more prominently as a kid.  That's where we would go after prom, for our parties and things, as high schoolers.  And so that was, as I recall, "the" black hotel.  The Lorraine was certainly there and a large business, but it was not--it was just a tad bit behind the Lincoln Hotel in prominence.  But by the time of the assassination of King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], I'm not sure that the Lincoln was even continuing to function.  I know that by the time I started on the museum project, the Lincoln was closed.  Mr. [Walter] Bailey who owned the Lorraine, as I understand the history, had been a friend with Kemmons Wilson who started Holiday Inn and had gotten the plan for the motel building from Kemmons Wilson so that the building reflects the design, the more modern building, of a Holiday Inn facility.  But in any event, after Dr. King's murder, those white supply businesses and smaller commercial enterprises that were in the vicinity of the motel continued to depart and leave empty spaces.  So, and yet the Lorraine, so the Lorraine was pretty much the only continuing business.  Now, when I was in high school here, there was another smaller hotel that was down the street from the Lorraine.  And it was also a black-operated business.  And it was kind of a two-story mansion hotel.  But those were the only two black businesses functioning in that area.  So they kind were iso--islands of enterprise for African Americans, strangely enough, surrounded by white enterprises.  Eureka Hotel was this two-story building.
Story_ID: 624532
Speaker 1: And so I met Mr. [Walter] Bailey, rather by accident.  I was coming out of a convenience store in the black neighborhood, not far from the Lorraine.  It was--
Speaker 2: This is about '83' [1983] we're talking about?
Speaker 1: Well, no, this was actually late '70's [1970s], probably around '79' [1979].  And there was a little convenience store, and next to that was a laundromat.  And Mr. Bailey was coming out of the Laundromat with his laundry.  His wife was, had died.  She died shortly after the King assassination within days.  She had a stroke the night of the assassination and died a few days after.  So I remember stopping on the sidewalk and talking with Mr. Bailey.  And he encouraged me to come down to the motel and visit.  And so some time after that encounter, I went down to the Lorraine.  Well, there was a little office space that was attached to an old hotel structure that was no longer functional, although there was a small restaurant that was still functional in it, but that was it.  Outside of that was the office for the Lorraine.  And then there was a second building that was behind it that was largely closed.  There may have been a tenant or so, a weekly tenant in that, and then there was the modern or more modern building where, the "L" shaped building where Dr. King was killed that was still functioning as a motel.  There were only Mr. Bailey and a couple of staff people helping him run the motel.  And along, and along the streets in front of the motel, prostitutes would populate the area and use the Lorraine as places for their business.  And so what business was continuing to come to the Lorraine was some travelers and working people who needed a place to stay and some prostitutes.  And Mr. Bailey was a kindly looking black man, short, slightly stocky, dark skinned, friendly, with a smile.  And so when I went in and talked with him, and he began to let me know about his financial crunch that he was in trying to keep the doors open there because by this time, the white hotels were able to take black customers and travelers, and so the business was not there for the motel.  And so he hired me for a couple hundred dollars to set up a non-profit group for him, that he was going to try to raise money to build the Lorraine into a shrine.  And so I incorporated a project called the "Lorraine-King Shrine Foundation" for Mr. Bailey.  And he and a man who was working with him at the site, Calvin Brown, were going to try to use that to raise money.  But they never could get anywhere with it.  And so I remember going with Mr. Bailey one day out to the house of his mortgage holder, a man by the name of Harry Sauer, S-A-U-E-R.  And Mr. Bailey went out to Mr. Sauer's home and we sat there in the living room, and Mr. Sauer was a man with a goatee, at that time, probably in his seventies, businessman.  And Mr. Bailey handed him his mortgage payment in a brown paper sack.  And Mr. Sauer counted it, and may have given him a handwritten receipt.  But that was the manner of Mr. Bailey's business transactions, paying off his mortgage.  Well, when, when the effort to, by him and Calvin Brown, to find some financial support failed, the idea occurred to me that perhaps I should try to get some investors that would buy the Lorraine and renovate it.  And so I went to a white development group, Caroma Construction, C-A-R-O-M-A, run by a business man, Murray Reiter, R-E-I-T-E-R.  And I said to him, look, let's put together the money and buy this property and develop it into a national shrine, into an important site, and we could use it as the focal point for a broader development in the entire area around it.  Now, I went to Reiter because I knew that he was a successful developer and had the financial resources and the manpower and the talent to do this.  And so he and I and a team of his people met down there and looked at the site and we met a couple of times after.  And he reported to me finally that he was not interested which, of course, to me was a devastating loss because I saw and knew what we were dealing with.  But I didn't have the money.  That's--
Story_ID: 624533
Speaker 1: He had converted it, Mr. [Walter] Bailey had, to a little shrine where he had a book, a wall of books that his wife [Loree Bailey], had, her library, and he had a display case with her shoes in it, and a couple of her personal items.  And in the other side of the case, he had a blanket and the dishes, a blanket that was thrown over Dr. King when he was lying there bleeding, and the dishes that he last ate from.
Speaker 2: We were talking about--we're rolling again.  So just, my question was like what was being done to honor, I guess, Dr. King's memory, you know, in Lorraine [Motel], at the juncture that you stepped to talk about, what Mr. Bailey was doing.  And you were saying that he did have a little display in the room.
Speaker 1: Yes, Mr. Bailey had preserved the room.  SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] had commissioned a marble plaque that was engraved with some tribute to Dr. King that was placed on the wall outside the room.  And Mr. Bailey had it open to visitors who could come inside and he had on the wall books from his wife's library, who as I said, was deceased by then.  And they had some photographs on another wall of the night of Dr. King's killing and some of the people who were on the scene there.  And then he had in the center of the room a display case, half of which displayed his wife's shoes and some other personal items as a tribute to her and then next to that, in the other half of the display case, he had the rather pinkish blanket that had been thrown over Dr. King from--bedspread actually, from the night of the shooting which still showed the stains of Dr. King's blood and the dishes in that case that had been collected the night of the assassination from the downstairs restaurant where Dr. King had had his last meal in the restaurant.  And these dishes were on display in the case, along with the bedspread.  And so that was Dr.--that was the memorial that Mr. Bailey had set out there for Dr. King.  Outside on the balcony, he had a glass enclosure.  And on the concrete of that balcony, you could look down into the concrete, and this was by this time, when I first started looking at the scene, '77' [1977], '78' [1978], fourteen years, well, six years after the--ten years after the assassination, you could still see the blood stains in the concrete from Dr. King's--
Speaker 2: So he had a walkway like blocked off with like plexi-glass or something or some sort of--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And the display you were describing, was that in the--
Speaker 1: In the room.
Speaker 2: That was actually in the room.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he had taken the bed out and had put instead this display case.
Story_ID: 624534
Speaker 1: And so when I had gone with him [Walter Bailey] to Mr. Sauer's house where he had taken his mortgage payment and was trying to figure out how could I find the resources to make a private purchase.  I wanted to buy the Lorraine [Motel] privately, but time was short, and I, of course, was just not too long having gotten myself situated in Memphis.  And so my effort failed in finding a private investment group, and in the meantime, Mr. Sauer, he initiated foreclosure proceedings on Mr. Bailey.  And so at that point in time, when the foreclosure was initiated which was in the spring of 1982, Mr. Bailey had his lawyer to file for bankruptcy.  And so the lawyer filed a bankruptcy petition, and the bankruptcy court ordered a halt to the foreclosure.  Well, in the meantime, and the black radio station here had had a successful campaign to raise money for a failing black-run town, Mound Bayou, Mississippi.  They had raised some $200,000 to provide relief to Mound Bayou.  And the station manager there--
Speaker 2: That's WDIA?
Speaker 1: WDIA.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the station manager at WDIA had contacted Mr. Bailey and said, look, let the station help to raise money to save the Lorraine.  And Mr.--and that was [Charles] Chuck Scruggs who was the station manager at WDIA Radio.  So he, at the same time, entered into a contract with Mr. Bailey and borrowed $10,000 as earnest money on a contract to purchase the Lorraine for 200 and something thousand dollars, I believe it was.  And when he did that, his idea was that now WDIA, we've shown that we can raise money.  We're gonna raise this money and buy the Lorraine.  Well, Mr. Bailey then said, well, contact Attorney [D'Army] Bailey, he's been interested in this, and he can help you.  And so Chuck Scruggs called me to come out to the radio station to meet with him and A.C. Williams, one of the other radio station on-air personalities, and a third person, I believe, at the station, and told me about the plan to save the Lorraine.  Well, my first thought was, well, how are you gonna do it.  And he said, well, we're gonna have a radio-thon.  We're gonna put on a big concert down in Mound Bayou, Mississippi.  We're gonna bring in Stevie Wonder, and we're gonna raise 200--we're gonna raise over $200,000, and we're gonna buy the Lorraine and use the rest of the money to give to Mound Bayou.  So I thought that that made sense, and I felt that the radio station had the power and the influence to be able to do that.  So I said, all right.  So then I donated my service to incorporate a group, a non-profit group that would oversee this project, and we called it the "Lorraine Civil Rights Museum Foundation".  And we made Scruggs and A. C. Williams who was an official there at the radio station and the station and another station official, three of them, Carl Connor, I think was his name, were three of the people that we used to incorporate, along with myself and with Jesse Turner who was the head of the black bank who had made the $10,000 loan of earnest money.
Story_ID: 624535
Speaker 1: And so we incorporated the [Lorraine] Civil Rights Museum Foundation.  Well, now how do you raise this $200,000?  You've got the bankruptcy impending.  The judge has given a stay for Mr. [Walter] Bailey to sell it privately, Judge Lefler (ph.), federal bankruptcy judge how was very helpful in that process.  And so [Charles] Scruggs and I went to New Orleans to meet with Stevie Wonder's manager at a black music convention.  And in sitting and talking with the manager, he said, well, look, we can't get Stevie Wonder in there for this.  He says, you, it's gonna take you tens of thousands of dollars even if Stevie was to donate his services, just to do the staging and the setup and get his band and everything in there.  I think the manager was Alan Addis.  He was a brown-skinned man with a goatee, silver graying hair.  But he was a long-time manager with Stevie Wonder.  So poof went the notion of this big concert because the man had just told me and Scruggs that no Stevie Wonder.  So then Chuck says, well, all right, we'll go ahead with the concert, and we'll have the Bar-Kay's instead as the lead act.  And so the station started pushing it, and we were gonna push to have the Bar-Kay's as the lead act, and we were gonna go on with the concert.  Well, when it came time for the concert, we had it in this big field down in Mound Bayou, Mississippi.  It wasn't well planned in terms of security so the fencing around this big field was inadequate, and people just could walk on, onto the grounds, what people did show up.  But the main thing was turnout.  We didn't get very many people.
Speaker 2: Now, Mound Bayou is quite a ways from Memphis, isn't it?
Speaker 1: That's right.  It is.  It's probably--well, I don't remember, but--
Speaker 2: Half way down Mississippi, at least, towards down, you know--
Speaker 1: It was a nice little drive, but, of course, the thought of Stevie Wonder was one thing, but without that kind of drawing power--of course, I was at this point now into the middle of this deal.  I had already signed on, on the thought that station was gonna produce Stevie Wonder.
Speaker 2: Now, can you tell me this.  I'm just curious.  Now we know a lot of people in Chicago are from Mound Bayou and the historical significance of Mound Bayou, Detroit too.  But what was the, WDIA's interest in Mound Bayou?  I know it was failing at one time they say (unclear).
Speaker 1: Well, the initial interest was simply, WDIA's listenership was broad enough that it had a significant listenership in Mississippi as well.  And so it was just, I guess, to show its influence and power as a community entity to raise the money.  And it had a history, going back even to when I was in high school, of having civic campaigns to raise money, good-will funds to provide funds for crippled children programs and the like.  So this was a venture to, as a part of the station's outreach to the community, was to now embrace this campaign to save Mound Bayou, which was on the verge of bankruptcy and they raised $200,000 which was a shot in the arm at a critical time.  But--
Speaker 2: But why were the two things mixed?
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know.  I mean that was the plan that was given to me by the radio station, that we're gonna do it in Mound Bayou and split the money. Now, I guess it was still the euphoria over the success of Mound Bayou to connect the two and say, well, we're now gonna bring people down who felt to save Mound Bayou, and we're gonna save the Lorraine [Motel].  But the concert was a fiasco.  It just fell apart, and we didn't raise, as far as I know, any money, although the radio station dipped into its charity fund and made a donation of $7,000 so that we would not look like we came up with a complete failure.  But here I am now, I'm out in the public, leading this campaign, and I'm not one volunteers for many public campaigns, and particularly as a leader.  And I wouldn't have done it then except for the fact that I had this prestigious radio station that was gonna do it.  Well, when that campaign floundered, time was running on Mr. Bailey to consummate the sale to WDIA and to Scruggs.  So we went on the air with radio funds for people to bring us money and donations.  And, but I, at this time, realized that the station had made its best shot, and if we were gonna succeed now, it had to come from my leadership.
Story_ID: 624536
Speaker 1: And so I contacted Bob Law who does a syndicated radio show, "Night Talk", and I would do--
Speaker 2: He's from New York, right?
Speaker 1: Yes, and I would interviews with him into the early morning hours to raise funds for the Lorraine, "Save the Lorraine", and he even had a benefit in New York where I went to speak.  And we got some contributions from a local, the largest one, $10,000 from a local pharmaceutical, while it wasn't--a cosmetics company, Lucky Heart Cosmetic.  The owner had come to me with a proposal for us to sell hand lotion.  And I said, we're not gonna do that.  He said, well, I'll give you $10,000.  And so we added that.  And all in all, we raised in that process about $65,000.  In the meantime, the bankruptcy judge gave us a stay. Gave Mr. [Walter] Bailey a stay, a second stay, more time to raise the money.  Well, by this time, with $65,000, and the mortgage that Mr. Sauer held was $153,000, I believe.  And so I knew that if we didn't have enough to at least buy the mortgage that Sauer could pull the rug out from under us.  So $65,000 and the foreclosure went forward.  The bankruptcy judge said, well, I can't hold it off any longer.  So it went to foreclosure auction on the 13th of December, 1982.  And I had gotten a promise from Reverend Jim Smith who was--by this time, we were adding people to our board, and we had added Jim Smith from ASCME Union, 1733, the local union, sanitation, that Dr. King had been here to help.  I put on Paul Shapiro, the owner of the cosmetics company who had given us the $10,000 and some others that I'd added.  So Smith had said, well, the union will give $25,000 towards the purchase.  And so, but I never got the check.  And I was wondering about that, but the auction came around for noon on the 13th of December, and I walked over from my law office which was just away to the courthouse steps.  And all I had was $65,000.  And as the crowd began to assemble on the steps there, and Mr. Sauer was there, and his son is a lawyer, Raymond Sauer, who was gonna do the bidding for his father.  And about 11:30, Jim Smith showed up with one of his officials, Taylor Rogers, from the union and brought up to the steps a check for $25,000 which was a wonderful relief because at that point we had $90,000, still short however, of what we needed.  Well, one of the other people that I had added to the board was a black lawyer, A.W. Wilson, who is also a businessman.  And he came to me on the steps, just before the auction began and said that he had a suggestion that we would borrow $50,000 from the black bank, which was run by Jesse Turner, the head of Tri-State Bank, a black-owned bank.  And so he had gotten Turner to agree that they would loan us $50,000, provided we had it guaranteed.  And so at that point, I went to Jim Smith of the ASCME Union and told him about the deal and asked him they would guarantee 25 [$25,000], and he said they would.  And then I went to Paul Shapiro and asked if he would guarantee the 25 [$25,000] which Shapiro said he would.  So suddenly, we had another $50,000 to add which gave us $140,000.  And so the bidding began.  There were initially during the auction a half dozen people bidding until we got up to the serious bids of 25-30, $40,000.  So I was doing the bidding for my group.  Raymond Sauer was for his father, and by this point in time, the bidding was down to the two of us.  And I bid, I was bidding in increments, by the point we got to 130,[000] of a thousand dollars here and a thousand there.  And he would always increase it.  I knew I had 140,000 and that was it.  And so finally when I got to--well, actually, I went over 140,[000] because I was trying to see how, what I could do, although I knew I had the 140,[000].  So I bid 141,[000] and the 140--and Sauer went to 142,[000], and I said, well, 143,[000] and not a penny more.  And he, it was clear to him I think that I wasn't, didn't have anything more to bid.  And they didn't really want the Lorraine.  They just wanted to get all of the money they could out of the bidding.  And so the hammer went down for $144,000.  I said 143,[000].  And so I had to be at the auction dealer's the next morning with a cashier's check for $144,000.  And so I got on the phone that night, and I called Jack Belz who was the owner of the owner of the Peabody Hotel.  And I knew that he was supportive of what we were trying to do.  And I said, Jack, I need $4,000.  Can you raise it for me?  And he said, let me see what I can do.  Well, he called me back, and he said now, let me make sure about one thing.  This money isn't going to Jesse Jackson [HM], is it?  Well, it was that Jesse had come out with that statement about Hymietown and so he was not well thought of by Mr. Belz.  And so I said, no, Jesse doesn't have anything to do with this.  So he called me later that evening and said he had the $4,000.
Speaker 2: This is during the Jesse Jackson presidential campaign, right, when this Hymietown remark?
Speaker 1: I think it--yes, that's right.
Speaker 2: He was running in '84' [1984], the "Run, Jesse, Run" campaign?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so, although this was '82' [1982].  So it had to have been earlier, but I don't know what the exact time of Jesse's remark was, but I do remember very distinctly that Belz called and wanted to make sure that Jesse wasn't in on this, which he wasn't.
Speaker 2: So this is 1982 we're talking about.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right, okay.
Story_ID: 624537
Speaker 1: And so, with the $4,000 that [Jack] Belz got for me and the rest of it from the bank, we went to the auction house the next day and bought the Lorraine [Motel] for $144,000.  Now, here I am, I'm a lawyer.  I don't know what to do with this run-down place.  All that I know was that we needed it.  It was an important historic structure, and I knew that it was important to history.  And so I and [Charles] Chuck Scruggs and some of the others who were working with me on the board, we talked to Mr. [Walter] Bailey, and we said, look, you can continue to run this place.  And you can keep the money that you get here.  He had a little collection box in the room there, exhibit room.  You don't have to pay us anything.  Don't pay any rent, but you do pay the utilities and try to not have the prostitutes just openly soliciting around the place.  I knew that we couldn't stop it, and in truth, but for the prostitutes, the Lorraine probably would have gone under even before.  So one has to be grateful for the bridge that they helped create that helped to keep that place afloat until we were able to get something done.  And so Mr. Bailey, from the time we bought it in '82' [1982] continued to operate it and keep the money for the next five years until we were able to come up with the funds and plans on what to do with the site.  And from '82' [1982] I had gone to architect friend, Herb O'Mell, and told him what we were trying to do here.  We owned the Lorraine.  How can we make it meaningful?  And because of my Civil Rights background, I wanted to do that in a way that would tell the story of the Civil Rights Movement.  I knew I had a site that people were coming to from all over the world that would always be important.  And so to me, [cough], excuse me the best thing to do was to use it to create an exhibition about the [Civil Rights] Movement.  I wasn't interested so much in creating an exhibit on [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King.  I didn't feel that the Movement was King.  I felt that the Movement was the Movement, and we needed to tell the story of the thousands of people that had made this thing change in this country, that had taken on segregation and fought it in the fields.  And I wanted an exhibit that could tell that because from my own experiences, I knew how moving that experience was and that if we could capture that, then the generation that would come into that site where King died would learn about this struggle, be inspired about this struggle, be angered by the injustice that had been experienced and would leave there with some sense of personal connection and determination on their own part, that it was to incite and to create a momentum for continuing our Movement.  That was my view of what we could do with the Lorraine Motel.
Story_ID: 624538
Speaker 1: And so when I talked to the architect, we didn't have any money.  And so he said, well, [excuse me], he said, I'm working with a group called the Memphis Design Center which is some architectural students from UT and some architects.  And so Scruggs and Willis and I started going over there and meeting with them.  And I laid out to them, and I say "I" because at this point in time, Scruggs was an important presence for the radio station's support that they had lent and for his initiative in launching the "Save the Lorraine" effort.  Willis was important.  He had been the first black in the legislature.  He had been involved in civil rights.  And so they gave me a good balance as we continued to work with the planning team in developing this.  But as far as the concept and the idea of what we were to do, it was mine.  I wanted to create a story of the [Civil Rights] Movement that I had been involved in.  And so they came up with a design plan, and with that plan that we'd gotten essentially for free, Mr. [Jack] Belz let me have a, he donated a luncheon for me to call together city leaders and present these plans to them.  And from that, the city leaders committed $50,000 which we used to hire a design team.  We put out a competition, and we picked a team, Benjamin Lawless, who was out of Fort Washington, Maryland because when the three of us on the selection team, A. W. Willis, John Elkington (ph.), a local developer, and I reviewed the submissions, it was clear to Willis and me that this was the most important presentation that Lawless had presented, which is now what the museum is actually.  The original concepts that he came back to captured what I thought was important, the dynamism of the Movement and the interactive dynamism.  And so, but it had a price tag of $8.8 million.  And so then we had to figure out how do we get $8.8 million.  And I went to the city mayor and to the county mayor, county executive, and they both said, no.  They were white leaders of the city at the time.  And I say that because the politics has changed now.  And Willis, having had some legislative experience, had gotten one of the black legislators to--Roscoe Dixon, to introduce a bill in the legislature to fund the project.  We didn't know to what level.  But nothing had been done on it.  Well, after I had gotten the rejections from the two local leaders, I contacted a Republican leader--Lamar Alexander was then governor, and this person I had known was a close associate of Alexander's.  And I said, Bob Schroder, I said, can you find out where the bill stands?  He did some inquiring and called me back and said that nobody has heard of it.  So I then called Senator Dixon, he was in the House of Representatives then.  And I said, look, nobody's heard of our bill.  Let's get moving.  And so I'd talked to Willis and a local development company, civic development that was funded by local government, Center City Commission, and said, we need to go up to Nashville and get this thing moving.  And so we went to Nashville, and this would have been 1986, went to the legislature.  And we started working the halls of the legislature.  We went to the Speaker of the House, Ned McWhorter (ph.) and to the Speaker of the Senate, John Wilder, got the Shelby County legislators together from Memphis, and particularly, the blacks.  And we walked the halls of the legislature.  Well, Willis, by this time, was beginning to become ill.  He had had cancer.  And so he was unable to sort of keep making the trips and follow through by that point.  And so at that point in time, it was just me making the journeys and pushing through to get this legislation passed.
Story_ID: 624539
Speaker 1: Now, he passed away not too long after that, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so, and so I kept pushing and working with the blacks in the legislature.  And they, in turn, I remember being in the legislature, walking from one legislator's office to the other.  And I went to one white legislator's office soliciting support, and he said, well, Mr. Bailey, he said, I was at lunch--at dinner last night with some fellow legislators, and if you don't mind, I'll tell you what they said.  I said, no, sir.  He said, well, he said, now, you got these black legislators that wanna, going around here wanting this money for this Martin Luther King project, and they want money for this, and they want money for that.  And you can't have everything.  Now, if they tell us that this is the number one priority that they want, you can get your money.  So I stood out in front of the Speaker's office on the plaza, Legislative Plaza the next day, and I said, "Fellas, let me tell you what the white man told me."  He said, now yall want money for Tennessee State and money for this and money for that, and he said that you can't get all this.  Now if you tell them that this is the one bill you want passed, you'll get it.  So to the credit of these blacks in the legislature, they all said, well, we're with you.  And so when they let it be known, because Lamar Alexander was not supportive, his administration.  They had already put their budget together when we came.  And I had met with the commissioner of finance who had said, well, Mr. Bailey, we've already got our budget.  And I said to him, well, sir, do you mind if we go down and lobby the legislature, which we did.  And so with the help of those blacks, if they had not unified, and that's a testament to what black people can do.  In fact, when we went to the Speaker of the House, Ned McWhorter's office, with--and I had Lawless, the designer to come in from Maryland to meet us in Nashville, to help us lobby, and we've sat in the Speaker's office and laid out our plans for what we were gonna do to build this museum.  And he looked up at us, and he said, you know, he said, if more people came up here with their plan together like you fellas got, you could get more things done.  And he got behind it.  And when it came up in the House for a vote, we were asking $4.5 million, McWhorter went to the podium, called our bill up first and it passed 83 to 17 in the House.  He then turned the gavel over and walked out.  It then came up in the Senate, and I was sitting up in the gallery, and I asked one of the Senate aides to let me look at her agenda to find out where my bill was on the agenda.  And I looked at her agenda, and it was a handwritten note next to the item on our funding, it said, "This bill is gonna pass anyway, so vote your conscience".  And so when it voted in the Senate, it voted 33 to nothing.  I had people who didn't even know what the plan was that were voting for the bill.  Now, I had a couple of white legislators out of Memphis who did question me in the hallway.  They thought that the plan was provocative, and as one of them expressed, Joyce Hassell, she said, we're scared that this might create antagonism between blacks and whites, stir up hostility.  And I said, no, it won't.  Well, truth of the matter is that I was not wanting to stir up antagonism, but I knew or hoped that it would stir some anger and make people uncomfortable.  But I tried to soft sell it when they asked me those questions.  And it passed in the, in the Senate.  Well, then when we came back to Memphis, now I've got half of the money.  Belz then let me have a big room at the Peabody, and I called again these local leaders together.  I brought in McWhorter from the legislature and Wilder, and we made our presentation.  And I sat in the back of room arguing with the County Executive who didn't wanna put up the $2.2 million.  Finally, he did.  And the city mayor put up $2.2 million, and that's how we got the other four and a half million dollars [$4.5 million].
Story_ID: 624540
Speaker 1: Okay, so we were just talking about the successful bid to acquire the Lorraine Motel, and now, you acquired adjacent properties too, right, thought, the building that James Earl Ray allegedly shot Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] from?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was purchased some years later, actually, after the museum had opened.  One side light actually to the process was that after we bought it at the foreclosure auction, I got a letter from the lawyer for Mrs. [Coretta Scott] King in which he demanded that we drop the name Dr. King from the name of our foundation because initially, when we incorporated our foundation, we had called it the "Martin Luther King Memphis Memorial Foundation".  And so when I got the letter and presented to our board members, we agreed that we could change the name to the "Lorraine Civil Rights Museum Foundation", which is what it is now.  And there was a good thing about that which was that since they had kind of thrown down the gauntlet about our project, I then didn't have to spend time trying to work with the King, Mrs. King, in terms of development of the project.  I just kind of ignored the Atlanta people, although periodically, she'd take a pot shot at us in the media, at one point telling a newsmagazine that our effort was a morbid project and that she would rather focus on the life as opposed to the death.  But later when we had the project built, we did get Mrs. King to agree to come to Memphis for the dedication.  Actually, I went down to Atlanta, along with one of the board members to seek her involvement.  And we paid her a fee of $15,000 to come for the opening of the museum.
Story_ID: 624541
Speaker 1: But that was some years after.  But initially after we had purchased the property in the foreclosure auction and then were able to get the legislature and the city and county governments to put up the $8.8 million, and we then had the design done by Ben Lawless, and again, I thought it was a dynamic design.  This was just amazing how he captured the essence of the struggle because I had made it clear that I wanted the visitor to feel they were actually in these protests.  That's why we've got the lunch counter and the sound and the--I even talked to them about even the smell teargas.  Well, we couldn't do that, but we burned the bus that's in there, and, and we actually--the state did, purchased what was a Trailways Bus and repainted it to be a Greyhound 'cause that was what was burned in Anniston, Alabama with the Freedom Riders, and then took it to a, the state fair grounds in Nashville, and it was burned by the fire department until it resembled the bus in Anniston.  But once we had all of this government money, then we were, had to meet with them and so I'm a little bit--Willis was still able to travel because I remember that he was back with me in Nashville when I met with state officials and officials from the city and county.  And by this time, we had the $8.8 million, but he had not been able to make all of the trips in between in this process.  But when we were finalizing our deal, I do remember he was there because the question that was on the table was, well, who are we gonna give this $9 million to?  We can't just give it to this non-profit group.  And so I got to thinking, and I said, well--and the City of Memphis didn't want it, and the [Shelby] County didn't want it.  And so the state official at the table, David Manning, who was the Commissioner of Finance said, well, the state will take ownership and develop the property.  And so I remember going out into the hall with A.W. [Willis] and talking about this.  And we both were just thrilled at the prospect because I didn't want it to come to the city and county government because I did not want them to interfere with the development of this project because they were not that sympathetic.  And, well, the city was, ironically, who was a more conservative leader than the county's leader, but I'd gotten Mayor Hackett's support by then.  And, but Morris was problematic, but I was happier to see the state because I figured that having it owned by the state, we would not be subject to such local interference and control.  So the result of that meeting was that we agreed, my non-profit group, the foundation, that we would sign our title--we were the owners of the property, over to the State of Tennessee, and the city and county would then give their money, $4.5 million together, to the state, and, but the caveat was that the state would have to build the museum the way we had it designed.  So that's the beauty of that museum, is that it was not designed by government.  It was designed by us and then we got the funding and then turned it over to government to build.  And so with that understanding, we made a contract, and by now, I'm president of the board, so I signed it over to the state, the property with the agreement about the terms of the development.
Story_ID: 624542
Speaker 1: So then we put together a development team.  Willis is no longer able to participate.  So it's now me, the only person from Memphis board participating from that point to the day that the museum opened.  Now, once we had gotten this deal with the state, and they now owned it, they said, well, we gotta close the property now.  And we couldn't any longer let Mr. [Walter] Bailey continue to operate it.  Well, the state had to give relocation money to Mr. Bailey, and he had about four or five weekly tenants, including Calvin Brown.  And the state offered relocation money to them too.  Everybody took it except Jacqueline Smith who had been helping Mr. Bailey operate the motel.  And she was one of the tenants.  And so she refused to move.  Well, the state was gonna have to close the property and fence it off so they could then get ready for development.  And so everybody was out.  They put up a fence, but they, but Jacqueline Smith refused to move.  So then they're keeping the lights on, and I say to the state, I call up Commissioner Manning and then I call up an aid to the governor, I say, why are y'all keeping the lights on?  They said, well, she's still there.  I said, well, what you--you may as well send her some food then.  They said, well, we're not gonna put her out without getting a letter from you asking us to put her out.  And so I wrote a letter to the Commissioner of Finance and asked them to remove Jacqueline from the property.  And so they then assembled a team of sheriff's deputies and police officers and went out there in a highly-publicized event and cameras and everything and lifted her out of the room and sat her on the sidewalk, which made us, of course, it wasn't the best public relations vision for us, but it was a necessary move if we were gonna move forward and develop the property.  Well, Jacqueline's objection was that, that we were going to gentrify and, and exploit the memory of [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King with a commercial project, that we were going to turn it into, in essence, a commercial circus.  Well, that wasn't what we were going to do, but that was her objection.  And she felt that the money should be used to build housing for the homeless or a food kitchen or something.  My feeling was that she and anybody else had had plenty of time to do that if that's what they wanted to do.  But that wasn't what I was putting my energy on, and we were gonna move forward.  So she camped out on the sidewalk, and she continues now to protest, being camped on the sidewalk outside of the motel.  I might just fast forward to say that--
Speaker 2: Now, that's out, they've got, yeah, she's got a little umbrella or something.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so she's been protesting, and she may actually have the longest running protest anywhere in the world, in history.  Someone said that to me, and they said that the reason it hadn't appeared in Guinness is because she's still living.  Now, I don't know.  I mean that's just some information that's been passed on to me.  But she started that protest when the state had to close the property, and that would have been 1988.  So--
Speaker 2: Did she have a history of any kind of Civil Rights activity or anything or interests prior to this?
Speaker 1: Not that I'm aware of, no.  But--
Speaker 2: Because the way you articulate it, her concern is based on some kind of principles of hers and I just wondered what she, if she had ever displayed any before, in terms of--
Speaker 1: I had not heard or seen those objections nor those concerns expressed by her.  The contact that I had had with her up to the time we closed it had been she was running the motel with Mr. Bailey as the, and she was, when he wasn't there, managing the property.  So, and she put a big bed sheet, hanging--when she was evicted, hanging down the wall outside of the, in front of the motel, that said, "D'Army is a sellout", and she took a big brush and put that in red paint.  And that hung out there by her protest site for a year until we finally were ready to open the museum.  I guess the weather eventually beat it up.  But now we've, and if you fast forward to current history, and I know we'll talk about some times in between, but some of the issues that she objected to in terms of gentrification in time have some basis to them.  And she and I, she's taken a different view of me, and I her.  Her views have reached a point of being rather supportive of me now.
Story_ID: 624543
Speaker 1: But that has to do more with what happened after we, as we went about developing the museum because once we had it in the hands of the state, and I had my professional team assembled--and when I say "I", I mean we had the state architect.  We had the developer that we hired, the company to build it.  We had Ben Lawless coming in.  We had the two historians, two African Americans, Spencer Crew and [James] Jim Horton.  And we would meet in Nashville regularly and lay out plans and move forward then from 1988 for the next two years to build the museum.  But in the meantime, now, whereas previously, I'd been having board meetings and usually the board members wouldn't come.  We would never have a quorum.  We'd always just go ahead with business, and we met in my law office.  The only office we had operationally was my law office.  The only secretary was my secretary.  And so with the members not coming to the meetings was just fine with me because we were really in the development and implementation stage, and I really didn't need to be going to board meetings, having policy meetings and discussions and votes about what we were doing when we were trying to build a museum.  And so it gave me a free hand going back and forth to Nashville and working with the team.  Well, as we got closer and the bulldozers got to working and the construction crews got on site, and the things actually began to look to be a rally, board members started coming to the meeting and saying well, when did we vote on this and how did you decide this.  And, and so at this point, they wanted to have bylaw changes and in essence, rein in my authority and power,  The only authority and power we had--we didn't have any money was the authority and power to work with the government team to build the right kind of facility.  And then their deal was that they would contract back with our foundation to operate it, but we'd have to make it self sufficient.  But I had to then sort of keep them at bay rather than let them involved in the decision making of we, who were building this building.  But then I became the lightening rod for their anger, some of them, and so our board meetings, then they'd start coming, wanting--and I'd have to filibuster the meetings.  And the meetings would sometimes be very heated, and they'd get mad at me, and I'd stonewall 'em because I didn't want 'em voting about the things.  I wanted to build the proper museum.  And so by the time the museum opened--now, I had, I brought not only some black leaders, but some whites, and I had to put on the board a white millionaire, Republican, because I needed another half million dollar almost to put in a work of art in the lobby.  And I brought him on board to contribute that money in addition to the state money.  And he was very savvy to see the dissension of the board, some of the blacks who were against me and some who were for me.  And he had some whites that were on the board who sort of laid in the cut so to speak and could see the dissension.  And at some point, things were polarized on the board, and I tried to put together enough votes to get rid of some of the problem people, but he put his people together with some of the problem people so that when the museum finally opened in 1991, shortly after that, they were prepared to vote me out as the president.  But I had kept them at bay for about two years with filibusters and disarray in the meetings while we moved forward to build it and get it ready to open.  But by the time it opened in 1991, they were so mad at me, and it I guess sort of culminated and one of the board members, Rev. Kenneth Whalum who's now dead, getting mad about the fact that we were gonna open on July 4th of 1991.  And that was a date celebrating the country, and we didn't need to pick that date.  Well, I didn't pick the date.  The state had, and that was the earliest date that we could move and open it, and I wanted it opened as soon as possible.  But he got hot in a meeting, and the somebody else got mad at me because I didn't go along with a vote about whether we would delay it from July 4th because that wasn't a good symbolic date to open it.  And I just ramrodded the thing on through.  I didn't have a bunch of them sitting on the stage when we opened it.  I brought in some, Jesse Jackson [HM] and Morgan Freeman and [President] Bill Clinton was there and Cybill Sheppard, and the mayors, the two mayors and the governor.  And--
Speaker 2: Why Cybill Sheppard?
Speaker 1: Well, the same reason I brought in Blair Underwood, just to add a little bit of--and Morgan Freeman.  She was the local--
Speaker 2: Is she from here?
Speaker 1: Yeah, she's from Memphis.
Speaker 2: See, I didn't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in fact, her mother lives just a couple of blocks from here.  And I knew her, and so I knew that we could get her as a, to add some star power to the opening event.  And, but I didn't have a stage crowded with--I wasn't playing to the ego issue and the politics of trying to keep the board happy, although I know, I knew they were furious at me, some of them.  I had strong supporters too.  So, but so I knew that after I'd opened it, that I was gonna face a crisis with the board, but I had been willing to run that gauntlet in order to make sure that I kept a firm hand on this thing until it opened and opened right.  It got built right, with quality work, quality production, quality design, and I was in on every decision that was made in that process, being made, not by the board, but in Nashville and built in Memphis.
Story_ID: 624544
Speaker 1: And so we opened it, and then they finally--
Speaker 2: This is 19--
Speaker 1: Ninety one [1991].
Speaker 2: Ninety One [1991], okay.
Speaker 1: We opened and, but we had the program July 4th, '91' [1991] Rosa Parks was here, Daisy Bates came in, but we actually didn't complete it until October of '91' [1991] when it actually opened for regular business.  Well, by the beginning of '92' [1992], the board was ready now to flex its muscle and put D'Army Bailey in his place.  And they had made contact with Ben Hooks [HM] who had been on the board, had never been to a meeting, been on the board ten years.  But I had put him, as some of the other civil rights people, Maxine Smith [HM] and others who, simply because I needed to have names of people that would give legitimacy to what I was trying to do, not that they were offering any help.  And so, the--Maxine Smith and some of the others on the board who were hostile got Ben Hooks to agree that he would step in as the president of the board if they voted me out.  Well, I didn't know that they'd gotten that agreement with Hooks [Benjamin Hooks], but I knew that they were going to, that they were going for my scalp at the board meeting, in fact, so much so that I had written a letter of resignation from the board prior to going to the meeting.  Well, I talked to Hooks that day.  He was in New York, and I asked for him to give me some support, and he pretended that he didn't know anything about what was happening.  And, and then when I get to the meeting, they produce a letter that Hooks has signed in which he says that if he's voted in as--that if I'm, that if they vote him in, he'll accept.  So they had the deal set.  And so in a vote of nine to six, the conservative white businessman and Paul Gurley, who was one of the, who was one of my, one of the white government officials that I had trouble with, and Tom Jones, another white government official, John Elkington and a couple other whites put their votes together with three or four of the blacks and got nine votes together, versus my six which were primarily the blacks on the board, a majority of them, but not enough to overcome that combination.  And they voted Hooks in as the president of the board, at which point I pulled out my resignation letter.  Now, the plan was that I was to serve on the executive committee they wanted and Hooks would be president of the board.  Now, at the same time, they put the conservative white Republican in as chair of the executive committee who still chairs the Exec committee after all these years.  And Hooks ultimately was just a figurehead.  And the board has been run and controlled by Hyde, who has, in the years sense, gradually replaced all of those people, with the exception of Maxine Smith that does his bidding on the board, and replaced them with blacks who come out of corporations and many of which he served on the board of.  And he effectively controls the board of the museum, and therefore, controls the museum and has since 1991.
Speaker 2: What's his name?
Speaker 1: Pitt Hyde, H-Y-D-E.
Speaker 2: Pitt Hyde, and he is who?  He is the--
Speaker 1: He was the chairman and founder of AutoZone Corporation, but prior to that, his family was big in the grocery distribution business, Malone and Hyde.
Story_ID: 624545
Speaker 1: So he [Pitt Hyde] was born into one of the wealthy Memphis families and--
Speaker 2: And he is now the--what's his title now?
Speaker 1: He is chairman of the Executive Committee of the [National] Civil Rights Museum Board which meets every month, versus the board which meets quarterly.  And they have carefully chosen who to put on the board, so much so that when some community citizens nominated Bill Lucy who's the highest ranking official of the ASCME Union, he was voted down.  I mean they're careful as to who comes on because they don't want people on there who have a strong civil rights background, who would be willing to speak out.  Now, they'll put civil rights figures on the board who'll sit there and be quiet and go along with the program which is to let the corporations, which now effectively control the board, continue to control the operations of the museum.  Now, what's the importance of that?  Well, there're several things that it means.  Most importantly, and this is an area where [Pitt] Hyde and I fundamentally have disagreed, is that I envision the museum as more than just a static museum on the history of the Movement but rather as a facility that would bring in people from the Movement to train a new generation of youth on how to empower themselves to create conflict in communities in order to fight for change.
Speaker 2: That's--they're not doing that.
Speaker 1: No, and he says, well, you need to go start something else if that's what you wanna do.  This is just gonna be a museum.  And that's his attitude, and as a result, that's where the museum stands.  And they let him run it like that.
Speaker 2: Well, when you think about The King Center [The Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change] in Atlanta, a lot of people thought, and I've interviewed people that thought that it should have been the same, training, a place where you get training and instruction on how to format social change and it's not doing that either.
Speaker 1: No, but part of the issue there, part of it, I think, over the years has been the transition of leadership from one director to the other but where the real power has resided in the King family--at least through Mrs. [Coretta Scott] King, up to the time of Mrs. King's death.  And it's hard to open up and bring in a change-oriented approach to an institution which may be at conflict in terms of that kind of style with the approaches Mrs. King took to run it and controlling the King Center.  In this case, you didn't have the dominance of a family, but you had the workings of a very sophisticated Republican businessman.  And I admit that I brought him onboard because I needed the money to put the $400,000 sculpture in the lobby, which actually ended up being a couple of hundred thousand dollars.  And it wasn't really the piece that I wanted, but, again, I either had to use his money or no money and have no sculpture.  And I felt that if I could have kept enough of a base on the board that his influence would have been kept in check.  But, again, it was the, it was the jealousy and the petty challenges from the blacks.  And, of course, that's, that wasn't new to my experiences.  I'd experienced that in California.  I'd experienced some of that in the fight in, certainly when I was in college in Worcester, and even in Baton Rouge.  So this was not a new challenge or a new experience.  So I knew that very often, when you're engaged in these fights and when you're engaged to create change, that your biggest opponent and your most deadly opponent is gonna be somebody black.

Speaker 1: What's the upshot of it now?  When you look at the museum [National Civil Rights Museum] now, do you see it as something better than what was there before or do you just--how do you philosophically look at it after working so hard to, you know, make this a reality?
Speaker 2: Well, it's certainly an important story that's told there about the struggle of our people and the strength of our people.  And that's what I wanted told, and that's there, and that won't change.  But it has lost its edge.  It has lost the message of transition from that struggle.  It's frozen in time.  History under glass.  And certainly, for people who come there not knowing about our struggle of the '60's [1960s], it's a valuable teaching and inspirational tool.  But it cuts them off from that energy and from that sense of purpose and direction of how do I now leave this?  Yes, I look back and I'm inspired, and I'm angered, and I'm hurt by what we've gone through.  But the corporations, you go there now, and the first thing you see in the courtyard is a plaque that says, "This exhibit sponsored by Bank of America".  Well, what is Bank of America doing besides a hundred thousand or a couple hundred thousand dollars here and there, chump change as Malcolm X used to refer to that kind of thing.  Or you go into the lobby and this is sponsored by this bank or this corporation.
Speaker 1: That amount of money is less than a bonus for top banking executives at the end of a year.
Speaker 2: Yes, but these corporations know that it's very cheap, and yet black people are ready to take that money and sell out a dime a dozen, not just in Memphis, but all over the country corporations have moved in.  They've taken over the Civil Rights organizations.  The NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] here in Memphis. [cough]  They have an annual Freedom Fund dinner, but who pays all the money to it primarily?  The corporations.  That money doesn't come from the communities.  And so if you're selling corporations a table for 15, $20,000 at a banquet, is that corporation gonna be held accountable in the 12 months intervening before you go back to them for another $20,000 check?  No.  And the corporations realize that.  And so it's like pay off on top of the table that used to be paid off to the police.  I was watching a movie on television, one of these old movies where the police come in to raid a place--it was a gambling hall.  And when they know the police are coming, they turn it into a pool parlor.  And the police come in, and they look around and pretend they don't see anything and walk out eating caviar and waiting for their next check.  Well, that's the way these civil rights people are and these organizations, and it's not just the museum and the NAACP.  Some of these summits--I was looking at one of these summits on television, and you've got black people standing up at the podium with the gold arches of McDonald's there, framing the background.  Well, I understand that you need to get support from the corporations.  But you need to support, not as these small gifts.  I mean [Pitt] Hyde gives ten times more in any given year to the University of North Carolina and the other institutions that are important to him than the miniscule money that he gives for his domination and control at this museum down here.  And for the longest, at the beginning, it was not even, poorly--not even properly kept clean and maintained.  Now, they have done a much better job of keeping it clean because the directors that are now on that board, they don't go through the museum to see what needs to be kept up.  They don't go through to see what inconvenience that may be experienced by the visitors who come there.  And so there's still much that can be improved.  But there's a disconnect between these corporate people, black and white, that sit on that board to go down there and make policy and personnel decisions, and they can put on their resume and on their corporate profile that they're on the board of and supportive of the [National] Civil Rights Museum, but don't give a hoot about the underlying issues and struggle that that museum is-- grows out of.
Story_ID: 624547
Speaker 1: Okay, now, we're ready to start again.  And we want to cover your judgeship and we want to cover your career, as a--small career as an actor too.  So, let's try to--in 1990, this is a couple of years before the museum [National Civil Rights Museum] opened up--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were elected to the Tennessee--
Speaker 2: Circuit Court.
Speaker 1: --Circuit Court, right.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Tell us how that happened.  Why did you decide to get out of private practice and become a judge?
Speaker 2: Well, I really didn't give it any thought about running for judgeship.  I was rather happy being a lawyer, and it was a reasonably successful profession for me.  There was a vacancy to be filled by a retiring judge on the civil court bench.  And civil court bench is generally viewed as the money court, that is, so it's the one that, that the establishment is more concerned about than the criminal court bench and the judges that sit there.  And so typically, you, that's where the law firms focus their support and are concerned about who sits as judge.  And there was a woman, a white woman, who was getting ready to run for this particular vacancy, who was a sitting city judge, which is a lower court.  And some lawyers were concerned, a handful, that she wasn't gonna make a good judge.  And so they contacted me, and they said, look, if you run for this seat, because she has a lot of name recognition, she comes from a family of liquor distributors and liquor store family, and people would know the name, and she'll have a good--and she's already a judge.  She'd be hard to beat, but you could beat her 'cause you're well known.  Would you run?  And I first thought about it, and I said, no.  There was another black who was in the race.  I thought the vote would be split, and there were a couple of other whites.  Well, then Mayor Hackett, who was the mayor that I'd gotten to know in my fight about the museum, I talked to him the day before the filing deadline.  And he said, well, D'Army, the word is out that if you get into the race, she's gonna get out.  So at that, I said, well, I contacted the leading white lawyer, Richard Glassman, who had asked me to do it.  And he had my signatures already gathered.  And I said, meet me at the election commission, and he showed up fifteen minutes before the deadline.  And at the same time, the judge candidate was there, and she and her husband came up to me.  And they had two petitions, one for the division that I was getting ready to file for and one for another division.  They asked me if I was gonna run.  And I told them yes.  Well, when I went in and filed, they learned that I filed in this Division 8.  Then she filed in the other division was against a sitting black judge and actually, they beat him.  They knocked him off.  But, but at the same time, I ran for the Division 8 seat and won.  So in 1990, I was elected, but as I said, at the recruitment and encouragement of these lawyers.
Story_ID: 624548
Speaker 1: And so I've continued to do that, and it's been a wonderful job.  I was one of nine state trial court judges in the City of Memphis, civil, civil court judges.  And of that nine, I think there were three of us who were African American.  It's now down to two.  About three years ago, the only black on the Tennessee Supreme Court, Justice Birch, A. A. Birch, and that's B-I-R-C-H.  He's one of--it's a five-member court.  Well, Justice Birch had served for about fourteen years, I think.  And he was retiring, and so a friend of his had called me, a lawyer friend, Ricky Wilkins, and said, Justice Birch is getting ready to retire, and I want to give you a heads up.  So I began to think about it, and then I talked with Justice Birch, and he said, well, D'Army, you're one of the two people I think best able to succeed me on the Tennessee Supreme Court.  And I hadn't given any thought to that and really had no burning desire to serve on the Supreme Court because it involves traveling primarily by car across the state because it meets in West Tennessee, in Jackson, about eighty miles from here, and then it goes to Nashville, where it's headed--headquartered and then it meets there.  And then it meets in Knoxville, which is almost 500 miles away.  And it wasn't the kind of traveling I wanted to do, nor did I wanna spend time reading briefs or sitting on a court and having my schedule determined by the will of all five of us rather than now, I control my own schedule as a state trial judge.
Speaker 2: Now, that's an interesting way of looking.  I think that most people would say, oh, that's a big position.  But you were thinking about all the things that--
Speaker 1: Yeah, and in addition--in fact, when I mentioned to one of the justices, Supreme Court Justices who's now the Chief Justice, Janice Holder, in a conference, I said, well, I'm getting ready to put my name in the hat.  She looked at me, quite a look of surprise, and she said, I don't see that fitting you.  You're not a team player.  And I said, and she said, how did you think you'd feel being one of five, as opposed to now you can run your own ship.  Now, she was just being--she's a friend.  She wasn't being hostile.  It was just her initial reaction.
Speaker 2: About what year is that?
Speaker 1: This would have been, that was three years ago so that would have been around 1997.
Speaker 2: Two thousand seven [2007].
Speaker 1: Two thousand seven [2007], I'm sorry.  And so when Birch had urged me to do it, and the salary was not a big difference.  We were making 140,[000] as a trial judge and they make, were making 150,[000].  But I put my hat in the ring.  And you have to go, and there--and you have to go to Nashville, and there's a screening committee of 18 lawyers, mostly lawyers and community people from across the state that look at all the candidates.  You fill out a lengthy application.  The Tennessee Bureau of Investigations investigate you.  The board of, the Bar board investigates you, everything, thorough background.  You go up to Nashville and meet with this committee for an opening hearing.  They question you, and you can have a couple of people come speak on your behalf.  And so the first time I put my name in--because there were actually two of the five seats that came vacant that they had to be filled, Birch's and then another Justice decided to retire.  And so they were going to fill them one at a time.  And so in the first round the screening committee recommended--and the way the process operates is that this screening committee, nominating committee, narrows down all of the candidates to three.  And there were 20-something candidates from across the state.  And so they picked two whites and one black and sent those three names to the governor, Bredesen.  And of those--and that black was Justice, Judge Dinkins, a black judge out of Nashville.  So I didn't make the cut.  And so the judge--the governor then picked a white lawyer out of, a white judge, Judge Gary Wade out of Knoxville and appointed him.  So now, you've got one of the two vacancies filled.  Now, it's time to fill the second vacancy.
Story_ID: 624549
Speaker 1: I go back through the interview process, the screening process.  This time the committee sends the governor three names.  I'm one of the three, me, a black and two whites.  At that point, the governor sues the committee and says that you sent me the names of one or two whites who were already on the other group, and I didn't pick them, and you're supposed to send me new people.  And the case went to the Tennessee Supreme Court, which was [an] especially appointed court by the governor because the court issue was in controversy.  And the Supreme Court agreed with the governor, this special Supreme Court, and said that you got to send new names, rather than two of the same names.  So the two whites--so the committee then goes back, throws open the entire process.  So I have to go back through the screening as do the, everybody.  The committee comes up with three names.  I'm on the list, along with two new white names.  So now, twice, now, my name has gone up, recommended by the nominating committee.  This time, I go up and I meet with the governor because when it gets down to the final three, they go and interview with the governor privately, separately.  So I went up to the State Capital, and went into the governor's office and sat face-to-face with him, chair-to-chair, not around the desk.  And we started talking.  We talked for about forty minutes and a interesting conversation, and the governor looked at me.  And he said, now, tell me this Judge Bailey, he says, you interview well, and you're obviously qualified for the job.  Why do you have so many detractors in Memphis?  And I said, well, Governor, I said, I am a person who all of my career, I've always believed in standing up for what I believe in and speaking my mind.  And when you do that, you do make people, have people who are against you.  But you also--I have a lot of friends.  I have far more friends than I do detractors, I hope.  And, of course, I, in supporting me, I had one former president of the Tennessee Bar Association, three former presidents of the Memphis Bar Association, John Seigenthaler, who'd been editor of the "National Tennessean", [Gilbert] Gil Merritt, who is on the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.  And so I finished my conversation with the governor, and he now has to make a decision.  Well, I'm getting, I'm at a judicial conference now, and Birch comes up to me at the conference.  The governor still hadn't made his announcement.  This is a judges' conference, judges from across the state.  Birch approaches me, he said, D'Army, he says, how are you and Maxine Smith [HM] getting along?  Well, she's the black woman who was on the Civil Rights Museum Board here, was head of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  So I said, well, I says, we get along, I guess, I mean why?  He says, well, I don't know.  He says, let me find out.  So he said, I'll talk to you tomorrow.  So that night he calls an aide to the governor, and then I see Birch the next day, and Birch comes up to me, and he says, man, it's the damnedest thing.  He said, Maxine Smith called the governor's aid and said if he were to appoint you, it would set the black community back fifty years and that she'd rather see a white person appointed to the seat than you.  Now, I don't think that that--she would have carried the weight with the governor, that that would have swayed his decision.  It just gave him cover because there were other people, as John Seigenthaler told me when we were discussing it, he said, somebody's putting poison in the governor's ear about you.  And we need to try to put some positive in there, and I did, had a lot of good people pushing for me.  But I'm just showing you the nature, again, of politics in the black community.  And so that message had been personally carried to the governor's office by Maxine.  But, and the governor ended up picking a white, a Republican, no less, a Democratic governor we have.  And the white judge that he picked, Judge Coke, who now sits on the Supreme Court, resulted in us getting, for the first time in the fourteen years since Birch had been on the court, an all-white court again.  So now, we're back to having an all-white Tennessee Supreme Court.
Speaker 2: Would that be--would you consider that a setback for the black community?
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely, because we do not have a voice that can raise questions and advance these issues that are of concern, not just to the black community, but to the working-class community and to the community of people who are not part of the corporate world and who are sensitive to the issues of, of the struggling man out there in the neighborhood and the grassroots people.  And Birch was like that.  Birch came from these communities and Birch had a sensitivity and concern for these communities, which is why I'm sure he thought that I was one of the ones.  And he pushed hard for me because, especially, since whoever that other person was of the two that he thought should follow him, didn't make the cut.  And I had made the cut in the last two rounds.  Birch was doing everything he could.  But, again, and now, it was actually a God-send for me that I didn't get the appointment because being clustered away in some judicial chamber reading briefs and writing opinions was not what I wanted to do.  But it would have been an opportunity to be in the room, to be at the table and help influence the flow of law in this state.  And that's why I was willing to make sacrifice.  But for quality of life, it wasn't for D'Army Bailey.
Story_ID: 624550
Speaker 1: I really, as I said, hadn't envisioned even being a judge, but I got recruited into it and did it for nineteen years.
Speaker 2: Okay, so how was being a judge, a Circuit Court judge?  We really haven't discussed that.
Speaker 1: Well, the cases that I handled ranged from divorce cases, where I had to decide matters of support and who gets divorced and how to arrange it.  And my approach to that, because divorces involve such emotional issues where people have their views often skewed by their emotions, and you get lawyers, particularly, where the husband and wife have money, you get some lawyers who handle these divorce cases who keep more shit stirred up than the parties themselves because by keeping it going, they can keep charging a lot of money.  I've had divorce cases in my court where the lawyer fees were a hundred, $200,000.  And to me that was just outrageous.  And so, they couldn't come into my court.  Some judges, most of them would let these lawyers come in on these divorce trials, and they'd come in with a dolly, with two or three file boxes where they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars or tens of thousands and in some cases hundreds, filing papers, taking evidence, doing discovery over things that were really not that consequential.  And the clients would end up, because it's in the lawyer's hands, and they're charging 250, $300.00 an hour to do this.  And so when I had these cases, I would have what I would call status conferences.  And I'd make the lawyers come into court with their clients.  And I would have the clients sit in the courtroom behind the attorneys.  I didn't wanna hear from the clients, but I wanted the clients to hear what was going on when I talked to the lawyers.  And then I would ask the lawyers, what's the problem?  What, what the disagreement is?  And once they said what the disagreement was, I would say, you know, I can't decide this without a hearing and taking evidence.  But, now, you know, the law of Tennessee is that you got to basically split things down the middle.  And then if it got into a big argument about the value of property and all of this, I said, well, I'll appoint somebody if need be to evaluate the property.  But the point was, you don't need to have all of this "Who shot John".  I wasn't gonna get into a lot of dispute about who he was, whether he did this or that in the marriage because that really would not have a lot to do with how you divide property, which is essentially equally divided as it developed in the marriage.  And if it came to a matter of alimony, then I was gonna look at, basically, what kind of money she had, what he had, and what she needed and what he needed.  I still wasn't gonna--I would keep them from getting into a fight about what brought them to the divorce table to begin with, the hatred that they may have or the boyfriend or girlfriend and all of that.  I kept that out.
Story_ID: 624551
Speaker 1: Now, the divorce lawyers, I was not a fan of some of them who were making these kind of tens of thousands of dollars.  So the lawyers would have their poll to try to intimidate judges.  They'd have a, what they call an evaluation poll where they would send out a mailing to all the lawyers.  Well, you've got 3,000 lawyers in town and say, of that 3,000, you've got maybe 200 black lawyers.  And in that poll, you may get 300 lawyers, 10 or 15 percent that'll answer the poll, and they would rate me at the bottom of the list, see, because all you had to do is anonymous is, you'd throw, you'd give D'Army Bailey a zero and give the other persons tens and nines or your friends who you could run the courtroom however you wanted as the lawyer.  And so they'd come up with these evaluations where I would be getting low scores.  In fact, most, in fact, all the black judges would.  But I would be getting, often, the lowest because I was sitting in the most important court to them, to wit the money court, and yet, I wasn't letting them run the court.  I had the record of having the lowest number of cases on my docket than any of the other nine divisions of Circuit Court for years, from the--for the last ten years.  And by the time I left, I still had--now, we get equally, roughly an equal number of cases assigned every year.  But I was not letting them drag these cases out, delaying cases.  I had the fastest moving--you could get a case from the time it's filed to the time it ended in my court in a year, whereas we had some of the other courts taking almost two years to do that.  But it was helping the litigants.  But it wasn't giving the lawyers a delay, and the ones that didn't want to be prepared.  Now, that wasn't the majority of lawyers because the majority of lawyers don't come into the courtroom anyway.  But the ones who do come in, and, and if you've got a third of your business, divorce business, and they're the ones who are really mad at you.  And then there may have been a few that I had to put in check, who--and that would just be a few.  But if they get out there and spread the word and get, and if you've got a poll going, and you've got a vote--you send the mailing out to 3,000 lawyers, and you get 450 that respond, it doesn't take many.  So you've already just got 15 percent.  And out of that 450, you may have 30 black lawyers or 50--you won't even have 50.  You may have 30 because the black lawyers generally are not participating.  And so you get skinned by a small minority of white lawyers who are mad at you for other reasons.  But because I was always so well known and respected in the community, that couldn't--I was pretty much--they couldn't really dent my armor with those kind of attacks.  But that was the kind of thing that I had--I wasn't a grinning and skinning, clubhouse judge with these lawyers.  I was a lawyer, a judge that I felt that I had to represent and stand up for the interests of the litigants and the jurors that came into my court.
Story_ID: 624552
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  We were talking about the tobacco case, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yes, I had five, separate lawsuits where individuals had died with cancer, lung cancer.  And these were all people who had smoked for some period of years.  And those cases, in fact, we had several of those cases around in our county [Shelby County].  And I decided I needed to put those cases to trial.  I didn't want them just laying around.  And so I got in the lawyers at Philip Morris, Brown and Williamson and R. J. Reynolds.  So we had lawyers from all over the country representing the tobacco companies.  And I said, look, we're gonna put all five of these cases together and try them in one lawsuit.  And the lawyers for the tobacco said--companies said, nah, that'll be too confusing, and then the jury can't understand it.  And I said, look, I'm sorry.  Smoke is smoke, I'm gonna try all these cases together.  So I consolidated the cases for trial.  The trial lasted four and a half months.  It was one of the longest running trials in Shelby County, highly complicated issues of science.  Basically, the lawsuit alleged that the tobacco industry learned in 1954 that smoking caused lung cancer through some scientific research.  And they basically kept that information secret.  And it was only a few years later that those papers came out, and the litigation on tobacco began.  Two of the five cases, I dismissed because of technical reasons that there was just no timeframe that I could interpret that would allow the cases to be timely under our various statutes.  The other three went to trial.  I must say that that case really reinforced my confidence in jurors because here we had working people who took time from their affairs and came to court every day for that time to listen to what was some highly-complicated evidence and yet, come out with, in the end, with verdicts in all three cases which they came out for the tobacco companies.  Tennessee has what we call comparative fault.  So if the jury says that the person suing is half at fault or more and the person being sued is half at fault, then the person suing loses.  So in one of those three cases, the tobacco industry had argued that the man had been through bankruptcy and had, was a heavy drinker, that he was a risk taker and that because of that, you cannot blame the tobacco industry for its advertising and for its concealment of information, that this man was gonna take risks anyway.  And the jury bought that argument and ruled half for the tobacco industry and half for him, which meant he loses, he lost.  The other two were plaintiffs who did not have that kind of background, but one was a lady.  And the insurance companies argued that [cough] excuse me, that x-rays on her chest showed a lump.  Now, it was never analyzed to be cancerous, but they argued that that was breast cancer and that she more likely had breast cancer that metastasized or spread to the lung, than lung cancer.  And they brought in high-powered scientists and slides and everything to testify on that.  The jury accepted that argument that, that--and ruled for the tobacco industry.  In the third one, the man had kidney cancer, and they again used their scientists to argue that, yes, he had lung cancer, but scientifically, we'll show you that he started with kidney cancer.  Therefore, the cigarette smoking is not what causes death.  So, in all three cases, the industry prevailed.  But it was an important case.  In fact, they--I had to bring, I had to move the courtroom to a larger courtroom and put in extra tables for the dozen or so lawyers that were in the courtroom in addition to analysts from the stock market who were there watching the trial daily and reporting back because they had to, whatever was gonna happen would influence potentially, the stock on the tobacco companies.  And so it was a most significant litigation.
Story_ID: 624553
Speaker 1: And I was glad to see that it came to conclusion.  Now, of course, what the jury decides is a different thing, and that's something that I've always tried to keep my thumb off the scale.  All I try to do is to assure that there's a fair trial, and in all of my years as a judge, I may have been accused of lots of things, but I was never accused of not giving someone a fair trial and, or putting my thumb on the scale.  When I first took my job, the judge who retired said Judge Bailey, I'm only gonna give you one piece of advice.  "Never care who wins a case in your court".  And I tried to adhere to that, irrespective of what the issues were or who the parties were.  In, and the jurors, as I said, I have high respect because they took time off from their affairs.  I had one juror who was a younger, black man, and after about a month, he came to the jury room before we got started and threw his juror badge on the table in the jury room and said, "F" this stuff and stormed out.  And I called his home and didn't get an answer, and I left word.  And he called me back a bit later, and he said, Judge Bailey, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean any disrespect, but I've been having problems at home.  My wife has had some issues here, and I just couldn't take it any longer.  And I understood, and I didn't take any penalties against him.  I excused him, because the man had taken a month and shown up and tried to stick with it.  So, it again shows me that our citizens are owed a deep debt of gratitude for the work that they do because there's no better way to resolve a controversy than to put twelve honest people in a jury box and let them listen to the evidence and come back with a decision.  So that was my tobacco trial.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 624554
Speaker 1: Do you have a judicial philosophy?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think I do.  I mean, it's to level the playing the field, and by leveling the playing field, I mean not let the people who've got the money and can hire the highest-priced lawyers come in and I'm gonna pay more attention to their high-priced lawyers than I'm gonna pay to the logic of the lesser paid or even the lesser experienced lawyers.  It's my job to, not to get involved in the case or to try to favor or help one side or the other, but the judge can do a lot in terms of the ability to listen and not be influenced by who's on one side and who's on the other or by what color they are.  I guess if I had a bias, it is for working people, people who are not at the top of the system, and that has nothing to do with color or ethnic group.  It's just that these people, you have to understand that they have not built up the strength and the evidence and the preparation to come in there and put on the strongest or the best case always.  It doesn't mean that, that they're not right.  And you've got to look past what your expectations would be if you're dealing with two corporate lawyers versus a lawyer that's coming in there with people who don't have that kind of money and that kind of resource, and still try to find out what is the truth?  What's the correct decision here?  So a judge has to be an equitable investigator, an investigator not just for who does the best presentation, but for where is the real justice in this controversy?  Where is the real truth?  Where is the real fairness?  And so that's the philosophy.
Story_ID: 624555
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were, you resigned from the court in 2009?
Speaker 2: Yes, in September of 2009, I submitted my letter of resignation or retirement, actually, to the governor who then--they go back through that, the same kind of selection process.  The nominating commission takes applications and they narrow it down to three and they sent the names of the three candidates to the governor.  In my particular division, they sent three African American names.  So the governor picked an African American woman who succeeded me on the bench.  And now, they come up for election in the first election after my retirement.  So that person's on the ballot, along with anybody else who wants to run, as there are other candidates running.
Story_ID: 624556
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, you have another, kind of a hobby career in some ways, and that's in the film industry.  Can you tell us how you first got started in films?  How did this come about?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I don't know whether it goes back to the days when I was a kid, and I remember that over in our little neighborhood in South Memphis, my brother [Walter Lee Bailey, Jr., HM] and I had a film projector.  And that was at the time when film came on these big reels.  And so it was a two-reel projector, one with the film and another big reel at the bottom that captured the film.  And it probably stood--well, it had to be pretty tall to hold up the two reels, plus the projector.  And, of course, with the projection bulb, and we would actually take these, rent these reels of film, and we would show movies for ourselves and for our friends.  And we'd take it out and show it against the side of our house, which was a white-wood, frame house.  And so at night, we would project these movies out.
Story_ID: 624557
Speaker 1: All right, so we were talking about you and your brother [Walter Lee Bailey, HM] showing films in the neighborhood on a--
Speaker 2: Yes, we'd be projecting--
Speaker 1: --sixteen millimeter projector?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, of course, that was about the extent of any involvement I had with film.  I didn't study it in school or anything. And my next contact with filmmaking came, I was in politics in California.  And I got a call from a friend who had been in school with me.  And he was doing a movie with Stacy Keach, and he wanted me to do a part.  And I, but it was gonna be a conservative black leader in some town.  So I said, no, I'm not gonna do that.  That's not good for my image.  So I turned that down.  So then that was, again, about the only contact I even had, thinking about film work until I was back here in Memphis.  And the first movie that I worked in was "Mystery Train" which was an artsy film by Jim Jarmusch, who was a very noted director, J-A-R-M-U-S-C-H.  And he was here to film that movie.  And it's a classic now, but he was doing some casting.  He had a local woman who was going with his crew around, and they showed up in a nightclub, black club in Memphis to take some Polaroids of some of the customers.  And she introduced me, Novella Arnold, to the people she was with.  And they asked if I wanted to come for an audition.  They took a Polaroid.  I said, yes.  So I went a day or so later to the hotel here where they were doing auditions for this film and--
Speaker 1: Now, this is 1989, am I right?
Speaker 2: "Mystery Train", that sounds about right when we did that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And so, I was in there with Marvell Thomas, who is Rufus Thomas' son and another actor.  And they had promised me that I would have a chance to have a speaking part.  Well, I got to the scene where they were shooting, and they were finishing one scene.  And so I had to wait, and then they had to break down, and we went to another set where they were filming inside this raunchy club which was where my scenes were shot.  And I worked on that two nights.  The first night I was, along with the other two black actors, kind of hanging out in this lounge there.  And I had thrown a towel over my shoulder and had my hat cocked on my head and looking like a tough guy.  But they didn't offer--but when I got there, I didn't have any speaking lines.  And they didn't offer me any.  And so I sat on the stage in this club, and I was talking to Jarmusch and somebody else, I guess.  And I was saying, look, I'm not gonna come back tomorrow.  I didn't get a speaking part.  I didn't realize that they had these things on these ears where everybody could hear what we were saying.  But I was really just pushing the envelope, trying to get them to at least give me a chance to get a speaking part.  So they said, well you come back tomorrow.  We'll see what we can work out.  Well, I showed back up, and still didn't get a speaking part.  But that was all right.  I enjoyed the process, and that was my first film experience.  And I got onscreen credits, and you can see me for a quick, good instance, but prominently in the movie.  And so that was "Mystery Train".
Story_ID: 624558
Speaker 1: And then after that I did audition for a couple of films that were being shot around here, Grisham-type [John Grisham] film.  Sidney Pollack came to do one, and then they had some open calls, and I auditioned--actually, it was for extras, I think, once or twice.  But I knew the, got to know the director of the Memphis Film Commission.  Somehow we met, but really the next part I got came because Michael Hausman who is a film producer, he was here in Memphis to produce a Grisham film.  It was "The Client".  And so when they were here filming that, I met Hausman because they shot parts of that movie in our courthouse, which is this stately, hundred-year old building, columns, marble columns, marble floors, everything.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the one that looks like a Greek temple?
Speaker 1: Yes, um-hum, with statutes in front.  So that's where they were filming.  And they were shooting some right next, in the courtroom right next door to me.  And so I met Hausman during that process, just briefly.  And when they wrapped on that movie, Len Sidler, the film commissioner invited me to have drinks with Hausman.  And we had drinks at a club.  And then he left town.  Well, he came back to Memphis a short while after that to make a second film which was "A Family Thing" with James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall.  And again, they shot at our courthouse.  This time the scenes for the Chicago City Hall in the movie.  And so while they were here making that, I saw Hausman again.  I had met Danny Glover, and had given him a private tour through the [National] Civil Rights Museum.  I think this was actually before we'd opened it.  And so later when Glover had come to town, he was gonna have lunch with Hausman, and he asked me if I wanted to join them.  And I did, and so I went out with Glover to the set of "A Family Thing" and had lunch with Hausman.  And so he said, look, next time I'm in town, I want you to meet my director.  And so they came back.  He came to make yet another movie, "The People vs. Larry Flynt".  And I was at home one afternoon, and Hausman called, and he said what are you doing?  I said, I'm free.  What have you got in mind?  He says, well, you wanna have lunch with me and Milos Forman.  Well, Forman was the director of the Flynt movie.  He had twice won Academy Awards for "One Flew Over the Coo Coo's Nest" and "Amadeus".  And so they came by the house, two van loads of people and pulled into the driveway.  And so I didn't immediately go out to get in the van with them.  I wanted them to come in and at least enter my home and see my environment, to make my own presentation of who I was.  And so they came in for a minute.  Then we went out for the van and went down to the Cozy Corner, a local barbeque place and sat down and had some ribs.  And Milos and I sat at the table together, and we got to talking.  Well, Milos was originally from Czechoslovakia.  And he was talking about how he had been caught up in fascism and, as a kid in Czechoslovakia and Communism later, and the movie, he felt was a statement against Totalitarianism.  And I talked about my Civil Rights background.  And so he said, you should be the judge in my film.  And so I said, well, sure.  And so he thus offered me a part in "The People vs. Larry Flynt".
Story_ID: 624559
Speaker 1: He [Milos Forman] said, I don't want you to act.  I want you to be yourself.  And so--
Speaker 2: So you were a judge by this time on the bench?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, so.
Speaker 1: And so when they came to film that, they gave me star treatment.  They had a stand-in for me.  When we weren't shooting, they had a small trailer compartment for me.  They gave me the entire script to study, and I shot with them for three days, two days and then later for a third day.  And, and they had invited me to the set to see a previous shoot before I started shooting, and I discussed with Milos the set up on one of the courtroom scenes.  And so we shot, and I got to work with Woody Harrelson, who is a wonderful actor and [Edward] Ed Norton.  This was his, one of his first major roles.  And when we were shooting, Milos [Forman] came up to me at the bench, and he leaned over before we started shooting, and he says, now, Judge, this is--he speaks with this heavy foreign accent, he said, this is your courtroom, and I want you to treat it just like you would your own courtroom.  And so there were, there was a scene in there where Woody comes into the courtroom, and he's got a military helmet on his head.  Well, I'm supposed to start the scene off, just saying, well, Mr. Flynt, are you ready to pay your fine or something.  But instead, he's got this helmet.  Well, I know I'm not gonna open court with somebody sitting there with a helmet on their head, so I said, "Sir, you'll have to take that hat off.  We don't allow hats in the courtroom."  And he looks up at me rather strangely and surprisingly, and he starts to pulling at the strap.  And he can't get it off.  And so then he has to sort of have this sheepish look, and he said props, to call from someone from props to come help him get the helmet off.  So then we have to stop the shoot.  And then they fix it where he can then snap it off when I tell him to take the helmet off.  And so he then does that when we start back, and he says--I says, "There's no war going on in here.  You don't need a helmet on."  And he says, well, you never can be too sure, Mr.--sir.  And I said, well, we've got U.S. Marshals here to protect you.  None of that was in the script.  But, again, I--Milos was the kind of director where he was inviting me to handle it like I would my own courtroom.  And so the next day when we're shooting, it was the third day, we had rehearsed.  Typically, we didn't do any rehearsals before we shot.  We just went in and he'd start shooting.  Well, Day 2, when we finished that, they said, well, let's rehearse for the next day.  So we started the scene, and that day's scene, I'm holding him in contempt of court, and I'm ordering him to jail.  Well, since he's being ordered out of the courtroom because he's acted up in the courtroom, he starts screaming at me and cursing at me.  And that's the end of the scene.  Well, I knew--and something bothered me about that.  I said to myself, well, now, I wouldn't just let the guy just go screaming at me out of my courtroom.  I'd have something to say.  So when we started shooting and we get to the scene where I've ordered him taken out of the courtroom, and he starts screaming at me with all kind of curse words, I, I say, "Yes, sir, yes, sir, you can say all those foul-mouthed words behind four padded walls.  Now, get him out on out of here."  Well, that wasn't in the script (laughter).  But I knew that I'd have to have the last word.  So that was fun working on that film, "The People vs. Larry Flynt".
Story_ID: 624560
Speaker 1: And then the next movie I got a part in was "How Stella Got Her Groove Back".  And in that case, I--Kevin Sullivan, a very talented black director, had been in Memphis.  He was working with Steven Spielberg.  They were gonna do a story on the black radio station here, WDIA, and so the film director, Len Sidler, had called me one day and said, D'Army, I'm supposed to have dinner with Kevin Sullivan.  But I can't make it.  Can you sit in for me?  So I met him for dinner.  And we had a nice conversation and talk about this radio station, and I--that was the end of it as far as I knew.  And then my agent in L.A. got a call, Robby Cast, who had agreed me on the recommendation of some of the Flynt film people.  And so he said that they had called him from the "Stella" movie and wanted me to come out to L.A. and shoot a scene.  And, but they were just gonna pay my day rate, and I'd have to take money from that and pay my expenses.  I said, well, you see what you can do about them paying to fly me out there.  So they flew me out there and paid for it and paid me a little extra.  So I got to the set and they were already shooting the scene when I went out because I was going to wardrobe.  And one impressive thing about that movie was that wardrobe was being run by a black woman, hair and makeup was being run by a black person, some of the sound was being handled by blacks, lighting.  This was the only set that I'd been on where I'd seen blacks in so many important roles in the film.  But the scenes that I was doing was in this church where--well, when I got to the set, it was actually this beat up old junkyard, but they had made the inside look like a very swank spa, and that was where they were shooting the scenes of Stella taking her two sisters to spa treatment.  And Kevin Sullivan was sitting in the director's chair when I walked onto the set.  And he looked over and waved at me.  Well, took a break, he came over and introduced himself 'cause I still wasn't quite sure how I got the call.  And so he smiled, and he said, hello, D'Army, it's good to see you again.  He said, you don't remember me, do you?  And I said, and I kind of paused on him.  He said, I'm Kevin Sullivan.  We met in Memphis.  And he said, plus, I liked you in "People vs. Larry Flynt".  How do you think you got the part for the Stella movie?  So then the next day was when I was to shoot in the church.  And the shoot in the church was the funerals for Whoopi Goldberg's character, and I'm the minister there.  And my line there--well, we first shoot outside, which is after the funeral because it's daylight.  We start at 9:00 in the morning.  And so they shoot the outside scene first to take advantage of the daylight, and then we go inside the church because they can put lights against the building and make it look like it's daytime.  So then we shot inside, and my line in that was, "And now we'll have a few closing remarks from Delilah's dear friend, Ms. Stella Payne."  Well, that is, that voice is heard as, as Stella is on the airplane flying to the funeral.  And then the scene opens in the church, and I'm standing up in the pulpit and Angela Bassett gets up out of the church and walks up and starts making a talk about her friend.  And that started at 9:30.  Well, I'd be through at 7:00.  I was scheduled to have dinner with Oliver Stone because I had met Stone in Memphis.  He was a co-producer on the Flynt movie.  And so we were to meet out at, at Venus Beach for dinner.  And so I ended up--I was supposed to meet him actually at his office.  And we were going out, and I had to keep calling saying, well, I'll be ready in thirty minutes.  And finally, it was 9:00 o'clock before we finished the shoot.  Well, in the meantime, they went on to have dinner, and they said, well, you come on out for drinks.  And so I met them after dinner out at the restaurant and I spent some time with them out there.  But I mention that only because it was, here I am stuck there on the set to get the scenes finished, and knowing that I've got dinner waiting with Stone.  So I made it out and had drinks, but it was a good experience--
Story_ID: 624561
Speaker 1: --All in all, you made about ten movies now?
Speaker 2: I've shot in probably--that's probably right.  I've shot about ten movies.  I've shot this, in the last couple of years, I was in "Nothing But the Truth".  I was a judge on the Supreme Court scene there.  I shot a movie called, last year, well "Forty Shades of Blue".  I didn't make it off the cutting floor, but I shot in that, "21 Grams", Alejandro Gonzalez [Inarritu], I shot on that, didn't make the cut, off the cutting floor.  I shot in "Cast Away", got cut.  But--
Speaker 1: There was only one person in that one--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --pretty much.  Well, there's two, well.
Speaker 2: So I've done probably a dozen film in one way or the other.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the latest one was "Cigarette Girl", I think--
Speaker 2: "Cigarette Girl", I did a wonderful film--
Speaker 1: --in 2010 here.
Speaker 2: --with Mike McCarthy and had a prominent role in that movie.  It's a wonderful film that's getting international acclaim.  It's a low-budget, artsy movie, but well done.  And "Insecure" done by a local black producer, Julius Lewis, that is a very good film, very good actors and actresses that he's still trying to get funding for.
Story_ID: 624562
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, and this is quite a bit, and you probably have a lot more to do, is there anything that you would do differently, if you could, when you look back on the whole thing?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm writing my second book, the--
Speaker 1: Wait, we didn't mention the books.  Now, you've got--
Speaker 2: My first one is about the time down in the civil right struggle in the '60s' [1960s], "The Education of a Black Radical" from LSU [Louisiana State University] Press.  Now, I'm finishing my second book about my time in California and my third book, I'll write about being back in Memphis and starting the [National] Civil Right Museum.
Speaker 1: Well, it's significant that they're not published by the vanity presses.  This Louisiana State University Press--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --publishing your autobiography or your early years.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: And they gave it first-class treatment, and, and released it as a priority book for them.  And they are prepared to publish the next one.  I don't know whether I'm gonna ask them or whether I'm gonna talk to another publisher in addition to them.  But they, they have voiced a willingness to publish the next book.
Story_ID: 624563
Speaker 1: What would I have done different?  I wonder sometimes.  You know, when I was California politics, someone gave me a hundred thousand dollars [$100,000] and paid all the taxes on it.  And I used all that money just to pay for staff and politics in California.  I could have taken that money and invested it.  I could have probably had a different career as a lawyer and made, and made money.  But I don't think that I would have had the release of my inner feelings and being in the sense of fighting back and being able to stand up and feel whole.  I've, I was reading an article called "Racial Micro Aggression in Every Day Life" by a group of psychologists who talk about the experience that black encounter from the time we wake up in the morning until the time we go to bed, just minor slights.  You go into a restaurant and get the worst table or you are the second person asked, "May I help you" at a serving counter or you get on the elevator and the lady holds her pocketbook closer or you, as I did earlier in the year, go to speak at the Clinton School of Public Service in Little Rock [Arkansas], at the library there and get back to the hotel, Peabody Inn.  The white man walks up to me to hand his car keys to go get his automobile or his car ticket.  And, and we have to understand, well, white people have to understand, and that's why it's written by psychologists for psychologists because they say you cannot begin to deal with clinical treatment of blacks as whites if you don't understand this, what they go through every day, which you may think is minor.  But for them, it's a cumulative effect that they experience from sun up to sundown.  And it's important for black people to understand that so that rather than internalizing it and letting those things eat at us, and raise our blood pressure, and make us frustrated and angry, we can reflect it back against the perpetrators and awaken and educate them.  And that's, to me, been not just a matter of race, but a matter of your very being that you can stand up and do--and on the one hand, be humbled, because we all live and breathe and hope and dream and die.  But you have to try to make that a fulfilling, and be friendly and have a little fun out of the process.  So asked if--what would I do differently or would I do anything differently or would I change anything, knowing that I was gonna be kicked out of college, knowing that I was gonna be knocked off the City Council in Berkeley [California], knowing that they were gonna vote me out as president of the board of the [National] Civil Rights Museum, I would do it all the same.
Story_ID: 624564
Speaker 1: Okay.  Likewise, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I was recently given an honorary Doctorate of Law from Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts where they acknowledged what they saw as my life's body of work.  I think that, to me, the greatest achievement for D'Army Bailey is that I've tried to be honest.  I've tried to be fair.  I've fought when I've felt that I had to fight.  I've tried to hone my skills to fight well and effectively, and I've tried to be a loving friend and person to my kids and wife and family.  And I've tried to make one small dent in the mountain of social and economic injustice that was here when I came and will be here when I leave.
Story_ID: 624565
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, well, tell us about--we haven't asked a lot about your family, but your, you've been married for quite a while, and do you have any children?
Speaker 2: Yes, my wife and I married in '76' [1976] so we're now recently celebrated our 33rd anniversary--34th actually.  I have two sons, Justin, my oldest son.  He's single.  He's a lawyer with the U.S. Attorney's Office, a federal prosecutor.  He's 31.  And my youngest son, Merritt, he's 29, and he's a waiter and bartender at an Applebee's Restaurant here where he's worked for about the last five years, works too hard, if you ask me, from 11:00 in the morning, until 11:00 at night.  But he's happy doing it.  And he does rap music on the side and I try to nudge him on to look at other things, but he's a sweet, loving kid who is very trustworthy and is doing what he wants to do and is happy in life.  So I've got a wonderful family, and Walter [Lee Bailey, Jr., HM] and I have been close.  Our life, our lives have, we've not always had the same strategies.  He's a little bit more conciliatory about things than I am often.  My mother [Will Ella Bailey] is still alive.  I'm blessed.  My father [Walter Lee Bailey, Sr.] died earlier at the age of 69.  He was a nurturing, it was a nurturing family environment.  And I think that's basically what we need, all of us, is love and nurturing and guidance.  It doesn't take wealth, it doesn't take being born on any given side of the tracks.  It's what's, what happens to the baby and child and to the adult that comes out of the process and what the environment is that helps to shape that person.
Speaker 1: How has the success of her sons affected your mother, you know?  I, who would have guessed, you know, that you all would have both been lawyers.  I mean is she impressed?
Speaker 2: Well, I think mama kind of takes for granted that, that Walter and I are going to do the right thing.  And she's always supported us and encouraged us.  She's never fretted that we would get off on the wrong track.  She's given us the love and encouragement, and she's, of course, our Number One fan and as my father was.  I mean if you ever saw Walter Bailey coming, close your ears 'cause he was going to brag about his two boys.  But mama is, we're fortunate that she, she's still agile and very alert.  And when I was writing my last book, she gave me some helpful family information that I used.  She still drives herself to church.  So we've been blessed with, with health.  I had a bout five years ago with lung cancer.  I was blessed that my doctor sent me for a chest x-ray which--and a very alert radiologist detected a small spot that then later was diagnosed on a cat scan and proved to be cancerous.  And they did surgery and removed the upper lobe of my right lung, but it was Stage 1.  It hadn't spread.  I didn't have to have chemo or radiation.  I was surgically cured, although I have to go back periodically for a chest x-ray.  So every day to me is a blessing, not just because I'm still here and healthy and alert and feeling well, but because of all of the great people and experiences that I've had the privilege of being a part of.
Story_ID: 624566
Speaker 1: Okay, well, our last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: You know, a black man who cared and who fought and who loved.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you very much for sharing with us.  Okay. I'm looking forward to hearing--to reading your books.
Story_ID: 624567
Speaker 1: This photograph was shot on the courthouse steps at the Shelby County Courthouse in Memphis on December the 13th, 1982, just as we finished the foreclosure auction for the Lorraine Motel, now the National Civil Rights Museum.

Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: All right.  That is the cutting of the chain, we used a chain instead of a rope for the actual opening of the museum which was in October of 1991, although we had the dedication July 4th, and those are the doves that were released when we officially cut the chain.  Standing there with me is the widow of Jesse Turner and Chuck Scruggs and Bill Lucy of the ASCME Union, along with other supporters that helped to build it.
Speaker 2: That is me at the City Hall in New York City with then Mayor David Dinkins [HM] and Memphis Mayor William C. Hackett, H-A-C-K-E-T-T as we were announcing an international competition to select an artist to do the sculpture in the lobby of the National Civil Rights Museum.
Speaker 1: And I believe that Ben Hooks [HM]?

Speaker 1: And Dinkins is the second one.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that you want me to do that one again.
Speaker 1: No, well, if you wanna show Dinkins to be the second one.
Speaker 2: All right.  The picture in the center is of me, J. R. Pitt Hyde, P-I-T-T, H-Y-D-E, chairman of the Executive Committee of the Museum.  At that time, he was a museum board member and Mayor David Dinkins at the New York City Hall, announcing an international competition to select an artist for the sculpture in the lobby of the museum.
Speaker 1: Okay, and here's the last one.
Speaker 2: That is a collage done on me for my career in Berkeley [California] as a city councilman done by the late and great Romare Bearden, R-O-M-A-R-E, B-E-A-R-D-E-N.  Mr. Bearden did that piece for me as a gift.  It was done in 1973.
