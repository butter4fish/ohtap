Speaker 1: All right.  Now is there a story behind the name Princell?
Speaker 2: Well, the story as I know it, my--I was a couple of days old, my mom was still in the hospital; that was back when they actually let women stay in the hospital after having babies, and my aunt came to see her in the hospital and said that 'Hey, he looks like a little prince.'  And out of that came Princell; that's the story.

Story_ID: 56565
Speaker 1: So, before we go into depth though, there are five lightweight questions we always ask and they only require a short answer; they are kinda like a warm-up.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: So the first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: A favorite food.  It would have to be sushi; I really enjoy sushi.  It's healthy, tastes great, you know, it's great with a glass of wine.
Speaker 1: Now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color?  Blue.
Speaker 1: All right.  Favorite time of the year.
Speaker 2: I'd have to say the fall is my favorite time of the year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: That's any place warm and tropical, which reminds me of home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I thought you said these were easy (laughter).  A favorite phrase or saying.  Not really; I, I really don't.
Speaker 1: That's all right, that's all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 56566
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: If you think of a saying later on, just--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --it's all right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and your father's side--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --then we'll put 'em together--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --so can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, her name is Bessie Ann Johnson, B-E-S-S-I-E A-N-N J-O-H-N-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: All right, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Date of birth is April 8th, 1945; place of birth Monticello, Florida--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --M-O-N-T-I-C-E-L-L-O.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what do you--what were they doing?  What kind of occupations (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Sure.  What I know about my mom's side of the family, my grandmother had 14 children, 11 girls and three boys; my mom is the third in the birth order, her brother--the brother next to her, which I believe he was fourth in the birth order, died in the Vietnam War very early on in the early 1960s, and from what I understand, it had a profound impact on my mother because they were very close.  Most of my family, my mom's family, stayed in the Monticello, Florida area which is a town about 30 miles east of Tallahassee; it's a very small town, what you would expect in a North Florida town.  Some of the family moved east--south-east to Titusville; several of her sisters currently live there.  My mom is the only one who ventured as far south as Fort Lauderdale.  My grandfather I did not know--my mother's father I did not know, and she was raised by a man with the last name Baker.
Speaker 1: He's a stepfather?
Speaker 2: He's a step--her stepfather, yes.
Speaker 1: Now what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Janie Mae Hair, J-A-N-I-E M-A-E H-A-I-R.  And my understanding is that they migrated from Alabama at some point during my grandmother's childhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what did your grandmother's parents do?  Were they involved in farming or--
Speaker 2: I don't know; I, I really don't know.  My grandmother--I don't even know what she did as an occupation.  I know that, you know, she--raising 14 kids, I don't think she worked outside of, outside of the home and as for my other--my aunts and uncles, one--I had one aunt who did some college, but most of them--the rest either barely finished high school or, or didn't finish high school; very small, poor community, and not a lot of work for uneducated African Americans.
Speaker 1: Okay, but they lived in town?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, they all lived in one house.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now what did your stepfather do?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Or your step grandfather.
Speaker 2: I, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, but he did something in town (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I never met him.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So did your mother have any stories about growing up?
Speaker 2: No, my mother really didn't tell a lotta stories about growing up; I think that once she left Monticello, it was kind of a way for her to just kind of leave that life behind so we didn't get a lot of stories from her growing up about family--yeah.
Story_ID: 56567
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Bessie Ann Johnson] have a chance to go to college?
Speaker 2: She did not.  I'm the only one in my family who's graduated from college.  That's of the 14 aunts and uncles, and they all have kids; I'm the only one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your mother go to high school?
Speaker 2: She did.  She did not finish high school; she later went back and got her GED.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now did your mother ever talk about what her aspirations were when she was growing up?  Did she have a goal or a desire to do something special?
Speaker 2: My mother was very--a very hard worker; she was very driven and often times talked about a better life.  I don't think she had the--she didn't necessarily have the education or the skill set to achieve that, that, that, you know, better life, but she certainly talked about it which is why I think, you know, that's part of the reason why she pushed, pushed me as much as she did, because she wanted me to have that, that better life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So as far as you know, she didn't have any special talents or anything that she wanted to explore or do--to sew or sing or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, no she didn't.
Story_ID: 56568
Speaker 1: So--now let me go to your father's side of the family.  Can you give me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--This will even be a shorter story (laughter).  I did not know my father [Roosevelt Jones]; he did not--I did not grow up with him.  He--my understanding is--left right after my brother was born, and my brother is a couple of years younger than me.  I know that my--and he was, I wanna say 10, maybe 15 years older than my mom [Bessie Ann Johnson], and they met in Monticello and he migrated to South Florida and, I don't know, he may have been the reason why she, she went down there; I don't, I don't know the answer to that but I did not grow up with him.  I didn't meet him for the first time until I was, oh probably nine or 10 years old; I had very few interactions with him.  I saw him maybe three times in my life; once at nine or 10, another time when we were visiting Monticello [Florida] at the age of 19 or 20, and then at my grandmother's funeral, and then he died maybe a year or two after that, so we didn't have a lot of, a lot of contact.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Roosevelt Jones; common spellings on both.
Speaker 1: And you said he was about 10 years or 15 years older than your mother?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So he was born around (unclear) 1935 or so?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that sounds about right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He'd be in his--he'd be in his 80's now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what did he do for a living, do you know?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Simultaneous)--Did he have a job?
Speaker 2: Odd jobs.  He wasn't educated--odd jobs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories from his side of the family about, you know, what they did or where they came from?
Speaker 2: None that I'm aware of.  He has other kids from other women; I think there's four or five other siblings.  I'm the--my brother and I are the two youngest but I don't, I, I don't have any--I don't really have any contact with his side of the family so I, I've never had the opportunity to really share stories.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So is there--I take it there's probably not a story about how your mother and father met that you know of, right?
Speaker 2: Not one that I'm aware of, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I assume they met in Monticello, which is where they're both from, and somehow ended up in South Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now--so they--but they did get married--did they live together or did they ever get married?
Speaker 2: They never got married--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --they never got married.  I assume they lived together but I don't, I don't know that for sure because he wasn't--I was two when he left so--
Speaker 1: Okay, but he did happen to leave so that meant he was there for some period of time.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: So is it just you and your brother?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you're two years older than your brother?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So he was born--
Speaker 2: Two and a-half years.  He was born in '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Sixty-Nine [1969], okay.
Speaker 2: August 15th.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 56569
Speaker 1: Well, as far as you know--I know you don't know much about your father [Roosevelt Jones], but as far as you know, when you consider your parents' personalities and their looks and their talents, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Definitely my mother [Bessie Ann Johnson].  I get my drive from her, my stubbornness, I guess, from her and, and really the desire to want to do more, achieve more, be more--I get that from her.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And I look like her, so--(laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 56570
Speaker 1: Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Probably the earliest childhood memory that I have is taking the bus to school [North Side Elementary School ]--the city bus--by myself.  We lived in the--what they say is the not-so-great part of town and my mom [Bessie Ann Johnson], for whatever reason, saw something in me and, and wanted me to go to the schools in the, in the white neighborhoods; she thought those schools were better and would give me a better opportunity to succeed, so she put me on the bus at the age of five, and I remember catching the bus every day to elementary school and getting on that bus in the afternoon and going back home, and I did that for, you know, the entire time I was in elementary school and middle school, and then we actually moved into the, into the jurisdiction of the high school.
Speaker 1: So this would be about 1972?
Speaker 2: This would be--yeah, 1972, 1973.
Story_ID: 56571
Speaker 1: Well, can you describe the house you grew up in and the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Sure.  We moved around a bit, we lived in apartments for the most part; the one that I remember--the earliest memory I have is of an apartment building that we lived in--it was on the west side of Fort Lauderdale [Florida] out near [US] 441 past [I-]95, and it was a--all, you know, it was a housing project, all-black neighborhood, you know, with families that were in similar situations to ours, you know, single family homes, single parent homes with all of those things that are associated with living in a, living in a ghetto, you know, drugs and, you know, everything that you could imagine was right there but for whatever reason, I was able to stay away from that, you know, but my friends would--I was embarrassed when I'd have my friends that--come and pick me up because since I went to the, the white schools, all of my friends were white so, you know, it was nothing to them that 'Hey, let's have a sleepover, let's do this, let's do that.'  And, you know, their parents would come to pick me up and it was, it was a bit embarrassing the neighborhood that I lived in.  But it was what we could afford and my mom [Bessie Ann Johnson] made it home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it being an apartment, was it a low-rise projects?
Speaker 2: We were--yeah, it was three floors; we were on the second floor, and it was--I don't know, there may have been--must have been, I don't know, five or six buildings in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So did you move a lot?
Speaker 2: We moved around a lot, yeah, we did.
Speaker 1: Similar places, or did you have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Similar places.  We didn't let the grass grow, you know, too long under our feet.  We were just, you know, when the lease was up, we--my mom was always trying to find a better place for us so we would, you know, we would constantly move.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is there any place that you would consider the place you grew up out of all those places?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a period when my mom was married; she got married when I was nine, and they divorced when I was 13 so there was a four-year period where I lived in a home in a neighborhood called Lauderdale Manors in Fort Lauderdale, and it was a--I would say a black, lower middle-class neighborhood.  My--the guy that my mom married worked for--had a pretty decent job; he was an air-condition technician for Sears and Roebuck back when they actually provided service on their, on their appliances, and that probably felt most like home because we, we lived there the longest and we had a good group of friends, or I had a good group of friends that lived in my neighborhood so was really able to kind of cultivate that, that sense of, of community and, and friendship and, and family in that particular situation.
Story_ID: 56572
Speaker 1: Now we always ask this question.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Some of the sights; let's, let's, let's start with the sounds of growing up.  That was back in the era of the boom box so, you know, there was always the sound of a boom box blaring, you know, out in the parking lot.  Our apartment that we lived in faced the parking lot so there was always, you know, music playing, you know, back in the, you know, '70s [1970s].  You know, there was Motown always playing or something like that in the neighborhood.  You know I--some of the sights--you know, I, I lived, I lived in a ghetto, I mean--you have broken down cars and you have people puttin' their sofas outside and mattresses and--but, you know, you also had--on the flip side, you know, there was--you know, you walk into every house or every apartment or what have you and there was always a picture of [President] John F. Kennedy, a picture of [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], and a picture of Jesus, you know, somewhere in, in, in--you know, that was, that was common.  And the furniture, you know, had plastic covering on it; I mean that was very common in, in, in the households that I went in in the '70s [1970s].  My mom [Bessie Ann Johnson] was very religious so we, we actually--we went to church, you know, two or three times a week; I actually got her into going to church 'cause I--the woman who babysat me when I was younger was, was really into the church and I would go with her, and I dragged my mom to church with me one Sunday and she started going and so we spent a lotta time in the church; so those were, you know, some of my experiences.
Story_ID: 56573
Speaker 1: Now what church did you attend?
Speaker 2: It was the--I attended a couple, but the one I attended the longest was the National Church of God in Christ.  It was a Pentecostal church, so it had all of the things that you would associate with a Pentecostal church, you know, the, the, the music, the singing, the speaking in tongues.  It was a, it was a very robust environment every Sunday.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now you found this church yourself?
Speaker 2: Well, a woman that I called my grandmother who babysat me after school, she introduced me to it.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now did you--did they have like a youth leadership role that you could take in the church?
Speaker 2: I sang in the choir in church.  There wasn't really a youth leadership role per se; we had--anytime that there was an opportunity to gather the kids and, you know, lead them through an activity or something, I would usually take a lead role in that kind of thing whether it was bible study or what have you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For whatever reason, the kids listened to me.
Story_ID: 56574
Speaker 1: Well, where did you start school?  When you were shipped out at five, you started school in a white community, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so what was the name of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--North Side Elementary School.
Speaker 1: North Side, okay.  Were you going to kindergarten or were you starting first grade early?
Speaker 2: I was going to kindergarten.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you like school?
Speaker 2: I did.  I was always that kid with the perfect attendance at the end of the school year; I hated missing school, I hated missing it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So I take it school was a contrast from the neighborhood.
Speaker 2: School was definitely a contrast; it was very--I felt like I lived two different worlds or lived in two different worlds.  I would go to school and it would be one way, and then, you know, I'd get home and, you know, into the neighborhood and then it would be another way.  But, you know, you, you, you adjust.  School was a--school was a way for me to kind of escape, I think, the neighborhood.  And it was also a way for me to really grow and really see.  So many of my friends in the neighborhood had these very ill-conceived and just plain wrong notions of white people, so it was, it was good for me in that I could kind of really see that, you know, it's really not that big of a difference; everyone is kind of, you know, trying to do the same thing and, and, and everyone is really just trying to live their lives and it was, it was--it just gave me a different perspective than my friends in the neighborhood had who were mostly afraid of white people.
Story_ID: 56575
Speaker 1: You say afraid, and I know what you're talking about but tell the--whoever is gonna watch this in the future, what you mean by that.
Speaker 2: I think that you fear things that you don't know, and if you're not in a situation where you're, where you're exposed to other races, then you, you make up things about those other races, and I think that, you know, in the case of a lot of my friends, they kind of constructed these, you know, images of white people as being--what's the word I'm looking for?  Really just not a--not--unfair people, mean people, immediately racist, you know, all kinds of negative connotations associated with that, and that's, you know, for a--I don't know--eight, nine, ten year old kid, that's frightening.
Story_ID: 56576
Speaker 1: Now tell me something about the demographics of Fort Lauderdale [Florida].  What kind of a town is it 'cause after all, this is Florida.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You go into an all-white environment.  I don't know, I mean sitting here, since I've never been there, I'm thinking 'oh, oh,' you know, 'that could be trouble.'
Speaker 2: Well this is Florida in the mid-'70s [1970s] so it's very different--South Florida; it's very different than South Florida of today.  Things changed in, you know, 1980 when the Mariel boatlift happened and we had this influx of Cuban immigrants coming in that completely changed the dynamic and, and--of the population.  The demographic completely changed; it became suddenly, you know, much more Hispanic, you know, first in Miami [Florida] and then migrating north to Fort Lauderdale and, and, and cities north of that.  So in the 1970s, you know, it's still, you know, it's the south and it was--I don't know what the exact demographics were back then in the '70s [1970s], but I can tell you that there was still that divide, you know, where we were on one side of the tracks and they were on the other side of the tracks; I mean that was very much alive and well in Fort Lauderdale.
Story_ID: 56577
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now what did this mean with you going to school in a white school [North Side Elementary School]?  Were there other--were there very many other black students going?
Speaker 2: No, there were, there were--it wasn't a lot; I don't know the exact demos but it wasn't a lot, maybe five percent, maybe 10 percent, but I can tell you that in the classes that I took, I was usually the only one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this busing was not mandatory, right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So this is something that was chosen by your mother [Bessie Ann Johnson] to--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes; very early on, she decided that I was going to get a good education.  She would go to these schools superintendents' office every year and get a special--get special permission for me to attend this particular school, and it got to--it reached the point where they knew she was coming (laughter) and they just allowed her to continue until we finally moved into the, into the school district which would have been--which wasn't until I went to high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  But before that, she had to--so she had to take the initiative--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --and get up and go down to wherever it was--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --fill out papers--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --with an intentional intent.
Speaker 2: Yep, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So--now that's something that doesn't, you know--well, I know they decry the fact that parents aren't as involved these days, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --always do, but your mother was--
Speaker 2: My mom was--she certainly had, I guess, the foresight to know that, that I could be more and do more, and that in order to do that, I had to have the right education and with--you know, in the right schools with the right teachers, and that's why she did it.
Story_ID: 56578
Speaker 1: Were there any special teachers and mentors at school?
Speaker 2: I had some very good mentors and some very good teachers who took an interest in me very early on.  I'll tell you that after, you know, growing up without a father, you really looked for those male mentors.  For me, it was my, my PE coach in elementary school [North Side Elementary School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida]; he took to me and I took to him fairly early on.  He was a bit of a disciplinarian, which I admired and sometimes needed.  He also gave me a lot of encouragement to lead people and not be afraid to lead.  He, he was in charge of the safety patrols, you know, the kids who would help the other kids with crossing streets and, you know, just kind of--really kind of manning the halls during the start and end of school.  Well, he made me a lieutenant in third grade and a captain in fourth grade which never happened before, but he saw something in me that I was--had the ability to at least get people to listen, and in--so that's elementary school.  And then in high school [Fort Lauderdale High School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida], I would say that my, my track coach was a strong mentor for me.  He--I think he understood me and where I was coming from, he had a similar background and he really just instilled in me the importance of working hard, training hard, being disciplined, taking care of your body and your mind and all those things and, you know, he was just someone there to talk to--a male figure to talk to.  I had several teachers throughout my, throughout my school career that took an interest in me, would push me, push me a lot farther than I would, you know, push myself, you know, both, you know, white, black--teachers that you really wouldn't, wouldn't expect really took notice of me and, and really worked with me and, and, and, and encouraged me.  And that's the big thing, you know.  I feel like--I don't feel like I'd, I'd be where I am today if I hadn't had, you know, one or two or three teachers just pushing me constantly, you know.  'Here, you can do this problem, you can do this work sheet, or' you know, 'I want you to lead the exercise today--the math exercise today.  You can do it.'  And that, to me, I think made the biggest difference because once I got to a, you know, probably maybe middle school, I started to push myself but early on, they really pushed me and I, and I saw the value of that as I got older.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Would you care to name any of the teachers?
Speaker 2: Sure.  My elementary school coach, Coach Sapp, my second grade math and science teacher, Mrs. Ford, my fourth and fifth grade teacher, Mrs. Ellen Walters, my track coach, Coach Hurley (ph.), my student council advisor, Mr. Stock.  Those are just a few of 'em.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 56579
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any black teachers?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Walters was black; she was--and Coach Sapp was black.  She--I think she was the only black teacher I had in elementary school [North Side Elementary School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida], and I had her in fourth and fifth grade.  In middle school, I had a couple, but mostly white teachers.
Speaker 1: Now, was Coach Sapp related to Warren Sapp?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think he is; I don't think he is.
Speaker 1: Is it spelled the same way?
Speaker 2: Yeah, spelled the same way, yep.  And I can't remember his first name now.
Speaker 1: Now, I'm not sure where Warren Sapp is from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well, he's from Apopka [Florida].
Speaker 1: He's from where?
Speaker 2: Apopka, which is more like Central Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but there may be a relation, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sounds--you know.  I know he played in Florida--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the NFL [National Football League] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Right, right; played in Tampa [Florida], played at Miami--University of Miami [Miami, Florida].  But yeah, I only had a few black teachers; most of my teachers were white.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, in your classes, you were usually the only one.
Speaker 2: I was usually the only one, but there may have been, may have been one other but usually I was the only one, and you just--you get used to that; you get used to being the only one, you get used to--you know kids.  You know, they treat you a little bit differently and--because you're different than they are.  And it's interesting because being the only one has kind of been a theme not just in, you know, in grade school, but really as I've, you know, worked my way through the corporate world, I find myself in meetings with 20, 30 people now, and I'm the only one.  So in a way, that was good training, you know, in order to, you know, just to be able to deal with that, but at the same time, in 2012 we're still talking about me being the only one in the room.
Story_ID: 56580
Speaker 1: Now, did your brother [Patrick Hair] start two years after you at the same schools?
Speaker 2: My brother did not go to the--well, he had trouble in school.  He is borderline mentally retarded and he went to the schools that were closer to our homes in the neighborhoods because it was just easier for my mom [Bessie Ann Johnson] to just deal with transportation and logistics and that kind of thing.  My brother did not--he dropped out of school in eighth grade.  He repeated the first grade, he repeated third grade, he repeated fifth grade and repeated sixth or seventh grade, and by then he was just, he was just done.  So he dropped out of high school--dropped out of middle school actually.

Speaker 1: Now--so you're living in two different worlds basically--back and forth.  You even have the social dynamic in the white world--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --going on sleepovers and things like that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So how were you accepted in your own community?  You know, with that kind of background, was it tough on you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a great question.  It was a little challenging at times; I spoke differently than the other kids in my neighborhood.  They always told me I talk white or I think I'm white, or I'm an Oreo--black on the outside, white on the inside.  I got all of those, you know, those kinds of comments growing up.  A lot of kids in my neighborhood just didn't understand me and didn't understand why I was the way that I was and, you know, again, it was just--I was different; I was different than they were.  You know, I, I found acceptance at church.  I think that may have been why I gravitated; it was just a much more accepting environment but, you know, when you're out on the, on the playground or out on the, on the basketball court and, you know, I'm the only one that talks the way that I do, you get ridiculed 'cause people don't understand it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --or they're threatened by it, or whatever it is, you know.
Speaker 1: So you didn't make any attempt to try to change the way you talked when you were back home?
Speaker 2: No, I, I, I didn't because it just wasn't, it wasn't me; it wasn't true to me and no matter what I--no matter if I tried, you know, if that's not who you are, you know, people are gonna see right through that so I just dealt with the, with the ridicule; I just dealt with the jokes, you know, and just tried to, you know, laugh it off and, you know, not, not allow it to, to get me angry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I don't know if this is fair or not, but I got almost an even chance of speaking like you did in the projects in school--I guess, because you could have chosen to do that--
Speaker 2: I could have.
Speaker 1: --you know, but that probably wouldn't have been successful in school.
Speaker 2: Probably not, probably not--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --and I don't know why, you know, I grew up--well, I do know why; because I spoke like the people that I was around most of the time, you know, growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you spent most of your time in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: It was a safe place for me--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause I was just as smart as the other kids, smarter than most of 'em, so there was this, there was this--even if it wasn't equal, there was a feeling of equality, and they would look at me and they would admire the fact that I was as smart as they were, so on some level, I was on their level, which made it easier to fit in.
Story_ID: 56582
Speaker 1: Now, did you like music growing up?
Speaker 2: I did.  I was--I played the saxophone in middle school, high school, play the piano now, I've always been a big music fan, both playing and listening.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did your musical taste mirror the white school or the black community?
Speaker 2: My taste?  My tastes are all over the place.  I just like good music.  I like jazz, I like hip-hop, I like R&B, I like country music; I mean my, my tastes really are all over the place.  I just enjoy good music, you know.  My go to place, if you will--if I'm really, if I really wanna hear some good music, I'll turn on some Motown.  That's probably what I--that's probably what I listen to the most because that's what my mom listened to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And those were the days--because when you were growing up it was the Jackson Five (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yes, Jackson Five, it was, you know, it was, it was the Temptations, the Four Tops, you know, it was all of those, those bands--those bands from the '60s [1960s], that their music was, you know, migrated into the '70s [1970s], being re-discovered in the '70s [1970s]; it's, you know, disco, you know, it was that whole era.
Story_ID: 56583
Speaker 1: Now did you pay attention to television?  Was television a big deal?
Speaker 2: I've always been a--I've always watched a lot of T.V., I've always been--as a kid growing up, you know, I watched 'Good Times', I watched 'The Jeffersons', I watched 'M.A.S.H.', I watched, you know, 'Charlie's Angels', 'The Love Boat', I mean I watched a lot of T.V., and I think, you know, that could have been kind of the, the beginning of me, you know, kind of figuring out that, you know, this is a pretty cool medium, this may be something I wanna do later in life because I enjoyed--I enjoy television; I still enjoy television.  And my tastes--again, much like my music tastes, are all over the place.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a favorite show?
Speaker 2: Growing up, probably 'Good Times' was the show that I would make an appointment to watch.  You know, if I missed it, I felt, you know, I felt like I missed something.  Yeah, probably 'Good Times'--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause I could relate to it, you know?  Growing up poor, the projects; you know, I probably related most to Michael's character, you know, the kid who was smarter than everybody else and really trying to, you know, fit in and figure out where he, you know, where his lane was.  That's, that's probably the one that I, I remember the most.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were you aware of networks and those kinds of things in those days?
Speaker 2: I was; certainly not to the extent I am today, but yes, you know, I knew that, you know, 'Good Times' was on CBS and I knew what shows were on NBC or, you know, 'Love Boat' or 'Charlie's Angels' was on ABC and so yes, I was (simultaneous)--PBS.
Speaker 1: Some people are oblivious to those things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Right.
Speaker 1: Some, you know, really focus in on it; some people can tell the signal--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and by looking at the signal, they're looking at CBS or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Right, right, right, exactly; or they now the channel number, you know, Channel Two, Channel, Five, Channel Seven, but they have no idea what the network's call letters are.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So--now had cable--did your family get cable?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I didn't have cable--I don't think I had cable until I moved into my own place which--
Speaker 1: That's in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: --yeah, that was in the late '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I know when cable started, certain (unclear) were connected by the late '70s [1970s] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--By late '70s [1970s], right.
Speaker 1: Columbus, Ohio--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --some other places had cable--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.  Atlanta [Georgia] had Storer Cable, I think it was the name of it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I know Chicago [Illinois] (unclear).  I mean city council fought about it for years--
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: --cable didn't arrive in Chicago until the late '80s [1980s] or early '90s [1990s].
Speaker 2: No kiddin'?
Speaker 1: Yeah--council fights.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  No, we didn't have cable.  We didn't have much use for cable.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Story_ID: 56584
Speaker 1: While I check on that--now--so you went on to--you were involved in a lot of high school activities and spent a lot of time in school--
Speaker 2: I was, yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah, and I read where you ran track--
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: --part of a 440 state championship (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, we had a great team that year; and I was hurt, too.  I had a--I was running on a--I had pulled my quadriceps and I, I was running on a--well, I strained it I guess; I didn't pull it 'cause if I'd pulled it, I would have--I wouldn't have been able to finish the race, but I strained it earlier in the year and I just kept re-injuring it and I--finally, you know, my coach took me out for about a month before the state finals.  We knew we could get there, but we knew we--I had to run in order for us to win.  I wasn't the fastest guy, but I was number two, and you know, we won, we won the mild medley relay, which is what--you know.  And the four by four which, you know, we ran this last race of the meet, I seriously considered not running because my leg was hurting; it was wrapped, it was just, it was--I, I just thought I would do my team more harm than good, and we had an alternate there and I asked him if he wanted to run and, I don't know, there was something about his eyes; I looked in his eyes and he just looked scared, and I thought 'okay, I gotta run,' you know, 'cause even me at 75 percent, I can get around the track in about 50 seconds, which is what I did.  So we came in fourth.  Had I been healthy, I think we would have won it because the last--our, our anchor leg was strong; he was fast and he, he, he, he caught just about everybody.  But it--the one thing my coach said to me, he said--when I was trying to decide whether I was gonna run or not, and before I had talked to the alternate, he said, 'Look, this is up to you; you don't have to do this, we can get him to run, but this is your Olympics and you gotta think about it that way, and if this is something that you're going to regret for the rest of your life, then you should just go ahead, go out and run, just give it a try; no one's gonna fault you if you can't make it.'  So those words were kind of, you know, bouncing around in my head, and then when I looked in the alternate runner's eyes and he was--he looked scared, I thought, 'okay, I gotta do it.'
Speaker 1: That's a tough race for anybody that knows anything about track--
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: --running a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--The 400 meters is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--400 meters is a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--That is the--I think it's the toughest race; I really do.  It's--'cause you're--it's all out--all the way around the track, you know?
Speaker 1: And so how did you even stay in enough shape to do it?
Speaker 2: Well, I ran cross-country, which helped, you know, build my endurance.
Speaker 1: So you just kinda did some jogging and stuff to keep your endurance up?
Speaker 2: Yep, yep, yep.  And then, you know, our coach really, you know, he really pushed us, especially that year, because we knew we had a special team that year.  But it's hard; it's a tough race.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--Some schools have one guy that can actually do it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Right, right, right.  Well, we had four guys and we were all sub-50, so we were pretty good, yeah.
Story_ID: 56585
Speaker 1: And you also were student council president [of Fort Lauderdale High School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida].
Speaker 2: I was the freshman class president, the junior class president, and then the student council president my senior year.
Speaker 1: Now what--I'm sorry, what was the name of your high school? (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Fort Lauderdale High School, yeah; Fort Lauderdale High School.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--only one high school in the--I mean--
Speaker 2: No, no; there are more (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--but this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--but this was Fort Lauderdale High School--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --The Flying L's they called us--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --because of our track team.
Speaker 1: Was it situated downtown in the center part of the city, or--
Speaker 2: It would be considered the northeast section of Fort Lauderdale, so it wasn't downtown.
Speaker 1: Was it the first high school in Fort Lauderdale?  I just wonder why it's called Fort Lauderdale.
Speaker 2: You know, I, I think it was.  It dates back to the 1920s, maybe 1930s, but it was, it was definitely the first high school on that side of town; so yeah, I guess that's why they call it Fort Lauderdale High School.
Speaker 1: I suppose we should take note that--like Miami [Florida], was it developed like in the 1920s?
Speaker 2: The high school?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the city.
Speaker 2: The city.  I think actually a little before that; very similar history to Miami, but Fort Lauderdale was always a--you know, it was a beach town; it was a resort town, it was where you retired, it was where the Canadians would come and the New Yorkers would come every, every, every winter--every summer, or every winter, and it was also the place where the spring breakers would come during spring break up until like the mid-'80's [1980s] when they really changed, you know, the whole marketing campaign around Fort Lauderdale Beach; so it was an interesting town in that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 56586
Speaker 1: Now, in 1983, when you were 16, you had a bad run-in with the Fort Lauderdale police, right?
Speaker 2: I did, I did.  Where did you get that? (Laughter).  That's pretty good.  I was, I was on my way--where was I going?  I'm trying to think what-- Now, were you delivering newspapers?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah; that wasn't the incident though.  Yeah, I started delivering newspapers at the age of 12, on my bicycle, as a way to earn money after school, so I would go from, you know, I'd go from school to my job, and then I'd go home; and really, as a way to help out around the house as well.  The incident you're talking about in 1983, I think I was on my way home from work; it was late at night, I worked--at that time, I was working for a restaurant in the Galleria Mall [Fort Lauderdale, Florida], and I was on my bike and I was in--the mall was on the east side of town, yeah.  So the blacks lived on the west side of town and the whites lived on the east side of town.  By then, it was becoming a little bit more integrated but--and I was on my bike on the way home and the cops stopped me basically for riding my bike while black, you know?  Pulled me over, you know, harassed me a little bit, asked me, you know, for my ID and all this other stuff and, you know, eventually let me go on my way, but that was kind of my first experience of, of being just in the wrong place--the wrong color in the wrong place.
Speaker 2: Okay, and they were looking for somebody with a general description of a medium-sized black person (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Right.
Speaker 2: Black male--
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly.  There was a guy who had--I don't know what he did but, you know, I fit the description, you know, medium build, black male, you know, five foot ten, dark hair, brown eyes, and so that, that was the reason that they gave for stopping me, but it--it was one of those things where you're, you're, you're so angry because you know--first of all, the description was just bogus; I mean that described, you know, most of the black men in Fort Lauderdale, and I know that it was just because, you know, it was in, it was in my neighborhood.  It was right in front of my house, and my mom is standing, watching from the window, wondering what's going on.  But, you know, it was just one of those situations where you have to really just take a step back and really just control yourself, do what the nice officer says, and just get out of the situation as quickly as you can, which is what I did.  But it definitely--it, it, it, it leaves a mark; it, it definitely leaves a mark.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Was this the only incident like this that happened when you were--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was really, that was really only--the only one.  I, I, I was a pretty good kid, and I didn't--I usually didn't get myself in situations where that kind of thing would happen; I was usually either in school, or I was working, or I was on the track, or I was doing something other than, you know, hangin' out.
Story_ID: 56587
Speaker 1: Now Fort Lauderdale High School [Fort Lauderdale, Florida], was that also like mostly white high school?
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Was--at the time.  I don't know what it, what it, what the demographics are now because the neighborhood has completely changed, but it was at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what other activities--I know--were you a senior class president too?
Speaker 2: No; student council president in my senior year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I opted for that because the senior class president has to plan all of the reunions (laughter), so I decided against that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Thinking ahead.
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: So, any other--now what did you--you took the college prep course, I take it, right?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And, you know, did you have a career goal in mind when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, I announced baseball games in high school and I always gravitated towards writing classes--English and those kinds of courses.  I did fine in math and science, but it really wasn't anything I was passionate about.  I figured out pretty early on that I wanted to go into journalism; it was--I was on two tracks, I was gonna be a lawyer or a journalist, and as I got, you know, more into high school and, and, and really just kind of learning more about both professions, I gravitated more towards, towards journalism.
Story_ID: 56588
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you have any heroes as journalists in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, back then, ABC had a guy by the name of Max Robinson anchoring their, their newscast or evening newscast.  He was certainly someone that I respected and looked up to.  The local ABC station had a guy by the name of Dwight Lauderdale anchoring their newscast--the first African American in that market to be a main anchor on the newscast; he was certainly someone I looked up to and respected.  Ralph Renick, who was the--he was the Walter Cronkite of the marketplace; he was a white, older man who just had this great set of pipes and when you watched him, you just--you believed everything that came out of his mouth.  So those were probably, you know, the, the, the biggies.  And of course, you know, it's hard not to admire, you know--at the time, you know, I grew up in the era of Walter Cronkite, you know.  Until he stepped down in 1981, you know, we would watch Ralph Renick and then it would lead in to Walter Cronkite, so those are, those are the people that, that I really grew up watching and admiring and, and, and really wanting to emulate, you know, in my career.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  That makes sense.  So did you graduate with any honors?
Speaker 2: No, I did not.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you didn't do any speeches or any of that?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 56589
Speaker 1: All right, so high school graduation.  When you were on the verge of graduation, what had you planned?  Did the counselors give you help in deciding what college you would go to, or what the next step was gonna be?
Speaker 2: You know, I would say that that's an area where my high school [Fort Lauderdale High School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida] failed me.  I didn't get a lot of input from the counselors; I was really trying to figure it out on my own and trying to--I had gotten a number of letters from several different schools wanting me to come and run for them--a lot of small--smaller schools, and I got some letters, some interest from some larger schools.  I didn't know enough about the process and how to weed my way through the process in, in order to take advantage of, of what were pretty--some pretty decent grades in, in high school, so I ended up actually going into the Navy.  I spent all of twenty eight days in the Navy; I was discharged on a medical discharge because I have flat feet, which is just amazing to me because, you know, six months earlier, I was running, you know, forty eight-second quarter miles.  But the shoes that they made me wear just, you know, made my feet swell, and so I, I, I don't know, I, I, I would think that they could have figured out, you know, maybe some different shoes.  But--so I was discharged from the Navy; I was in their officer candidate program; it was actually--it's a bridge program where you spend a year in San Diego [California] training, and then they pay for four years of college, and then you go four years into the Navy; I can't remember what the name of the program was, but it wasn't, it wasn't OCS [Officer Candidate School] because that you immediately go into college--shorter training period, immediately into college, and then into the navy.  This was a one year-BOOST [Broadened Opportunity for Officer Selection and Training] is what it was called; it was a--it was like a bridge to get you to college, and then from there on to, on to the Navy.
Story_ID: 56590
Speaker 1: Now, just back to high school [Fort Lauderdale High School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida] for a minute--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --I didn't wanna get that far ahead, but you were Mr. Fort Lauderdale in high school, right?
Speaker 2: I was Mr. Fort Lauderdale High School.
Speaker 1: And we said this on camera, that's why I'm making sure I get it on--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and you were supposed to say something at graduation, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Right, well there was a committee that was, that was put together to--I wasn't part of the committee, but I had several friends on the committee, to decide who was going to speak at--which student was going to speak for the students at the high school graduation, and my name was bandied about, there were a couple other names bandied about, and somehow out of that meeting, it was determined that I was too over-exposed, you know, being the student council president, I was very prominent on the, you know, like morning announcements and, you know, we, we had pep rallies, we had these pep rallies every week for various teams and what have you, and I would lead those, and I guess somebody in the, in the room just didn't like the idea of, you know, giving me another platform, so my name was voted out and someone else got the, got the honor, which she did a wonderful job, she did a great job so I'm not, I'm not bitter about it at all.
Speaker 1: Over-exposed?
Speaker 2: Over-exposed.  I'm not sure how you do that in high school, but okay.
Story_ID: 56591
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But it does seem curious.   So now you've taken us almost through the first year in the Navy but it seems curious that you would go to the Navy instead of going to college with--so some colleges wanted you but why did you wind up choosing the Navy instead of college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know I, I just--I was, I was not, I just wasn't really educated about the process and I really didn't have anyone to help me, and, you know, my mom couldn't really help me; she, she didn't know, and I wanted to--I knew that I couldn't afford college but I knew I wanted to go to college.  I wasn't being offered any scholarships.  Well, that's not true; I was offered track scholarships, but they were to very small schools in very small towns in places like Montgomery, Alabama and places that, that I just didn't want to go, so I opted for the Navy because I knew that I would get college paid for and that was my goal.
Speaker 1: So were you recruited or did you go to the naval--
Speaker 2: I was recruited.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean they came to the school and did the, did the hard sell, and it was just--and a couple of my friends decided to do it, so it was just kind of a--it was an easy decision early in my senior year to do it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I didn't have to worry about it.
Speaker 1: And you said that--so you were in the BOOST [Broadened Opportunity for Officer Selection and Training] Program--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --which, under this program you would do service for a year and then go to college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a year of training, four years of college, and then four years of--in active Navy.
Speaker 1: Okay, and they would pay for all your college?
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: But you--were you in there long enough to get the benefits of the program?
Speaker 2: No, I, I was only in the program for twenty eight days.
Speaker 1: Only in the Navy for twenty eight days?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it's--yeah, it's--I was having trouble wearing the shoes that they issued, and I kept going to the doctor and going to the doctor, and they were trying to figure out what was wrong and so they just determined that I had flat feet and could not serve in the military.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So then, I get back (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--fine in your regular shoes, right?
Speaker 2: I was fine in my regular shoes.
Speaker 1: Are you suffering now from flat feet?
Speaker 2: No, I, I, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: So, do you--in looking back on this, do you think that they were--there was a deliberate attempt to wash you out before you could get your benefits?
Speaker 2: I don't--you know, that sounds very conspiratorial (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--second thoughts about it in any way?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I don't, I don't think so; I mean I, I think I presented myself as a pretty good candidate.  I was smart, I was black, I was gonna be an officer, I mean--so I don't think that there was anything--any kind of attempt to, to, to wash me out; I just think that the--you know, they see how many hundreds of recruits every year, how many thousands of recruits, and I think that, you know, there may have been almost like a rubber stamping kinda thing that--'All right, well, you know, he's having trouble with the shoes, let's just (CLICKING SOUND), get him out.'
Story_ID: 56592
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, at that point, there were no scholarship opportunities for me, you know.  Those had all gone by the wayside so I was able to go to a junior college in Jacksonville [Florida] and run.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of the--
Speaker 2: At the time, it was called Florida Community College [Jacksonville, Florida].  I think it's called Florida Junior College now, and it's also the place where my high school sweetheart got a scholarship, so it was kind of an easy way for me to be with her and, and pay for school.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right, so this is near--this is in Jacksonville?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.  So how did things go there?
Speaker 2: Academically they were fine; I never really made it to track season.  We got pregnant.  I was 18?  Nine--18.  And we decided that we were going to take some time off from school and try and figure out--you know, I was gonna work full-time, which I did, and really try and figure out, you know, what the next steps were.  We were very young, soon to be parents, scared, no idea how we were going to afford this; neither one of us had insurance, you know.  We were using Medicaid and whatever resources we had at our disposal and, you know, we spent the next--I wanna say almost two years, year and a-half, just trying to figure out what we were going to do.  We moved to--we had the baby and moved to Gainesville [Florida] where I decided I was gonna go to--my girlfriend did not have aspirations of going to college but I still had them, so I saved up enough money to go back to school in 1987.  I graduated high school in '85 [1985], did that one semester at Florida Junior College, took a year and a-half off and started in the fall of 1987 at Santa Fe Community College [Gainesville, Florida].
Speaker 1: Santa Fe Community College (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--In Gainesville; Gainesville, Florida.  So she worked, I worked and went to school, and we were taking care of our two year-old--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --or one and a-half year-old.

Speaker 1: So we stayed there for two years, and I had every intention of transferring to the University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida] which had--at the time, had one of the better journalism programs in the south; still does, still has one of the better journalism programs.  But then she left, wasn't--she really wasn't finding what she needed in Gainesville, and we were really kind of at the point where the relationship was, was dwindling, and we both knew it.  She went back to South Florida (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Now is she African American or white?
Speaker 1: No, she's white.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I followed her back because I wanted to be near my son, and that's when I started school at FIU [Florida International University, Miami, Florida].
Speaker 2: Okay, that's Florida (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Florida International University, yep.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this was about 1990?
Speaker 1: This would have been 1990, yeah.
Speaker 2: Florida International University.  So is part of the moving around and the whole drama of just the fact that she was white and the--or were her parents okay with this marriage [sic, relationship]?
Speaker 1: No, her parents were not okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, that's what I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, her parents were definitely not okay with the relationship and, you know, we were really kind of on our own.  You know, my mom [Bessie Ann Johnson] was, was, was okay with it, but she really didn't have anything to offer us, you know, from a resource standpoint, so we were really trying to make it, make it on our own.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So--okay.  That had to be a tough time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was definitely a growth experience, being so young, you know, being a kid myself, you know, having to raise a kid and to really try and figure out what a family is supposed to be, all the while working full time, going to school full time; it was definitely a stressful time of our lives, not having the support of, you know, our parents.  And really, our only support was our network of friends that we had met in that city.  So it was, it was difficult but I think, for me, it forced me to grow up very quickly, and it just, you know, it just forces you to look at life a little bit differently with a little different perspective.  So after I left--after we left and went to--you know I started going to FIU, I moved in with a friend of mine, started going to school there, and about a year into my tenure at FIU, I met the woman who would be my wife--who would become my wife.
Story_ID: 56594
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is in '91 [1991] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--This is in '91 [1991], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is your second wife (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well, we--I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--This is the only one you've had since (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Right, right.  Stephanie and I were never married.
Speaker 1: Oh, the first--oh (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Right, we were never married.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, all right, okay.  So did you get married in 1992?
Speaker 2: Ninety-One [1991].
Speaker 1: Ninety-One [1991]?  Okay, all right.  And--well tell us about how you met her and--
Speaker 2: Sure.  We were in a class together.  The way she [Jodie Hair] tells the story, I stalked her, 'cause she had seen me in different places on campus during that week of registration where you have to go to orientation and you gotta go and pay for classes and pick classes and go to the book store and get books and all of those things.  In each one of those places, she says she saw me; I didn't, I didn't see her.  My focus at that point was on just getting through school; I wasn't trying to be in a relationship, I really wasn't, you know--getting through school, taking care of my son, and that was really, that was really it, but it turns out we had a class together.  It was on a Friday--no, it was on a Thursday, we had class together, and I actually had a crush on her roommate who was also her seat mate in class, so I went over to talk to her roommate and then she just kinda, you know, chimed in and, you know, we just started talking and I invited her to a party, that night.  A good friend of mine was having a party so--you know, it was a college party, we had all been drinking a little bit, and I told her to be there at nine; she was late, so I think right around 9:30, we left and went, you know, went to a bar across the street or something like that, and she showed up and there was nobody there.  So the next day in class, I was a bit hung over and she came up to me and said, 'Why'd you stand me up?'  And I said, 'I didn't stand you up, you were late but we were there, I waited for you,' blah, blah, blah.  So I said, 'Okay, let me make it up to you, let me take you to lunch.'  So we went to this, this little cafeteria, the Piccadilly Cafeteria in North Miami [Florida], and we had lunch and we've been together ever since.  Went out that night and spent the weekend together and just, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 56595
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you're at Florida International University [Miami, Florida] and--so she's [Jodie Hair, Princell Hair's wife] a student there too, right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  Now what was your major at Florida International?  Was it journalism?
Speaker 2: Broadcast journalism.  I have a Bachelor of Science degree in broadcast journalism--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but that's a story in and of itself because I was fortunate enough to, to work in the field while in college.  I was a--the Post-Newsweek Stations had an internship program; it was a paid trainee program.  It was a one-year program in which I think I was paid, I don't know, six bucks an hour, or maybe seven bucks an hour, and I was able to work in all facets of the newsroom; started out on the assignment desk, and then I was assigned to the writers and producers and then I was assigned to the reporters, so I would go out into the field and report on stories and photographers as well, and at the end of that program, you're either offered a job or they say, 'Thank you very much' and they send you on your way.  Well, at the end of that program, they offered me a job; it was a producer job and they offered me 15,000 [dollars], which, you know, I had just made like 12,000 [dollars] during that year so I was gettin' a raise, but at the same time, I was being recruited by the station across the street, WSVN, and they offered me a producing job at 25,000 [dollars], so I took that job and I'm now in my second to last semester of, of college, I am working full time, going to school full time, which proved to be a bit too much for me.  So with four classes left, I quit school and decided to work full time and I went back ten years later when I was in Baltimore [Maryland], and went to the University of Baltimore, took those four classes, transferred them to FIU, and got my degree in 2000 from FIU.
Story_ID: 56596
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And I see here you worked with a fellow named Joel Cheatwood; is that true?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Now, Joel Cheatwood is famous for saying in 1989, coining the expression, 'If it bleeds, it leads.'
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now tell us about your reaction to that, and how was it working with him?
Speaker 2: I think Joel is probably one of the, one of the most misunderstood people in our industry.  He is someone who really likes to do good television.  I'm not sure if he actually coined that phrase, I think maybe that was a phrase that was assigned to him.  You know, it was a time in the marketplace where there was just a big switch with the NBC affiliate moving over to what was then the CBS affiliate, which became the NBC affiliate, and there was this little-known group called Fox that was, you know, taking over, and the--WSVN had to figure out a way to stand out, shake up the market a little bit, so in keeping with kind of the Fox model at the time, they really tried to be innovative; bold graphics, live reports, you know, from all over the city, anchors who were very conversational, and a presentation that got your attention.  Also, at the time, there was a lot of crime in Miami and, you know, one of the things that is quick and easy to do, as any journalist knows, is to go out and cover the crime of the day.  So it was, it was this approach really, that gave S--WSVN that reputation of 'If it bleeds, it leads.'  Now, there was, you know--WSVN had two very strong investigative reporters, WSVN had a health and medical unit that was unrivaled in the market, WSVN had a, a very strong connection to the Cuban community and news in that particular community for those folks who were English-speaking Hispanics, WSVN had a, a consumer unit that got results that, you know, went after, you know, government waste and, and public officials and, and really held people accountable.  Those things you don't really hear about with WSVN, but having been there and having lived it, it was definitely more than 'if it bleeds, it leads.'  Now, did we cover crime?  Absolutely; did we, you know--was it in your face?  Absolutely.  But there are a lot of other things that really made up the whole of covering news at, at WSVN.  Joel Cheatwood is, is one of my mentors; he is a very smart, thoughtful man who understands how to brand a product and how to drive that brand home day in and day out, which is what you have to do in television, you know.  Once you figure out what your brand is, you have to reinforce that brand day in and day out, you know; re-tell the viewers, 'This is who we are,' you know, 'This is why you like us, and this is who we're going to be.'  And he's brilliant at that, and I learned a lot under him.
Story_ID: 56597
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you adopt a certain-him [Joel Cheatwood] being a mentor, but I know everybody has their own philosophy how they want to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Sure.
Speaker 1: --but what became your journalistic philosophy after your training and your mentorship and all that?
Speaker 2: Well, you know I've worked for several different types of news directors with different types of philosophies, and what I like to do is, you know, I like to take something from each one of them and, and what I've done is taken something from each one of them and, and really develop, you know, what I consider my own philosophy.  I think that, you know, good journalism and good television are not mutually exclusive; I think you can have both.  I think it's important that we as journalists tell stories, and we tell all sides of the stories, and we tell it in a way that is meaningful, that is compelling, that is presented in a way that you're gonna wanna watch it, and that's, that's, that's really kind of the, I guess the, the core of, of what I believe in as a journalist.  We are story tellers and we owe it to our audience to tell that story the best way we can.
Story_ID: 56598
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you were in Miami [Florida]--well, it wasn't long before--well, what happened there?  Now you were mentored by Joel [Cheatwood]--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --and is there anything there that was, I guess, a big event in the news that you--
Speaker 2: Well, Hurricane Andrew; that was in August of '91 [sic, 1992], and it was certainly the biggest event in the, in the market, it's certainly in my lifetime, and it really taught me the importance of what we do, the importance of, of--the importance of our medium and our, and our business; I mean in, in, in--we were the eyes and ears of the viewing audience and, you know, for I don't know how long, they couldn't see us but they could hear us on the radio because we, you know, we were simulcasting on, on the radio.  You know, we were telling people where the shelters were, we were telling people where to go to get supplies, we were telling people, you know, what gas stations were open so they can go and get gas, I mean it was, you know--the areas to avoid, I mean it was an important piece of that story and, and, you know, all of the television stations in South Florida really galvanizing just, you know--or I should say mobilizing--really came together during that event.  I mean we were on the air non-stop for twenty one straight days.  Didn't go to a commercial, didn't leave the air at all for twenty one straight days.  I spent, you know, right after the storm, I spent, you know, fourteen, fifteen hours in the control room just sitting in the chair producing our coverage.  Here's a kid who, you know, a year removed from, from, from college and, you know, I'm callin' the shots on, on what, you know, what live shots to go to, what the viewers are seeing on television.  It was a, it was a--just a fascinating experience.  I had to leave my daughter's first birthday party when I got the call to come to work; I came back and rode out the storm with them during that, you know, three, four hours, and then got back in the car and went back to work.
Story_ID: 56599
Speaker 1: Okay, sir, what do you think the skill sets were that the Miami [Florida] TV [television] stations saw in you when they offered you the job as producer of the news?
Speaker 2: A couple of things; one is, you have to have vision, you have to be able to look at this collection of stories, whatever they are, and figure out how they fit into a thirty minute broadcast, or a sixty minute broadcast, depending on the length of your show, you know; what kind of time to give, you know, a particular story, where it belongs in, in the, in the rundown, how it fits into the overall newscast and brand of, of the program.  So I think vision is key, leadership, I think, is another key because you are dealing with, you know, you're dealing with anchors, you have to be able to get them to buy into the newscast that you're doing, you're, you're dealing with reporters, you have to guide them on their stories and what's important, what's not important, that kinda thing.  You're--you have a staff of writers and directors who you have to get their buy-in to the newscast, and the writers need to write the stories the way you want them written, the director needs to have the same kind of vision for the show that you have, the shots that that person takes; you need to be able to direct the assignment desk, "No, we don't wanna go over to this story, we wanna go over to this story."  So I think the ability to lead a team of people is important, and I think the, the final thing is you have to be a good writer.  I think the best producers are good writers and I was always a, a pretty good writer.  The producers typically will just focus on, you know, the headlines and the teases and the, and the lead-ins to all the, all of the packages, but inherent in being a good writer is being able to recognize bad writing and being able to fix it, so you have to be a good editor as well.  But I think those are the key components to, to producing.
Story_ID: 56600
Speaker 1: Okay.  So with a big project like the hurricane [Hurricane Andrew in Florida in 1992], all these skills were being tested--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well, there wasn't much writing (laughter) because you're on live television, so at that point, when you go into live TV mode, you're really trying to--you're, you're, you're directing traffic, you're, you know, telling the anchors, you know, what's next, where they need to go, you are telling the director, you know, what's next, where, where, where we're going next, that kinda thing.  You're talking to your satellite or live shot coordinator, "Get this ready for me, get that ready for me," you're keeping track in your head, 'okay, I just talked to this person at the shelter, now I need to talk to' you know, 'the hurricane center, and now I need to go to the weather meteorologist; now I need to'--and really just kinda keeping track of all that stuff in your head, and really that goes back to that vision thing as understanding, you know, in the next hour of television--in the next hour of live television, I wanna hit these, you know, six or seven things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In that kind of a crisis, I've often wondered how a producer decides who they're gonna talk to and who they're not.
Speaker 2: Well, a lot of it is, who's ready?  'Cause a lotta times, when you're in those situations, you know that you have reporters in the field and they're out doin' their jobs--they're reporting, they're gathering news and they're gathering information, and you have to allow them the time to do that because, you know, you need that information for your, for your broadcast, so it's knowing when to, when to shut them down so that they can go and spend 30 minutes, you know, talking to the PIOs or, or, or, or what have you, and, and knowing what's, what's, what's ready and, and, you know, the other mark of a good producer is always, always having a backup, you know, you always have someone on set that you can go to; this person is gonna talk about X, or someone in the newsroom who's gonna talk about X, so that in the event that you have a, you know, a meltdown of, of live shots, you know, you have somewhere to go.  Always have somewhere to go, that's, that's a key com--that's a key thing for any producer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, that makes sense.
Speaker 2: So when you see those, those, those moments of, of dead air on, on TV or anchors who are looking like they don't--they have no idea, you know, where they're supposed to go, it's because that producer didn't have a--didn't have a backup, didn't have a place to go.
Story_ID: 56601
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, in 1993, you became Executive Producer at WBBM in Chicago [Illinois], and that's a CBS affiliate, one of the big Chicago stations.  Now, how did this take place and--
Speaker 2: Well, I went from Miami to Detroit [Michigan], and in Detroit, I was a producer of the number one eleven o'clock newscast with, with legendary anchor Mort Crim, a Detroit legend, and his partner Carmen Harlan, and I made the move to Detroit because I never lived outside of Florida; I'd never lived anywhere else, and I really wanted to experience another part of the, of the country.  I had come through the Hurricane Andrew disaster and I, I was at a point where I felt like I needed a change, I needed to do something different, I needed to, you know, to, to really--you know, that was a traumatic, stressful event in South Florida and, you know, something that impacted that community for years to come.  This opportunity came with another Post-Newsweek Station in Detroit, and--
Speaker 1: What was the name of the (unclear) station?
Speaker 2: WDIV.
Speaker 1: WDIV.
Speaker 2: Yep, that's the NBC station in Detroit.  And they recruited me pretty heavily and, and gave me a lotta money to, to come to Detroit, so I made the jump.  And--
Speaker 1: And when you got there, was Coleman Young still the mayor?
Speaker 2: He was--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --he was still the mayor, and in fact, he was, he was, he was re-elected, I think, while I was there.  I may be getting my dates mixed up, but Dennis Archer was--I think ran against him and lost, but then ran, you know, four years later and won.  But yeah, Coleman Young was, was the mayor and--I can't even tell you who the governor was; I don't remember.  But that--Detroit really, you know, so much of Detroit revolves around the auto industry and I'd never, you know, lived in a city where, you know, one industry really drove the economy, and just understanding the nuances of working in a market where you have, you know, shift workers and programming to those various, various shift workers in, in a marketplace and understanding audience flow and how that all works, and it was a, it was a, a real eye-opener for me.
Story_ID: 56602
Speaker 1: I'll tell you a quick Detroit [Michigan] story.  So I made the decision to go to Detroit in November of 1991.  My wife [Jodie Hair] and I decided that we were gonna spend our first Thanksgiving in, in, in Detroit.  It was our second Thanksgiving together, but we wanted to spend Thanksgiving that year in Detroit, so we set out on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving to head to Detroit, left Miami, and we were on our way.  We got to West Palm [Beach, Florida], the car broke down, and it was the day before Thanksgiving, it was after 5:00 'cause we left in the evening so that we'd drive overnight and get there in the morning, so there was, there were no mechanics open, we couldn't get the car fixed, the next day was Thanksgiving, everything was closed, so we ended up spending Wednesday night and Thursday night--Thanksgiving night, in West Palm.  We actually--you ever see the movie A Christmas Story where they go to a Chinese restaurant to have dinner because, you know, they, they ruined the, the turkey or the duck or whatever it is?  Well we to a Chinese restaurant and had dinner on, on Thanksgiving night.  So the next day we, we get the car fixed, we set out to head to Michigan, you know, sometime that evening, we get to Michigan on Saturday morning sometime, and they're having the worst November snow storm in ten years.  Now, both of us are from Florida, I'd never--I'd seen snow once before, my wife had never seen snow, and here we are driving in it in a city that we're unfamiliar with.  So we, we, we get to our corporate housing that Saturday, and we kinda, you know, just kinda looked around, and we kinda hunkered down because we didn't know what to do with snow, and then we decided to get a little adventurous and we said, "You know what?  We should probably learn how to drive in this."  So we went out into a parking lot and started driving in the snow, just to get used to driving in the snow--on that Sunday.  And then that Monday, I started, I started work.  But it was kind of a--it was a, it was a very interesting start to my, my tenure in, in Detroit.  I was there for nine--ten months in Detroit, and got an opportunity to move into management at WBBM in Chicago.
Story_ID: 56603
Speaker 1: Now this was all happening really fast, it seems to me.
Speaker 2: This was all happening very fast, I'm moving up very quickly, and part of the reason is I, I wasn't afraid to move around.  You know, I could have stayed in Detroit another, you know, 10 years if I wanted to, but I was ambitious--I am ambitious, and this was a great opportunity to get into management in a great city, in a very--you know, a TV station that had a lot of tradition, working for folks that I, you know, have known in the past, so it was a very familiar situation, and it was an easy--pretty easy decision.  We weren't in love with Detroit [Michigan]; it didn't--we didn't hate it, but we weren't in love with Detroit, and we hadn't really settled there, so we made the move to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, so 1990--
Speaker 2: Ninety-Three [1993].
Speaker 1: Three [1993].
Speaker 2: So it would have been the summer of '93 [1993].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you're in Chicago, WBBM.  Were they still--I think Walter Jacobson and Bill Kurtis were still there?
Speaker 2: No, Walter was gone, he had gone over to Fox by then.  It was Linda MacLennan and, and Bill Kurtis; yes Bill Kurtis.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --great pipes (laughter).
Speaker 1: I think at the station, you still had Harry Porterfield.  Was he still (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--No, Harry was at WLS at the time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Oh, was he gone?
Speaker 2: Yep, he had already moved over to WLS.  The main team was Steve Bask--but it was Bill Kurtis, Linda MacLennan, Steve Baskerville, Corey McPherrin on sports, and--you remember--oh gosh, Burleigh Hines?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Burleigh Hines was there, Pam Zet--ahh, Zekman?
Speaker 1: Zekman, right.
Speaker 2: Yep, Pam Zekman.
Speaker 1: She did investigative reports (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yep, yep.  Lester Holt was my night side reporter.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Lester Holt--that's before he went over (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yep, yep.  Larry Mendte was one of my investigative reporters.  I'm trying to think; there were several--Rob Stafford, Janet Shamblin, who are both at NBC now, were two of my reporters.  We had a great team of folks, a great team of people.  And the last time WBBM was number one during ratings (unclear), was in '94' [1994] when I was there.  Now we had a little help from the [1994 Winter] Olympics and Lillehammer [Norway], but that was the last time WBBM saw number one.
Story_ID: 56604
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you think was the biggest story, you know, there that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--While I was there?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We had a series of, of gang-related killings of very young, you know, young people--kids.  There was a ten year-old girl who was caught in some crossfire and the kid that--at Cabrini Green [housing project in Chicago, Illinois]; I think it was Cabrini Green.  It was either Cabrini Green or Ida B. Wells [housing project in Chicago, Illinois], but the kid that actually did the shooting, the cops were looking for him; they knew who he was, they were looking for him forever.  He turned up dead because he was bringing so much heat on the gang that they killed him.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Now this is (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You remember this story?
Speaker 1: [Robert] "Yummy" Sandifer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: Eleven years old.
Speaker 2: Yep, eleven years old.
Speaker 1: Made the cover of Newsweek [magazine].
Speaker 2: Yep, exactly.  He turned up dead, and there were a couple of others that were, that happened at that time.  We decided that we were going to take a very proactive approach and we--I produced a show from one of the housing projects, I think it was Ida B. Wells.  We went inside the home of, of, of, you know, just one of the citizens there, and we had the, the mayor on, we had the head of public housing on, we had the police chief on, basically looking to hold them accountable for what was happening and to figure out what they were gonna do about it.  It was anchored by Bill Kurtis, and it really just focused on the fact that, you know, our future was in crisis with all of these kids dying; in fact, that was the title of the special, 'Our Future In Crisis.'  And we won an Emmy [Award] for it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think one of the cases that you focused on was the case of Eric Morris [sic, Morse], the little kid that was hung out of a window.
Speaker 2: Yes, yep, yep.
Speaker 1: That was the Darrow Homes, next to Ida B. Wells (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--That's right, very good memory.
Speaker 1: Yeah, fourteen stories high.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  So that was probably the biggest story that I was involved in while I was there but, you know, Chicago is a great news town and, you know, the, the, the politics alone in, in Chicago would, you know, fill up most newscasts so, you know, there--and that was a time--that was at the time of [Dan] Rostenkowski where was, you know, still the powerful Ways and Means Committee Chairman, you know, Mayor [Richard M.] Daley was, you know, he was maybe a second term?  Maybe third term at that time?
Speaker 1: I think he had just started the second term (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Second term, started the second term?  But, you know, it was--and [Rev.] Jesse Jackson [Jr.] was, was very active at the time with, with the Rainbow [PUSH] Coalition, and WBBM had gone through a lot of issues with him, he had boycotted the station, they marched on the station because of some discriminatory issues, so there was a lot of activity.  The [Chicago] Bulls--they were making their first run during that time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, they were--that was their first (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--That was their first three, yep, exactly.  So it was a, it was an interesting and exciting time in Chicago.
Story_ID: 56605
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were there only--
Speaker 2: Two years, yep; I was there [WBBM in Chicago, Illinois] for two years, and I got an opportunity to--so I was there for two years, and I went through two news directors, and only one GM [general manager]?  No, it was actually two GMs.  I was hired--when I was hired, Bill Applegate was GM, but then [Robert] Bob McGann took over and then Mark Tony hired me as--he was the news director and after a year, John Lansing came in as news director, and Lansing is another one of my--another person I consider a true mentor for me because he, he really--you know, he was a true journalist, really focused on the journalism; he was a photographer who had worked his way into management, so he had a very keen eye for pictures and sound, which is something that we use often in, in our story telling.  But I had an opportunity--you know, there is a lot of instability in management, and Lansing was actually on his way out to another opportunity, so I was looking around to see what was, what was out there, and there was this station in Orlando [Florida], it was a number four station in the market, number five station in the market--WCPX, it was a part of a three-station group, and they were looking to turn the station around, so I'd never really been in a situation where I was in a turn-around, so that was appealing to me.  Going back to Florida, that was also appealing to me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--This was 1995?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  And it was an opportunity to move up in management.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you ever work for WKMG?
Speaker 2: Well that's it--that's what the call letters are now--
Speaker 1: Ohh.
Speaker 2: --when Post-Newsweek [Stations] bought it, they changed the call letters to WKMG.
Speaker 1: Okay, but then it was--
Speaker 2: WCPX.
Story_ID: 56606
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay.  So now, tell us about--now this is Orlando, Florida.  Orlando now, is starting to become a boom town.
Speaker 2: Right, Orlando is still--at that time, was still very dependent on tourism as their main industry, but it was really starting to grow because you were getting a lot of migration from South Florida up to Orlando.  You know, that station was like number four, number five in the market, really kind of an after-thought; no one really took it seriously.  They didn't have--they had a third of the resources to cover news in the marketplace and I was brought in as the assistant news director with expanded authority; what that meant was I really ran the day-to-day news operation and I was responsible for really overseeing the entire news process.  Our news director was also the station manager, so he was consumed with other parts of the station and I--it was my opportunity to really--my first opportunity to really run, run a newsroom myself.  He--we probably transitioned forty to fifty percent of the staff during my time there.  We really had people there in positions who didn't belong there.  It was a market where--it was the 21st market there--22nd market at the time, and--but we didn't, we didn't produce television like a, you know, 20-something market TV station; we were really, you know, always behind everyone else, always the last to arrive on the scene.  We could never get the interview with the family member or, you know, that key interview that the other stations got, so we really had to turn that into a competitive environment, and that meant investing in the resources for the station, making smart decisions about it but making investments in the resources and in the people and, you know, my part of it was really the people--in finding good people, good managers, good producers who understood how to do live television.  When I left the station, we were number two, pushing for number one.
Speaker 1: In Orlando?
Speaker 2: In Orlando, yeah.
Story_ID: 56607
Speaker 1: Now, you left to--from what I understand, to go to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Back to Chicago [Illinois], to WMAQ.  Now this was an opportunity (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--So this is 1997?
Speaker 2: This is '97 [1997].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This opportunity came from my old friend Joel Cheatwood.  He had moved to the station as station manager and he needed a news director and it was a great opportunity for me to go back to Chicago, a number three market, for my first news director job; now that time period was very tumultuous.  During the time that I made the decision to go to--to go back to Chicago as news director, the GM [general manager] of the station made the decision to bring Jerry Springer on to do commentaries.  I wish I had had that information when making my decision; I'm not saying it would have been a different decision, but it would have given me pause.  This turned out to be a very controversial move; it was headlines in the Chicago Sun Times; big, bold headlines every single day, you know, "Channel Five hires Springer," "Springer does his first commentary," "Springer--he misspoke."  Misspoke, misled, I'm not really sure.  In one of his commentaries, someone at the paper did some fact checking.  He says he gave the KK--his first commentary was about free speech, and in that, he said that he gave the Ku Klux Klan permission to march when he was mayor of Cincinnati [Ohio].  Well it turns out, the mayor of Cincinnati doesn't have that authority; it's some other department.  So it, it's, it's a small thing, but at the time everything was big, so that became headlines.  Carol Marin quit Channel Five and then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--And what was her issue?
Speaker 2: Her issue was she didn't wanna be on, you know, on the same set with a tabloid talk show host, and this was before Springer--the Springer today--it was different; the show was different.  It was still the tabloid show, but it hadn't gone over the top yet.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--It was pretty close.
Speaker 2: It was pretty close, it was pretty close but you, you take a look at his shows in '97 [1997] and you take a look at his shows in '98 [1998] and beyond, and there's definitely a different tone.  It was--there was at least a, a modicum of respectability to the shows, and he'll, he'll, he'll, he'll admit that himself; he's laughing all the way to the bank, but--so Carol Marin quit, the newsroom was very divided, there were folks in, you know, one or two camps, the camps--the camp that hated management for doing this, and then the camp that said, "You know what?  They tried something, it didn't work, let's all just move on."
Speaker 1: The thing is, you know, Ron Magers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Ron Magers.
Speaker 1: Warner Saunders--
Speaker 2: Warner Saunders.  When Ron left, Warner became the main anchor, when Carol Marin left, Allison Rosati became the main anchor.  Art Norman and Nesita Kwan were the, were the morning anchors.  Renee Ferguson, one of the investigative reporters, Dave Savini, another investigative reporter, we had--you know, we--Charlie Wojciechowski--we had some great talent there; some very good reporters, but it was, it was a very difficult, tense situation coming into work every day because we had this thing hanging over us and it was poorly handled by--and I'm gonna say us, even though I'm not the one who really handled it; this really fell on the GM at the time.  But it was poorly handled, poorly communicated, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Were you blamed by it?
Speaker 2: I was lumped in with the rest of management, even though I had absolutely nothing to do with it.  And Joel had nothing to do with it; everyone thought it was Joel's call to do that, and he had absolutely nothing to do with it.  The GM, Lyle Banks, had made that decision with Springer months before, but it was a runaway train; it was, it was--and hard to get outta the way of.  And my job was to try and get newscasts on the air every day; we still had to do our jobs, we still had our obligation to our, our viewers, we still had to give them the best news and information possible-
Story_ID: 56608
Speaker 1: All right.  So, Jerry Springer controversy--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so during this period, my role really was to, you know, try not to get caught up in what was happening, you know, on the fifth floor, but really to get everyone on the first floor focused; get the newsroom to a place where we know it's there, but we're coming in, we're gonna do our jobs every day, and we'll be as transparent as we can about the controversy that's happening within our walls, but at the same time, Chicago [Illinois] is a big city; there was a lot happening, and we owed it to ourselves and to our viewers to continue to try and put on the best news product possible, and that's all we--that's all I could really do.  It was a, a really--it was a tough time; it was difficult, you know, personally 'cause I had nothing to do with this but, you know, you'd walk in--into the newsroom and people would give you the evil eye, people were openly defiant in the newsroom; there was just a lot of--that's a newsroom that really prided itself on being difficult; they liked the fact that they were considered a difficult newsroom.  So that whole thing happened; the GM [general] got fired eventually, his boss in New York retired eventually, Carol Marin left, Ron Magers left.  There were a lotta people that were impacted by, by that decision; a lotta careers that were impacted by that decision.  New GM comes in--this is now 1998--beginning of '98 [1998], maybe March of '98 [1998], I think.  Joel Cheatwood gets, quote-unquote, promoted, and he wants to bring in his own entire team; he got rid of everybody, even down to some of the producers that we hired.  They completely, you know, cleaned out the place, which I think--well, I shouldn't say completely; there are still a couple of people there that were able to kind of duck and cover and survive, but the entire management team was, was let go, along with several producers--changed a lotta careers.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, were you there when--I can't think--your investigative reporter, you just named her--
Speaker 2: Dave Savini?
Speaker 1: No (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Renee Ferguson.
Speaker 1: Renee Ferguson--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --did the investigation for Marva Collins.
Speaker 2: I was not there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: No, I was not there.  I think I had left by then.
Speaker 1: That was a big public relations flap (ph.) too, because her investigation was good, I thought.
Speaker 2: Uhh huh.
Speaker 1: Results didn't--made people angry.
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: I have to tell you about that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, yeah, definitely.
Speaker 1: That's another (unclear).  But Warner Saunders stayed there, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 56609
Speaker 1: Okay, so in 1998, are you looking to try to get out of there too?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was, I was invited to leave by NBC at the time, and I was actually happy to leave; it was just--it was not an environment where I thought I could do my best work, and I just didn't--I didn't like being there anymore.  So I was entertaining several different opportunities--news directorships in Pittsburgh and Washington, DC, and I ended up going with WBAL in Baltimore.  I liked the town and I also liked the Hurst Group as a, as a station management team; I liked what they stood for and really believed in their product and what they did, so I, I--we moved to Baltimore the summer of 1998, and I spent three years there as news director at WBAL.
Story_ID: 56610
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was the biggest story in Baltimore [Maryland] when you were there?
Speaker 2: Wow, we had so many of them.  I guess the biggest one is--and I'm drawing a blank on his name, but we had a guy who--well, there were two.  The first story is Hurricane Floyd.  Hurricane Floyd was, was blowing through--we had this tower, our, our television tower, in back of the station.  The stations were all on TV. Hill, up in like North Baltimore--Northeast Baltimore, and our tower--on top of our tower was a crane that was up there for, I don't know, repair or something, I can't remember exactly why, but as the hurricane was approaching, there was concern that the tower was gonna do one of these (DEMONSTRATION), and the crane would end up falling on one of the stations and potentially the tower could fall on one of the stations.  So they evacuated our entire neighborhood because we were in a neighborhood, so they evacuated all of the homes in the neighborhood, as well as all the TV stations, so we ended up going to a PBS station.  We set up a newsroom at a hotel that was right down the street--the Cross Keys Hotel, and we ended up broadcasting from the PBS station in the market.  Our newscast for, for that particular--those particular couple of days because we couldn't get into our, our facility; it was unsafe--which that, in and of itself brings, you know, a whole lotta challenges when you're in one place, your anchors are in another place, you're only really connected remotely.  But we had a great team and we were able to, to pull it off.  So that was, that was one story.  And then we had a guy take some folks hostage, and there was a standoff for several days involving this guy and, and he had two or three hostages with him, and there was a lot of controversy because the members of the media, we were--we had unbelievable visuals into the, the home.  We could see people inside and we--the journalistic issue that it raised is, you know, how much is too much, you know, how much of--you know, we knew he was watching us on television and we had to make some, some real calculated and well thought out journalistic decisions during that coverage, but that was a big story 'cause he had killed a couple of people and then he, you know, held some folks hostage.
Story_ID: 56611
Speaker 1: You said you had to actually regulate (unclear) (COUGHING) or how you were covering the story because he was watching you cover it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yes, absolutely, absolutely (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--inside the house, on TV.
Speaker 2: Yep, yep, yep.  We were--initially, you know, we were--with our helicopter coverage, he could see where all the police were so we, you know, moved the helicopters out of the way.  You know, it's those kinds of things you don't think about in the heat of the moment when you're covering a story, but it was a--it was, it was, it was a heck of a story.
Speaker 1: I wonder if he, at one point, decided to write a letter, for lack of accurate coverage.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Right, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)-- say, "Hey, I should be able to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--(laughter) exactly--
Speaker 1: Yeah, these are questions yeah, that, you know--
Speaker 2: --that come up all the time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have to kinda think on your feet, so I would guess that as a producer, the more experience you have in different situations, the better you become--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --and, you know--
Speaker 2: Absolutely; and that's--I was fortunate enough that I worked in some very dynamic, large markets, so every day we were faced with, you know, these kinds of decisions, you know, Miami [Florida] every day.  You know, Detroit [Michigan], you know, every day--great news town; Chicago [Illinois], another great news town.  So I'd had--I certainly had had enough, you know--the right experience I should say, to be equipped to make these decisions, but they're hard decisions nonetheless, and that's where you have to really rely on the veterans in the newsroom, you know; not just your, your managers but you really, you know, you look to the main anchors who've been in the market for thirty years, some of the, you know, the investigative reporters who've been in the market for twenty five plus years.  And you've really, you know, you gotta--you know, there are people who are--people who have direct authority, and then there are folks who have influence, and you gotta really look to those folks when you're making decisions like that.
Story_ID: 56612
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I have a note here that in 2000, election coverage at WBAL [Baltimore] was superior, and other stations were watching WBAL (laughter) like the hostages watching--
Speaker 2: Right, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--to see what--
Speaker 2: --Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, was going on with the election.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And this is the election in 2000 where (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--the mayoral election.
Speaker 1: Was that it?
Speaker 2: I think it was the mayoral election.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you also had national elections too, so was it the mayoral election that was the one that you got the praise for?
Speaker 2: Yes, we did.  We, we covered--it was when Martin O'Malley, who's now the governor of Maryland, was running for mayor and we just, we, we just happened to be in, in all of the right places at the right time.  We also--our results were just, you know, a tick ahead of the competition, and we just had some great journalists and photojournalists in the field who captured every moment of that election, and we produced it in such a way that it--you know, there was just no comparison in the marketplace.
Story_ID: 56613
Speaker 1: So you depend a lot on reporters and the initiative of a good reporter?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Look, you're only as good as your weakest reporter and, you know, when you're--when they're out in the field, you know, they're out there by themselves and you really have to rely on them to be your eyes and ears out there, and you have to rely on them to get the good story, and you have to trust them.  You know, I've heard so many producers on the phone with reporters asking, you know, elementary questions and asking, "And are you sure that they won't talk?"  Well of course they're sure; they're out there.  But you know, that--what that comes from is I was out in the field.  In my first job as a, as a trainee, I went out with the reporters, I was out, you know, by myself with a cameraman asking those questions and, and, and learning those things that you have to learn along the way.  A lot of the producers that I've worked with, you know, have never been out in the field.  You know, one of the, one of the things that I did in my newsrooms, when I was running newsrooms, is I made it mandatory for producers to go out with the reporters.  Go out for a day or two, get out of the office, go see what they do, see what their job is, see what their life is like, see what they have to go through to get stories on a daily basis 'cause a lot of 'em didn't understand it.  Whenever we did specials, I would look for opportunities to send producers out in the field to field produce.  The more you can get people in the newsroom out into the field to understand what reporters do, I think the better because then they get it, you know; they, they get it that what they're asking for is impossible so, you know, let's ask for something different.
Story_ID: 56614
Speaker 1: Did you have favorite reporters at work?
Speaker 2: I had a few, yeah; I had a few favorite reporters.
Speaker 1: I'm not trying to get you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--You want names, don't you?  (Laughter)
Speaker 1: I just wondered if there were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Sure.  Vickie Frazier Williams in, in Miami [Florida] at WPLG; it didn't matter what the story was, she always delivered the goods and she always did it with the same enthusiasm--great presenter, very strong reporter.  Let's see, Michael Putney; he's a political reporter in Miami and probably one of the best writers I've, I've worked with.  Let's see--Chris Hansen, who's now a reporter at NBC; he was my night side reporter in Detroit [Michigan].  Chris Hansen and Anne Thompson were my two night side reporters in Detroit; both very strong reporters, very good writers, always got the story with very little, you know, grief.  Jane Miller; she's the investigative reporter in Baltimore [Maryland], WBAL.  I probably leaned on Jane more than anything; she was like having another manager in the room because she understood the market, but she also understood people, and she understood management and what management has to do.  Probably--she's probably the best reporter I've worked with.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I had to ask, so--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Story_ID: 56615
Speaker 1: Now in 2001, you left [the] Hurst [Group] for Viacom, right?
Speaker 2: Yep.  It was, again, an opportunity to move up; it was once again with Joel [Cheatwood], he called me and said, "Hey, I got this--I need a VP of news for our station group. We have seventeen stations and I can't do them all myself.  I'd love for you to, you know, come join me."  So--I was living in Baltimore [Maryland] at the time; I didn't want to move my family yet again, so I said, "I'll do it, but the one caveat is I need to be based in Baltimore," so--I actually had an office in DC [Washington, D.C.] and most of my job work was on the road anyway; that's one thing Fred Reynolds, who ran the group, taught me is that, you know, when you're at corporate and your job is to support the stations, your job is in the field, and you really need to be at a station.  If you're sitting in an office in New York [New York], then you're not doin' them any good and you're not doing me any good.  (COUGHING)--Sorry.  So that was the summer of 2001; six months into it, Fred asked me if I would go to LA [Los Angeles, California]--hang on one second.  Fred asked me if I would go to LA and take over the newsroom at KCBS.  He had Joel in New York at WCBS and thought that it would be a good idea to have me in LA at KCBS, so I did it, moved my--so I, I, I, I, I moved out to LA.
Speaker 1: So what year is this now?  You joined (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--This is January of 2002 now.
Speaker 1: Okay, so 2002--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --KCBS--
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 56616
Speaker 1: I was still VP of news for the group, but also news director--added the title of news director at KCBS [in Los Angeles, California].  So I'm in the job for about three months, and I'm still--I'm not traveling as much as the other stations but I'm working with, I'm working with the newsroom at KCBS.  At the time--at that time, Viacom bought KCAL, so KCBS and KCAL were gonna be one, one news station.  So when that deal closed about three months later, Fred decided to put the KCAL GM [general manager] in charge of both entities and let the KCBS news director--or GM--go.  The KCAL GM wanted to bring in his own news team to run both entities, so--which was fine with me 'cause I had, you know, two jobs anyway so I was kicked back upstairs to corporate and really just focused on my corporate job based in LA [Los Angeles, California].  My family moves out 'cause at the time when all that--all those decisions happened, you know, we were making decisions about moving the kids, and schools, and that kinda thing, so my family moves out to LA in, I don't know, it would have been summer of 2002.  Joel Cheatwood leaves at the end of 2002, and Dennis Swanson comes in as the head of the station group.  So I'm working with Dennis which, you know, seems to be goin' fine, and then he approaches me--we're now in like July, August of 2003, and says, "Look, I want you to--I wanna put you in a station."  Said, "I don't need a VP of news, if I need a VP of news, that means I need stronger news directors.  I don't believe in the position and, you know, I think you're good at what you do, but I wanna put you in a station; I want you to be a GM in this company somewhere down the road."  So I said, "Okay, if that's what you want, that's fine."  But now it means--in my head, I'm thinking, 'okay, this is another move for my family, who've only been in LA for a year.'  So he says, "Well your choices are Minneapolis [Minnesota] or Miami [Florida]."  I said, "Okay, well those are very different choices."  And then, maybe a couple of weeks, "Let me think about it."  And then, maybe a few weeks later, he came back and said, "Well, you know what, I'm thinking the Miami thing is probably not--the need is greater in Minneapolis, so I want you to go to Minneapolis."  Now at the time, CNN had started recruiting me to come to Atlanta [Georgia] to run the Domestic News Division at CNN, and so I had these two opportunities; do I go to Minneapolis as station manager for a company that I'm not really sure, you know, what direction they're going in and how committed they are to, to stations, and how committed they are to me, or do I, you know, take this opportunity to run the most powerful news organization in the world?  So I took the CNN opportunity; left LA and moved to Atlanta December of 2003.
Story_ID: 56617
Speaker 1: CNN is, you know, for many is--what they identify with in terms of the news stations (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Sure.
Speaker 1: --you know, 24-hour news (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Sure, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --played in airports and the bar, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yes, it's the pinnacle, it's, it's the ultimate, you know.  Where do you go from there?  So at that thirty six [years old], I'm now running the Domestic News Operation for CNN [in Atlanta, Georgia], which--people always ask me what that experience was like 'cause I was in that particular job for fourteen months.  I was at Turner [Broadcasting] for three and a-half years, but I was in that job for fourteen months, and they asked me what the experience was like, and I say to them, "I was ready for the job but I wasn't ready for the politics."  There's a lot of politics that comes with a job--with that kind of job, and I got some interesting advice from someone who had held a job similar to that, and she said, "Look, these jobs are all temporary, whether it's a year, two years, three years, you know, five years, they're all temporary, and what you have to do is go in, do the best job you can, make as much money as you can, and make sure you have a nice landing on the way out," which I remember that to this day.  The CNN experience taught me a couple of things.  Number one, you never know where the bullet's gonna come from; you have to make sure that you are managing up, down, sideways, all around.  You know, I'm someone who--I tend to wanna just hunker down and focus on the work, focus on the job, but when you're in those highly political positions, you have to be able to navigate the politics, which I didn't do very well in that situation.  It also taught me the importance of, of bringing in people that are loyal to you.  I'm not saying you go in and you, you, you blow everybody out, but at the same time, you have to bring one or two people in who got your back, who are able to help you with navigating those very political waters.  And number three, you have to look for--you have to be a good promoter of yourself and you have to look for those milestones, you know, every thirty, sixty days where you're doing something that is, that is big; that is--you know, that gets, you know, attention--the attention of not just the people that work for you but the people that you're working for.  Because a lotta times--often times, in those jobs, what can get lost is what you're really doing, you know?  We still got on the air every day, we still covered news around the world better than anybody did every day.  I'm proud of the fact that I was able to diversify the staff there; most of the talent that I hired is still there, so I know I have an eye for talent, and the fact that we were able to do it and do it very well--and look, we were number one in 2004 with our political convention coverage; they haven't been number one again.  So I'm proud of the fact that I was able to achieve that, even despite, you know, everything that was happening politically around me.
Story_ID: 56618
Speaker 1: So what you've experienced, it sounds like a book I heard of called "Swimming with Sharks," (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, yeah, very similar.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So is this a typical experience in the news and the TV news world?
Speaker 2: I think it's a typical experience in the corporate world--the corporate news world; big organizations, big corporations that are, you know--have these, these intricate, you know, organizational structures and relationships are sometimes difficult for outsiders to navigate, and that's, that's what I experienced.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were there for--
Speaker 2: I was running the Domestic News Operation [at CNN in Atlanta, Georgia] for fourteen months, and then I was moved into a position overseeing talent and programming across all of the different CNN platforms.  I was in that job for about a year, and the fact of the matter is that's a job that really didn't have a lot of teeth because--the network heads, they wanna hire their own talent, you know, they don't really need me telling them who to hire; they got into that position because they know a little something about talent, so I found myself running up against walls with the various network heads who I was, you know, really liaising with because they had their own ideas of what their talent should be--as they should.  So I went to, to Jim and Phil [Kent] and just said, "Look, guys, I'm happy to stay here and collect a paycheck and do this for as long as you want me to, but the fact of the matter is you're not really getting the value out of me; you're not really getting as much as you can out of me; I can do more, I'd like to do more."  So they moved me into corporate strategy.  It was a position that I was--or it was an area of the business that I didn't know, that I was interested in, and it also gave me an opportunity to go back to school and get my MBA, which is what I did at Emory [University, Atlanta, Georgia], so I was working full time while getting my MBA, and I was working on a project--we were going to take WTBS which is, you know, Turner[ Broadcasting]'s first station, and figure out what we were gonna do with that locally, and turn that into a--you know, there's the TBS Superstation and then there's a local station in the market--WTBS, and at the time, their programming was the same, but Phil Kent who's, who's running Turner at the time, wanted to turn that into something else--more of a local station, so that TBS could be a separate, completely separate station.  So that was my project and, you know, amongst working on other things with the, with the, the strategy group--and at the end of that year, and after I got my MBA and had finished--completed the projects, I was ready to run something else; I was in a position now where I, where I was down two years removed from, from running something, and I went to Phil and said, "Hey, look, I'm ready to run something; you know, I can stay in corporate strategy as long as you want, but I'm really ready to run something."  And, you know, "We don't really have anything for you to run," to which--I, I saw that as a sign that, you know, maybe it was time for me to, to move on and try something else, take some time off, which is what I did.  I took about a year and a half off which, you know, fortunately, I was able to do to really figure out what I wanted to do next.  I had been in news for now 20--20 years, and was really burned out with, with, with news.  I didn't wanna really go back into a local news situation because it, it had changed so much, and resources had been drained from local markets, local news stations, and I wanted to try something, something different; and that is what led me to sports.

Speaker 1: Okay, so we're at 2006 when you get your M.B.A. [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and you resolved the TBS [Superstation] issue, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right; I did resolve the TBS issue and 2007, I left Turner [Broadcasting], took that entire year off, and started looking again at the beginning of 2008.  And during that time off, I was looking at a number of different things; I was--fancied myself an entrepreneur and looked at joining with a group that was looking to buy stations.  I helped a friend start a production company, I worked on a couple of different website opportunities; really, just doing enough to, to keep myself busy but it, it wasn't something that was sustainable long-term, and knew I would have to go back to work at some point, so I started looking again at the beginning of 2008 and, you know, sports, sports began to kinda bubble up as, as, as a potential opportunity; I was looking at an opportunity with the Golf Channel and then I got a call from Jon Litner, with Comcast Sports Group, asking if I wanted to come and run news operations, studio programming for, for their regional sports networks; there are fourteen of 'em around the country and seven of them are full blown news operations, so it was really kind of an opportunity to marry, you know, my twenty years of experience in news with my love of sports.  I've always had a passion for sports; played sports, obviously, and always really gravitated towards, you know--I would religiously follow the Bulls [Chicago Bulls] during their runs, and whenever we produced specials, I would produce them; I would go on the road with the team and that kinda stuff.  So it was, it was definitely--and when the Ravens [Baltimore Ravens] had their, their, their run in 2000, I was in Baltimore [Maryland] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--yep.  So we produced a lotta specials in and around that, and--so I, I, I always had an affinity for sports, so it was just a good marriage and it was time for me to get back to work.  Problem is, the job's in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], my family is in Atlanta [Georgia], so for the first two years, I commuted because I had a--my daughter, my oldest daughter, was a junior in high school--was going into her junior year.  I took this job in June of 2008, and she was going into her junior year, so I wanted to get her through her two years in high school, and then I moved my family up in 2010--summer of 2010.  So I had a son that was in that middle, you know, between sophomore and junior year; my two daughters were a rising eighth grader and a rising ninth grader so it was--wasn't ideal for my son, but it was, you know, the best time to do it, otherwise we were waiting two more years, and I just--I couldn't handle another two years of commuting.
Story_ID: 56620
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now the nature of Comcast Sports is local sports colleges (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, their regional sports networks, we have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--regional market.
Speaker 2: Yep, we have--in some markets, we have equity partnerships with the team, and in other markets, we have rights agreements with the teams.
Speaker 1: Now these are professional teams, right?
Speaker 2: Correct, correct.  These are the professional teams; so for example, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], we have the rights to the Phillies [Philadelphia Phillies], the Sixers [Philadelphia 76ers], and the Flyers [Philadelphia Flyers]; and we also produce--we have the pre-game and post-game rights for the Eagles [Philadelphia Eagles] as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know the same is true in Ohio with the Cavaliers [Cleveland Cavvaliers] and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Right, right, that's--I believe that's Fox Sports Net (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Fox Sports (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, in Ohio, yep, yep, yep.
Speaker 1: So that's your rival then, Fox Sports.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think--yeah, although they don't really do the amount of studio programming that we do; they really just focus on the live events, the games.  We--what we've done is we've built this, this model in which we program, you know, around the games, pre-gams, post-games.  We also program three live half-hours of news a day--sports news, and we also program an hour talk show every day focused on the local teams.  So really, our goal is to be the one stop shop for all of the news information on your local teams, as well as the games.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in some ways, you're competing with ESPN, but not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, they're, they're national (simultaneous)--yeah, yeah, they're national; we're strictly local.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or in the case of--like a market like D.C. [Washington, D.C.], regional.
Speaker 1: So you got fourteen markets like this--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --around the country--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and seven, you said, that are--
Speaker 2: Full blown news operations where we have that complement of studio programming; in the other markets, we are primarily a mix of the live events, as well as some original programming that's produced.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you've been this since 2008?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--July, 2008.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--June, June of 2008.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.  June?
Speaker 2: June of 2008.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 56621
Speaker 1: So what has this been like?  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: It's been a, a, a, a, a great experience getting to understand the regional sports business, the whole issue of rights, fees and rights agreements, and how that all works.  This is a--the cable business; this, this particular business is a--very heavily subscription driven, it's a, you know, 85 percent subscription revenue business with, you know, the other 15 percent coming from advertising, which is a very different model from, from broadcast, which is all advertising-based; or even a cable network like a CNN, I mean it's, it's heavily subscription-based, maybe 65-70 percent, but this, this--the regional sports business is all subscription-based; that's the ESPN model, and they're charging $5.00 a sub, you know; you're there in 100 million homes so, you know, you do the math; they're at $6.2 billion annually before they even, you know, turn on the lights.
Speaker 1: I would think this would afford you more freedom to do what you really want to do--
Speaker 2: Right, well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--rather than to satisfy a sponsor.
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.  It, it, it does give us the opportunity to cover the teams in the market, to develop programming in the market in and around the teams.  We have--it, it's a, it's a sometimes contentious relationship because, you know, we cover the good and the bad but, you know, as a partner with a team, they have an opportunity--we give them every opportunity to respond and, you know, we, we, you know if it's--you know, we give them the courtesy of a heads-up or those kinds of things.  We do--you know, they are our partners so we have to, you know, be mindful of that but at the same time, we have to, you know, as best we can, maintain our independence.
Speaker 1: Right.  You don't wanna appear to be the puppet of the team--
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: --I would guess especially in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter), being the headquarters of, of Comcast, yes, we don't wanna appear to be the team's puppets, but I think if you talk to any of the teams, they will tell you that, you know, we're pretty independent; we do what we want.
Story_ID: 56622
Speaker 1: And the nation--now, there's been journalists for years, because I've been reading sports for years, have--I guess, a profile of a Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] fan--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --which is the Philadelphia fans take no prisoners (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--No, they do not.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--they're the toughest in--
Speaker 2: They are; it's a --look, this is a town that's very passionate about their sports teams.  When the teams lose, it affects the, the mood of the entire city for the next two days, you know.  The Eagles [Philadelphia Eagles] lose to the Giants [New York Giants] or the Eagles lose to the Cowboys [Dallas Cowboys] or, you know, the Phillies [Philadelphia Phillies] lose in, in the World Series.  I mean people come in and they are genuinely pissed off because their team lost.  It's, it's a passion and a fervor that I have never seen anywhere else.  I've never lived in Boston [Massachusetts], but I hear that the Boston fans are, are very similar, but this place is very--these people are very passionate about their teams and, and, and if you're--if--they boo their own teams.  If they're doing poorly, they boo their own teams; the Sixers [Philadelphia 76ers] were booed the other night because they had a really bad first half with the [Boston] Celtics.  I said, "Wow, wow."
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the reputation of Philadelphia fans (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, yes, yes; they do not suffer fools.
Story_ID: 56623
Speaker 1: Okay, so do you have to really keep the nature of the city in mind as you do these--or the region in mind when you--
Speaker 2: Well, I think you do, and it's all in how you program your, your news.  For example, the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] teams in the Philadelphia market, they only wanna hear about the Philadelphia teams, and if you're telling them a story, if you're broadcasting a story about another team, it better somehow tie back to the Philadelphia team.  So in the Philadelphia market they're gonna follow, you know, the NFC East teams because they, they're gonna wanna know how that impacts their team.  In a market like D.C. [Washington, D.C.], which is a much more transient market, you know, we tend to focus a little bit more on, on national news.  You know, we cover the local teams, but we're not afraid to throw in some national, some national stuff because you have so many people from so many different places in a market like D.C.; in a market like San Francisco [California], you know--again, a very national, international market; we have a tendency to do more, you know, national news.  And in San Francisco, you know, our biggest competitor is the weather, you know.  People don't watch as much television in California as they do in--on the east coast because of weather.
Speaker 1: Right, and I think they say the same about Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 2: That's right, absolutely.
Speaker 1: If the team loses, they go surfing, or they go (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, absolutely, absolutely; that's for sure, so true.
Story_ID: 56624
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you've been doing this since 2000 and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well, yeah, I have been doing this since, since 2008, and earlier this year, John Litner approached me about taking on a bigger role with the NBC Sports Group, so I'm, I'm now overseeing all of the talent across the NBC Sports Group, so that's the Golf Channel, that's the NBC Sports Network, that's the Broadcast Network as well as the regional networks, and what that entails is the, the, their recruiting, the development, negotiating their contracts, and really all of the caring and feeding, if you will, of the talent revolves through my office.  And then the second bucket for me is developing a news strategy for the NBC Sports Network, you know.  We don't have a, you know, we don't have a Sports Center on our network yet, and it would be a mistake for us to go out and try and duplicate Sports Center; we're going to have to figure out, you know, what our voice is going to be and how we're going to cover news on a national level for the NBC Sports Network, so I'm charged with doing that as well.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now at a certain point, had Comcast purchased NBC (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, Comcast purchased NBC Universal, but NBC Universal acquired the Comcast programming assets, so the Comcast programming assets consisted of E!, Style, G4, the Regional Sports Networks, PBS Sprout--I said Style, Fear Fact--or FEARnet, and I'm missing a couple, but there were--the ten or so Comcast programming properties have been acquired by NBCU, so you have, you know, the Comcast Corporation--the parent corporation, and then you have Comcast Cable, which is distribution, and then you have NBCU which is all content.
Story_ID: 56625
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, in developing sports talent for the air, a lot of people notice that a lot of the talent are former players--
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: --and do you develop any--the players?
Speaker 2: Sure.  You know, the former athletes and former coaches, you know, they give you a certain amount of credibility; they played the game, so they can talk about it from a first person's perspective, and I think, you know, in sports more than anything else, that's something that the viewer--the sports viewer not only wants, but expects, so you're always looking for those athletes who are retiring who, you know, you've seen them in interviews, they can, you know, they can handle themselves, they're articulate, they can, you know, they understand how to, how to tell the game, not just play the game.  So we--you know, we work with them; some of them work out great, some of 'em don't work out at all; it just depends on, on the person and, and how much work they're willing to put in.  You know, some of the guys, when they come out, they think they can just sit--they think it's easy; they can just sit up on the set and just talk about sports, and the fact of the matter is it's not that easy; you have to do your homework, you have to study up on the teams, you have to understand their schematics and what they're, what they're doing on a week in and week out basis and, you know, what some of the key points are and some of the weaknesses of the team, and really--it requires them to really focus and, and, and, and study, and some of the guys just don't wanna do that; they just don't wanna do that, and you can tell right away a guy who hasn't, who hasn't done his homework because his information is just kind of generic, it's not insightful at all, which is what, what makes like a Cris Collinsworth, who I think is the top in his field right now.  It makes him so good because he gives you insight, you know, not just a kind of generic insight, but really insight into that team, into that psyche, into why they do the things they do, and he gives you kind of historical references, and you can't do that unless you're doing your--unless you're doing your homework.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right. (Unclear) sometime if certain personalities are on the air because they're a big name and then when you see a little name on there, and usually, those guys are the ones that really know what they're talking about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Right, right.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--some of the big names because some of the big names know, too but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well here's the thing.  Most of the big name guys they have gotten by for so long, you know, on their God-given talent--now look, they, they practice and they work, you know, but there's a lotta God-given ability there and it's easy for them whereas, you know, the not-so-big-name guys had to work a little harder at it, and they may not have played as long, but they were the guys who were, you know, they were the guys who were in the mud doin' the work, and when they come out, it's--when they retire, it's the same kind of thing.  The big name guys tend to be the ones that don't want to do the work.  Now, some of them do, but a lot of 'em don't; I mean, you know, Cris Collinsworth was, you know, he was a decent player, but he certainly wasn't a big name as a ball player; he's become a big name as a broadcaster because he's willing to do the work.  Joe Montana--big name quarterback; he lasted a year, maybe two years in broadcasting, so the name doesn't necessarily translate to the work.
Story_ID: 56626
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a--what's your most successful region (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Boy, you're really just forcing me to--that's like pickin' like which is--what's your favorite child?  I would say that our, our most successful region is San Francisco [California] and mostly because of how much they produce out of that facility; you know, they produced like eighty four or eighty five live events in the month of April, between the San Jose Sharks, the Oakland A's, the San Francisco Giants, the Golden State Warriors, Sacramento Kings--I mean that, that facility pumps out a lot of content, and it's--you can't do that unless you're organized and just runnin' like a well-oiled machine.  They all know what their jobs are, and they all do their jobs to the best of their ability day in and day out, and the guys just, you know, they just get it done.  I couldn't, I couldn't take that much content and put it in any other regional, except for maybe Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and be as successful as they are.
Speaker 1: Now your job requires a lot of travel; you actually go to the regions and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yes, yes, it does.  I--these are good cities though.  Boston [Massachusetts], DC [Washington, D.C.], Chicago [Illinois], San Francisco [California], New York [New York]; we have a small region in Atlanta [Georgia]--so at least they're, they're good cities, and we're about to--we're about to launch a new regional in Houston [Texas] in October.
Story_ID: 56627
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what are your--do you have an over-arching goal beyond this job to--now I don't wanna get you in trouble again, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--laughter.
Speaker 1: --what would you ideally like to do in broadcasting?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would like to--I would like the opportunity, again, to run another network and, you know, the great thing about my career and, and the fact that I've had so many varied experiences, I'm not just limited to a news network; it could be a sports network, it could be a business news network, it could even be an entertainment network; I mean I am such a consumer of television that I feel like, you know, I could, I could run any, you know, network, regardless of the content because ultimately what it comes down to is what we talked at the very beginning, and that's having a vision; having a vision for what you want that network to be, you know, having a vision for what, you know, what kind of voice you want that network to have, what kind of programming you wanna program on that particular network.  If you have vision, you can, you can do anything; you could run anything, and that's, that's what you need.
Story_ID: 56628
Speaker 1: Now we know that you got started out of--you were a trainee and hired as a trainee--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --regardless of the fact of whether you graduated from school or not--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --and you graduated later--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but, so--you know, your talent and your acumen and being able to pick things up, you know, got you, you know, earlier jobs.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How has the MBA affected your career as a credential, and as I guess, a base of learning--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that you can apply to--
Speaker 2: It's a great question.  I, I got my MBA--it was always a personal goal to get my MBA.  I didn't do it with any expectations of it changing my career all that much; you know, had I just--had I wanted to go into, you know, finance or go on the Wall Street [New York, New York], then an MBA would have, I think, been more critical, but it was really a personal goal for me.  Ultimately, my hope is that, you know, it's an extra credential, it's a tie-breaker; if it's between me and some other guy who doesn't have an MBA, it could be a tie-breaker.  You know, what it has helped me with is, you know, being more in tune with, and able to participate in those financial conversations when we're talking about the business, and not necessarily the operations piece.  You know, understanding what ROI [Return On Investment] is and understanding how the business side thinks so that when I'm making a pitch for something, you know, I build in those things so that, you know, they can't say "No" to me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 56629
Speaker 1: Now when you look back at where you came from and everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could go back and change it?
Speaker 2: You know, I'm not a person that looks back; I, I, I just think it's a waste of time, I mean that's just my personality; I'm always looking forward and really, you know, trying to see 'okay, what's--you know, what's next?'  So I haven't spent a lotta time, you know, reflecting and looking back on, you know, what I might have done differently.  Maybe I wouldn't have moved around as much, maybe I would have, you know, buckled down and just finished my degree earlier so it, you know, wasn't an issue for me later in life, maybe I would have fought to stay in the Navy and where would my career be, you know; I don't, I don't know; I had an opportunity when I, when I was deciding television or print in--at--when I was at FIU [Florida International University, Miami, Florida], I did have some interest from the Boston Globe for a--it was an internship, but that could have turned into something more, and I got the same opportunity at WPLG and I chose television instead of print.  What happens if I would have chosen print, I don't, I don't know; I'd probably be like the rest of 'em now, looking for a job.  But, you know, I, I don't, I don't have any regrets; I'm happy with the way my career has gone, I'm happy with the way that my life has gone, I have some beautiful children, I have a beautiful family, which ultimately that's what's really important, and that's why I'm here.
Story_ID: 56630
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, likewise, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I'd like my legacy to be, you know--at this point, if I were to drop dead tomorrow, the fact that I've, I've helped a lot of people with their careers, I have promoted diversity wherever I've gone; and you never wanna be that guy in the room, but at the same time, you know, in every situation that I've been in, I have managed to bring in diverse people both behind the scenes and the front of the camera, and it just makes for a better, a better experience, a better news product, and I'm not just talking about race; we're talking about gender, we're talking about, we're talking about ethnicity, we're talking about religion, we're talking about all different kinds of people because that's what the world is.  So I would like them to say to me that--or say about me that that was--inclusion was something that I really believed in and that I, and that I fostered and, you know, and that I was a good, good dad, and that's, really--again, that's ultimately, for me, that's how I hope I'm remembered most is 'He was a good father to his kids.'
Story_ID: 56631
Speaker 1: Well tell us about your children.
Speaker 2: Sure.  They're all very different as, as kids are.  My youngest, Autumn, is fifteen; she is--she has no filter, she says whatever is on her mind; it is a stream of consciousness all the time and it's a very interesting dynamic in the family because sometimes she says things and you look at her and you're like, "What?  Did that really just come out of your mouth?"  But she's, she's kind of the--she's the spice in the family.  My middle daughter Rachel, she is--she's one, one speed and has always been that way; from very early on--even, you know, when we brought her home from the hospital, she was sleeping through the night within like the first week or two of, of coming home; and that's been her personality, she's very--she's very diplomatic in the way she handles her siblings and really tries to--she's a lot like me in that she tries to get--she, she knows how to get her way without--in a way that you don't know that she's getting her way, you know what I mean?  So--and they're all very smart, very good students.  My son Jordan is--he was a very accomplished gymnast until he got hurt a couple of years ago and, and, and didn't go back to it, and part of that--part of the reason why I think he didn't is he was trying to punish me for, for moving him, which I can't blame him; he's a good kid who--again, great student; just got accepted to Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania], so he'll be going there next year, and he is painfully shy and I'm hopeful that when he goes off to college that, you know, he'll come out of his shell a little bit because I think he has a lot to offer the world and a lot to offer the people around him.  He is a--people kinda gravitate towards him, which is interesting, being as shy as he is; but people, for some reason, recognizes something--recognize something in him that they wanna gravitate towards him.  My daughter Paula is very head-strong; she reminds me a lot of my mother; very head-strong, very stubborn, also very smart, is a little lost right now, I think.  She's a junior at Drexel University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and she's majoring in video game design and production, which is a great field for her; she's kind of a video game junkie, and there aren't too many African American children in, in that field, women especially, but she's, she's had some trouble just kinda navigating and, and, and figuring out life; she's 20--she'll be 21 in about a month--a couple of months, but I think she's on the right track now and, and, and doing well.  And then my oldest son Shane (ph.), he is--he and his wife--he's married, been married for four years now?  Yeah, four years; got married young, but is, is doing great.  He and his wife have a life in Savannah, Georgia, and she's studying to be a nurse and he--despite my attempts to try and talk him out of it, he's going into this business.  But I think he's gonna be on the business end--the sales end, which I, I said, "Look, if you're gonna do it, go in on the sales end."
Story_ID: 56632
Speaker 1: All right, we always ask this question:  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, it really hasn't changed, and it really stems from my own up-bringing.  My hope is that more African American fathers participate in their children's lives, even if the relationship with the, with the mother doesn't work out, to be a part of their children's lives and to really, to really be engaged, because I think that's important, especially for young men out there because, I think if you don't have that force in your life--I think I'm, I'm an exception, and I can tell you that based on, you know, my own, focus group of my neighborhood, my--the people that I know growing up, most of 'em are dead or in jail, so--and most of them grew up without fathers, so I think that that is a--that's my hope, is that African American fathers really engage in their children's lives.
Story_ID: 56633
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there anything else I need to ask before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Now you asked me asked me a question earlier about--was it do I have an expression?
Speaker 1: Right, a favorite phrase (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--A favorite phrase or saying?  Well, there's a couple of 'em but there's, there's one that I, that I really--whenever I'm talking to young producers and young managers, young leaders, they always ask me, "Okay, what's the secret?  What do you have to--what should I know?"  And there's a book that I read and I always recommend; it's a Warren Bennis book; it's called "On Becoming a Leader," and there's a phrase in there and, and, and it's attributed to him but I'm not sure if it originated with him, in which he says, "Managers do things right, but leaders do the right thing."  And what that says to me is ultimately it's all about doing the right thing; it may not be within policy, it may not be, you know, it may not be something that is looked upon favorably at the time, but if it's the right thing to do, a true leader is going to do that right thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, and this is Warren Bennis?
Speaker 2: Bennis, B-E-N-N-I-S.
Speaker 1: I-S, okay.
Story_ID: 56634
Speaker 1: Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  I would like--I'd like for people to look back and know that I made a difference, know that I wasn't just here, you know, killing time, that I was able to really contribute and I'm hopeful that, you know, the fact that, you know, I've had all of the positions that I've had and I've been able to work my way up through corporate America that it, you know, paves the way for others behind me, and that, you know, in fifty years when whoever takes over your role and whoever takes over my role, they're setting here across from each other having this conversation, that the person sitting in my chair isn't the only person in the room; isn't the only one in the room anymore.  And I hope that I have a small part to do with that--with what I can do from my, from my position, from my vantage point 'cause there aren't too many of us who are actually in a position to do something about it.
