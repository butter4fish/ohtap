Story_ID: 260870
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: That's gonna be good if I can do that, 'cause that middle name's kind of like that--Henrietta Ellastein Talbird, and I'm going, Ellastein, it must be E-L-L-A-S-T-E-I-N; so Henrietta is H-E, H-E-N-R-I-E-T-T-A  and Talbird is T-A-L-B-I-R-D.
Speaker 1: Oh, T-A-L-B-E-R-T?

Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, Talbird, okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Octo--you know, I wrote all that down, 'cause I couldn't remember, but it's October 27th, 1928.
Speaker 1: Okay and where was she born?
Speaker 2: In New York, I believe--I'm thinking it must have been the Bronx, Bronx [New York], New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace the ancestors on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: I knew--I didn't know him, but I know my grandfather was from Haiti, and his name was Henry [Talbird], and that's why her name was Henrietta.  And so, I never really knew that side of the family.  My grandmother was born, I know, in South Carolina, I'm not sure exactly where, but Victoria Talbird was her name--marriage name.  I don't know what her maiden name was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, it seems like it says Victoria Pageant [ph.] Talbird, and I really don't know how to spell Pageant exactly.  And I know that she--her mother was Cherokee [Native American] and that her father was of mixed race, black and white, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now did, did they talk about--are there any stories of family history from South Carolina or Haiti that are passed down to you?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Our grandmother moved to New York when she was really young, probably like, I'm thinking teenage, right.  She decided--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to get out of the South.  She wanted to live north though, you know.  And she never liked to talk about the past.
Speaker 1: Okay, did--any stories from the Haitian side of the family?
Speaker 2: No, 'cause see I never knew, I never knew him, I--
Speaker 1: Did anybody talk about why your grandfather moved from Haiti to the United States, or where was he?  Nothing?
Speaker 2: (Shaking head) (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nothing; but I would think of it.  I know one of my brothers told me that his family was doing pretty well.  They were doing well moving to--east.  So he--they--he must have come not--he wasn't born in New York, but he came--they came to New York, so almost like second generation Haitian, and sort of kind of like middle class, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right, so no stories at all that have come down from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Seriously, none.
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) they don't talk about any of them?
Speaker 2: My family is like tight-lipped (laughter); really, I mean, I used to wonder why people, when I was a kid, even up until being a teenager, used to ask me where did I come from and what was I, 'cause as far as I was concerned, I'd been black, Negro, colored, all my life (laughter), and I never really knew a lot about any other sides, why people would want--would ask, you know, so.  And I remember being probably fourteen and asking my grandma for some history on it, and she said, "What difference does it make?"  You know, she just like--didn't like to talk about it so, it was sealed with her.
Story_ID: 260871
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Henrietta Talbird] talk about growing up in New York [New York] at all?
Speaker 2: Not a lot, you know, not a lot.  I know she had a lot of fun; she just loved to--one of her favorite pastimes was dancing, I know I get that from her.  You know, she smiled a lot, had a lot of fun.  My dad [William James] and her grew up together, so they got married really young in New York; they probably knew each other since they were like twelve and fourteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So she liked to dance back in the days of the lindy hop and all that olf--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, she could do that.  She'd do that well, and then the other side of her loved [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, so the West Indian would pop up too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did--I mean, did she--
Speaker 2: I've seen her; I've seen her do some of those dances.
Speaker 1: So West Indian dances or--?
Speaker 2: Well, well, she would teach us to--well, okay, in New York, it was not just so much the West Indian dance--she loved the music--but I've seen her do like the lindy hop dancing, and she taught us all as children how to do Latin, you know, 'cause that's part of New York, too.  Latin dance, so we all at least knew how to do the cha-cha.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right, do you know what your grandfather [Henry Talbird] did for a living?
Speaker 2: My grandfather, I know he was a chauffeur; I know that much.  And I didn't get that from my mother or grandmother [Victoria Talbird]; my brother told me that.  I guess he found some old photographs or something, but he worked for rich families as a chauffeur.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Primarily housewife, primarily, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did, your mother have a big family; did she grow up in a large family?
Speaker 2: She--actually there was only two, herself and her sister, an older sister.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did she talk about going to school in New York?  Did she have a chance to finish high school, go to college or--?
Speaker 2: She finished high school, but she didn't go to college.  She got married at eighteen, you know, and they were like eighteen and twenty or something like that, my mother and father.  And they started having kids (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, is, is there a story that they've passed down about how they met?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I feel like this interview is gonna be disappointing; there so much lack of information (laughter) about a lot of the past, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, it's just, it is what it is you know, so you just have to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know--
Speaker 2: Well, I know that they primarily grew up together, evidently lived in the same neighborhood, used to do a lot of their--some of their studying and reading together; they did that as well.
Speaker 1: So they go to high school together or--?
Speaker 2: Well, my dad was about two and a half years older, so, they weren't in the same grade or anything.  But the person that would have had the most history on that would have been my cousin Rose [ph.].  Now, she told me bits and pieces, she's the--she was like a grandmother to me, and she passed away about ten years ago at 102.  If you were gonna get any information you got--but you got more about the joy, so you know, about how she saw them growing up together and got married and all that.  So, he was like her special--what would that be?  She was my grandfather's, my dad's dad's cousin, so that's why we called her Cousin Rose, but she was like a grandmother to us.  But she really was in love with my father, almost like a son, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --if I had had any sense, I would have asked her questions years ago, she would have known.
Story_ID: 260872
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, William Jasper James.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His birth date is August the 22nd, so let me see, if mom [Henrietta Talbird] is 1928, his must be 1926.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And New York [New York] too, so I'm saying Bronx, New York [New York].
Speaker 1: So is Jasper spelled, J-A-S-P-E-R?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, he's born in Bronx, now is--what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: I just know that my--his mother, my grandmother [Louise James], was Cherokee [Native American] and German Jew.  His mother's Cherokee, and her dad was German Jew.
Speaker 1: And they were from New York or--?
Speaker 2: No, I believe originally from Birmingham, Alabama area.  Yeah.  And then as far as my grandfather, I also never met him, I've just seen pictures of him, and he was very, very, dark.  He looked very African, you know, and that's all I really know; aside from just finding out his name was Jesse James (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so his name was, yeah so this is the famous (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The African Jesse James (laughter).  Yeah, that's who he looked like.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right and they were from the Birmingham area, that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah; in Alabama for sure, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there any, any story in the family about why they moved to New York, or--?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they call it the Great Migration.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --all this may seem like it's obvious, but in every story, you know, we have to kind of--
Speaker 2: Sometimes, there is; there's other reasons (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --just like my grandmother [Victoria Talbird], maternal grandmother ended up moving to Los Angeles [California], she fell in love with California; that's why I ended up being born in California.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And not New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was back in New York when I was two.
Speaker 1: Now what--did your father talk about growing up, were there any stories--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --from your father about growing up?
Speaker 2: No.  No, I'm laughing, 'cause he was--he wasn't shy, but he was really a quiet man, so to get him to talk--I mean, the man didn't even like to dance (laughter), let alone talk.  He liked to do his work, and you know.
Speaker 1: So, he never told stories about how tough it was for him to go to school or any of that kind of stuff that you, that parents talk about some times, and?
Speaker 2: Not a thing.
Speaker 1: Never?
Speaker 2: Uh-uh.
Speaker 1: No comparison between (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The only thing he ever talked about and showed me pictures when I was about eighteen, nineteen years old is that he really wanted to be an artist.  And so, I got to see really tiny drawings of his that he was able to, in minute drawings, make person--portrait, in pencil alone, and they looked very realistic.  So he used to do his favorite movie stars or singers or whatever, and he would--and it would look exactly like them, and he had no training.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so the only time he told me about school, the difficulties when he decided to go to art school or try an art class and went in with his drawing, and the professor wrote all over it in red pencil, and so he never ever went back to a class.  That's the only thing that--one of the things, I would say, that must have really broke his heart, because he never really went back to it.  He never--and it also--so he never painted, so I love to paint, so he--but he--I look at that as where the innate talent comes from, 'cause I'm self-taught.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, he was really--that's really insulting, the professor wrote, just wrote on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wrote in red.
Speaker 1: --on his work--
Speaker 2: Correcting, yeah.
Story_ID: 260873
Speaker 1: Did your father [William James] try to give you any instruction coming up, in terms of art?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't, he didn't.  But we did--the four, well, four of us, well, actually three of us, my older sister, my--one of my younger brothers, we used to sit around a lot, you know, color like kids do, or when my fourth, my second brother came along, you know, we'd all be doing that, but not really any instruction.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, maybe like, maybe little praise, a little bit, like, "That's nice."  Or--'cause you know you're gonna show your parents, I'm sure my mom [Henrietta Talbird] was more in the praise part of, "Oh, that's really nice," or something like that.
Speaker 1: Now did you know he could draw before you started drawing?
Speaker 2: I actually, and I can't tell you why I knew this, but I knew at five I wanted to be an artist when I grew up, you know.  I don't remember why I said it, someone must have asked me.  At five years old, the only competition I had was also I wanted to be a jockey (laughter), so I didn't want to get any taller than 5'2".  I got my wish, and I'm the shortest (laughter) in my family.  So I think (laughter) I must have some power, 'cause my full-blooded sister just ten and a half months older than me is 5'8".  There was no reason for me to be this short (laughter), and I didn't become a jockey (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you like horses then, I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No I just decided that--you know, I used to play with my brothers and sisters and Nate [ph.], our neighbor, we used to play cowboys and Indians, I was always the Indian [Native American], you know.  We used to take the wire hangers and the old wooden clamps, you know the pin--what do you call it--clothes pins, but the ones that you don't squeeze, you just--like that and that used to be my, my weapon (laughter).
Speaker 1: Like a bow and arrow?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my bow and arrow (laughter); fortunately we never put each other's eyes out or anything, (laughter) but yeah.
Story_ID: 260874
Speaker 1: Now did your father [William James] have a chance to pursue any higher education or anything or did he--?
Speaker 2: No, no; he kind of in his own way over the period of years was an entrepreneur to a degree, a really good degree for, I'd say, that time.  Because during the course of his life he's had his own trucking business, and other times he was an independent truck driver, he owned his own truck and do cross city.  But I remember when I was a teenager in Los Angeles [California], he had a professional appliance delivery service, so he had about fluctuating between five and seven employees and three to four trucks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So, that's pretty good for in the '60s [1960s].
Story_ID: 260875
Speaker 1: Now, before you born--you were born, the family moved to Los Angeles [California] right?
Speaker 2: No, it was more my grandmother, maternal grandmother [Victoria Talbird], lived here, she decided to move here, so they kept traveling back and forth.  So, the first four children, let's see, my older sister whose like, as I mentioned, ten and a half months older than me was born in New York [New York], I was born in California, we went--the one other brother was born here, was not even--maybe a couple years younger than me, then we went back to New York, and my younger brother was born.  So, it's like two-two (laughter), so they're really like going back and forth.  And then, when I was six, my parents broke up and my mother [Henrietta Talbird] finally full-fledged moved here, and within months, my dad [William James] moved here too, from New York.
Speaker 1: Okay, so even though--did they get back together?
Speaker 2: No, they both ended up, within two years, remarrying.  And then when I--I lived in different sets of homes, I lived with my mother and father, I lived with my mother and my maternal grandmother, I lived with my mother, maternal mother--grandmother and my stepfather, and then I lived with my father and my stepmother [Hattie Ferguson].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay, so I was like, a lot of different places, and then when I was eighteen, living with my dad and my stepmother, we moved back to New York.
Speaker 1: Okay so--
Speaker 2: And I was there 'til I was twenty-three, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, so you were born here (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --all right, but you--the family--
Speaker 2: Back, yeah, back and forth--
Speaker 1: --yeah, you were raised in New York until (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From two to six.
Speaker 1: --the family--
Speaker 2: From two to six, and eighteen to twenty-three, and I call it my wonder years of growth.  My wonder years of growth were all in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's where I learned, my first school, I learned to talk, where I decided I was gonna be an artist when I grew up and you know.  And then coming back to Los Angeles from six to eighteen then going back, you know, first time fall in love, first time big real job, you know, more in college and more of a grown up, and then deciding to move back here on my own by twenty--when I was twenty-three, I think, maybe a couple months before I was twenty-three.
Story_ID: 260876
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up, when you were a little kid (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  Well, in New York [New York], it's so multicultural, you know, and I always think of, coming from a truck driver father [William James], you know, it's like all the delis and the truck stops to eat.  It's the food (laughter), all the different kinds of foods and variety and how authentic the food is, because there's so many different cultures within New York.  I think that one of the strangest things for me, when I went back at eighteen was seeing the steam come up from out of the streets and trying to figure that one out, with the subways, what was that all about, and never wanting to walk across those.  But when I was five, like in New York, we lived in the Bronx [New York, New York] and then our place was like a--similar to a brownstone, so we had tenants and we--so we had a basement we had where we lived, we had--where my uncle lived, and we had another floor.  But it was on a street that was elevated, so that in my bedroom, you--the traffic from the lower street would shine, so I'd see all these headlights in my bedroom at like, all the time, you know, and sometimes would just lay in the bed watching them.  It wasn't noisy; it was just like you would see all these different kind of color lights, or you'd look outside and see different colors.
Speaker 1: So this was in the Bronx right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, of course, I remember that address, 1314 Clay Avenue because we had our little dog tags back then.  And I went to elementary school and you had to memorize where you lived so I've never forgotten that I lived at 1314 Clay Avenue. And then it's just, it's just a variety--I mean, I, at that time, when I was five, I used to also take like, find like a piece of board, cardboard or something, and there were steps that led down to the street that was below us, and I used to actually like sit on those things and slide (laughter)--I was very daredevil, tomboy (laughter).  You know, do that sort of thing, sliding down to the next street, and always get in trouble of course, because then you come home, you can say you didn't, but the back of you shows that you did (laughter), yeah, I think I drove my mom [Henrietta Talbird] crazy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I always like to climb to the top of the monkey bars with the babysitter and not come down, and just liked being up there.  And then I turned to a real sissy after a while you know, but when I was little I would jump off the side of garages. I did all kinds of stuff.  So I was super woman.
Story_ID: 260877
Speaker 1: What was your neighborhood like?
Speaker 2: In the Bronx, New York [New York] at that time, it was primarily white, primarily white.  I think my dad [William James] was the only, I think the only house in that--our immediate area that was owned by a black person, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was, what were--what elementary school did you go to?
Speaker 2: Elementary school, I'm tryin'--I'm--can't--do you think I remember--I don't remember the one in New York [New York], isn't that something, what was the name of that school.  Probably had a number, you know they have P.S. this and whatever, so I don't remember the name of that.  That would be interesting to find out.  Here in Los Angeles [California], I pretty much know the ones I've gone to here, at least a couple of them.  Alto Loma Junior High, I'm sorry, Alta Loma Elementary School [Los Angeles, California] is where I graduated, I know that; Alta Loma.
Speaker 1: Okay, but--well, what was school like for you in the Bronx, you know, when you started, I mean, what--did you like school?
Speaker 2: You know what, I did and I didn't.  When I look back on that, I was excited to go; it was kind of a challenge, like, walking to school or learning your way to school.  I know I used to like to stop by the trees that some part of the leaf would fall down, I don't know the name of the tree, and you'd open it up, and you'd put it on your nose like you had a little extra nose (laughter) I mean it's so--I remember doing all these little things, you know, some little gluey thing; I used to like to do that.  I know that when I came home from school the first day my mom [Henrietta Talbird] had me in a cute little dress, and I decided to climb the gate to come out home, instead of walking through the gate, so part of my dress was trailing behind me when I got back home.  I remember that--and I still can't believe this when I say this, but I know this actually did happen--in kindergarten, I was held back a grade for a semester, because I didn't play choo-choo train.  I didn't want to play choo-choo train.  So, when I got this pinned--little note, so you go home my mom finds out about this, and the way I caught up and to my regular grade level, where I should have been, was in the second grade when we moved to California.  They tried to move me up, and then I think they did it really in the fourth grade (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's--
Speaker 2: It was all over not wanting to play choo-choo train, 'cause I thought--I just felt it was stupid (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So that's really--
Speaker 2: --to stand there and hold somebody and just go choo-(laughter) choo; just didn't have it in me (laughter).
Speaker 1: That was an offense in the Bronx school.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Maybe to this particular instructor it was; I don't get that, because I can't see where one incident would make a child have to be in kindergarten for another semester.
Story_ID: 260878
Speaker 1: So you were in first--in kindergarten, and then you had to be in kindergarten again in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they held me back, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you were six years--you were in kindergarten when you moved--finally moved to Los Angeles [California], then?
Speaker 2: When we first moved here [Los Angeles, California], I probably was in the first grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you--okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, 'cause I'm trying to think, because I know that--
Speaker 1: You'd be six years old, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was six and--but what I do remember is they automatically wanted to move me up, and I remember feeling very intimidated, at six, in a room full of kids in the second grade; when it came to math, I got tongue tied, and I would have to say it just must have been some kind of fear right then, because later in life, I became an accountant, and I, you know, had my own tax business for ten years, so I don't think it was the numbers.  It was being in a new city with those--a lot of strange people, you know, that I didn't know them.  And I was definitely different than everyone else because I had this real thick New York [New York] accent, so I really stood out; really had a thick, thick accent.  So I think that might have been it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--what--did you notice a dramatic difference in New--in Los Angeles from, I mean, between Los Angeles and New York?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because I grew up around our porch--well, we lived in a house and I grew up--on our porch there was a space that kept all of the salt so it can melt the snow, you know, big old bag of salt, where a lot of things--yeah, quite a few things were delivered to the house.  So, first of all the weather, you know, from my mom [Henrietta Talbird] when during the summer used to love to like hose us down in our swim suits on the front, you know, the front lawn to being all bundled up in snow suits to play in the snow; that's a whole different extreme.  And then coming here, to Los Angeles (laughter), to Los Angeles, and then it being summer almost all the time and noticing that, to me, the first thought I had was that the postmen were a lot lazier here, 'cause they had a cart what they pushed around instead of carrying it over their back, the mail, you know, I noticed that.  Just the lifestyle's completely different.  Well, much--of course, 'cause it's so much more spread out.
Story_ID: 260879
Speaker 1: Well, you're in Los Angeles [California] now, you're about seven years old, I guess--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you were talking about school, now.  Now, so you, you went to the first grade here in Los Angeles, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually, on that trip from--coming back at six, I was here 'til I graduated from high school [Los Angeles High School, Los Angeles, California] and one semester of college [Los Angeles Valley College, Los Angeles, California] and then, the family moved back--
Speaker 1: Okay now, well, how did you like school here in Los Angeles?
Speaker 2: I only got along well in school, kind of--I never had a chance particularly to take the art, it was all liberal arts, but I remember in elementary school [Alta Loma Elementary School, Los Angeles, California] of course you get a little art, 'cause that's just part of it, 'cause you're younger.  And junior high school had one elective, one joint class elective, and primarily what you did is you got graded on how good it was or how many you did, 'cause you weren't really being taught.  So it was really on what you were good at or not and then the same thing in high school.  So those classes didn't really teach me anything, but they were like elective.  They were pleasurable.
Speaker 1: Now did you--so you didn't--you said that from the age of five you thought you'd become an artist, you wanted to be an artist or a jockey (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) A jockey for a while.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I think I got rid of the jockey after a while, but yeah.
Speaker 1: Now what was the motivation behind being a jockey again?
Speaker 2: I do not know; I guess I've always loved animals you know, and when I thought about moving to California, I literally thought about the wild, wild, west too.  I thought I would see Indians [Native Americans] and cowboys, you know, and probably Mickey Mouse too, you know.  But (laughter), but, I--something about--someone must have told me there were more horses something about California, like, about that must've come up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, but, so you know, as a kid you just pretend, I'd do a lot of pretending--that you're riding a horse like going to--your dad or your uncle, you're riding a horse on their knee, you know.  Or you're on the side like a little chair or something, and you're pretending you're riding.  Just all part of the games I guess like with the cowboys and Indian thing.
Speaker 1: Now did you see a lot of western movies on television or at the movies?
Speaker 2: What was out then?  I know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A lot of--
Speaker 2: --we didn't go to the movies much.  I don't think we did that, but something--who was a famous--something, back then?
Speaker 1: Well, all the cow--it's so many cowboys on television (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah the, yeah--
Speaker 1: --those days--
Speaker 2: --yeah that whole--
Speaker 1: --Roy Rogers--
Speaker 2: --right, well, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, of course.  Even later on in life, you know, the Mickey Mouse Club, that were, you know--Annette Funicello and all that and their--you know, had the little cowgirl stuff on, and--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I don't know why jockey, I don't know how that came up.  I never had gone to races; maybe my uncles were talking about the races, I don't know, but I thought that that would just be something, or it may have been a Shirley Temple movie or something.  But somebody had to be riding a horse to make me think that I wanted (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, there's a famous Elizabeth Taylor movie--
Speaker 2: Is that 'Velvet,' was it--
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'National Velvet.'
Speaker 2: 'National Velvet'--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and, something on that order probably triggered it.  And back then we had, you know, Red Light, Green Light, Engineer Bill ['Cartoon Express with Engineer Bill']: that was more like the trains.  I remember watching that, and then with the funniest thing, which really didn't affect me any particular way was, remember Liberace had a show ['The Liberace Show']?  Right, so those are the shows I was seeing in New York [New York] at that age.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: The glittery jacket--
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).
Story_ID: 260880
Speaker 1: --Was your family involved in church a lot or did you--?
Speaker 2: Later, a little later my mom [Henrietta Talbird], biological mom, became a Jehovah's Witness, you know.  My father [William James] was never a part of any organized religion, and myself, I just call myself spiritual, but I'm not a part of any particular sect, or organization.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so, church wasn't, a big deal growing up in terms of going--
Speaker 2: Well, in a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) to church every Sunday and all that sort of thing--
Speaker 2: Well it was the Jehovah's Witness[es], yes, 'cause when I was with my mom until I was fourteen, I went, you know, was very much involved--just part of our training.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, was music a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Younger, younger, after my mother got more involved in religion and things, you know, we didn't have as much fun as about free dancing and having fun and just playing music and that sort of thing.  She got very seriously involved in it.  But younger, I remember more, which probably, most of our mothers our age, were walking through the house singing songs like, 'Stormy Weather,' right (laughter).  I remember my mom doing that--
Speaker 1: Exactly would, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, singing 'Stormy Weather'--
Story_ID: 260881
Speaker 1: Now did you have a choice of where you stayed when you were--'cause you named like three different places you were staying when you were growing up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I was a kid so I was not in control.  Later, at fourteen, we actually went through custody suit and then that was when I was able to decide where I felt that I wanted to be most--where I would be most comfortable.  And at that age, you know, a judge can decide what's the better place, and usually when a child's about that age, they feel that they know enough of where they want to be.
Speaker 1: So, when you first moved to California, your parents [Henrietta Talbird and William James] were together, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, they had just separated.
Speaker 1: --no, no, they had separated--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you stayed with your--did you stay with your mother or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was with my mom and my grandmother [Victoria Talbird].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you were there for how long?
Speaker 2: Well, I was six, so it wasn't until I was fourteen that I lived with my father.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, and you were saying before, when we were, like, looking at the photos that your stepmother was a big part, part of your life.
Speaker 2: So much so that, I hate to say this, I hate to call her stepmother, 'cause that gives another connotation entirely.  To me, she's actually my other mom, you know.  In a lot of ways, including spiritually, she's been my biggest support mechanism in everything that I've done.  So, I've known her since I was six, so, you know, and it's like very mutual, so I don't--she's never treated me other than as her daughter, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's why it's hard to put that other little step thing in front of there.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you give us her name.
Speaker 2: Hattie.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Hattie Marie Ferguson DeSalle (laughter) James.
Speaker 1: Hattie?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Hattie Marie Ferguson is her maiden name, Ferguson (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, Hattie Marie Ferguson LaSalle (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, DeSalle was her--
Speaker 1: DeSalle?
Speaker 2: --first married name, DeSalle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then James.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and was she from New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: No, no, she's from--she was born--I'm just doing this to get it right, 'cause sometimes I get confused with this, 'cause there's two places.  She (unclear) Stamps, Arkansas, she's from where ever [President William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton's from.  Hope, she was born in Hope, Arkansas, right (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Hope, Arkansas, that's right.
Speaker 2: I had to think about that one.
Speaker 1: Okay and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And everyone thinks she's my mom, 'cause we look enough alike that she could have been my mom.  Know a little bit about her, a little bit about her history.  Her mother, who I did get to know, her mother was Creole and Cherokee [Native American], and mom's dad was Irish, you know, so they were down south dealing with that, but they were never--well, she didn't experience a lot, you know, she got hold of--felt a few things, you know, here and there.  Like when it came to the movies and the picture show and stuff like that, her dad taking her or things like that.  But she was the youngest child of all of them, you know, so she has a few more memories, and she's the one that actually remembered what my grandfather's [Jesse James] name was.  Sometimes I could ask her questions and, you know, she'll know, so I'm sure from my dad's information she probably knows a lot more than me and my dad ever talked about.
Story_ID: 260882
Speaker 1: You said you only took a few art courses in school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, they really weren't even courses; they were electives.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you weren't being taught, you know.
Speaker 1: So, nobody was really being taught, what you're saying is nobody's really getting any art instruction of significance or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nobody was being taught.  I mean, no, no you had an assignment, you know, you did the assignment, and you got graded on how well it was done or according to how the instructor felt about it.  I know at one point, I was averaging like a B+ or something like that, and the instructor told me if I did a hundred more drawings I'd have a A.  Well, I didn't feel like doing (laughter) a hundred more drawings (laughter) so, you know, and ironically again, with all the painting I do and all the preliminaries I do, what I like least is drawing.  I love to paint.  But I know that, you know a lot of my work you can tell that it has to be some kind of outline design for me to do it, but that's minimal, then it goes straight into painting it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so a hundred drawings was a bit much for to have a A.
Story_ID: 260883
Speaker 1: Did you have any mentors in school in terms of teachers or other people in the community?  Did you attend a community center or anything like that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 1: --or was it just school?
Speaker 2: No, there's a couple of instructors along the line that were encouraging.  I would say that in elementary school [Alta Loma Elementary School, Los Angeles, California], in the fourth grade, I remember his name was Mr. Maurer, I believe it's M-A-U-R-E-R, I would--that's the--at the point when I was getting ready to skip, they were getting ready to put me up a grade, and I'd learned the study so well that he actually was the first person that had me do any art-related work, and he said, "Well, instead of--" we were studying the Vikings, so he said, "Instead of sitting and studying this, why don't you do a mural?"  So on paper, I did my first mural of Vikings and the ships and--I didn't even know I could do it, but I just got up, and that's what I was doing during the classes.  And so, so that's twofold that at that point that I was really drawing and coloring and whatever that was being put as part of the display of what we were studying, and also that he was the instructor that knew that I really needed to go up in grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is in the fourth grade?
Speaker 2: In the fourth grade (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Four grade, all right.
Speaker 2: And then the other instructor was in the tenth grade in high school [Los Angeles High School, Los Angeles, California].  That--you know, I guess I was always a good student, but I didn't, you know, I didn't have this big need at times that I had to have an A, later in my at times that changed when I became really like extreme, almost overachiever in what I got in the course.  But I remember one instructor, Mr. Jamison [ph.], that, just because he took me aside, and he was a history teacher, black history teacher, and--not black history, but he was a black man.  And he took me aside and talked to me for a few minutes about knowing how much better I could be doing, immediately I turned that thing around.  Just because someone took interest, so in a sense he was a mentor, even for that few minutes of saying that.  I'm sure he has to know idea that he was.
Story_ID: 260884
Speaker 1: Were there very many black teachers in school, or students?
Speaker 2: When I was in Los Angeles High [School, Los Angeles, California], that's where I graduated from, in the beginning was more--we were more in the minority.  Towards the, you know--'cause it's like the Hancock Park area of L.A. [Los Angeles, California] which is a, you know, now it's very mixed, but back then it wasn't.  But you had more doctors and lawyers and families.  But as time grew our school really was everything: Latin, Asian, black, and all the mixtures of, white and Jewish and everything.  In fact, that was my first first: I was the first black homecoming queen (laughter) at L.A. High, so 1966 was the first black homecoming queen.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were kind of in high school society there for--
Speaker 2: Well, I wasn't.  I was quiet, you know, so I was shocked that I was this homecoming--became crowned, you know, but I became homecoming queen.
Speaker 1: Were you nominated, was there a nomination process or they just voted for people they--
Speaker 2: Well, I guess what they did, they did the whole narrowing it down, so then I ended up in the finals and--well, you know what, I was--ended up in the finals I guess, and then they--because--semi-finals.  I remember most about that is that some of that Jehovah's Witness[es] training was good for me, because it made me able for somebody to be able to give me a subject and for me to speak about it.  So, one of the things in the process, they gave you something to talk about and you had to talk about it, so I came up with something to talk about it.  I'm sure, you know, 'cause we didn't do a lot of--we didn't do talent, you know it was more (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay so this was like a more of a formal kind of a process, it wasn't just a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, formal, and then--yeah, and then, and then what happened is then it narrows down to twelve or less.  In my mind--no it must narrow down to six, narrowed down to six and at--in that final part process, like I'm walking home from school, I said, "Well, I didn't get it."  And they had not calculated my ballot, and it--so that, that year end up being more than--it was seven of us rather than six and then the student body votes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, you must have been fairly popular if they voted for you.
Speaker 2: Well, more popular than I knew, because (laughter), 'cause I was--I think, I think the reason why people, if I look back, I didn't have to really be verbal, I think people just thought of me as a nice person, and I smiled a lot.  I was mind my own business, you know, I wasn't miss popularity, but I didn't hurt anybody either.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, so then yeah, so I was surprised.  I was surprised I won something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay so, was this when you were a senior or a--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was in '66 [1966].  I graduated in '67 [1967], I graduated in winter of '67 [1967] so, yeah, so summer of '66 [1966].
Story_ID: 260885
Speaker 1: When you were in high school [Los Angeles High School, Los Angeles, California], what did you see as your future vocation?  Did you have any aspirations, I mean, did you still see yourself as an artist in the future?
Speaker 2: That was still my desire, you know, what my mom [Henrietta Talbird] was trying to, especially back then, how was a little black woman gonna make it as an artist and eat?  So I continued to take liberal arts for a while; I never took art.  I took liberal arts for a while, and back then she thought, "Well, maybe [HistoryMaker] Synthia [Saint James], you could become a teacher," you know, safe, would be a teacher and then back then, summers or summer vacation, you can paint in the summer.  That was her thought, and (laughter) and I wasn't fighting it, because I knew I wanted to always be able to make my own money--been working since I could.  I've always worked, so didn't fight it, just kept at it for a while, went to L.A. Valley College [Los Angeles Valley College, Los Angeles, California] only for a semester, before we ended up moving back to New York [New York].  But then, here's another first: at that time in '67 [1967] I was, yeah, graduating, almost graduating from high school, not yet, but what happened was at what was called Grauman's Chinese Theatre [TCL Chinese Theatre, Los Angeles, California], they never had a black person ever work there before, ever.  Okay, so the word got leaked out to the management of Grauman's Chinese Theatre that they're getting ready to go through being boycotted and some demonstrations are gonna happen and all of this stuff, and at the time I was dating, briefly, this Chinese guy, and they asked him if he knew anybody that they could hire that would be interested in becoming an usherette and box office person.  So, when I got there, and I always remember this, 'cause I walked in, and they looked at me and they all looked relieved.  I could see them all just go like (sighs) because I wasn't black-black; I didn't have an afro (laughter), you know--put a Chinese dress on me and I'm a lot of other things.  Because we were, like, fitted exactly to Suzie Wong dresses; we wore them to here, they were slit really high, really classy kind, even though it was a little money, it was still the highest paying job you could get in that profession.  So I became the first black to work at Grauman's Chinese Theatre.
Speaker 1: That's interesting, that's a--I know it's a famous black actress who played Chinese grandmother in 'Flower Drum Song,' Juanita [Hall] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was it Moore [sic.]?
Speaker 1: I think it was Moore--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --she was in 'South Pacific' too.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but so that's, you know, without me really being part of the demonstration per se, (laughter) what do you call that?  Kind of like easing it out--the tensions out, just because I needed a job, and because I happened to be black, and it helped them.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-seven [1967], okay they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --they never had a--did they have any--were there any imprints--Grauman's Chinese Theatre's where the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All the imprints are, yeah--
Speaker 1: --the imprints of the stars, the hands and feet and that sorta thing--
Speaker 2: Right, in fact, I think the movie that I came in--which movie was it--I used to kid about this, but I think they were playing Sidney Poitier's movie during the time I was there, 'They Call Me Mister Tibbs!'  It was that Rod Steiger movie?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or, 'In the Heat of the Night'--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --I think was the first version--
Speaker 2: Right, well during the--'In the Heat of the Night,' well, that's around the time when I was working there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so fall of '67 [1967] then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Uh-um.
Speaker 1: Okay, right so, was his--did he have a star out there at that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't think he did, I don't--'cause I don't believe he got his Academy Award [Oscar] until 'Lilies of the Field' (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He got it--now that was before that--
Speaker 2: Was that before?
Speaker 1: --was in '63 [1963], I think--
Speaker 2: You know I don't remember if he did, but I know there had to be some black something in the imprints, I would think, at that point, you know, but I don't remember what.  But still during that time we had a lot of, you know, openings and things like that.
Story_ID: 260886
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to meet Sidney Poitier?
Speaker 2: I met Sidney, in fact I have a picture with him.  I met Sidney when I came--when I was back here [Los Angeles, California] again in my mid-twenties when I was doing a little bit of acting, a little auditioning for this and that and the other.  So at an audition--I never got a chance to work for him or with him in a film but I did audition for him enough times, so he knew who I was and he was very encouraging.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were aspiring to be an--to do film (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  I was gonna--everything, I feel like, you know, anything--I was working with a--when I first moved back here, I was twenty-three, and at that time, I was working, started with photographer for a little bit and he, you know, said to me, said, "Well, probably if you just went and took an acting class, you'd be a lot more comfortable in front of a camera."  So I took--went to Inner City Cultural Center [Los Angeles, California], I thought about it, and then I went to Inner City Cultural Center, and then I kind of enjoyed their--my main acting teacher was Glynn Turman so that's where I took acting, I took some jazz dance, other like things that kind of well rounds you out, that kind of thing.  And, so I did some for a while but I--but it wasn't my big ambition, my ambition has always been the art and then being an author.
Story_ID: 260887
Speaker 1: You went to New York [New York] in the early part of '68 [1968], is that (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went to--yeah, I was in New York, well, after a semester of--yeah, after a semester of college [at Los Angeles Valley College, Los Angeles, California] so it was after summer--it was at the end, closer to the end of summer vacation.  And then, I lived first up in the Bronx [New York, New York], in that area again (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you still have relatives up there?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I still have relatives in New York, yeah.  Yeah, which was great 'cause then I got to see the city another way; my first cousin took me around and, you know, as an adult, and we did things.  But yeah, I was there, then I decided to, you know--that I felt then, okay, now I'm stuck here, 'cause I really didn't want to be there, so the first thing I want to do of course is get a job, make back my own money.  So my first job in New York, I worked for Macy's, 34th Street.  And not as a sales clerk, we called us, look-up clerks, where basically you went up to the accounting level floor, and if you didn't bring your charge card with you, you could get a pass for the day to shop.  So that's what my first accounting job was, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then after that, I did that just long enough to save up, and then I went to up-state New York, Poughkeepsie, New York, and stayed with my Uncle Bobby [ph.] and his family for, during school.  I went to Dutchess Community College [Fairview, New York] for a year, liberal arts.  And then I, you know I still--it just wasn't what I was supposed to be doing.  And so, I moved back to New York, got a little apartment up in the Bronx and had a--got a full-time job downtown, and I learned accounting on the job.  I learned accounting by walking in to be a file clerk for a mortgage insurance company, and I was hired off the strength of my printing on the application.  They like the way I wrote (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you have a neat hand?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I have a neat handwriting (laughter).  So I got the job, and in a matter of just months, they were having me do a whole lot more.  And when I was with them for a couple of years or more, and I became the accounts receivable clerk, I learned accounts receivable.  Yeah, I did that.  And then the next job, that's--around that time I went to, I was twenty-one, almost twenty-two, and at that time was my first time out of the country.  I had a Guyanese friend, so for Christmas I, first time out of the country, went to Barbados and Guyana.  And when I came back to New York, that decision was clear, I was moving back to California.  I had had it with the snow and (laughter) the lack of palm trees and the weather and everything else.  So I worked two and a half jobs and saved my money and moved back to L.A. [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you came back in--when was it?
Speaker 2: You know I always try to figure that out--I--when I was--wrote it down to try to remember it, but I believe it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Seventy-two [1972], '71 [1971].
Speaker 2: Yeah, '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Seventy-two [1972]?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Came back here at Christmastime '72 [1972], 'cause Christmastime '71 [1971] I guess I was in Guyana.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In the course of being very honest and excited about moving to California, my boss at the mortgage insurance company started getting real ticky about stuff and wanted to deduct money from me and all that, so I said, I'll just get another job.  And so I ended up becoming payroll clerk for Phoenix House, so I learned payroll (laughter).  So I worked for a drug program, drug rehabilitation out of New York.  It's--you know, and finished saving the money and moved back here.
Story_ID: 260888
Speaker 1: You said when you were here you took classes at Inner City Cultural Center [Los Angeles, California]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now those days, now these are the days of the black cultural, kind of a renaissance in the United States, a lot of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah 'cause that's--
Speaker 1: --artists and--
Speaker 2: --around, yeah it was renaissance, and then it was also the time--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Black Arts Movement, I guess we'd call it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause that's when we had a lot of blaxploitation movies, started or post-blaxploitation and all that, then that's the same time around when [Dino] De Laurentiis was doing all the things on slavery, like 'Mandingo,' and then 'Drum,' I had a little part in, and things, you know.  Then, I did another (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, you were in the movie 'Drum'?
Speaker 2: Yeah, until I hit the floor.  You know how they do that--when you do the whole film, and then they change directors, and then they have to slice the first half into nothing, so for an instant I played, Hulita [ph.], a Cuban slave (laughter), so there just was that little part, you know, but it's still, you did it.  I think it was one of the times I decided that that wasn't for me, 'cause you act, and you put everything into it, and no one would ever see it, you know, and so you really have no control over what happens to what you may work hard at.
Speaker 1: How many movies were you in?
Speaker 2: Just a couple, the second one was originally called, 'Emma Mae' and Jamaa Fanaka did all of those blaxploitation movies, well, post-, and after it came out in video, he changed the name to 'Black Sister's Revenge,' and even in that film, my best parts are all cut out, I started out with fourth billing, but by the time they went for the sensationalism and the fights and stuff, the softer parts were cut out, you know, so, but then, I did that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Can you spell Fanaka's name for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, was Jamal is, what is that, J-A-M-A-L [sic.], Fanaka, F-A-N-A-K-A, you know he did all those 'Penitentiary' films and of all that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He was like in the late '70s [1970s], I guess mid-'70s [1970s]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, close to like '77 [1977], '78 [1978], something around there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 260889
Speaker 1: My first art exhibit was at Inner City Cultural Center [Los Angeles, California] in '77 [1977].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, during this time are you continue--are you still--are you doing artwork--are you?
Speaker 1: During that time, I was doing some writing, I used to do some freelance writing for--'cause I ended up working in the record business.  I did publicity writing.
Speaker 2: For who did you--?
Speaker 1: I started at a small company called Shelter Records, and that's where Phoebe Snow started, and that's where the Gap Band started and, you know, we, but the big rock star at that time was Leon Russell, so it was his company, and we were distributed either by MCA [Records] or Capitol [Records], and then I started learning more about the business and being in the business.  And of course, I started out answering the phones and ended up being the assistant general manager by the time I left (laughter), and then I started doing freelance writing for like, Columbia [Records] and Epic [Records].
Speaker 2: So you must've been a pretty decent employee, 'cause you start off on these jobs (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) I'm a high achiever.
Speaker 2: --and you move up.
Speaker 1: I move up, yeah, yeah, I think what it is--they see the potential what I could do, or, you know, and--I mean, I think at one point that little record company I must've had about six different titles.  I was in charge of art and advertising, and I was like on the other end interviewing artists and photographers, when really I really wanted to do an album cover (laughter).
Story_ID: 260890
Speaker 1: So you're working in a record industry and you kind of bore from within, you get in, and then you go all the way into the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) I keep being invited to step up to another plate, that's what it seems like.
Speaker 1: So you're doing some acting, some accounting, some record (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, some publicity writing.  I was assistant national promotion manager before I became assistant general manager.  So I learned promotion, and I learned publicity, and then I did some freelance writing for Columbia [Records] and Epic Records, like for instance, when The Emotions first came out, I heard the first little cut, and from that, wrote a introduction which really just goes to the record--I'm sorry, radio stations as it comes out, you know, so.  And then I learned things like all of that correction, and getting permissions and copyrights and publishing from, those kind of liner notes and all that kind of stuff too.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in terms of artwork now, are you, are--what kind of artwork are you doing--are you doing artwork at home in your spare time?  Is it like a hobby, or?
Speaker 2: Okay, what I was doing when I started at Security Title Guaranty [ph.] in New York [New York], the accounting place?  One of the lawyers found out that I was an artist, we were talking about it and I was primarily, at the time, painting, putting paintings in my apartment.  You know, I hadn't sold anything, I was just more doing that.  And so he was the first person to commission me to do a piece, and during that period, was all abstract was what was happening, and his name was Daniel Fishman [ph.], and he said that--what I would charge, and I said, "I really don't know."  So he said, "Well, basically the going fee right now, average in the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York] for the street artist is about $75.  So, you got to think of back then, like, we probably made $125 a week pay, okay.  So, $75 wasn't bad.  So, I painted a piece for him for his apartment.  So, this was what you do, you bring it into the office, and the bandwagon thing happens, you know it's like Fuller Brush or Avon [Products], everybody--all the other employee want something, so that's actually how it started.  I wasn't intending or knowing that was gonna happen, but it did.  He loved the first one, so I did a second one, and I probably ended up doing about five for different people in the office.  And then for another office, for someone else's home, and that's kind of took off--became its own little life, but that's first being a professional artist, was that.  And by the time I did move here [Los Angeles, California], back here from New York, when I was twenty-three, I'd left about six unfulfilled commissions of doing pieces for people. Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so, you started--how young were you when you started?
Speaker 2: I sold my first painting when I was twenty.
Speaker 1: Twenty, okay, by 1970 or so?
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: So then, okay, so you moved back (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, nineteen--yeah, 1969.
Speaker 1: --yeah, yeah, '69 [1969]?
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so, now did--what was your style like when you were doing ab--you said abstracts?  Were you using acrylics?  A lot of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I was doing oils and then some acrylics.  I was doing geometric abstracts and some of the canvases were four by four feet, some were smaller.  Then I did smaller pieces that were more scenic, more impressionalistic style, you know of a little scenes or little villages, or one coworker asked me to paint a piece that was in the fall, and it was getting ready to rain, and it was like gonna--you know, all these particulars, and it was like a challenge, so I did it.  Looked like it was getting ready to rain, it was windy, and it was wherever the location was he wanted it to be, you know (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now at this time--now, people were starting to, you know, as I said it was like we had a lot of Black Arts Movement going, you know.  From the late '60s [1960s] through the mid-'70s [1970s] I guess, and maybe it's still going on, I think it's, I think the awareness around black art has been increasing since that time, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it's increasing, even more so since '[The] Cosby Show.'
Story_ID: 260891
Speaker 1: Did you have any idea of who--of what black artists, or any art--did you have any artistic heroes or role models, or--?
Speaker 2: Well, no, because, you know what, I didn't put myself into any category at all, because I was painting abstracts, and I was painting scenes that didn't have people in 'em.  I was selling to people of all colors: Jewish, Italian, black, Puerto Rican; you know, it had nothing to do with color.  So I didn't particularly put myself--I've tried a lot not to put myself in particular spaces or get hemmed in too much.  I know that in my career the art started selling more when I started depicting cultures of the world and it had people in it too, wasn't just a scenic, but I did really pretty well with wild domestic animals.  The late '70s [1970s], for three years, I painted wild domestic animals, realistically, especially the eyes and was invited--had shown in Paris [France] on the strength of just animals, so that's still not a black artist, in particular.  I think I became more known as an African American female artist after [HistoryMaker] Terry McMillan's books and seeing 'Waiting to Exhale's' ['Waiting to Exhale'] cover and that sort of thing and then a lot of people approach me more about that other side of what I do.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's way down the road though (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's way down--
Speaker 1: --from nineteen--from the late '70s [1970s], are you doing still mostly abstracts and then other, you know, animals (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Late '70s [1970s] I'm doing animals.  I'm also, at that time, in the very beginning of like 1980, '82 [1982], '83 [1983], I was doing some portraits for people, realistically, commissioned portraits.  Once again, that's people of all color that I was doing.  And then, I believe it's probably 1984 or so, I went to Martinique and I fell in love with the group scenes, the market scenes, and I challenged myself to paint people without features and also you'd feel their age, their temperament, even their culture.  So then I painted people from all over the world, you know, Tibet, you know, Bangkok [Thailand], Tahiti, all the Caribbean--so many different Caribbean islands, Africa, Native American pieces and black Indian series and you know, not so long ago started a series on the Hassidic Jew, but in the style that I developed that's more like the style that people know for being me, primarily--the featureless, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you started doing this in the early '80s [1980s] or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah about mid-'80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Mid-'80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Uh-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right, so, the same time you're still working with the record company or did you?
Speaker 2: What did I--how did I do that?  You know, I had to learn a few more other jobs (laughter).  Denny Cordell bought--when I went back to working for Shelter [Records], there was an interim period where, almost for about four or five years where I just freelanced everything, and I spent about a year, a little over a year working for [The Walt] Disney Studios [Burbank, California].  And I worked in educational media, and that was the beginning of the computers and inputting, all that, so I was--really, boring, boring job, inputting schools according to zips, zip codes, whatever.  But, while at Disney Studios, I had two exhibitions in animation library of my animals.  So, you know, I actually started selling some work there, and then after--just was all these different jobs and very little money, I had an opportunity to go back to Shelter Records.  I stayed with them maybe six months, and then they opened a private skating rink, and then I helped them put that together.  So, then it was like a private club over in West Hollywood [California].  And I was more in charge of membership and, you know, those--the elite guest lists and all those sort of things.
Story_ID: 260892
Speaker 1: Even during a black arts movement, I mean, black visual artist are often depicted as being more solitary; they really don't seem to have, like, a need to have like big associations with each other and that sort of thing.  Were you part of the NCA [National Conference of Artists] or anything like that or did you know anything about that or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No. Uh-uh, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause a lot of people, I mean when they look at your work, it somewhat reminds people of Jacob Lawrence on some level.
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: But you say you really didn't know who he was, until--
Speaker 2: 'Til someone told me, well--to tell you, back in--since I had no art training, in New York [New York] when I started doing the impressionalistic type of work, with scenes, someone came to me and said to me, "Oh, your work reminds me of some of [Claude] Monet's work and some of [Vincent] Van Gogh's work."  Well I knew of Van Gogh a little bit, but my favorite movie was 'Moulin Rouge' but that's Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec so it's--that's a whole 'nother thing, but I had an attraction to the impressionalist period, so I read about them, and I found out who they were, and I went to a couple of exhibitions.  The same with Jacob Lawrence.  It was kind of like, almost after the fact, and I said, "Oh, okay."  I looked up who he was and saw some of his work, a couple of his exhibitions and retrospectives, and I can understand why people would associate me with him, but it's someone I never knew, or knew of his work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so now did you ever get involved in any of the black arts organizations or anything or--?
Speaker 2: Oh sure, I'm part of even Black Art on Tour [ph.] now.  Then, back in 1980 there was something called Bunker Hills Art League [Bunker Hill Art League], which was a black organization and for primarily getting exhibits together and getting group shows and getting awareness and black history month and all that, and I used to be a big part of that.
Speaker 1: Here in Los Angeles [California]?
Speaker 2: In Los Angeles, uh-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What other artists were a part of that?
Speaker 2: Well, Charles Bibbs, Varnette Honeywood, on--I would say any major African American artists in the nation and some artist from out of Africa or the Caribbean--yes, definitely Caribbean, there were several Caribbean artists--when we'd have these big shows, would all come in town, and we'd do like, sometimes Crenshaw Baldwin Hills Mall [Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Mall, Los Angeles, California]. There'd be a salute to Black History Month, and there would be all these different artists, you know, [HistoryMaker] Paul [D.] Goodnight, Larry Poncho Brown, you know; it's a big list.
Speaker 1: Did you, did you know, Charles [Wilbert] White, at all?  I know he was out in California (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I didn't, I didn't--I didn't know him.  He didn't live too far from here though.  I know--I've had the opportunity, later to meet--come on, [HistoryMaker] Synthia [Saint James], what is her name?  Guess (unclear) skip me.  He was married to a female artist that's a sculptress, that's still alive, she's in her eighties.  You remember, right, it just skipped me right like that.  She also did a commission like I did for the House of Seagrams.
Speaker 1: I know what you're talking about.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm tryin' to think of who it is.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but the only other artist that I--that's one of our more--older artists, you know--
Speaker 1: It's not [Edward] Augustus Samuels?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It's not [HistoryMaker] Elizabeth Catlett?
Speaker 2: Exactly, Catlett (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It is Elizabeth Catlett?  Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Elizabeth Catlett, yeah.  And then, I was honored once with [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks, 'cause we both had done a commission for the House of Seagram, you know, we did that in New York, probably four or five years ago, yeah.  But the artist that I think that one--you never know what simple thing, when I mean simple, I mean, like dumb, but simple, simplicity, that someone could say that might anchor encourage, and back in 1980, Ernie Barnes was one of our guest speakers--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and what I've got from Ernie, and we're still--we're friends now, we've been friends for years, is something very simple that he stated.  He said, what he did was he made a place for his art, okay, so he created the space for his art.  He took advantage of the NFL [National Football League] and that--his affiliations and all that, and he found that niche that wasn't being fulfilled, and so he created that so he created his own energy.  And what I've always--from that, I've always found ways of creating work for myself that keeps me a working artist.  So that's what I took home from that little afternoon conversation, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, Ernie Barnes, yeah he's, he's a--yeah, I forgot all about him being in California (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah, [HistoryMaker] Bernie Casey too is another one (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Bernie Casey, I just saw Bernie about two months ago.
Speaker 1: --former football player who was an artist.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: So lot of artists here.
Speaker 2: There are a lot of artists (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You mentioned from Varnette Honeywood--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Varnette's here--
Speaker 1: Her sister's an artist too, right, I believe--
Speaker 2: No, she did a little bit (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, but in California, there's [HistoryMaker] Phoebe Beasley, but she's originally from Ohio, Cleveland [Ohio], yeah, originally from Cleveland.  There's quite a few, Bernard Hoyes is here, he's Jamaican artist, and the list is endless, really is, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 260893
Speaker 1: When would you say that you got a chance to really do art full-time, or when did your big break come?
Speaker 2: Hm, let me think, I've had--you know you have those little peaks and then those little valleys and those little peaks.  I think--
Speaker 1: When was the first peak?
Speaker 2: The first peak was mid-'80s [1980s], when Richard Pryor bought five paintings.  It was redoing a home in--well, actually it was a new home in Bel Air [Los Angeles, California], and there was fifteen pieces taken there, and between the interior designer and himself, five were chosen.  So that was a peak; prior to that, no, that would be about the first one.  Because then the second peak was, 1989, being commissioned by the House of Seagrams Corporation to do something for black history month and then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did you do for House of Seagrams?
Speaker 2: A piece called 'With Honors,' a graduation scene.  It's in their collection and original lithographs were made of it and were donated to the National Urban League, and they sold them as fundraisers to bring money into their funds.  So that was the first one that--and then, they kind of trickle, you know little trickle things happening.  I did something for the Mark Taper Forum [Los Angeles, California] right after that.  And around, I guess it was around '73 [1973], with [HistoryMaker] Terry McMillan's book, was that Ter (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Ninety-three [1993], ninety--
Speaker 2: --ninety-three [1993].  That was a commercial success; that's something that put me into book covers, although I did a book cover for Alice Walker first--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but it was a book of the month club selection, so the world didn't see it, and that same cover is reissued now; it just came out again (laughter) of Alice's.
Speaker 1: Okay, what book was that of Alice Walker's?
Speaker 2: Well, it's a trilogy, it has 'Meridian' in it and '[The] Color Purple' and '[The Third Life of] Grange Copeland,' you know it's like--I don't have it here, 'cause I gave it--oh, I have of 'em here, yeah, I have one.  And, but what Terry's book cover did is propelled me into another arena.  Authors started feeling like if they had a book cover by [HistoryMaker] Synthia Saint James, they're gonna be a number one best seller (laughter).  So now I have over sixty book covers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So the book that you, that--
Speaker 2: 'Waiting to Exhale.'
Speaker 1: 'Waiting to Exhale,' all right--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and that was a--now Terry McMillan's previous two books, 'Mama' and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Disappearing Acts'--
Speaker 1: 'Disappearing Acts' sold well, increasingly well, but 'Waiting to Exhale' was a big huge hit (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a big one, and then that's when they released the other two again, and I did covers for them when they re-released them and for Japan, I--they used a piece of mine for 'How Stella Got Her Groove Back.'
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: So I think that's probably, would you agree that's when your work got the most exposure, I guess (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's when I really became--not became, I've always been African American--but I mean, that's when I became more known as a black artist, you know.  And they usually thought of me as a woman's artist, meaning that everything, a lot of it was female, women and sisterhood and--put me to that sisterhood kind of thing, which is fine, 'cause that is part of what I do.  But with her book, Terry McMillan also did for me it had that same company ask me to do a children's book, and since that I've done thirteen children's books, picture books, and four activity books.  But it was off of the bright colors, and off of seeing that first cover.  That's how I got my other work.
Story_ID: 260894
Speaker 1: Now, you use a lot of bright colors and a lot of solid colors, and can you describe your style to us?
Speaker 2: Well it's almost, without being too pink or anything; it's kind of a candy store (laughter), really bright.  It's really bright, it's what attracts me when I first go into an art store, those colors and all the cadmium colors, all my favorite, and then I also love the teal colors and the turquoises and the light reds, but when it becomes to the oranges and reds and yellows they're usually cadmiums, which are the brighter of the pigments.  Lot of pieces are multicultural in intent and some of the piece, pieces are really not particularly multicultural, it's just because we come in so many different colors it looks multicultural, so that happens too.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you mean sometimes you're not really intending to paint black people, necessarily, but, we see them as all black people because of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, what I'm saying in one way what I'm saying is that because we come in so many different shades, there's a piece I've done called 'Sisters of Courage,' well it really is, when I was painting it really all black women, but because there's a very, very, fair skinned woman in there it looks like it might be mixed, because of all our different colors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Other times I've painted very intentionally multicultural pieces, I've done quite a few even designed quite a few multicultural pieces, like 350 feet for the [Ontario International] Airport [San Bernardino County, California] and for some schools in a tile and elevator doors, you know, I'm purposely making it multicultural, depending on the project or what I'm doing.  And then other times, it's cultures of the world; they're all very distinct when you look at the piece.
Story_ID: 260895
Speaker 1: Now, I think it was after the [HistoryMaker] Terry McMillan book came out, started to see like prints of your work in bookstores and galleries (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well, how that happened is that the piece that's on Terry's 'Waiting to Exhale' book was already a painting I had.  It was a commission I did for a designer, clothing designer and through Essence [magazine] art it was published as a print, and Terry purchased that print in a gallery in Oakland [California] that was then called, Samuel's Gallery [Oakland, California], and that's when she decided she wanted it for her cover.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it happened the opposite way?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: The print was already out?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so she had had it, I think she told me she'd had it for about a year, and she was unhappy with the art director had for the cover, and so she found me and asked if there was a way we could work with the publisher and use that piece for the cover.  So that cover became an international book cover 'cause it's in different publishers in Japan, you know, in England, in Spain, in France and I don't know how many different places.  All wanted to use the same image and then design around it as the book cover, so it made me an international book cover artist, as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So that must have made you pretty happy (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so I think at this point, now, at what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's when I didn't have to do taxes anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's why I could give up the accounting.  I, the last thing I did as an actress was in the late '70s [1970s], I had a national McDonald's ad.  I was the spokesperson, actually I was playing a teenager in a campaign, and I just started getting my residuals, and I said, enough of that, I withdrew from SAG [Screen Actors Guild; Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists], I'm still a, you know, I'm still a member, 'cause it's so hard to get in, I'll never give it up, but I'm a member which means if I needed to go on and play [HistoryMaker] Synthia Saint James one day, I'm already in the union (laughter).  But, after that I just started just painting as much as I could and that's when I started doing all that freelance stuff in the late '70s [1970s], and I worked for [The Walt] Disney [Studios, Burbank, California], I went back to Shelter [Records], I worked for Flippers [ph.], I did a bunch of different things.  And it lasted until about 1980, when I went to Paris [France] for the [Group] Exhibition [at Musee des Duncans, Paris, France] and when I came back, that's when I had to get a job again.  And when I got that job again, it was accounting, I was a head accountant for a computer corporation, so I learned how to do computer accounting on the job.  And I painted; I painted a lot of commissioned realistic portraits even of the president of that company, so that's when I started doing commissioned portraits.  And, so, you know I worked as long as I could at that, probably was a couple years before--I was always trying to save, so I'd have time to paint and get back to just painting, but even during that period I'd get up at four o'clock in the morning and paint before I went to work.  So I was always still painting, I think the most time that I didn't paint very much as when I was in the record business, because that's not only the eight hour during the day, but that's the night things and the weekend things and that.  Helping put on concerts and that sort of thing, that took the most time away from me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, but after Terry McMillan's book came out, 'Waiting to Exhale,' you were like off, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was able to--
Speaker 1: --able to devote full-time--
Speaker 2: --I became something I never thought I would become, which is called a commercial artist.  I never thought that I'd be hired for book covers or existing work to be used.  I became a licenser, you know, and it was another way of pulling money in was licensing.
Speaker 1: But your experience in the record industry probably helped you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It really did, the acting helped, because the feeling good with people, you know, not that I ever felt bad, but it makes you feel more comfortable and more confident if you go through that fear of being on the stage part, you know.  Then all the publicity and promotion I learned and the accounting all helps me in my business as an artist.
Speaker 1: They really do, now when you think--when you stop and think about this you really have--yeah, you mastered a lot of the skills that you needed to be a successful artist  (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --and really, a lot of the things that, that had the downfall of a lot of artists is not being able to keep their business straight (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Is to keep that.
Speaker 1: --not being able to promote themselves--or you know, and you seem to have--
Speaker 2: Right. You know and just thinking--
Speaker 1: --not how to protect themselves, legally--through a contract or something (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. 'Cause I also worked for lawyers, you know, so it's like, it's made it so that all the work I've ever done is still working with my heart and passion is, is the painting, and it's also writing.  Through the painting I've been able to do more writing, you know, I'd say that because I started doing book covers I got to write some books.  And I have many more books I want to write.
Story_ID: 260896
Speaker 1: --What are your books about?  Tell us about the books.
Speaker 2: Well, right now, out of the children's books--there's thirteen--I've also authored, I wrote three of them.  The others are other people's manuscripts that I brought to life by co-authoring, deciding, you know, the illustrations and deciding even where, where it was gonna be.  Where--even what country or if they were in New York [New York] or if they were in the Caribbean, whatever and with my animal books I've done a couple of animal books, Tanzanian and others, and I get to make up the characters almost like an animation.  Then I've got a few books of poetry and prose.  One point, I wrote a multicultural cookbook.  And, I sometimes have to think what do I have, I mean I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What are the titles of your books?
Speaker 2: Okay, well one poetry and prose book is called, 'Girlfriends,' and another one is called, 'Can I Touch You?: Love Poems and Affirmations.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then there's a book called, 'Mother's Love,' there's--which I can give you a list so--of 'em, I've got a list of all this bibliography.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, I've got even like the little book behind you, Kwanzaa lift-the-flap book called 'It's Kwanzaa Time!,' you know really for little kids and I just signed last week to write a art marketing book for artist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Which is to me, sounds really boring, you know, it sounds really boring, but what I like about it is that the publisher and editor, I've known her for a little while, and she's watched what I've done.  She said, "[HistoryMaker] Synthia [Saint James], all I want you to do is write what you learned from your experiences."  So it's not going to be one of those textbooks, you know, it can be used like it's text but, I mean, it's gonna be, this happened to me therefore I learned this, there's another way I should do it next time, or is this the way I now handle it?
Story_ID: 260897
Speaker 1: How long does it take you to complete a painting, on average?
Speaker 2: That's a tricky question, because if it's a little painting like this and it's acrylic--that dries quick--and I'm working what I call full-time on it, meaning I'm at least giving it six hours a day, I could probably do that in a few days, depending on how intricate it is.  That same size painting as oil might take twice as long, because the fact that it's oil.  Or it might even take four times as long.  Then, if I go to like a large or an average piece like thirty by forty [inches], and it's acrylic, I'm gonna say, maybe a couple of weeks if it's full-time; if its oil, three to four months.  So it just really depends, 'cause with the oil's different stages of drying, or what the subject matter is.  And with the acrylic, it's the fact that there's generally six coats of paint, so even if I am, even if it's drying fast, if it's a big piece like this piece here it probably took me two months to do that.
Story_ID: 260898
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about the big Kwanzaa stamp controversy (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, God (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not so much as a controversy--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah--
Speaker 1: --but as a tremendous opportunity, this is a--you designed the country's first Kwanzaa stamp--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and, tell us about how you got a chance to do that, and?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say that it kind of is the wonders of the Internet and research.  I began to really realize that a lot as things have come to me at different times.  I know I've done a lot of work, but in researching Kwanzaa, the U.S. Postal Service came across a children's book author that I had done the cover of her Kwanzaa book ['The Seven Days of Kwanzaa,' Angela Shelf Medearis] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, now, what--?
Speaker 2: --so I'd done a book cover, and I'm--
Speaker 1: Now, what's the author?
Speaker 2: Angela Shelf Medearis is her name, and I don't have in front of me the exact name of the Kwanzaa book, but that was the--they based it only on that; they didn't know anything else about my art.  When they called me, 'cause they actually got my phone number and called me, 'cause later I asked how they got my phone number, because a good little New York [New York] girl keeps her phone number unlisted, so I don't understand how they got my number.  But then I said it was the government, they can get your number.  So, anyway, they called and asked me if I would and being the follow-up person that I am from the business of advertising promotion, I sent them a media kit, and then it was so sweet when the designer called me back, and she said, "Do you have time to, you know, to design a Kwanzaa stamp," and I just smiled and said, "I'd make time to do that."  So we went through the process and the interesting part of the process is that I had to paint something really small, so it was like 4.5 by 5.5 inches of a painting, with detail to it, but still enough simplicity that the 32 cents can show clearly.  So they--she sent me a couple a little formats, and I did two paintings, and the one that became the Kwanzaa stamp is based on a painting I did for my book that I wrote and illustrated called, 'The Gifts of Kwanzaa' [Synthia Saint James], so that's where that came from.  And then, in that same week, I got a call from Girl Scouts of the USA to ask me to do their thirty-fifth anniversary image poster, so I called that my all-American week, you know, the Girl Scouts and the U.S. Postal Service.  I'd have to say, I was so excited about the stamp--to even believe that you could pick up the phone and call somebody back and that you got this commission, you know, and the opportunity to do the first African American holiday stamp--it's really, you know, with that--it's the first, that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Artist normally compete to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --for a chance to do a postage stamp, is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --there was a scene in 'Fargo' where the husband of the protagonist [Marge Gunderson], Frances McDormand's husband, Norman, Norm [Gunderson], he paints decoy ducks, and he's been submitting his ideas to the U.S. Postal Service, and they finally pick a three cent, and he's like halfway depressed and halfway excited, I mean--but it's competition, right?
Speaker 2: Well I, in this case, it must not have been.  I mean, they must have done some research and decided--I don't know if it had to do with time, they were putting out a whole holiday series, and I didn't compete, and I never had submitted myself to them before.  So that's where, let's say, that was the beauty of the Internet that they did research and they found Kwanzaa, and I happened to be the artist that they chose to call.
Story_ID: 260899
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about the controversy part (laughter).
Speaker 2: The controversy part I wasn't real clear on at first, well, because I just knew after right after first issue, I did over thirty-five interviews, and one particular day I did about eighteen to twenty, and they were all telephone but through radio stations through different parts of the country, and a couple times they were trying to pull me into some heated debates about the [Kwanzaa] stamp and about the flag and if it really was a [Marcus] Garvey flag or the flag was wrong and the this was wrong and the colors were in the wrong position.  But myself, as an artist, I had no idea of any of that, I just knew that in reading [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Maulana] Karenga's book and basing my book for children on--to get his principles right, that those three colors, you know, red, black and green, were the important colors and what they symbolized.  So as an artist-designer, I just went and designed a flag that I thought would fit in well.  It was later changed, and they were able to do it technically on their side, design-wise, and then they sent me the actual painting back, and I changed the stripes so that they could hang it where they keep the originals.
Speaker 1: Came to three, three bands of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Three bands, yeah.
Speaker 1: --black, red and green?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well, now did you go on tour with the--I know they opened their receptions in various cities (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, what I did was, I was really selective about how much I wanted to do, because I noticed that it was really a lot that they wanted me to do, and I kind of wanted to do quantity not quality--no, quality not quantity, and after a while, when they were kind of indecisive about where they wanted to do--where they wanted to do that, I just really--I believe I told them that I would do four; I would do four travel engagements.  So, what I did do: I did, when Detroit [Michigan] opened an African American museum there, we had a pre-unveiling there.  We had a pre-unveiling in Winston-Salem [North Carolina] at the university [Winston-Salem State University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] there, Diggs Gallery; we had a big reception.  Was able to get it done here in Los Angeles [California], where at the same time I was having an exhibit at the Natural History Museum [of Los Angeles County, Los Angeles, California].  So we had the big extravaganza-gala there, where that it was blown up to about 54 by 56 feet and covered in red, and it was the backdrop of the stage and at a given moment--cue--then it came up for the, for the public to view it.  And then right after that I went to and did a small scale one in Busch Gardens in [Tampa] Florida, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was a--there's some celebrity attached to this project, I guess in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, there's a lot, I mean, a lot of excitement.  There was a lot of markets that wanted me to come there to unveil it, quite a lot, but we really try to bring it here, and I think because of, not only be the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles is the place to have it, but because Dr. Karenga lives here, I live here, you know, and it's a big community here, so it seemed like the right place to have it, the official one.
Story_ID: 260900
Speaker 1: You've branched off from just painting, now, to designing mosaics, I mean, and work that had been--certain works had been turned into mosaics (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and stained glass windows, and tell us about some of that work.
Speaker 2: Well, I can't remember when I first started thinking on another scale of some other things I'd like to do.  I don't ever want to fabricate it, I don't want to become a stained glass artist.  I'd love to design it.  So that's what's so wonderful about that, now you can design something and someone that knows what they're doing in that medium can actually fabricate it.  So, my first commission came through the curator at the Natural History Museum [of Los Angeles County, Los Angeles, California], shortly after the [Kwanzaa] stamp, and that was in 1997, and it was 150 feet long by almost 3 feet high.  And then we did it, like twenty-five foot increments, and I designed a scene for the international baggage claim for Ontario [International] Airport [San Bernardino County, California], which is here in California.  So, in international baggage claim, I've got the whole--that whole section where you go pick up your luggage.  So, that was my first opportunity to do something like that.  When I first got the job I was completely floored, because I couldn't see how possibly I could design 150 feet, 'cause all I could think of was painting, since I'm a painter, and it was explained to me then how it could become ceramic tile.  And I--my fabricator, Ricardo Duffy, did like a puzzle almost. I drew it to scale, I color coded it, gave him the color chart, and then he cut it out, after he, you know, laid it and covered--cut it out, and he glazed each of my colors, which was about twenty-five colors to match whatever area I had that for.  And it was a multicultural image of people traveling more or less; more or less what you would see in the airport.  And then, then the second job came as a--actually almost the same time, but it was, but it was a painting I did for a hospital [Glendale Memorial Hospital and Health Center, Glendale, California] nearby.  Did a painting for the Woman's Center, which is actually where you go to view the babies.  And I situated it where that the babies, newborns, would actually be looking at the painting while you were viewing them, so they gave me that opportunity, choice, there.  Then came the elevator doors I did for--did six 9 by 4 feet elevator doors, and that design was etched into the metal, and then my colors filled into the grooves, so that was a whole 'nother way of thinking about painting, where that my bright color wouldn't be everywhere it would just be the outline, of the face, of the clothing.  And then I was able to, for West Tampa [Branch] Library [Tampa, Florida], which is being unveiled April of 2005, stained glass for an old [Andrew] Carnegie-restored library, West Tampa Library, and each piece for the windows is approximately 54 inches high by 22 inches across, so I've done that.  And then the stained glass person fabricated it for me--sent me glass, I was able to choose a lot of the glass.  And most recently, I did a piece for Gibson, Dunn [&] Crutcher [LLP, Los Angeles, California], it's a eight hundred lawyer firm that's international, and it's going to the Wonders of Reading [The Wonder of Reading] program for children, 4 by 7 foot ceramic tile piece, for an elementary school [Cowan Avenue Elementary School, Los Angeles, California], where they refurbished the library and brought in--they're bringing in all new books, just redoing it for the children.
Story_ID: 260901
Speaker 1: You shared with us, before we started rolling, when we were talking some of your concerns about public art, and you know, just an artist's view of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Of public art.
Speaker 1: --public art.
Speaker 2: Well, it's kind of in ways difficult, because it kind of can break the creative spirit, depending on how it's handled.  I've been fortunate in all of the ones that I've accomplished and finished, I've really had complete support and given free hand, and I didn't have to go through five and six different committee meetings with, even where the project was gonna be.  Like for instance, let's say there was a library I was supposed to do something for in Los Angeles [California], and by the time I got to the third meeting, and I'm meeting with the community and the people and what they wanted, it became like a lot of time was being wasted and a lot of the creative juices were being lost, because then it became like a dictation of what everybody else wanted, but everybody else wanted something different, you know.  So a lot of times in public art, you have to be ready to try to please your clients, rather than be able to just, from your heart, come up with something and present your best.
Story_ID: 260902
Speaker 1: Do you have a certain philosophy of art that you have, or--I mean, do you have a philosophy of what black art is, or what it isn't, or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, I think that--I feel that, in most cases, all art comes from inside the spirit, inside a person's spirit and what--and the creative juices and what they're able to give and want to give.  I've been told that my art is really healing.  Healing--and one area of healing is that, because of the brightness, it--people that live with my art have told me that it makes them feel good, just because of the brightness.  I've also been told that, by one of my girlfriends whose grandson had Down syndrome, that whenever he was in a room with my art, he didn't cry; when he was somewhere else, he cried.  My reiki master had taught me some years ago--reiki--said that I don't really need to go to second degree reiki, where I'm actually healing people and healing at distances and spending so much time hands on, because she says the reiki is in my art, that's where I do my healing.  So for me, that's the kind of--what I'm doing: I'm sharing, I'm sharing history, I'm sharing cultures of the world, I'm interpreting words for people through images, you know, or conveying my words in--through images, and this is sharing, so there's that--that's the kind of fulfillment that I feel really special.  The public art is nice, because so many people get to see it, but then you go, and you turn, and you look on another table of any of my book covers--well, how many people have seen those?  And then when you're touching children with children's books and teaching them to use their imagination and to read and to get involved in books, even encouraging them to be painters, if that's what they want to do--all of those things together.  So, there's no philosophy particularly, except, I think, really of giving and being able to have the opportunities to be able to give.
Story_ID: 260903
Speaker 1: You never really formally studied art, I mean, as such not in college level and that sort of thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, un-uh.
Speaker 1: They--there's theories about color and what color--how certain colors affect people, and that sorta thing, you know, there's a theory at one time that you paint all the grade schools green, this industrial looking green--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --that it would chill the children out, and it would relax them or something; I mean, I don't know, do you have any thoughts about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I've heard some of those theories of, even like, colors for all that would calm you and colors that would do this for you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Red would get you excited--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, all of those things.  But I don't really know any of them; I don't know the rules. I do know that one of my closest friends that's also an artist, Charles Bibbs, did take all of the formal training and one thing he shared with me that made me feel particularly good, 'cause he's an incredible artist, is that he started painting and using colors that he was told not to use together, because he saw how wonderfully I did it, and it looked great.  So some of those theories of what goes with each other, what doesn't is not--that's somebody's theory, I think that's somebody's opinion, you know, and I, for that reason I'm glad that I'm self-taught, because I don't have all these rules and regulations.  I just do what comes out of me, you know.  I'm sure some of the first paintings fell off of whatever I painted them on, 'cause I didn't know not to put oils on foam cord (laughter), but, you know, but it's really--I'm really happy that I've never had any training.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, formal training, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know there's so many stories of black people that've accomplished--and other people too--that have accomplished things out of really not knowing what they couldn't do--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and they just went on and did it anyway.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So you're (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That just changes advancement, you know that just changes up what you can do or what people feel.  They don't feel inhibited.  The other thing I learned, and I'm not putting down art education at all, 'cause it's really useful.  The instructors, if they're not so busy trying to make you like them, or let you be your own free spirit.  Like, I really believe that art shouldn't be graded, I don't think it should be, you take a painting class and you should be graded.  I think it should be a pass or fail.  If you didn't do the work, because then it makes people try to accomplish what the instructor's gonna think is nice.  Because out of the artists-actually, friends of mine, that were able to take art in school, where I wasn't, where they may have minored in art, none of them paint, because it became a grade, and none of them who's ever passed those schooling has ever lifted a brush to do anything; maybe one or two times.
Story_ID: 260904
Speaker 1: Tell me if you've encountered this, but I heard a gallery owner tell me, you know, in person, you know, to my face--they said that they are not inclined to exhibit the work of people that have not gone to school to get their M.F.A. and that sort of thing, because they thing that these other people have paid their dues, why should someone who hasn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --paid their dues get a chance, you know, to exhibit, and they, you know, they were disdainful of so-called naive artist and some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --people from, you know, what--have you ever encountered that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: I--well, let me see.  I know that in the beginning when, wanting to deal with galleries and museums, that I was a little nervous about the fact that I was self-taught.  I couldn't help, because I hadn't, you know, had the--enough accomplishments to feel more confident, more confident.  I had people buying my art which was a very boost--very big boost because people wanted it, which is more important to me that people wanted it.  But I have had some experiences.  One experience, that is similar to what you're saying, one experience is that years ago when Mayor [Tom] Bradley was the mayor of Los Angeles [California], through his offices, they just set up an appointment for me to go to the [Los Angeles] Municipal Art Gallery [Los Angeles, California] to show my work to see if they would exhibit me.  Well I, and the woman was a critic for the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times] too.  I think she was angry that she had to see me, and it wasn't her choice, so she was extremely rude.  I took off from regular work, and I put paintings up against the wall for her to come in and see, and so it's a long wall like this in the museum, and she purposely went through her office this way and came around that way, glanced down at the paintings and said that, "You need to go to school; you're painting just to please people."  'Cause I said, I said, because, "I paint, and I do have clients."  She said, "Well, that's nice."  And then she said, really, pretty racist little slur there, "Well, when you get your Cadillac, you come back and take me to lunch."  Okay, okay, what I've thought about that, well, I know several people that probably that would have just really, really interrupted their art career.  They may not have even painted again, 'cause I know when my father [William James] got those red marks across the paper, he didn't go back to a class.  What I felt is I had already such strong conviction in what I was doing, and had done it long enough, 'til that only impelled me the more to you know, "I can't listen to what she says."  To the point where I was angry, I was really angry.  But I didn't even want to follow it up, I'm sure I should have followed it up and let them know how I was treated and all that, but I didn't want to make it into an issue.  So, I let that go.  Another time, prior to her, when I was just, around the late '70s [1970s], which I'm gonna put in my art marketing book of things not to do, I decided to pack up my little car and visit three locations, three galleries, one was an art mart that sells art supplies but also has a gallery section and two were galleries in different sections of Los Angeles.  I went into the Aaron Brothers art mart, and I was so wonderfully treated by this person.  I had no appointment--you do not go someplace without an appointment--I had no appointment; he explained to me the techniques, how they get their art and how they can sell them at the prices they do, and he also let me know that he loved my work but he was sure that not would be something that they would invest in, because of how they make their money, they have people in foreign countries paint up like almost assembly line, ship the paintings in and hang them up in nice frames and they--that's how they sell their art.  So, I felt kind of good, because at least I was being taught something and treated kindly.  The next gallery I went to was in West Hollywood [California], and I was really huffily told that they only carried fine art, and my art was not fine art.  So, from there I had one more place to go, and I said, "Well, you started this thing [HistoryMaker] Synthia [Saint James], so finish it."  So I went to a gallery in Santa Monica [California] by the beach.  And I went in, and the director there, owner, looked at my art and really liked it, and he said, "Your art is too good for our gallery, but I'd love to hang a few."  Okay, lesson from that is (laughter), don't ever go to a gallery--don't go anywhere without an appointment; send them slides, research the galleries before you go there, you know, those kinds of points, because then you don't get your feelings hurt or crushed or go on roller coaster rides.  You know, there's a professional way of doing everything.  On the other hand, there was no reason for that particular person to be so rude, you know.  So, that's the only thing close to that, as far as, most people look at me, and they raise their eyebrows when I say I'm self-taught, you know, but it's something I'm proud of, if you go back into a lot of history, a lot of the people that have made major achievements were all self-taught.
Story_ID: 260905
Speaker 1: It's beyond me to tell the difference when, you know, I mean you--I don't know how anyone can, like, look and tell the difference, these--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in terms of whether someone is self-taught or not, I mean, it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, and the paying your dues is--that's another form of saying, "Well, suffer a little more--you don't have to go to school, but you better go to school if you want to be in my gallery--"
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: --spend (laughter) all this money just so I can--
Speaker 1: Maybe presentation might be the--or the approach to dealing with the art might be the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the tell in terms of who's had training and who hasn't, maybe that might be the only thing, I--you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) how somebody approaches a gallery, or how somebody, you know, talks about their work, you know, that might be the difference.  But other than--
Speaker 2: And then it's just opinions.  It's like the whole thing with the French impressionists: the established artists had disdain for them.  They called it mockery; they called it all kinds of names, because it was different, you know.  It wasn't accepted; it wasn't dull; the colors weren't drab, you know.  There's all those schools of art.  I don't think we have 'em as bad, but sometimes we do.  Another artist was telling me that what they call our work, he said they have a new name for our work, meaning, not primarily black artist, but our art, he says they call it popular, because we sell a lot of it, but it's still not academia.
Speaker 1: There was a controversy a couple of years ago, I believe, at Studio Museum in Harlem [New York, New York] there was an exhibit of black artists whose work was primarily on posters in bookstores, you know, and I think it was a controversy of whether it was fine enough to be exhibited or not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fine. Right.
Speaker 1: Or something like that; do you remember that?
Speaker 2: No, I don't, but I'm thinking that once, University of Utah [Salt Lake City, Utah] did a show, maybe twelve years ago, and what they wanted was my work on paper, just called it 'Works on Paper.'  They were posters and prints.  I thought that was a great way to do it, but I don't think what it's on makes it less value to be exhibited; poster art is storytelling art.
Story_ID: 260906
Speaker 1: --Do you have any advice for young people, aspiring artists?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, my main word is research.  Definitely research, because no matter what you're doing you've got to do a lot of research.  There's--only reason why, or one of the primary reasons why I work, and continually work, is 'cause I do so much research, see what's out there, what can be done, what market I can create for myself, like when I do my--I have a whole non-profit sector that I work with.  I have a whole 'nother cost that I do with them, and I came up with it on a walk.  You know, another way to approach art that helps them and helps me, and we're both making money out of doing it, and then helping other people at the same time.  Research, I mean, is--one of my first exhibits, I researched all art magazines and trade magazines to see how to go about this, how to go about that.  Research in books about art marketing, art publishers, what--you being paid for this, licensing.  So you kind of get an idea of what you want to go after, you know.  And to this day I research.  I'm constantly researching to see what else I can do to make it in it.  The other thing is really takes a lot of determination; it's not something that someone's gonna bang down your door and come find you.  You've got to make yourself available, putting yourself in group shows or invitational shows and starting to build some kind of a resume or exhibition listing, so people can see you.
Story_ID: 260907
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, one of them we were addressing in a show just recently, and that is the--see, on the flip side is the lack of art in schools.  It's being more and more taken out of the schools.  Not just for the instruction side of it, but for the fact that art is very important to life and well-rounded growth, you know, and look at that.  And, when I look at that, I think of, as our communities, what we need to do with our children is get them out to art-related functions, community and cultural functions, that they actually see what we're doing or what can be done, meaning, art shows, museums, theater, dance, anything that has to do with us is, so--'cause, otherwise, we're losing it, you know.  And it's taken so hard to begin to build some self-esteem in so many areas 'til, I think, knowing there's all these possibilities and people are making it at different things is helpful, in that we have choices.

Speaker 1: They're all looking up, and I think it's, it tends to--there's a certain amount of dignity, I think, with that that I think impresses people, it makes people feel (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To kind of uplifted, yeah--
Speaker 1: --positive about your--
Speaker 2: I think the only, the only piece I ever--well, let's say that stands out in my mind, that I ever did with someone little more looking down was because it was part of a play.  It was 'Miss Evers' Boys' [David Feldshuh] and after reading bad blood and what this play is about, they couldn't look particularly happy.  They were going through this disease and all that, and it was one of the most difficult pieces I had to do, because of having to do something more downtrodden, you know, but yet and still was a very popular piece, for a poster, it was very popular--sold out.  But what I try to convey is self-esteem, pride, you know, dignity, when I paint.  When I paint people, if they're not looking up, there's some sense of it.  For instance, in this one, she's enveloping: there's some kind of nurturing going on.  But it's primarily self-pride, dignity and all the -hoods: brotherhood, sisterhood, yeah.
Speaker 1: A sense of community.
Speaker 2: Yes, definitely a sense of community, yeah, and the strength in community, yeah.  So that naturally started happening, I mean, I didn't, I mean, it was not really conscious.  I noticed a trend after a while, and I think I noticed it more when people started pointing it out to me (laughter).
Story_ID: 260909
Speaker 1: Has anyone ever pointed out similarities in your work to African art, you know, traditional African art?
Speaker 2: Well, I've had more--well, I've had African people and a couple collectors tell me that I really captured the country well, and I've never been there so that was wonderful to hear.  I think I've gotten more of a similarity to, not a particular artist, but more people think of me as a--my work looks more Caribbean or Haitian; Haitian primarily, come up with Haitian, even though it doesn't look exactly that.  And the only thing I can come out with that is my grandfather [Henry Talbird] was Haitian so it's in my blood, you know, so evidently that's just something that comes through sometimes.  Yeah, but not--no, primarily that.
Story_ID: 260910
Speaker 1: Now when you look back on your career as an artist, well, just as you--and doing other things too--is there any one major thing that you regret, or?
Speaker 2: That's something, 'cause you know nothing--you know, right this second, nothing comes to mind, but let me (laughter) think for a minute.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you would do differently if you had to do it again?
Speaker 2: Well, I could think of one thing, if I had more money, I would have had images of mine I created many, many, many years ago, I would've had them, now I have the--practically everything, and since I've been able to afford to do and have transparencies and, 'cause I'd love to have some art books be published.  But also, I'd like to be able to know what I did, and look at it, so I been able to do that.  And, anything differently--I really don't think so, because, I think, because the whole process had a pretty much a life of its own; it was a direction I was going in.  My primary goal was, unlike the French impressionists looking at my film, 'Moulin Rouge'--the first one--is that I was gonna live past thirty, and in my lifetime, I was gonna sell my work.  And I was gonna live off my work, because back in that--during that period, those particular artists seldom lived past thirty, thirty-five and many of them never sold a thing, and then once they were gone they were extremely famous, and people started making money.  Right.  So I think that having that as a goal, I've accomplished a major part, I mean, so far I've made it to fifty-five, twenty years past (laughter), and for many years I've been able to support myself, primarily as an artist, but full-time as an artist for the last twelve, thirteen years, yeah.
Story_ID: 260911
Speaker 1: What did your parents [Henrietta Talbird and William James] think of your art career, I mean, as it, as you grew, and in your--?
Speaker 2: Their chest got bigger and bigger.  I mean, there was first that whole fearful period, but there was a great thing for them, because I was also an accountant, I knew how to do taxes, I mean, I had things to fall back on.  But I know that they initially were a little frightened for me and my livelihood and being able to really make a living at what I really loved.
Speaker 1: Were they worried that you didn't go on and finish college, or did you?
Speaker 2: No, they weren't, they didn't seem to--they never voiced it.  I think when I first stopped going to college [at Los Angeles Valley College, Los Angeles, California], I myself felt a tinge of guilt, 'cause it felt like something you needed to have to do.  And, so how I worked on that with myself is I said, "Well, I'll go back to it later."  But then, once I got into the workforce, and when I--being able to take care of myself and when I was able, with that, to be able to paint and start my career at that, it never made any sense to go back to school to take something I was never gonna do anything with.  Which was liberal arts, that what I--my major.  So as accomplishments and time went on, they just got prouder and prouder and then they saw that I was okay, and I was fine, and in many ways much better than I would have been with a steady job.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was your father particularly proud of you being an artist, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I know that there was--I had something at one of the international buildings here [Los Angeles, California], but more towards Santa Monica [California] area, in this building, and it was like still the very beginning, but they had work of mine, and he used to just go sit in the halls and look at the work or tell people that I was his daughter (laughter), and of course I got it all from him.
Speaker 1: Now you have almost, what is it, ten brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: It's--were total--that's right--we're, total, eleven. They call us the halfs, steps and wholes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: And any of them involved in the arts?
Speaker 2: Two brothers enjoy it more as a hobby, you know, to the point where I believe that the one is most talented with it really paints for his self and for his home, and he has incredible work, but he has no desire to sell work.  I have a sister that had painted some and has spent little periods of time selling some work, but then she finds it difficult to sell her work, too.  In my beginning, I found it extremely difficult to sell some work, but I wanted to be an artist to make a living at it, you know, so I would choose different pieces out of different series and keep them for myself, and then once I learned how you can market and make the money through art reproductions on even things that you weren't ready to sell, you were still making a living at art.  So, I guess I was the more serious about it being my career, yeah.
Story_ID: 260912
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, and you're still relatively young, what would you consider, at this point, to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, we'd have to go with the [Kwanzaa] stamp, to be one, 'cause that's a first, you know, so that.  Like, I remember when everyone had me completely associated with [HistoryMaker] Terry McMillan, and a lot of people still do, but in one advertisement about a new print of mine that came out it said, "No longer 'Waiting to Exhale' artist, [HistoryMaker] Synthia Saint James," you know, so it was almost like, enough, enough, now she does other things, she's done stuff before and since.  But, I didn't write that, but I thought that was one of the cutest things.  And then, you know, then for a while I called myself Queen Kwanzaa, because everybody wanted me to do everything involved with Kwanzaa.  I mean, we had all kind of merchandise was out, people wanted me to sign and be here for Kwanzaa, Kwanzaa, Kwanzaa.  So, but, all of those things I accept, because they're things that people remember, but I--but the legacy that, I guess, is part of what I think of, another kind of legacy, is that if you've got enough willpower, and there's something strongly in your heart that you want to do you can make the sacrifices and actually accomplish it, and I'd like to be thought of that I've been able to do a lot towards what I've really wanted to do in life--and there's still a lot more I want to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But is a--but it's hope, and there's--it can really happen; it's not just a fantasy.
Story_ID: 260913
Speaker 1: Can you tell us something about what you are envisioning for the future?
Speaker 2: Well, I would love to do some--I would really love to design some more stained glass, and I would want to do some more ceramic tile work.  I initially was gonna be commissioned to do a terrazzo floor.  I would love to design--I would like to design a lot of things that will be in buildings.  Yeah, I see that and in major buildings that people would be able to see and get something from or, you know, be excited by.  Then, I have started my autobiography, but it's really from an artistic side, it's really not so much the family, as it's about points in how it attaches to art through my lifetime.  Almost finished with an affirmation book called, 'The I Wills According to SAINT JAMES (Book One)' [Synthia Saint James] (laughter), and it is things that make you feel good and focused each day or maybe one a week in kind of a journal style.  And, as I said, I'm doing an art marketing book.  Then I have a few projects that I've not signed to do yet, but they're some more things towards actually helping non-profits for Judge Mablean Ephriam.  She has some awards that she gives to fathers, yeah.  I think it's called the H.U.F. Awards [Honoring UnSung Fathers] or something, but it--but they're the ones that are raising the children; it might be the grandfather with a child or foster or something, but it's for the men.  I'm supposed to be doing something for her.  I'm starting to do things for people for their homes more, meaning, someone's building a house, but I'm doing the children's rooms.  There's particular paintings on canvas that will be in those rooms.  So, being a part of architecture, more a part of the architecture and getting a chance to do some more writing.
Story_ID: 260914
Speaker 1: Well, in terms of family, now, you don't have any children right, or?
Speaker 2: No, I say, I've no children, but I have thousands of children (laughter) through the books, I mean.  I've got--I'm one of the oldest so my--helped raise my younger brothers and sisters, have a couple of godchildren, you know, so I get all that too, but I don't actually have any children.
Speaker 1: Okay, have you ever been married?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was kind of like, when I look back on it, I really, I think I really gave a lot of things thought, really a lot of thought, and I knew that this was the main focus.  By the time I was in my mid-twenties I had decided that this was my main focus, and I know the type of person I am, and I would let this go to the wayside if I decided--if I had've gotten married and had children, 'cause the children would have been most important, of course, my husband would be too, but those would be my little nurturing seeds and flowers, and I wouldn't spend the time that it takes to do this on that, you know.  Maybe when they were finally in their twenties I could do it, or in college, but the time when I needed to develop--so, I think I was twenty-five when I decided that I wasn't gonna get married and no children.
Speaker 1: Okay so you just decided this--
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) at a certain point, so it wasn't a just a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --matter of happenstance, you just decided?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I really--yeah, I really decided it and, not regretfully at all, but just something that I just knew myself well enough, you know, that--I mean, I once was a--definitely not meant to be, but I once even eloped to get married, and my fiance and I, and we couldn't find anybody to marry us (laughter), so we got back on the--I was living in New York [New York], we got back on the, I think we went to Baltimore [Maryland].  Got back on this long bus trip and got back to New York; just never got married, you know.
Speaker 1: So just doesn't seem like it was in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) No, it wasn't in my script; it wasn't meant for me, but I have a very fulfilling life.
Story_ID: 260915
Speaker 1: When we first came over here, you talked about taking walks along the beach and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the dolphins and so tell us a bit about that, that's (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well, well you know what, I'm such a concentrated workaholic that generally unless I'm on vacation do I give myself a lot of special me-time.  I'm always thinking of what else I can do.  So in the neighborhood I used to do like three miles a day and then about fifteen months ago, about a month after coming back from Hawaii, I said, "Now, when I'm in Hawaii I walk eight, seven, eight miles a day by the water," and I love water, you know, "Why can't I do it here?"  I live in sunny California, even if it's raining and cold, I can walk.  So I go to the beach every morning before dawn, I get there at dawn, and I walk on the sand where the waves come in, and I do a six mile walk every morning, which has been tremendously good for me physically, mentally, spiritually.  And it also helps me with the whole stress level and being really calm and knowing what I want to focus on that day when I get home, you know.  And then there's the trill of the seagull and the pelicans and all the other little birds, and then I see many dolphins that you would never expect to see so close to shore, but that's like so early in the morning, and then you see the surfers, I mean, the dolphins are right almost like we're--sometimes the dolphins are on the waves surfing with the surfers (laughter) you know, and every now and then you see a sea lion laying on its back, and one morning that was the most funny is I actually saw a black chicken walking on the sand.  I don't know how it got there or what it was doing there but it's like--takes you to nature, so much more, to another whole feeling in life, and just seeing the sky change colors and the clouds and, yeah it's a very peaceful, meditative feeling.  So, I been doing it for fifteen months.  It's an addiction; little upset when I go out of town, like I'm getting ready to leave, I won't be able to walk the beach for five days.
Speaker 1: You're getting ready to go to Chicago [Illinois] for the first time, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: To exhibit at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) [The] Woodshop [Art] Gallery [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, but what I normally do wherever I go--even if it's in winter, I figure out someplace I can do some kind of walk, at least get a few miles in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So the first thing I'm gonna do when I get to the hotel is look for someplace to walk.
Speaker 1: We have a lake [Lake Michigan], so.
Speaker 2: So, it's gonna--this place is on Lake Shore [Drive].  It's Ramada on Lake Shore, Ramada Inn [Lake Shore, Chicago, Illinois], is that a pretty good--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can go right under the underpass and walk.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, that's where I'll be; that's where I'll be Thursday (laughter).
Story_ID: 260916
Speaker 1: Is there anything we haven't asked you that you need to--that you think you want to address?
Speaker 2: What would that be?  I think we've got it, I think we pretty much have things covered, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, we have one last question--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and it's similar to legacy, but a little bit different, and that's a--it's--you probably--I don't know if you've thought about this or not: how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, by my work, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, well thank you very much.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Put that little hand in there.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they did that to me (simultaneous).
