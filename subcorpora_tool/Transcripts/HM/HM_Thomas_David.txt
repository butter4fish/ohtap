Story_ID: 322867
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Jesse Thomas] side.  We'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Her full maiden name or her full--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, maiden name and--
Speaker 2: Her full maiden name is Jewel, J-E-W-E-L, Marie, M-A-R-I-E, Nichols, N-I-C-H-O-L-S [Jewel Nichols Thomas].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: June 1st, 1928, Armstrong, Missouri.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about--what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family, how far back can you trace them first of all?
Speaker 2: Only to my mother's parents [Rena Nichols and Dave Nichols].  And they were both--I never knew them.  They were both deceased by the time I was born.  And as far as I know, her family--I don't--I don't know that they lived anywhere other than in Missouri, right.  So I don't know about any migration.  And--
Speaker 1: So chances are that they were there after--after slavery?
Speaker 2: Chances--chances yeah, and you know, Missouri was a slave state, so chances are that the, you know, the--the family's origins, as far as I know are in Missouri, her family.  And they--they had twelve kids, so my mother was the seventh of twelve, seven girls and five boys.  And my mother left when she was fifteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So there's no discussion about what the family was doing back in the, you know, back in the 19th century or any what your great-grandparents were doing?
Speaker 2: No, no, unh-huh.
Speaker 1: Do, do you know what your grandparents did for living or what they did?
Speaker 2: They were farmers and day laborers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, as far as I know.
Story_ID: 322868
Speaker 1: So did your mother [Jewel Nichols Thomas] talk about growing up, what is was like to grow up in Armstrong [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, a bit.  One of the things that happened was that my mother actually was not raised by her parents [Rena Nichols and Dave Nichols].  She was raised in the same town that they lived in, but there was a couple that had--that didn't have kids.  And my mother was sent to live with them when she was--when she was a little baby.  They--it wasn't a legal adoption, but they essentially adopted her.  Now, part of the story is that my mother's father, legal father, wasn't her real father.  And so--so her mother had an affair that produced my mother and--and so I guess the way they dealt with it was to allow this couple, that didn't have kids, to raise my mother.  And wha- what was--and--and the family that raised her was--was by the standards of the black community in Armstrong, which was very segregated.  I mean, it's a classic, if you go down--when we would go down when we were little, there literally were train tracks and all the black people lived on one side of the train tracks and the white people lived on the other side.  And this woman was the--the teacher in the town.  They had a one-room school house and she was the teacher.  So in that sense, my mother was raised, you know, much more privileged by the standards of the town than her--than her siblings.
Speaker 1: Did this couple actually live across the tracks, on the other side of the tracks?
Speaker 2: Well, they--they--they lived--they lived--well they lived on the same side of the tracks as all of the other black people, 'cause, you know, they were black.  But they had a nicer house and, you know, my mother would talk about the fact that she would take food down to her brothers and sisters, 'cause times would be hard at her parents' house.  You know, she always had new, nice stuff and the other kids didn't.
Speaker 1: And this is the Great Depression you're talking about--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --when she was raised.  In fact, she was raised--born just--just at the cusp of it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: She had, what eleven brothers and sisters on, you know.
Speaker 2: Yep, eleven brothers and sisters down the street living on, you know, hardscrabble.  And yeah, you can imagine, you know, 'cause the woman that was raising her, Miss--they--they called her Miss Bertha [ph.].  You know, she was one of the few people with a steady government paycheck as a teacher.  So then when my mother was fifteen, for some reason, her parents wanted her to come back home and she didn't want to go.  So she left and went to live with her older brother, who by then was living in another small town up the road from--from Armstrong.  I think a place called Boonville [Missouri].  And--and she dropped out of school.  So she never finished high school.
Speaker 1: So, what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: My mother?  She did housework for white people up until about 19--let's see when I was five.  So up until about 1961, and then she was a seamstress in a--an apparel company, and they paid her by the piece rate.  And she did that up until about--she was doing that when I finished college.  So she was doing that up until about 1979, '78 [1978] or '79 [1979].  And then she started to do, you know, light clerical work for a community center.
Story_ID: 322869
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Jewel Nichols Thomas] have any good stories of growing up which you can share with us?
Speaker 2: Any good stories of growing up.  You know, she didn't talk--she--I mean, other than--other than talking about, not any good stories.  No not any good stories.  Yeah, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) By that I mean just any--
Speaker 2: --she didn't talk a lot about growing up.
Speaker 1: --interesting story I guess, it doesn't have to be necessarily good.
Speaker 2: No, she didn't talk a lot about her growing up.  Now that I--now that I think about it, yeah, she didn't talk about it (unclear).
Speaker 1: Did she--did she feel like that she benefited from being separated from the rest of her brothers and sisters or did she?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because, you know, my mother grew up, the assumption was made that she was gonna go to college.  She was a very good student, very smart.  You know, good literary skills, good diction, you know, all because she was raised by this school teacher [Bertha (ph.)], right.  So, you know, my--my--my father [Jesse Thomas] used to--used to kid my mother that, you know, God made her black because otherwise, you know, she--she'd be an out of control snob (laughter).  You know, and she always, you know, raised us with the expectation that, you know, you should set the highest expectations for yourself.  There's nothing you can't do.  There's nobody better than you.  And in fact, you know, I can remember times when I would be outside having a fight, getting into it with somebody, you know, my mother would come out and say leave the trash alone (laughter).  You know, and--and this is all black, everybody's working class.  Nobody's got any more money than anybody else, but you know, she would try to impart this sense of, you know, don't--don't lower yourself beneath who you really are, right.  You know and you know, she was a sweet person, I mean, kids loved to come to my house, and you know, we hung out with everybody.  But, you know, it was just this attitude that she had that despite her material reality, you know, which didn't put her at the top of any heap, you know, that psychologically, you know, you're--you're, you know, she was a person of significance and importance and her kids should carry themselves as if they are people of significance and importance.  And you know, you could also see it in the way that she dressed.  You know, my mother was the kind of person who would rather have one really nice, high-quality coat, than have, you know, five or six cheap, low-quality ones, right.  You know, she would go and put clothes in the layaway, you know, a layaway, okay, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well that's something that, explain it to, because people watching this in the future.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--so--so layaway is basically where you--you make an arrangement with the store that you're gonna buy something and they put it away for you.  Take it off the rack and you come in each week or month, you know, some period and you pay, you know, some money until you've paid it off and then you get to take it out of the store.  So, you know, she would put things on layaway, you know, fo- no matter what it was, furniture, you know, right, so she could get the high-quality stuff and pay it off over time.  And, you know, she was known as a great dresser.
Story_ID: 322870
Speaker 1: Matter of fact, the stories that I know about my mother [Jewel Nichols Thomas] actually don't come from her childhood so much as they come from her--her sort of late teen and her twenties.  Where--there's a group of women who became her life-long friends and they had a women's club.  And they went to this church called St. Stephen's Baptist Church [St. Stephen Baptist Church, Kansas City, Missouri], I mean a lot of 'em.  And she came to Kansas City [Missouri] when she was about seventeen in 1945.  And she was no, you know--
Speaker 2: Now what drew her to Kansas City?
Speaker 1: What drew her to Kansas City was that one of her brothers had come to Kan- another brother had come to Kansas City.  My mother got married when she was sixteen and the women that raised her, Miss Bertha [ph.]--so she gets married, she sneaks off, she elopes, she gets married when she's sixteen.  Decides within a couple of months that she's made a mistake.  The woman that raised her, Miss Bertha, comes--comes to town--comes and--
Speaker 2: Oh my fault (background noise).  Pause a second, pause a second, my fault.  All right.
Speaker 1: --yep, so--so anyway the marriage was annulled and I think--and--and--and it's a little while later that she winds up going to Kansas City.  So I think it was all part of this, you know, she had--she had--she had gone to Boonville [Missouri] to live with her brother.  She's trying to, you know, basically get some freedom.  She gets married to this guy, she realizes that was a mistake.  So now she's going off to Kansas City to live with another brother, but I think it's all about, you know--
Speaker 2: Getting further out.
Speaker 1: Yeah, getting her further out.  And she gets there and that's when she starts to do work in people's homes as a--as a maid.  And--and meets a set of friends.  But, you know, the--the rap on my mother was that she was always well-dressed, didn't drink, didn't smoke, but was the life of the party, you know.  Knew how to have a really good time, but--but always kind of seen as, you know, and treated as if, you know, she was kind of a cut above, you know, in terms of style and poise and--and--and that sort of thing.  And how she carried herself, 'cause she didn't smoke or drink, you know.
Story_ID: 322871
Speaker 1: Well let's go--turn to your father, again we'll--we'll get 'em together here.  But, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep.  His full name is Jesse [Jesse Thomas], J-E-S-S-E, Jewel, he and my mother [Jewel Nichols Thomas] had the same name (laughter), did--they spelled it with one L, just one L.  Jewel Thomas, Sr.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is July 24th, 1927.  And he was born in Kansas City, Kansas.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's right across the river, right?
Speaker 2: Right across the river.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?  How far back can you trace that--that group?
Speaker 2: I can trace them only--well, I can trace them back to my father's father and my father's mother.  My father's father's name was Fred Thomas [ph.], and he had four brothers.  And then he--he had five sons, of which my father was one.  My father was the youngest.  And two of--my--my father's father and mother got divorced around the time--shortly after my father was born.  And my mother married another guy--
Speaker 1: Your grandmother?
Speaker 2: I me--I mean my grandmother, married--oh gee I can't remember grandpa's name.  Mr. Cooper.  Right, right, his name was Cooper, Israel Cooper.
Speaker 1: What was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's name was--gee.  Grandma's last name was James, Irene.  She was Irene James Thomas and then Irene James Cooper after she married Mr. Cooper.  So when I was--when I was growing up, you know, I knew her as Cooper and my grandfather was Israel Cooper.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now any stories about--from that side of the family about life in Kansas City back in the--
Speaker 2: Well yeah, so--so--so my grandmother leaves Kansas and goes to live in Independence, Missouri.  So where my father actually grew up as a kid is in Independence, Missouri.  And they had a small truck farm and were pretty poor, the way my father talks about it.  They lived in a--a--I mean we used to--we used to go down there when I was a kid, a kind of three-room, poorly-insulated, kind of farmer shack without--with an outhouse, you know, and a chicken coop right next door, you know, right next to it.  And you know, my--my--my father loved to talk about it.  You know, he's one of those people who'd tell you about, you know, walking twenty miles to school and getting up early in the morning to get water, and you know, taking a bath in a tub that where you--you heated the water on the stove and you know, having to go out and get the wood to put in the potbelly stove and his job was to keep it going through the night, you know.
Story_ID: 322872
Speaker 1: And he [Thomas' father, Jesse Thomas] didn't finish high school 'cause he left to join the [U.S.] Army or the [U.S.] Navy in 1944.  And he was the youngest of five.  And all of his brothers had gone off to fight in World War II [WWII].  He went to the Navy and he was--he was--spent most of his time on an aircraft carrier in the Pacific Ocean.  Because he joined late, he basically was involved in, you know, the--the cleanup operations in the Pacific in the latter part of the war.  He had three jobs.  He was a cook like most of the black guys or many of the black guys who were on these ships out in the Pacific; that was his non-combat job.  And then his combat job, one was he used to drive the boats that took, you know, if you're watching the movies, troops land on the beach, they have these pontoon boats that they bring 'em in on and then the front drops down, he drove one of those and he also was a gunner.  And finished up his service in Okinawa [Japan] and then came back to the states for a few years and then got called back up to go serve in the Korean War.
Speaker 2: So he basically volunteered to go--go back is that what?
Speaker 1: No, he didn't volunteer to go back so, right.  So, he joins in '44 [1944].  It's--they're cleaning up the Pacific and then the U.S. occupies the Pacific, and he's out there until 1948, and that's when he comes back to the states.  So the--so the Korean--so--so they start to gear up for their--recall--they start to gear up for the Korean crisis in about--in 1950.  So they're calling people back and he was on the--he was--he was in the reserves, because, you know, he thought he could get an extra paycheck, right.  And he gets called back up.  And--and he goes to--he goes to Korea and is there for--until 19--1951, he comes back.  And he had also gotten married to his first wife, and he comes back home and he and his wife are, you know, they never get back together, and he finds out that everything he owned had been wiped out in the flood that had hit the--there's an area of Kansas City, Kansas [sic.] called the Bottoms [West Bottoms, Kansas City, Missouri], and that's where he lived.  And it--and it basically is on what essentially was the flood plain for the Missouri River and this was like the great, you know, people still refer to it as the Great Flood in Kansas that wiped out this area where lots of black folks lived call the Bottoms.  So--so he comes back, goes to work in a place called the packinghouse [at the Kansas City Stockyards, Kansas City, Missouri], which basically is a slaughterhouse.  And--and Kansas City was a big slaughterhouse center back then.  He worked for Armour [Armour and Company].  And he and my mother [Jewel Nichols Thomas] met in about 1952.
Story_ID: 322873
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how they [Thomas' parents, Jewel Nichols Thomas and Jesse Thomas] met that they tell?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the story they tell about how they met is my father's best friend was this guy, I forget his--I forget his name, but anyway they're--they're hanging--my father's best friend's mother sort of became my mother's big sister slash adopted mother, okay.  And--an--an--and so this guy's na- they called this guy Junior.  So my father and Junior are fixing a car.  And my father sees my mother go up the stairs to the--I guess to the apartment or to the house, you know and starts to flirt with her.  And she kind of, you know, eggs him off.  And then a few weeks later they're at this place called the Pass Time [ph.], which is basically a--an illegal speakeasy out in--in Independence [Missouri], right, in a--in a late nightclub.  So he starts hitting on her there and you know, long story shorter, they each wind up, you know, using their networks to get information about each other.  And it turns out, you know, my mother's a great cook, right.  She made him the first meal and that was it (laughter).
Story_ID: 322874
Speaker 1: Okay, so your mother [Jewel Nichols Thomas] and father [Jesse Thomas] finally get together--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: When did they get married?
Speaker 2: They got married in 1953.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. So can you tell me do you have an--do you have any sense of who you take after the most, your mother or your father?
Speaker 2: Personality wise, I take after my father.  I think from a--from the vantage point of sort of internal drive, you know, I take after my mother.  I think, yeah, yeah, kind of on the surface, people experience me as being a lot like my father.  And I think, you know, kind of internally my--my sort of sense of drive and focus comes a lot from my mother, you know, setting very high expectations, you know, that I should have for myself.  So, you know, like I always want to be the best even though, you know, you would--you wouldn't--like most--most people have no idea how competitive I am, 'cause I don't come across as, you know, the guy who is trying to beat the next guy.  And--and in reality, you know, my focus is always on, you know, competing with myself, you know, kind of like okay mathematically if I add it up, I'm not the guy who, you know, should win this race, right 'cause my clock speed is only average in the field by this, by that, by this by that, but in my mind I'm like okay so how I'm gonna win this race (laughter), you know, right.
Story_ID: 322875
Speaker 1: Do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Four brothers--I--I'm sorry three brothers, there's four boys.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where do you fall in that group?
Speaker 2: I'm the second, right.
Speaker 1: Second, okay, all right.  Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: An earliest childhood memory, yeah.  My earliest childhood memory is pushing my older brother through the house in this pump car and my--now my parents [Jewel Nichols Thomas and Jesse Thomas] tell the story that I used to push him and then when it was my turn to ride, he would put the car away (laughter) and not let me have a turn.  But I don't remember that.  But I remember pushing him.  You know, we lived in this apartment, what they used to call railroad flat 'cause, you know, had a long hallway and rooms off the hallway.  And I would push this car.  My brother's a year older than me, so we were very close.  And that--that's my--that's my oldest childhood memory.  And so I was probably two and half or three, you know.
Story_ID: 322876
Speaker 1: Now can you describe--did you grow up in one neighborhood or did you move around a lot?
Speaker 2: At the time that I was four, we moved into the neighborhood that--that I grew up in and into the house that I then grew up in, did all of my schooling and where my mother [Jewel Nichols Thomas] lived until she died in 2001.  So--so for me, I grew up in one place, one house, one neighborhood.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now can you describe the neighborhood for us?  I mean, it was--was there a name for the neighborhood 'cause often, like you said your father [Jesse Thomas] lived in the Bottom [West Bottoms, Kansas City, Missouri] in Kansas City, Kansas [sic.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well--we--we lived in the neighborhood that back then was called Oak Park [Kansas City, Missouri], which was name--which was basically named and even the neighborhood had a neighborhood club called the Oak Park Neighborhood Club.  And our address was 4234 Montgall [Avenue]--
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Montgall, M-O-N-T-G-A-double L.  One block over from a main street that was called Prospect [Avenue] that ran from one end of the city to the other.  And when we moved there right after the neighborhood had become majority black and within about four years of our moving there, there were only two white families left in the block.  One lived right next door to us and the--all the white families that were left were really just old couples that didn't have the means to move away and whose kids hadn't managed to, you know, somehow relocate 'em.  So I grew up in what was essentially an all-black neighborhood.  Went to all-black schools, in fact, I remember the grade school I went to had one white family and--and they literally were the poorest people that I knew.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your grade school?
Speaker 2: My grade school was called Henry C. Kumpf School [Kansas City, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Henry--
Speaker 2: C. Kumpf School.
Speaker 1: Is that--how do you spell is that K?
Speaker 2: K-U-M-P-F, Kumpf.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how did that fam- you were--we were talking about that white family.  How--how did they feel about being--being the only white family in the?
Speaker 2: Never talked about it.  There was a guy who was in my grade named David Bell [ph.] and he and I, you know, we--we were friends, he was cool.  You know, you know, I don't know how they felt about it.
Speaker 1: It didn't bother the black students I guess or did it or you?
Speaker 2: Not in grade, no, no, no, no.  And you know, I mean my guess is what bothered him more was, you know, the fact that he was poor.  You know, and there was no father in the home, you know and they lived in this house that was a ramshackle house.  And I don't know what his mother did, but you know, you could tell that the kids, you know, didn't have much discipline, you know.  You know, you basically could go over to their house and do anything, you know, 'cause the kids were in control you know.  So yeah.  And--and--and at the time that I grew up in this neighborhood it was very much a working class black neighborhood that by black community standards was a very middle class neighborhood.  You know, most people had jobs.  Most families had, you know, two parents who worked.  People took really good care of, you know, their lawns and took a sense of pride in, you know their families and that, you know, sort of thing.  Now mind you, you know, probably 80 percent of the families, mine was one of 'em, we were living paycheck to paycheck, you know, and you could tell that when somebody got laid off and--and my father [Jesse Thomas] was one of those people who, you know, almost like clockwork every two years there was either a major layoff or a major strike, you know, so he'd be out of work for, you know, anywhere from two and a half weeks to, you know, three months on his main job.  And you know, the belts were tightened.  And not in any way that, you know, made us feel deprived as kids, but you know, bill collectors would start to call and you know, that sort of thing and they would get behind.  But always made sure that, you know, we never felt any sense of, you know, deprivation or anything like that you know.  They would much more likely tell you, you know, if you wanted something that they couldn't afford, you know, they would basically talk to you about, you know, wasting money, you know, as opposed to we can't afford it.  And, you know, over time that neighborhood became a depressed neighborhood.  So if you--if you go back there today, you know, that's the hood.
Story_ID: 322877
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of the neighborhood [Oak Park, Kansas City, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds and smells of the neighborhood.  Main thing--main thing I remember about the neighborhood is from Memorial Day through Labor Day on any holiday or weekend, you could smell barbeque throughout the neighborhood.  And the men in the neighborhood, my father [Jesse Thomas] being one of 'em, you know, like being able to barbeque was like a sign of masculinity and these guys, you know, they would barbeque something and then, you know, I--if I'd barbeque I'd take it over to your house and say, you know, "Hey Larry [Larry Crowe], you know," it's Larry right?  Yeah, "Hey Larry, taste this."  Well, you know, the next week you'd be over at my house showing me, you know, yours and you know, they could talk wood and what kind of wood you use and how you set your grill up and all that kind of stuff.  So that's the smell.  You know, sights, dogs chasing cars (laughter).  There were lots of dogs in the neighborhood and lots of people, you know, you just let your dog run free through the neighborhood.  And these dogs used to take off chasing cars.
Speaker 1: And that's a feature of today's life that most of the places in the United States it didn- doesn't happen like that anymore.  Dogs just run loose, but growing up--we grew up maybe--I'm older than you are, but I remember--
Speaker 2: Only by four years.  I was class of '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: Okay, I was--but, there was a time when dogs would just run and you had to know the dogs in the neighborhood like--like the people, you knew who they were (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah right, right, exactly, exactly, exactly.  You know, another sight is--was kids playing football in the street.  So we played pickup football, you know, from all year round, even in the snow.  And we'd play right out on the street, you know.  And that--that's another sight.  You know another sight is people going to church.  Like, you know, it seemed like everybody went to church on Sunday morning, so.  And there was a church right at the end of our block, so when I was a little kid, I would go to Sunday school there and then come back home and go to the church that my mother [Jewel Nichols Thomas] and father went to for services, you know.
Speaker 1: Oh that's Saint--
Speaker 2: St. Stephen's [St. Stephen Baptist Church, Kansas City, Missouri].
Speaker 1: St. Stephen's.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and I went to Sunday school at this church called Friendship [Friendship Baptist Church, Kansas City, Missouri], which interestingly enough is--is this church that my wife went to, but we didn't know each other, when I was five or six.  But, so those were the, you know, sights--you know, the other sight is afros and miniskirts (laughter) from my--from my teenage years.
Speaker 1: So you were ten years old in 1966, I guess, when people were really wearing--it was the height of or beginning of--maybe beginning of the afro and miniskirt era, yeah beginning of it, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was beginning of the afros, yeah, yeah.  And I remember I got my afro when I was twelve.  You know, I was starting to--wearing what I thought was an afro.  And I--my father used to cut my hair and I had this picture, this football player and I said I want my hair like that.
Speaker 1: Now which one was it?
Speaker 2: Which football player?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Otis Taylor.
Story_ID: 322878
Speaker 1: Now this raises an issue, 'cause I know this has gotta be a big deal: Kansas City Chiefs football team.  Because and I've talked with some of the players in the past who they--they--from the aspect that the AFC [American Football Conference], the American Football League [AFL] before they merged with the National Football League [NFL] seemed to bring in a lot more of the black college players, I think, because they were trying to find guys who could play.
Speaker 2: Correct, right.
Speaker 1: You know, guys like Gloster Richardson and Frank Pitts and those guys are all guys who played in black colleges [HBCUs].
Speaker 2: Buck Buchanan [Junious Buchanan], right.
Speaker 1: Curly Culp.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah those are all Kansas City guys.
Speaker 1: Aaron Brown, you can go on and on with the team.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: Otis Taylor being the big star.
Speaker 2: Exactly, went to Prairie View [Prairie View Agricultural & Mechanical College of Texas; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas].  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I was a big Chiefs fan and like most kids there.  And in fact the first time I ever saw a colored TV was the first Super Bowl [Super Bowl I] where Kansas City lost to Green Bay [Green Bay Packers]. That was my first time watching color TV.
Speaker 1: Now that's when you were ten, that's in '66 [sic. 1967].
Speaker 2: Is that '66 [1966]?
Speaker 1: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Let's see, I think so.  I think it's '66 [1966].
Speaker 2: I guess it was '68 [1968], 'cause I guess they won in '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: I think '69 [1969] or '70 [1970] wasn't it, they won it, they won--I think it's '70 [1970] they actually won at '70 [1970], I think.
Speaker 2: Was it '70 [1970] they beat Minnesota [Minnesota Vikings]?
Speaker 1: I think, yeah right, I think that's '70 [1970] when they fin- it took that long for them to get back, but they got back and did it.
Speaker 2: Then--then--then you're sure the first Super Bowl was in '68 [1968]?
Speaker 1: Maybe it was '68 [1968], maybe it was '68 [1968], maybe that's it, maybe that's it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Cause I'm just--it just seems to me--
Speaker 1: Seems like just a couple years--
Speaker 2: --like it was two years.
Speaker 1: --yeah may--maybe you're right, 'cause that was a hard--long time to keep a good team like that together.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So maybe so, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, seems like it was a two-year gap.
Speaker 1: Some of the guys are still playing, but, you know, I hear you.  I think you might be--you may be right.
Speaker 2: But, yeah so Kansas City was--yeah the Chiefs were big, it was a big sports town.  You know.
Story_ID: 322879
Speaker 1: What did the afro really mean in those days to you, I mean, you know, when you look back at it?  Did you attach--other than a style, did you attach any other significance to it?
Speaker 2: When I first started wearing the afro it was just about style.  I didn't attach any significance to it until the--the only--I--I started attaching racial significance to it when a--when a--when [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis was being tried.  You know, and there was just--there was something about it that just, you know, struck me as, you know, as is--that it was a statement of militancy, in a positive sense of black militancy.  But, you know, but I--I didn't see my own afro, you know, as like a statement of protest as much as a statement of identity, you know, and--and being cool.
Story_ID: 322880
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about school.  Now you went to grade school at Henry C. Kumpf School [Kansas City, Missouri] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep.
Speaker 1: Did you go there the whole eight years?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep, seven years.  They went to the seventh grade.  And then the eighth grade I got bused.  That--that school I walked to was about five or six blocks from my house.  Then I got bused in the eighth grade to a school called Manual [Manual High School; Manual Career and Technical Center, Kansas City, Missouri], which was one of the original black high schools.  So if you went back to, you know, the early half of the century, like when my parents [Jewel Nichols Thomas and Jesse Thomas] would've been going to school, blacks in Kansas City [Missouri] went to school called Lincoln High School [Lincoln College Preparatory Academy, Kansas City, Missouri], which actually my father's cousin was principal of at one point in time.  His name was Earl Thomas.  And--and another school was called R. T. Cole [R. T. Coles Vocational and Junior High School, Kansas City, Missouri] and that later became Manual High School, and it was a vocational school.  And so I--so I got bused there in the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Why--
Speaker 2: Why?
Speaker 1: Why were you bused to Manual instead of finishing up at--at Kumpf?
Speaker 2: 'Cause Kumpf only went to the seventh grade.  So the seventh grade you had to go somewhere, and--
Speaker 1: That's sort of strange isn't it, for a school to just to go to seventh grade, a grade school?
Speaker 2: You know, back then I--most--most schools, excuse me, most schools back then had junior highs attached to 'em.  Most high schools had junior highs, right.  And for some reason--so the high school that I--that I went to a year later and started ninth grade in, they decided to get rid of their eighth grade, 'cause they were building a junior high close to my house and then somebody made a decision that people who lived in my neighborhood couldn't go there, right.  And--and remind you, a--all the neighborhoods around the school were black so--so it didn't have to do with race, but there was just some reason why if you lived the certain--if you lived beyond a certain block you couldn't go to the school.  So they had to find somewhere to put us.  And high school enrollments were down at this school called--at--at Manual.  So they shipped us all there, you know.  'Cause my brother, he did the eighth grade at my high--at what a year later became my high school.  No, that's not true, that's not true.  He went to East [East High School, Kansas City, Missouri] for the eighth grade.  So he got bused too.  So there was something about, you know, our neighborhood that we got bused.  And then a year later, we would change and go to the local high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you went there for a year at Manual?
Speaker 2: Went there for a year and then I went to Paseo High School [Paseo Academy of Fine and Performing Arts, Kansas City, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Paseo, P-A-S-E-O?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 322881
Speaker 1: Now were you a good student in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a good student, but I was always throughout my grade school [Henry C. Kumpf School, Kansas City, Missouri] in particular, teachers frequently underestimated my abilities.  So I can think of three times when my father [Jesse Thomas] came up to the school and had a--not an argument, but a disagreement with the teacher about where they had placed me in terms of skill level.  And one time in particular I remember, you know, this teacher had written letters that we had to take home to our parents that said that we couldn't do--I was in the sixth grade and--and--and she wrote this letter and said, take this letter home to your parents.  And the letter said that I couldn't do basic, I don't know, third grade math or something like that.  And I said, well that's not true.  And I didn't get the letter to my parents.  So the next day the teacher said, how many people gave their letters to their parents.  And I didn't raise my hand.  And so she says--her name was Miss Jackson [ph.]--she says, "David Thomas [HistoryMaker David A. Thomas] you didn't give your letter to your parents"--she was a black teacher.  "So you didn't give your letter to your parents."  I said, "No."  She said, "Why?"  I said, "'Cause it's not true."  She went ballistic and this was back when, you know, the teachers gave you a paddling--used paddling.  So, you know, she gave me a paddling and then she, she liked to embarrass you so she would have you stand with books in your hand like this with your arms outstretched, right, until, you know, your arms got too tired.  If you dropped your arms, she come over and hit you with the paddle.  You know, humiliate you in class.  So she does that to me and then I go home and I tell my father, you know, that or she called or something.  Anyway, but anyway, you know, I think she called my house too, but by the time, you know, she talked to my parents I had already told 'em.  So my father says, well it was--it was the last time that my father ever gave me a spanking, a whooping, 'cause my father said, "Well you know, I know you're right that you can do the math, but you should've given me the letter anyway so I'm gonna give you a spanking not because of what she said, but because, you know, you didn't give me the letter and--and--and that wasn't for you to decide."  So he gives me a whooping, it's the first time I ever got a whooping I didn't cry.  I just took the licks and you know, hit me maybe five times right, you know, it was kind of like, you know, he was a very judicious kind of guy, right.  You know, a different life circumstance he probably would have been a [U.S.] Supreme Court judge, you know.  High integrity, you know, very kind of--everything was in proportion, right.  But by the same token, you know, my father told you were grounded for a month, you were grounded for a month.  My mother [Jewel Nichols Thomas] told you, you were grounded for a month, you were grounded until she felt better (laughter), you know.  And that was the last time he ever gave me a switching--
Story_ID: 322882
Speaker 1: But anyway long story shorter, they had this parents visit day, okay.  And my father [Jesse Thomas] takes off from work, right, which means he gave up a day's pay to come up for parent visit day and brings my mother [Jewel Nichols Thomas].  They the only parents who show.  And the teacher had asked the day before, you know, what--what subject do you guys want to do when the parents come in.  So I had said I wanted to do history, 'cause I liked history.  She says, "Oh we don't want to do history, we don't want to look stupid, you know, right, yeah."  So we decided to do math.  So--so--so we do math.  So then, I come into the--you know, so the teacher calls me to the board and gives me this easy problem to do, right.  So I do it.  So my father says, "Well, give me the book."  And my father goes to like a part of the book that we hadn't even done yet in class.  He says, "Do this problem, David [HistoryMaker David A. Thomas]."  So he gives me the problem.  And I work it, right.  And then he gives me another one and I work it.  And the teacher they--so then they go outside, and I can see my father, you know, you know, tearing her a new asshole.  'Cause she says to my father, she says, "I have never seen David, I have never seen David perform like that in class.  That was just--oh blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."  And my father said, "He told me you never have asked him to go to the board.  You know, you never," right, I mean, you know.  And she came back in and from that day forward treated me like I was a different person.  You know, 'cause she had these kids that she thought were pets.  Now most of 'em had parents who were teachers or preachers or you know, some higher up on the class food chain, you know, then--then I was.  The other thing was, she was very fair skinned and even though I was, you know, for my neighborhood I wouldn't have been considered very fair skinned, but I was fair skinned, but all my friends were dark.  And I realized later, you know, that it was also a color thing, I think, right, and that all the kids who were pets were light skinned, you know.  And--and probably if I think back on it, with--with a couple of exceptions and the dark skin exceptions were kids whose parents were all--were very involved in the school, right, 'cause they were head of the PTA [Parent Teacher Association] or you know, right or something else.  But I think there was a class thing going on.  And then the other thing she did was--this is now, this is after my father comes up there and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and you know.  And my father was the kind of guy who, if you met him, and he was dressed up, you wouldn't know what his education level was. 'Cause he was very smooth, very poised, you know, had two suits, one charcoal gray, one blue, you know, used to be a very good dresser, you know, but very conservative, you know, right.  So you know, he had on his one blue suit and he went up there and looked like, you know, an Indian [Native American] chief.  And so one day she asked in the class, she says, "How many kids' parents went to college?"  I didn't raise my hand.  She said, "David Thomas, raise your hand, you know your father went to college."  (Laughter) Okay, you know.
Story_ID: 322883
Speaker 1: I was saying that this--this kind of experience has got to inform the kind of work you do (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep.
Speaker 1: Just in behavioral scientist in business.
Speaker 2: Yep, absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: The expectations that people have of losing corporate heads bringing on minorities, you know, and their expectations of what they can do and can't do based on what their view or stereotype of the group is.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So, so you did all right in high school [Paseo High School; Paseo Academy of Fine and Performing Arts, Kansas City, Missouri].  You seem to be--but, but you weren't always recognized for what you could do, I guess?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, well yeah, well--and that was elementary school [Henry C. Kumpf School, Kansas City, Missouri].  And then in high school, I did very well.  I--I left after three years and went to France.  But the thing about my high school was, you know, if you go--in--in 1981 there was a court case [Missouri v. Jenkins] that was decided that essentially said that Kansas City [Missouri] had one of the most egregious, separate and unequal school systems in America.  And required the state and the city to invest a bunch of money into rehabilitating the Kansas City schools and desegregating them.  You know, I was one of the top students in my high school, but I never wrote a paper that was longer than six hand-written pages.  I took every math class, every level of math you could take, but the school didn't offer calculus.  And I had enough credits to graduate after three years, so I left and went to--I got this fellowship to be a foreign exchange student that came about by--by--by a kind of accident which was that I had this girlfriend, she got a scholarship to go to Phillips Exeter Academy [Exeter, New Hampshire], which is one of these high-end prep schools from this organization called A Better Chance [ABC].  Have you heard of A Better Chance?
Speaker 1: Right.  I just heard about it, in fact it was like two weeks ago I heard about it, A Better Chance from--
Speaker 2: Somebody you were interviewing?
Speaker 1: Yeah a journalist out of--he's in Atlanta [Georgia] now from Chicago [Illinois], Syl- [HistoryMaker] Sylvester Monroe.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, okay, right, right, exactly, yeah.  As a matter of fact, there's a book ['Blacks in the White Establishment?: A Study of Race and Class in America,' Richard L. Zweigenhaft and G. William Domhoff] written about A Better Chance that Sylvester stars in.  Right.  So she gets A Better Chance scholarship.  So I go to A Better Chance and I say I want to go, too.  And the lady looks at me and literally she says, "Well who are you?"  "You know, I'm David Thomas [HistoryMaker David A. Thomas], you know."  She says, "Well, you know, we looked around the city for the best students and I never heard of you (laughter), right."  So my girlfriend goes off to this prep school and she writes me a Dear John letter, you know.
Speaker 1: 'Cause she met somebody in--in a--at this school or what?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it turned out that was the case as she had met somebody at this school I think, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely she, you know.  No sense in writing a Dear John letter if you ain't met nobody.  So, that day they were having interviews for students who'd want to go abroad.  Well, my German teacher had talked to me about it a few days before.  She'd talked to a bunch of us who were taking German.
Speaker 1: Is this the American Friends?
Speaker 2: Yeah, American Friends Service [sic. American Field Service; AFS Intercultural Programs], right, exactly, exactly, American Friends Service, so AFS.  So me and my buddies, we were like ah, she gotta be crazy, you know (unclear).  But--but the reason she told us we should do it was we were cracking on this guy who had done it the year before, because we were, you know, basically, you know, he was effeminate.  So, you know, we were saying, "Ah man, he's over there representing, you know, black people and blah, blah, blah and blah, blah, blah."  She said, "Well why don't you do it?"  "Oh no, I'm, you know.  You know, things are too good here, why would I want to do that."
Story_ID: 322884
Speaker 1: So anyway, I go home I get this Dear John letter.  I was in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps], so I had on my, you know, ROTC dress stuff, and I had just been made what they call sergeant major.  So anyway, so I looked like--I--I looked decorated, right.  So I turned around and I walk into this interview for this.  'Cause I just walk in, I tell the lady who's running it, look I--I've decided I wanna go abroad (laughter).  You know, I got this Dear John letter, I'll leave the country.  So, I go in and there's these little old white ladies interviewing, you know.  And you know, I probably looked like, you know, Colin Powell [HistoryMaker General Colin L. Powell] sitting across from 'em, you know, (laughter).  You know, all patriotic.  The next thing you know, you know, I went through the local, I got selected, at the regional I got selected, the national I got selected.  And the next thing you know they were offering me to go abroad, and I kind of stepped back and said well you know, by this point in time, of course, I had a new girlfriend who actually is my wife now.  And everything was, you know, gelling, but I thought for a moment, you know, and I said, you know, it's time for me to go.  You know, just something in me said it's time for me to go.  And I left my junior year [at Paseo High School; Paseo Academy of Fine and Performing Arts, Kansas City, Missouri] and went abroad.  And that changed my life.
Speaker 2: In what way?
Speaker 1: A couple of ways.  First thing that happened was just before I left I met a guy named Arthur Bronson [ph.], who was a Communist and a black guy.  And he was involved in this youth summer job program that I had been involved in, that I had worked for.  And I worked in the office, me and my brother 'cause we--we--we had actually helped--we were part of the student group, student activist group that led to this being formed because Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] had cut--there had been a budget cuts in the CETA [Comprehensive Employment and Training Act] programs that used to give summer jobs for--for black kids in urban areas basically.
Speaker 2: Yeah the summer youth program, right?
Speaker 1: Summer youth program, right.
Speaker 2: You get jobs cleaning up.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Youth Service Program, YSP.
Speaker 1: Exactly, so the cut 'em.  And we put together this protest thing that led to the mayor's office creating another jobs program.  And so we became like the students who worked in the office of this program.  And mostly teachers and guys in college, you know, worked there in the summer running the program.  So this guy named Arthur Bronson, you know, he kind of adopts me and some other kids, and you know, we just start hanging out and he starts talking to me about--talking to us about, you know, politics and class and race, and stuff in America, you know.
Speaker 2: Now, was he--he was with the project over the summer?
Speaker 1: He was, yeah, he was working for the summer project for the jobs program.  It was called Job Opportunity for Youth, JOY.
Speaker 2: Was he a student who had just come out--out of school or something?
Speaker 1: Artie, yeah, Artie had dropped out of college and gotten married and was sort of, you know, or he had dropped out of being a full-time student.  So he was kind of going to school part time and working, and doing this political organizing.  And, you know, I just found his analysis of the dynamics of the country very interesting.  So he gave me these books to take to France with me.  And they were by Che Guevara, Ho Chi Minh, you know and the Vietnam War was going on and--and--and I was starting to come to the conclusion that there was something wrong with this war.  You know, and because I had been in ROTC and my cousin had gone to Vietnam and, you know, my father [Jesse Thomas] valued the [U.S.] military.  You know, I--I actually had thought about applying to West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York] or to the Navy Academy [United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland] when I was a junior in--in--in college.
Story_ID: 322885
Speaker 1: So anyway I go to France and there's lots of Vietnamese people in France, you know, and the French were def- the French were, you know, by then against the war [Vietnam War] and the United States.  And I'm reading these books and so, you know, I created a very different sense of the world and the U.S. in the world.  And the role of the African American struggle in the world.  And at the same time, I'm--I--I go to France, I had studied German, I didn't know how to speak a word of French.  And--and in this program you go live with a family, you don't live with other, you know, American students, not like a college foreign exchange program.  And I'm living in this small town trying to learn a language that I didn't--I--I hadn't studied for one day in my life, right.  And so, I spent a lot of time reading.  And most of the people that I was attracted to were people who were interested in kind of bigger picture, intellectual and political kinds of things.  And I had always had that bent to me, but you know, I didn't have much, you know, my friends, you know, they didn't want to sit around and talk about how the world works, you know, and we were being, you know, poorly educated in our, you know, in our schools and stuff.  And just before I left the country, I read a book called 'Manchild in the Promised Land' [Claude Brown].
Speaker 2: Yeah, by Claude Brown, right?
Speaker 1: By Claude Brown.  And--and that book hipped me to, you know, the fact that there were a set of dynamics that swirled around black men that led to self-destruction, right.  So all this stuff is happening and I go to France, you know, and--and it allows me to sort of put all this together.
Story_ID: 322886
Speaker 1: And then this counselor that I had in high school [Paseo High School; Paseo Academy of Fine and Performing Arts, Kansas City, Missouri], she was getting ready to retire, and she was responsible for putting every black man from Kansas City [Missouri] who had ever gone to Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] and at that time there had only been four.  She was the person who had been their counselor and put them there.  She was getting ready to retire, and she wanted to put one more.  So, she got me and a guy who was one of my best friends, a guy named Oscar Donahue [Oscar Donahue III] to apply.  And Oscar had been drum major, president of the class, you know, chief bottle washer, you know, I mean, everything.  And you know, I--you know I was good, you know, but I wasn't that--it just wasn't my MO [modus operandi], and I know that had I not gone to France, right, that going to France is what gave me the nod, you know.  And if I hadn't gone to France, I was going, you know, by then I had decided that I was going to go to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], you know, 'cause the guy down the street had gone to Morehouse and Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had gone to Morehouse.  So I was like, Martin Luther King.  Then I was like now since this cat gets in, I'm--I'm pretty sure I can go, that's where I was going and I probably wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't have come on my counselor's screen, you know.  'Cause it was another one of those, she knew I was a good student and all that, but you know, she didn't see me as a kid, you know, with the fire in the belly.  And--and she fell in love with my mother [Jewel Nichols Thomas].  Because I had to go to France, you know, there was a lot of stuff that the counselor had to do.  So she spent a lot of time then with my parents, you know, and I think saw, you know, what the--my depth through dealing with me, you know more intimate way and dealing with my family.   And, you know, that's how I wound up at Yale.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So--so what year is this?  This is 19--
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-four [1974].  September '74 [1974], I arrive at Yale, and I graduated in 1978.
Story_ID: 322887
Speaker 1: What was Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] like for you?  And how big a change was that?  Now you go from, basically from Kansas, which is used as a--as the--it's probably unfair, but is used as the most boring place in the United States.  I mean people, you know, Dorothy leaves Kansas to go to Oz, never come back to Kansas.  You know, everything is in black and white from Kansas.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm in Kansas City, Missouri.
Speaker 1: Now that's a little bit lateral.  That's where there's some crazy little old women that leaves and all that.
Speaker 2: But--but yeah, you're right.
Speaker 1: But you leave Kansas, you--you go all the way to Germany, I mean, you go to Europe.
Speaker 2: I go to France.
Speaker 1: France when you're--yeah, France as a student and then you come--and then the next year you go off to, you know, Yale.  So this is--is a lot of growing going on in this period of time I guess.
Speaker 2: Right.  So what was Yale like?  You know, Yale was a place that, academically, I was unprepared for, and the only--but the good news was I never knew it.  And you know, the good news was that, you know, my mother [Jewel Nichols Thomas] had taught, you know, my mother through words and my father [Jesse Thomas] through his--just his own behavior had taught me, you know, doesn't matter what other people think, never give up on yourself.  You know, the question is just are you doing your best.  Can you say you did your best?  So, all that to say, I get into English class at Yale, and I'm getting Ds; you had to write a paper every week.  I'm getting Ds on my papers.  You know, they come back totally marked up with green and red ink.  And--and I--I have this teacher named Jane Levin, but--but the class is a seminar, and we're reading Shakespeare [William Shakespeare], and we're reading Jane Austen, and these books that I had never read.
Speaker 1: So they never read those in high school [Paseo High School; Paseo Academy of Fine and Performing Arts, Kansas City, Missouri] either?
Speaker 2: No, we never read those in high school.
Speaker 1: No Shakespeare in high school?
Speaker 2: In high school I had never seen Shakespeare.  Never seen Shakespeare, never--never read any--'til I went to France, I had never read a--a--a book by a philosopher like Plato or anybody (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That--that's quite an indictment of Kansas City school system--
Speaker 2: Oh, hey--
Speaker 1: Because, I mean, I grew up in a black community, I mean, other people I have talked to had Shakespeare in school.
Speaker 2: Yeah right, no, no--
Speaker 1: They read 'Romeo and Juliet' [William Shakespeare], read 'Macbeth' [William Shakespeare] at least.
Speaker 2: Right, right, no, none.
Speaker 1: But no--none.
Speaker 2: None.  No, yeah, no.  It was--it was mis-education on a monumental scale.  And I was one of the best students they produced (laughter).  Imagine what it meant to be average there in terms of how prepared you were.

Speaker 1: So anyway, I--surely I'm getting these Ds and Fs.  I do not know how to use a comma, literally, okay, literally.  I write run-on sentences, no commas.  So I go to the teacher [Jane Levin].  Now, but in the seminars that were--'cause I'm reading the books, and I come in in the discussions, I'm in the discussions and you know, I've been--now I've been to France.  I probably wrote--probably at that point I wrote better in French than I wrote in English in terms of--in terms of--in terms of grammatics.  I've been to France, you know, I've got this world view.  I wrote a paper about 'The Tempest' [William Shakespeare] that is an analysis--an anal- it was an analysis of the colonial and imperialist dynamics in 'The Tempest.'  Right, 'cause this, you know, this magician goes to this island where there's this guy who is a monster, and all, right (laughter) and I--I write about that--this from--through this analysis so this colonial lens.  And I'm talking about this in class, and I go see the teacher.  And the teacher says, "You know if I didn't know that you were the same person sitting in my class who wrote this paper, if I didn't know that for a fact, I would find it hard to believe, because you're very good in class.  But you know, you're producing these kind of papers.  And--but, you know, this is a writing course, so this is your grade, you know, right, this is not a class participation course, this a writing course so, you know, this is your grade."  So I look at her and I say, "Well, how do I get an A?"  And you could see her eyes kind of like, now you're like on the verge of getting an F, so why are you talking about how you get an A.  But, you know, again it's all about your expectations for yourself, right.  So I wasn't expecting to get an F, I was expecting to get an A, so I'm asking about my expectations.  So long story short, she becomes a supporter of mine, and she basically says, 'cause you had to write a paper every week, we we're talking about four weeks in, you know, right, I've gotten these Ds.  And she says, "Well, I'll tell you what we'll do, I'll make your grade based on your last six papers.  And so basically you've got this twelve-week course, you got two more weeks to warm up and then the clock's going to start and that will be your, your grade is going to based on those.  But, you know, right, like this is the gap you got to fill."  So I stayed--I would stay up 'til four--four o'clock in the morning writing what essentially was a three-page paper, right, and just figuring out the grammatics, the spe- you know, how you put it together.  End of the course I got a B.  So I went from Ds to Bs.  And I remember, you know, my first grade card, my first set of grades there I got two Bs and two Cs.  And another class that I took I had the same--same--same dynamic which was, I was struggling, I mean, I was struggling.  And I would go see the teacher every day, and it was--it was calculus.  Now all the other kid--'cause that was the lowest math you could take at Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] was calculus.  All the other kids in the class had had calculus in high school, and they were taking that course because, you know, that--that was their easy course where they hadn't done--they didn't like math or you know, but the most, they had had it.  And my teacher couldn't believe I'd never had any calculus, you know, right.  He's like, you never had any calculus.  You know, yeah you know.  So, you know, I think in that class too I got a B, and I can't remember the other two classes I took.  Excuse me.  And it was funny because four years later when I was ge- about to graduate, a guy who had flunked out, a brother, comes up to me and he says, "You know, I owe you an apology."  I said, "Why?"  He said, "You know, when we were freshmen," and he had flunked out and then he had come back.  He said, "You know, when we were freshmen, we were in the same math class and I looked around the room and I--I--I--I predicted that you wouldn't last the year at Yale."  I said, "Why?"  He said, "'Cause you were always asking questions, you know."  And that's, you know, the way I sort of approached it, right, if I didn't know something I wasn't embarrassed, you know, and I.  And by the time I left Yale, you know, I was basically an A student, you know.  I think it got one bad grade in my entire, like one D and the reason I got the D was I didn't take the midterm, 'cause I took my now wife to Bermuda (laughter).  So I missed the test and I didn't make it up, and I was a senior.
Story_ID: 322889
Speaker 1: So you all stayed together all that time, even though, now--now, where did she [Thomas' wife] go, did she go to college there?
Speaker 2: My wife went to many colleges.  She--my wife was very smart.  In high school, she like--like, you know, got this award for being one of the top women in high school and that kind of stuff.  She left high school when she was a junior and went to community college, 'cause they had a program where you--you--technically she was sti- she was doing her senior year but she did it at the junior--at the, whatever it is, the community college.  But, and then she went to a few other schools, but she never finished.  And, you know, I think part of it was, you know, she didn't have anybody who had really high expectations of her.  And her mother was a single mother with four boys and her.  And her brothers like, you know, their lives read like some set of statistics about the pathologies of black males in America, prison, drugs, you know, disease, right.  And her mother is managing all that.  It was kind of, her and her mother were like a team.  And she didn't want to leave her mother, you know, and she was working and going to school and you know, all that kind of stuff.  But, yeah, she's, you know, very smart, did very well in high school.  But also, you know, went into college with the same lack of preparation, you know, that anybody who got educated, where we got educated, but that most of us had but didn't have the time to focus and you know, didn't have the drive, the personal drive.  You know, but, yeah, all that, but--but--but that said, yeah we stayed together, we kept hanging out.
Speaker 1: But you all stayed together the whole--that's--that's a big distance to cover, you know, from Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] to Kansas City, Kan- I mean Missouri [Kansas City, Missouri].  That's a long way.  So, you know, that's something.  You don't hear those kind of stories anymore hardly about how people meet in high school and stay together the rest of their lives.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you really don't.  I don't hear that many even from older people.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, at least not the stay together part (laughter) or the still together part.
Story_ID: 322890
Speaker 1: From what I've read about you, and it hadn't been a whole lot, the stuff that we got from you and there's not much biographical information, but--but I take it that you had a mentor, you know, somebody that--that you learned from.  Was it--was that at the undergraduate level or the?
Speaker 2: No.  Well I--I, well, I take that back.  I actually had mentors and I think--I think this is also part of why, you know, things turned out well for me.  I would say that I had mentor--important mentors start, you know, I mean the first one was my father [Jesse Thomas] who really--you know, like what I say is, if--when I die my kids say what I say about my father then that's how I know I will have been successful, right.  And I still don't know, I've tried to be as good a father as I can be, but I still don't know if I've been that good.
Story_ID: 322891
Speaker 1: You said you had no mentors on the undergraduate level here [sic. at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But you said your father [Jesse Thomas] was a good mentor.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father was a good mentor and then when I got into high school [Paseo High School; Paseo Academy for Fine and Performing Arts, Kansas City, Missouri], I met this guy named Al Winder [Allen Winder].  And Al had gone to college in Kansas City [Missouri] and then he played pro ball for a year, basketball.  Then he come back to Kansas City to work.  And he was the head of something called the mayor's office on youth opportunity.  And when we got involved in that jobs program that I was telling you about.
Speaker 1: JOY [Job Opportunity for Youth], right.
Speaker 2: JOY, that was under Al's office.  And Al became a kind of mentor and role model and--and influenced me in lots of ways, especially around discipline when it came to work and women and--and fun.  You know, and I remember one day Al brought me in his office and he said, like fine women worked in his office, super fine.  And Al said, "You see all these women?"  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "I can have any one of 'em, but I don't, 'cause you never shit where you eat" (laughter).  Right, you know, and he would just, you know, hit me with the little, you know, things that always, you know, stayed in my mind, you know or like, you know, you get the work done first.  You know, we'd go with him somewhere and be hanging out, you know, and he'd say, "See all these cats here."  "Yeah."  You know, "What's the difference between me and them," 'cause we're all hanging, you know, you know.  And he'd say, "Difference is, all my work is done and that's--now I'm hanging out.  Right, that's, you know," and you know, and--and you're watching him do it, and he's a young cat and you know.
Story_ID: 322892
Speaker 1: So, I got to college, I actually did have a mentor in college, but not around--but he wasn't a professor.  He was a guy named Glenn de Chabert.
Speaker 2: How do you spell that now, that's?
Speaker 1: De Chabert, D-E-capital C-S-H-A-B-E-R-T [sic. de Chabert], Glenn de Chabert.
Speaker 2: Okay, de Chabert, okay.  Glenn de Chabert?
Speaker 1: Glenn de Chabert and Glenn was from New York.  He had been one of the leaders of the May Day protest at Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].  And by the time I got to Yale, he was a black guy, Glenn was working in minority admissions at Yale.  He was the director of minority admissions at Yale.  (Cough) Excuse me.  And he met me, he was very brash, a fab--a great dresser, you know.  And Glenn met me and he knew all about me and he--and he told me, he said, you know, basically I'm the guy that got you in here.  He says, you know, I'm the guy who got you in here.  I didn't quite know what that meant, 'cause you know he's the head of minority recruitment, minority admissions, so you know, wasn't that true for anybody you got in.  Later, I went and I found my--I was working in the admissions office, and I found my admissions file.  And it turned out that the first time I went through the admissions committee, they rejected me.  Second time I went through the admissions committee, they waitlisted me, third time they waitlisted me.  Fourth time, they admitted me.  I only got an admitted letter.  So I never knew that my case had been reviewed so many times.  So now that, you know, right I've been in, you know, in a university for a long time, is what that means is there was somebody who kept resurrecting my case (laughter), right, you know, yeah, right.  In the face of the majority of people not getting it, right, I mean that--that's the way it works, right, they reject you once, somebody's got to bring you back to life.  You get waitlisted, somebody's got to keep you at the head of the line, right.  And I ultimately got in.  So now it's pretty clear to me that it must've been Glenn and that's what he meant by, you know, I got you in here.  And he took me under his wing, not around the academics, but around the politics of the institution.
Story_ID: 322893
Speaker 1: So at Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] I was a student activist, I was head of the black student's union, which name was called BSAY, the Black Students at Yale [sic. Black Student Alliance at Yale].  And at that time, the organization was going through a big crisis and there was a--there was a group of students that I was part of, and we thought that the Black Student Alliance at Yale should be an organization focused on the political needs and challenges of blacks at Yale, but also black people in the community around Yale and New Haven [Connecticut], and in the black diaspora.  And there was another group that thought that, you know, we should be basically a social group for black students at Yale.  And we had also decided that people shouldn't, just because you're black shouldn't mean automatic membership in the Black Student Alliance at Yale.  That you needed to declare that you were a member, right.  And other people thought, no.  If you're black, you should be a black.  So when--so--so when the Black Student Alliance has elections, you know, if you want to get elected you could just go and get all your buddies who'd never come to a Black Student Alliance meeting and have them vote for you and disappear so, you know, that was kind of dynamics we used to have.  So at the end of the day, the folks, like me, we won.  Well, we had a vote and basically we voted in these membership requirements, you know, we invited everybody come to the meeting, people didn't show up, we vote 'em in.  Well that--that created this huge split in the black community.  And another group formed in opposition to us called the Black Student Union [BSU].  And I became the head of the Black Student Alliance the year, well basically six months after the split happened.  So I was the person who headed the organization through all this turmoil and you know, and--and--and we used to have a lot of lock horn interactions and meetings with the administration, and Glenn [Glenn de Chabert] was kind of like my--my mentor, you know.  But what Glenn was good about was teaching me about how power actually works.  And you know, the--the importance of, you know, not--not coming to the table as a powerless person.  You know, even if the only power you have is just the power that resides in your personal being and you know, your willingness to put truth to power, and you know.  And long story shorter, the BSU, the group that was in opposition to us, they wound up disbanding and going into disarray and you know.  And at the end of the day, you know, we had breathed life back into the Black Student Alliance at Yale.
Story_ID: 322894
Speaker 1: Those were days, as I recall when black student organizations were kind of in a crisis of identity and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly, 'cause the easy work was done, you know, right.
Speaker 1: And also there was a feeling, I know in the mid-'70s [1970s] that students were--they--it became even more dramatic later from people I've talked to since, you know, that the school administrations actually were trying to dissuade black students from joining the black organizations and trying to get them focused on career path type organizations rather than the political type.  I mean that was really what, you know, it kind of boiled down to.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah--I think yeah that was definitely the trend in the '80s [1980s] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Personal success being, yeah, personal success being put upon rather than, you know, the activism.
Speaker 2: Yep, yep.  So anyway, yeah, so--so Glenn [Glenn de Chabert] was a mentor of mine in that period.  I didn't have any professors that I ever became close to in my time as an undergrad.
Speaker 1: Were any of the black professors involved with the students some? You know--
Speaker 2: There were--there were black professors involv--
Speaker 1: I was trying to think who was at Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] then and I'm drawing a blank, I'm sure.
Speaker 2: Well you had Robert Stepto, you had a guy named Charles Davis, ran the Afro--the African American studies program there.  You had a guy named Hardy Frye who was there for a while.  There's a tall guy who's a historian, not--John Blassingame.
Speaker 1: John W. Blassingame.  Now he's the probably major figure from Yale that people would identify with in the black community.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The writer of 'The Slave Community[: Plantation Life in the Antebellum South,' John W. Blassingame].
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was a star at most of the black history gatherings in those days.  John W. Blassingame.  And I think he's passed now, I think he did.
Speaker 2: I think that's right, yeah, yeah, John has passed.  Willie Ruff taught music there.  Then there were lots of people who came through at different points in time, Skip Gates [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.], who's here, was--used to be on the faculty there.  Cornel West was on the faculty at the Divinity School [Yale Divinity School, New Haven, Connecticut] in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: They were young guys, really good guys in those days.
Speaker 2: Yep, right.  Yep.  So then I graduated, and then I came back to Yale to do my Ph.D.  And--and had the exact opposite experience that I had when I was an undergrad.
Story_ID: 322895
Speaker 1: Now, we don't want to skip going to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], right, 'cause you went to, didn't you go to Columbia next?
Speaker 2: Yeah I did go to Columbia.  Well, what happened was, I left Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] and went to New York [New York] to work.  And I worked a few months at Columbia at Columbia Teachers College [Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, New York] for a guy named Edmund Gordon doing research for him.  And he ran something called the Race Desegregation Centers.  He had this huge contract from the st- from the government to run the Race Desegregation Centers at Columbia Teachers College.  And I worked for him.  And then I got a job working--I also worked at a place called Boy's Harbor [Boys & Girls Harbor, New York, New York] doing research on alcohol, basically kids and alcohol abuse.  And--and we were--we were doing a study of the effects of this program that was designed to teach kids not to use drugs and alcohol.  This peer education program.  And then a buddy of mine who I met just before I left Yale, who became a real, probably the most important professional mentor I had.  This guy named Leroy Wells [Leroy Wells, Jr.], who was the first person to get a Ph.D. from Yale's program in administrative science, then later was called organizational behavior, which is what--which is what I got my Ph.D. in.
Speaker 1: Now he's important.  You dedicate your book ['Breaking Through: The Making of Minority Executives in America,' David A. Thomas and John J. Gabarro] to him?
Speaker 2: I dedicated my book to him.
Speaker 1: And from what I understand, I had to read about him, 'cause (laughter) I saw his name.  He was a--he was a Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] professor later on, right?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, right.
Speaker 1: Things have been named for him and you know, there's a conference named for him now?  Yeah, so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--so Leroy was a Ph.D. student.  And we met my last like, I guess I graduated in May, we must've met in March.  And, you know, just took to each other.  So he offered me a job doing just some--some annotated bibliography for him for some paper he was--he had gotten a grant to write and from the National Institute of Health [National Institutes of Health (NIH)] or someplace.  And so, he put me in touch with this place called Operation Get Ahead [Hempstead, New York] and they needed a director.  They were about to be defunded 'cause they were having lots of problems.  Nobody would take the job.  So he told them to come--he told them about me and told me to go interview with them.  And told me don't tell 'em how old I am, I think 'cause he had told 'em I was older than I was.  I was only twenty-one.  And they hired me to be the director.
Speaker 1: And so Operation Get Ahead was looking for a head, (laughter) you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah right, and they got me.  And it was--it was a--a program that did counseling, group counseling for at-risk youth out on Long Island [New York], in Hempstead, Long Island [New York] and Roosevelt [New York], Long Island and Westbury [New York] which is another town out on Long Island we had programs running.  And everybody who worked in this program was--I guess the closest person to my age was thirty-one, I was twenty-one.  And I went out and this thing was about to be defunded and we turned it around in six months.  And in--by the end of the next year, we were--we were getting grants from New York State to run larger programs.  Well, we were--we were under the umbrella of this larger organization called the Long Island Minority Alliance or the Long Island Alliance of Minority Group Leaders [sic. Long Island Minority Alliance].
Story_ID: 322896
Speaker 1: And I was going to go to--back to graduate school and I had applied to Columbi- I had applied to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] and I had--had applied to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and I had applied to Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].  I got rejected at Yale to Ph.D. program at Yale; I got rejected at Yale and--
Speaker 2: Now why do you suppose that's, you know, would seem like Yale would bring its own along, you know, but?
Speaker 1: Well--well the reason why there was--this is interesting, a couple of reasons.  One, you know, even though I finished undergraduate school strong, I mean, I finished strong, right, I had, you know, my junior--my--my freshman and sophomore years, you know, my grades were sort of, you know, some As, some Bs, some Cs.  So my overall grade point average was about a 3.35, which is fine if you want to go to business school, but not, you know, the way Ph.D. programs at places like Yale see themselves as, you know, this is where the really smart people go.
Speaker 2: So everybody's a 4.0?
Speaker 1: So everybody, yeah, in their vie- right, in their minds everybody is a 4.0.  And what was interesting though was, the guy who was mentor, this guy Leroy Wells [Leroy Wells, Jr.], that's where he had gotten his Ph.D., so he recommended me to the program.  And, excuse me, what later became known to me was that he really struggled in that program to get through.  He became a star, but like, you know, it took him years to write his Ph.D.  So I think that part of the issue was, you know, he didn't have enough creditability himself on this sort of academic side, like is this going to be another struggling black guy getting through here.  The other thing that happened was again, you know, I later when I--once I--'cause--'cause what's going to happen in a year from that point when they reject me is they admit me.  So I--I later found out that two of my references, one guy--this guy--this guy wrote a reference that said, David Thomas [HistoryMaker David A. Thomas], great guy, but this is a black professor.  David Thomas, you know, he's a great guy and da-da-da-da-da, but I don't see him having the ability to create new knowledge, you know, right.  He's good--he's good at politics and he's good at institutional stuff, but I don't see him as a scholar.
Speaker 2: But that and third-grade math are the things that (laughter) you can't do, right?
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, yeah, right, right.  So this guy says this in--in--in his letter.  He then--he then insults the program and says but, you know, maybe he'll be good in your program, 'cause you guys are into, you know, more applied stuff.  Right, so that nixed it.  And then a guy who wrote me a letter who also was in that program and got his Ph.D., who had been a professor of mine when he was a graduate student, he wrote me a letter and later was stopped on the street by one of the people in the program, by--by one of the professors in the program, 'cause now you know they are about to reject me.  So my--Leroy's mentor calls him and says, you know, we're about to reject, I don't know if David Thomas is gonna get in, it's on the fence.  So they go to another guy named Rick Guzzo [Richard Guzzo], Guzzo, who by this point is a professor at NYU [New York University, New York, New York] or someplace.  And they say, "Rick, you wrote a good letter for David Thomas."  He says to them, "I wrote a good letter for him but I didn't know he was applying here."  'Cause--'cause what you would do back then at Yale was if--you--if you had a good outing with a professor you would ask them to write a letter that would go into a general file that you could use to send anywhere, 'cause that was back when everybody was going to law school and med school, you know.  And he says--so he basically says, "He's good, but he's not in our league."  So, that's how I got rejected.
Story_ID: 322897
Speaker 1: So I get into Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], but not in the Ph.D. program.  I get into Harvard for a master's [degree] and I get into Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] for a master's.  I go to my boss, and I tell him I'm going to Harvard.  He says to me, 'cause by this point I run--I'm running two or three programs for them [Operation Get Ahead, Hempstead, New York] 'cause we got these grants and we got the basic program that I was running.  And we've turned it around, it's getting accolades, da-da-da-da-da, right.  And you know, I'm this young kid just kind of doing his thing.  Staff, we'd built a great staff.  And so he said, "Look I don't care if you--I don't care if you--when you come to work if you can keep this thing going.  Go to school, take the schedule you want, just make this thing continue to hum."  Right, 'cause--'cause he remembers when it was under water.  So I'm like wow.  So I go to Columbia and stay in New York [New York], 'cause I was living in New York City right down the street from Columbia and I would commute out to the Long Island [New York].  So I go to school and--and it's a two-year program, but I'm able to create a schedule that allows me to do it in a year.  'Cause Columbia has no rules, right.  You know, they just say it's a two-year program, but they didn't know why it was a two-year program, you know, other than the fact that, you know, most people can't take that many courses in a year.  So I take it, and I get straight A's.  And I reapply to Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].  And I go up to see my--a guy who becomes my mentor, who was Leroy's [Leroy Wells, Jr.] mentor named Clay Alderfer [Clayton Alderfer], white guy.  Clay is the most straight-forward honest person I have ever met in my life.  So Clay sits down, and Clay says, "Look you didn't get in, and I agreed with the decision," right.  He says, "I agree with the decision."  So we have this long talk at the end of which he says, what are your grades going to be at Columbia.  'Cause I hadn't gotten all my grades in.  And I said they should be five A's and maybe a B, 'cause I was taking six courses, something like that.  He says to me, "If you get five A's or something like this."  He says, "You know, if you get four A's and you reapply, we won't make the same mistake twice."  And so I got the grades, and I reapplied and got in.  And everybody acted like they had never rejected me, right, like I was a different person.  The other thing that they had said to me was, I was good but the class they had let in that year was just off the charts.  Right, they said that to me too.  You know, just the competition that year was just, you know, off the charts.  And so anyway, you know, so I finished Columbia.
Story_ID: 322898
Speaker 1: So you got a master's [degree] in philosophy?
Speaker 2: I got a master's in organizational psychology at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] which was this joint program between the business school and the psychology department.
Speaker 1: Psychology department, okay.
Speaker 2: Yep, and then I went off to Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], and that's where I got a masters of arts and then a master's in philosophy and then my Ph.D. in organizational behavior.
Speaker 1: That seems--seems like kind of a odd combination of--now did you--what was your objective.  I mean, did you have a real clear idea of where you're gonna with this.  I mean behavioral psychology?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well--
Speaker 1: Philosophy and--and business, was it, business administration?
Speaker 2: Organizational behavior.
Speaker 1: O- organizational behavior, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now how did--how did all these mesh up in terms of career goal, I mean?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I'm a--I'm a--careers are interesting thing.  You can see careers from the vantage point of paths or you can see careers from the vantage point of themes.  Right, so some of us pursue a path for the path's sake--
Speaker 1: It's like I want to be a doctor somehow I'll do this, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I want to be a doctor.  I want to be a lawyer.
Speaker 1: I want to be a fireman or whatever I want to do.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, from the time I was about five, I thought I wanted to be--about five, maybe five or six or seven, but definitely by the time I was, you know, the civil ri- I was aware of the Civil Rights Movement and stuff so, you know, ten, maybe young.  But I remember Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] coming to Kansas City [Missouri] in 1963 and my parents [Jewel Nichols Thomas and Jesse Thomas] taking us to Municipal Auditorium [Kansas City, Missouri] to see Martin Luther King speak, and the place was packed.  But anyway, I wanted to be a lawyer.  And I wanted to be a lawyer in part because, you know, I saw two kinds of people shaping the Civil Rights Movement, lawyers and preachers, right.
Speaker 1: So the question is right now, why not a preacher?
Speaker 2: Well here's--here--well why not a preacher, I like sinning too much (laughter).  They didn't seem to be having that much fun, and when they did, you know, it got 'em in trouble, you know, right, so, right.  And but I--when I got in college I realized that, you know, I wasn't pursuing, I actually wasn't pursing a path, I was pursuing a theme and the theme was changing the world.  So I saw lawyers, right, 'cause I'm connecting 'em to the Civil Rights Movement as leading the change in the world.

Speaker 1: This story--you had a story about how--how you use the--I was asking you when we broke about how--how all--you're career path was coming together and you started to tell me, and then we came up with this story about how you used course work at Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] to inform the activities in the Black Student Organization.  You had a story you're going to tell me.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, right.  And this story I was about to tell you was that--'cause you asked me if I had taken any courses in community organizing--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --and I was saying that the courses that I had to take for my major in undergrad were courses, a lot of which, addressed group dynamics, the sociology of organizations, organizational change.  And I would learn stuff in class and then go try it out in my role as chair of the Black Student Alliance at Yale [BSAY].  And for example, I remember once learning about how, you know, when groups don't have a clear mission and they're in trouble, they tend to--the members of the group tend to turn on each other, right, and that's how they implode.  And I remember, you know, we were fighting each other in the group and you know, blaming, you know, people for, you know, not doing this, not doing that, not doing this.  And I remember coming back and getting the group to focus on the fact that, you know, what we hadn't acknowledged was that we weren't being very effective at getting our agenda met, at--at meeting our organizational objectives.  And so rather than focus on what wasn't working, you know, and making ourselves more effective, we were starting to focus on who was screwing up.  In which case, everybody could point a finger at everybody else, right, and we were--you know, and I just--I just came in, you know, and made that observation and it was like, wow, you know, and boom we shifted our dynamic, right.
Story_ID: 322900
Speaker 1: So I had lots of moments of, you know, using that stuff in my same thing when I took over this community-based organization, Operation Get Ahead [Hempstead, New York].  Everybody was older than me, but what I had were these theories and notions about how you organize, you know, and I remember I came in and I made an assessment of the organization, which was that the people were very competent at working with the kids, but the organization had been so poorly managed that what everybody had done was to detach themselves from the sinner, from the coordinating mechanism, and everybody was out running their own version of Operation Get Ahead.  And they were doing a heck of a job, but nobody in the center of the organization, the people who were supposed to be managing it knew what was going on.  So the funders couldn't figure out what was going on, right.  And so, you know, my theory was that I didn't have to become an expert at delivering the service, that what I had to do was to create a center that would draw people back in because they started to trust it, and then they would share the information about what was going on in the field and also be more open to the funders.  You know, 'cause there would be stuff like a counseling session was supposed to be going on at Hempstead High School [Hempstead, New York].  Well, three weeks before, the counselor had changed the schedule because maybe half the students were playing ath- some athletic sport and the fall schedule didn't work for the winter.  So they would change the schedule but wouldn't tell anybody back at the central office.  And they would give funders the schedule and these funders would show up unannounced to make sure the sessions were going, you know, are the curriculums which--I mean all kinds of things.  So--so all that, you know, stuff came out of, you know, what I learned about organizations and organizing and likewise, you know, how we--we--we had to do some things to organize support in the community.  So, so I didn't have formal training in community organizing, but this stuff I was learning was all applicable, you know, it's just when they taught it to us, they usually were talking about businesses, but you know, I saw it.  So--so--so anyway, you know, back to your question about how this comes together as a career was, you know, I realized that I didn't really want to be a lawyer, I wanted to change the world.  Then I realized in college, after I got up close on some of what lawyers do, that that's not actually not what lawyers do (laughter).  Most lawyers catch society's problems after the fact, you know.  So if I'm, you know, you know, it's kind of like the reality is most people wind up in criminal court they've done something.  Now they may not have done what the police said they did and there may be--there may even be good reasons for, you know, that you could exp- mitigating circumstances for why they did what they did, but what most lawyers do on a daily basis isn't gonna help with those conditions that created those circumstances, right.  They may help a person, you know, make sure that--that they get treated equitably and that, you know, they--they get justice and all those other things, but it's not gonna have a lot to do with what caused those problems.  So I want to change the world.  And my experience running Operation Get Ahead was that, you know, the stuff that I had learned actually was useful to help make change.  You know, 'cause I'd gone in and changed this organization and now we were delivering better, and you know.  And what I really like doing, 'cause I was able to do that job, the funders asked me to go out to other community organizations that were in trouble and help them, you know, advise them about how we turned Operation Get Ahead around.  And I really loved that.  So mo- being able to move from, you know, kind of practice to then theorizing about what I learned from it and then teaching it or sharing it with other people.  So my buddy, who had gotten his Ph.D. who--who was then trying to finish his Ph.D., Leroy Wells [Leroy Wells, Jr.], Leroy talked me into seriously considering getting a Ph.D.  And you know, as I was saying before, that's when I applied to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] and Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], and you know, got into Columbia and Harvard and went--did the master's [degree].  And then got into Yale in 1981.
Story_ID: 322901
Speaker 1: At Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] you worked on a master's [degree] in philosophy and in a--in a--
Speaker 2: Well what it is, the masters of philosophy is the degree, it's like a Ph.D. is a doctor of philosophy, but--but the--the subject is organizational behavior for all those.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I'm just reading it (unclear).  Okay, all right.  So, so those who study organizational behavior pretty much apply it to business, is that what it is, or is it--or is that right?
Speaker 2: It's mostly taught in business schools.  So--so and--and yeah, mo- most of the books and theories that are written are centered in business.  But, you know, people who are trained in organizational behavior, they teaching.  So my mentor, Leroy Wells [Leroy Wells, Jr.], he taught at the--the first place he taught was the University of Maryland's [University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland] program in community psychology.  And then, he taught at ar- he taught at--when he finished--when he died, he was teaching at Howard's communication school [Howard University School of Communications; Howard University Cathy Hughes School of Communications, Washington D.C.].  So, it applies to any kind of organizational setting.  You know, whether it's for profit, not for profit, business, professional service firms, as long as it's an organization, our--our field can be applied to it.
Story_ID: 322902
Speaker 1: Well are there any stories about, you know, getting your Ph.D. that are interesting?
Speaker 2: Yeah well, yeah, you know, like I tell people that I--I had to go back to Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] a second time to become a Yalie.  Because in my undergraduate I spent a lot of time, you know, dealing with the poli- you know, the politics of the institution and in some ways being, you know, in conflict with the institution.  I never went to a Yale-Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] game.  My picture is not in the undergraduate yearbook for the year I graduated, not--not as any protest, but just, you know, those things that had to identifying with the university weren't that important to me.  You know, like on the day I had to get my picture taken, I had like three other things I could be doing and that was just the least important, you know.  And likewise, you know, I didn't have any professors that I got close to when I was at--in the Yale program, I was at the center of the place.  You know, every plum assignment that Ph.D. students got, I go--I had at one time or another.  When I finished, you know, I was considered the top student in my program.  Several faculty members, you know, extended themselves to me and--and including this guy, Clay Alderfer [Clayton Alderfer], who became, you know, after Leroy Wells [Leroy Wells, Jr.], the most significant mentor in my life, in my career part of my life.  You know, so I was like joined with the place at the hip, you know.  And they even talked to me about staying and joining the faculty.  And I realized that, you know, feeling that support and that--and getting that mentoring was the only thing that separated me from a number of other black students who were get--in Ph.D. programs at Yale who were struggling to finish, 'cause they didn't have that support.  And the way that support manifests itself is people make you feel like you don't have to prove to them that you're smart.  You don't have to prove to them that you have--that your ideas are good.  Right, so you become confident and--and--and then they care about you enough that if you produce work that they don't think is excellent, they don't hesitate to tell you.  You know, this is junk, take it back, right.  But it's never about how smart you are.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's not a tisk, tisk, tisk, this poor guy can't do any better.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: At this point, it's like, hey if this is not good then you should--
Speaker 2: Right, it--it's Dave [HistoryMaker David A. Thomas], there is no way this could be your best work.  'Cause I know you're brilliant, you don't have to prove that to me.  So now go do your work.  Right, and it is unbelievably liberating.  'Cause what you're then also able to do is to--to do stuff that people think is basically impossible.
Story_ID: 322903
Speaker 1: So like my dissertation was a four hundred page dissertation that when I finished the first half of it, my advisor said to me, he said 'cause I had a job offer out in California.  He said to me, "You know, Dave [HistoryMaker David A. Thomas], we--we--we wi- we can give you your Ph.D. for what you've already done."  And I wasn't even finished with the study yet, right.  'Cause I had this whole qualitative study that I was doing.
Speaker 2: What was the title of your dissertation?
Speaker 1: The title of my di- you know, this is--
Speaker 2: Or what was it if you (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was--it was a study of the--the dynamics of race in mentoring and sponsorship relations in organizations.  So I created a survey that allowed me to compare the extent to which minorities and whites in this--what was then one of the Bell Telephone companies, the extent to which they had mentoring and sponsorship in their careers.  And also to answer questions like who are they most likely to have that sponsorship with, is it gonna be with the boss or is it gonna be with their boss' boss, is it gonna be with another person of color or is it gonna be with a white person.  Is it likely to be a cross-gender or same gender relationships?  What are their relationships like with their peers, when do they occur in their career, a whole host of questions, right.  And then what I did was--so that helped me to kind of answer the--the, statistically, the influence of race on sponsorship and mentoring.  Then what I wanted to look at were the dynamics of mentoring relationships, when they occur across lines of race.  So from my study I was able to identify people who had had cross racial mentoring relationships.  And then I interviewed them and I interviewed their mentors, right.  And it turned out that these were two distinct studies, either one of which could've gotten me a Ph.D.
Speaker 2: So you--you over did it?  You did what our people back in--about fifty years ago would always say you should do--work twice as hard, do twice as much?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but see here's the difference.  Most of the time when people are working out of the psychology that, because I'm black, I gotta be twice as good and do twice as much.  The reality is, that what really happens is they put in twice as much effort, but they're actually not always twice as good.  They don't always produce twice as much.  But what they know is, that they're working a hell of a lot harder.  But when you're focused on the effort, you usually are not at your best, 'cause you're trying too hard.
Speaker 2: That's an interesting distinction, but I understand what you're saying.
Speaker 1: Right.  As opposed to when you're operating from the vantage point of let me be my best, let me do it like I think it has to be done to be the absolute best, 'cause that's what I want it to be.  Not that's what I gotta do to get over white people's bar.  Totally different.  And I've--I've been in both places, right, you know, so--so I know what it's like when you're working against the tide, and I know what it's like when you're working with the tide.  So when I was at Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] as an undergrad, I was working against the tide in lots of ways, you know.  And you know, when I was in graduate school, right, I was working with the tide.  So--so anyway, you know, so--so I had just amazingly supportive experience while I was at Yale, you know, both with my faculty and also with my student colleagues, you know.  And left there feeling like, you know, I could do anything.
Story_ID: 322904
Speaker 1: Later on you become the Fitzhugh professor [H. Naylor Fitzhugh Professor of Business Administration] here--here at Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts]--
Speaker 2: At Harvard yeah.
Speaker 1: --but did you know Fitzhugh, did you ever meet him?
Speaker 2: I met him.
Speaker 1: His name H--
Speaker 2: H. Naylor Fitzhugh.
Speaker 1: H. Naylor Fitzhugh, right.
Speaker 2: Most people just know the Naylor.  But yeah, I met him my second year at the school.  'Cause he used to come back for every--the--the--the African American students at the Harvard Business School have a conference [H. Naylor Fitzhugh Conference] every year, started I think in 1971 [sic. 1972].  And he came back for every one until the year he died.  So yes, so--so I had the opportunity to meet him and talk to him on a few occasions.
Speaker 1: Now he's an interesting figure.  Can you tell us a little bit about him, you know, just for the record here?
Speaker 2: Okay.  H. Naylor Fitzhugh was the second known African American to get a Ph.D. from the Harvard Business School.  When I say known, I'm qualifying it, because we all know there are lots of black folks who just passed as white, and I'm sure there were more than a few who came through the Harvard Business School.  But he was the first.  He had been an undergraduate at Harvard College [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] back in the days when black students couldn't stay on campus.  Had graduated with honors.  His parents wanted him to go and be a doctor; he was from D.C. [Washington, D.C.], from the black middle class or upper middle class of D.C., but he decided that he wanted to go into business.  Came to the Harvard Business School, graduated with the highest honors, couldn't get a job in corporate America anywhere.  So he went back to D.C. and became a--a--a salesman, you know, in the black community.  So if you had a product, he would contract with you to sell your product in the black community, you know.  So he was kind of like a distributor.  And had a good sense about marketing.  You know, that he had concentrated a lot of his studies on when he was at Harvard Business School and wound up creating the business department at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] in what later became the nucleus of Howard University's business school [Howard University School of Business, Washington, D.C.].  And then in 1961 or '2 [1962] he went to PepsiCo and is considered to be one of the pioneers in what now, you know, we call ethnic marketing or targeted marketing.  Well, he was helping PepsiCo back in, you know, actually I think he was a consultant to them before he went to work for them, helping them, you know, figure out how to best market their products in the black community.  And black Americans have been the only ethnic group that, you know--they're the only ethnic group for whom Pepsi is their preferred drink over Coke [Coca-Cola] in the U.S.
Speaker 1: It's an interesting story behind this.  I was--I couldn't believe it.  I didn't know it for some reason, but I should have.  But, that--I read that many blacks in the South and elsewhere in the country were forbidden to drink Coke and they couldn't--they weren't serv- counters wouldn't serve them at all, but if they went to a restaurant and there was--to the backdoor even, they weren't allowed to drink Coke.
Speaker 2: Ha, that's interesting.
Speaker 1: I, you know, there's--there's a big discussion out on the Internet about it.
Speaker 2: Really?  I never heard that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, people say oh yeah I remember that.  Whites--Coke was reserved for whites in certain towns in the South.  They could not drink Coke.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Story_ID: 322905
Speaker 1: So and I also read, I don't know if you heard this story, that Fitzhugh [H. Naylor Fitzhugh] had a photograph on his wall of a white poli- white policeman beating a civil rights worker with a nightstick in one hand and a Coke [Coca-Cola] in the other.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I can believe that.  I can believe that.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I think Pepsi [PepsiCo] one time sponsored Tony Brown's show ['Tony Brown's Journal'], quite other--a number of other.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but he was--you know, what I loved about him was that, you know, at these conferences, you know, he would always, you know, have something to say and the room would just fall silent.  And he was one of these guys who would, you know, I mean he--he--he'd speak for, you know, three, four, five minutes, right, and he's in the audience and it's a Q and A, you know.  He wouldn't ask a question, he'd.  But he was always very clear that black people should never be apologetic about the fact that you were black or that you were getting an opportunity.  I remember we had this forum on affirmative action, you know, and he was like, you know, you should never act like or feel like affirmative action is some kind of stigma that you have to separate yourself from.  You know, like that's just not our issue, should not be our issue.  And you shouldn't be ambivalent about saying, you know, you are affirmative candidate, right.  As long as, you know, you're prepared to make the best of that opportunity, then you know, you treat affirmative action like white people treat networks (laughter).  You got your job because of who you knew.  Affirmative action made sure that I got in line to get the job, 'cause I didn't know anybody.  Hey, it's balancing it out.  You know, and lots of white guys who get jobs 'cause they know somebody, you know it.  They're really prepared to do that job.  So.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's hard.  That's one of the key issues I guess in advancement, it's said black people says they've been disenfranchised and kept out of a lot of functions of American life don't--don't know anybody in power.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.
Speaker 1: Nobody's been there.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  So anyway yes.  So--so Naylor was just a great kind of icon for African Americans in business.  The other thing that's interesting is after I got named to the chair I realized that over three hundred people contributed.  Now, you have to raise five million dollars.  Most chair professorships are given by a family, a wealthy family, or they're given by a business.  It's the rare thing for a chair to come about as a result of hundreds of people donating money in tribute to an individual.  So something on the order of three hundred people gave money to create this chair and in tribute.  And--
Speaker 1: How much did they have to raise?
Speaker 2: Five million dollars.  Yeah, so it's a five million dollar chair.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's quite a score.  Do you know who started that?  I mean, who--I mean who led the, I guess the effort to raise the money for the Fitzhugh chair [H. Naylor Fitzhugh Professor of Business Administration]?
Speaker 2: A woman named [HistoryMaker] Nancy Lane, who was one of--who knew Naylor Fitzhugh, I think was one of his proteges, and a guy named [HistoryMaker] Dennis Hightower, who's a well-known figure in business, he's African American.  And Jim Cash [James I. Cash, Jr.] who is a professor at the Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts], or was, he retired.  He was the first tenured black professor.
Story_ID: 322906
Speaker 1: You know, you started at the Wharton School [Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You taught at the Wharton School at Penn?
Speaker 2: Right for four years.
Speaker 1: Four years.  And then how--how did you get the call to come to Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts]?  Not that Wharton's a, you know, small potatoes, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.  Basically, a friend of mine named Herminia Ibarra, who I had gone to Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] with--
Speaker 1: Let's stop and spell that one will you (laughter)?
Speaker 2: H-E-R-M-I-N-I-A, Herminia, Ibarra, I-B-A-R-R-A.  She was in her--she--she and I had gone to graduate school together, and she's Cuban American.  And we had sort of developed a big brother-little sister relationship.  And she was on the faculty at Harvard.  And she called me up, and she said, "There's a job opening here, you should apply."   I said, yeah, you know.  Well, then I read the job announcement, it was in the paper, New York Times [The New York Times] or someplace.  And it said that they were looking for people in organizational behavior and one of the fields that they had in it that they said, you know, they were especially interested in people with expertise in and it said, you know, leadership, organizational change, careers and then it said diversity in organizations.  Well, I had never seen--and I had looked a hundreds of job announcements in my field--diversity ever mentioned, you know, job as a field of study.  So, that peaked my interest.  And she told me that, so I talked to her and she said, "Yeah, you know, they--these guys have done this study where they went around to the heads of human resources in some of the world's largest organizations, and they asked 'em what the most important issues were.  And one of 'em that kept coming up was diversity in the workplace.  And, you know, they realized they didn't have anybody doing any work on that so they just popped it into the list 'cause, you know, that's how it came up."  Okay.  So then I got a call from the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] that said that they had done a survey to--to identify people that they would want to have join their faculty who were already at other business schools and that my name was on, you know, one of the names at the top of their list and would I apply, you know, would I be interested in, you know, talking about getting a job.  So, I'm like, nah, no I'm not talking about getting a job.  So--so I was playing squash with a buddy of mine at Penn and I said, "Yeah, you know, a friend tells me, you know, apply to Harvard and Michigan called me," and he said, he said well, "Why?" And I said, "But I'd don't want those jobs."  So he says to me, he says, "Well, why are you turning around a job that's nobody's offered you.  You know, they just expressed interest in having you apply, but you don't have a job, you know, you talking like you turning down a job."  I said, "Um that's an interesting point."  And so--so--so I de- I decided to apply and I applied to both Michigan and Harvard and also wound up getting job offers at both.
Story_ID: 322907
Speaker 1: And you know, at Penn [Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] I had a really good run, but it always struck me that people were sort of surprised that I was doing as well as I was doing, you know.  And even--I had this paper that became, you know, one of my most important papers and it was on--it was related to my dissertation on race--it was a paper about race--racial dynamics in--in mentoring relationships.  And I gave the paper at a seminar at Penn and they asked me where was I planning on publishing it.  And I said I was going to publish it in Administrative Science Quarterly [ASQ], which--that was my aim.  And the people said, these are my colleagues at Penn, they said this will never get published there.  Yeah, this will never get published there.  Are--are you serious.  This is the leading journal in the field.  That--to that point in time had published in its entire forty or fifty year history had published two articles that had anything to do with race explicitly, right.  So they were like, there's no way.  Well, it did get published in that journal.  But that's just to say that, you know, there was kind of this thing of, you know, how come, you know, people aren't, you know, getting it, right.  I mean, yeah.  So when I got the job offers at--at--at Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts]--first I got the job--I--I--I got a job offer from Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  I went into the chair of my department and I said, you know, I just want to tell you, you know, I got a job offer from Michigan and there's probably going to be a job offer coming from Harvard, you know.  He said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, I heard"--he said, "I gotta go look at your resume."  Right, like why is, you know, right.  And I just--I walked out of there, I walked down to the dean's office at Penn 'cause a buddy of mine was--was the vice dean.  And I said to him, "I'm leaving.  I'm outta here."  And he ran to the dean and told the dean, and the next thing I knew all these people were flying in my office begging me to stay.  But I had just made up my mind, you know, that right, you know, that they--they--they had undervalued me.  And I had been productive, but you know, there was this sense of kind of back to my earlier point about, you know, when you're working against the tide it doesn't free you up, right.  So if you're sitting there, it's one thing, you know, right.  And--and now people are saying this will never get in ASQ, right which is the name of this journal, Administrative Science Quarterly.  Well, you know, that puts you in the frame of mind of feeling like okay, you know, I got to, you know, I can't make any mistakes as opposed to if people's reaction is, you know, if that's what's you going to do you need to focus on this, you need to focus on that, you know, this would be great, they've never published anything like this, this can go through the sound barrier, right, you know.  Good for you, right, that's totally different.  So--so in a way, you know, Harvard got on my screen because, you know, I kind of realized that, you know, there was something, I was doing great, I thought, you know, but it was kind of, you know, like back to that sixth grade teacher, you know, just hadn't called me to the blackboard, you know, (laughter), but I knew I could do the math, yeah, right, so.
Speaker 2: So that's, yeah, this--the dynamic, this--this is interesting.  This--this informs your work as well (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Hell yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, this whole thing, like I said before I can see where all this, your personal--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 2: --experiences in this have really informed what you have been doing.  So--so you did apply to Harvard and you were hired--
Speaker 1: Got the job
Speaker 2: --yeah got the job.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's right.
Speaker 2: And became assistant professor first?
Speaker 1: I became, yep, assistant professor, got promoted to associate professor in 1993, and got promoted to full professor in 1998 [sic. 1999].
Story_ID: 322908
Speaker 1: So the essence of your work is, I think maybe, can be--well the first thing that you focused on I guess in your dissertation [at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] was mentorship?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Did you continue to, you know, really focus on that?
Speaker 2: I continued to focus on that and wrote a number of papers on that topic.  A matter of fact I--I like to tell people that, you know, basically in my career I've written three blockbusters, you know, my dissertation was a blockbuster, 'cause it produced what I guess, you know.  It produced about five job offers, it probably has produced a stream of consulting that, you know, if I could add it all up over the last twenty years well over a million dollars' worth, you know, (laughter), right.  So I continue to do work in that.  And in fact, you know, right now I'm--I'm writing a paper for a--a--an anthology on mentoring.  So I continued working that.  And then that sort of blossomed into a broader interest in the development, advancement of executives of color in--in organizations of which, you know, mentoring is a piece.  And that's what led to the 'Breaking Through[: The Making of Minority Executives in Corporate America,' David A. Thomas and John J. Gabarro] book, which--which also became a blockbuster in terms of, you know, if you just kind of look at it in terms of book sales, the way that it influenced my own career arc, the consulting that's come from that.  And--and then another piece of work has to do with what are the conditions under which diversity becomes a positive resource for organizational effectiveness and performance.  And--and you know, that work has also had that same kind of flavor to it in terms of being, you know, being a core building block.  So yeah.

Speaker 1: Let's talk about the book ['Breaking Through: The Making of Minority Executives in Corporate America,' David A. Thomas and John J. Gabarro] maybe.  And it was published in the fall of '99 [1999] I guess right or did it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, winter of '99 [1999].
Speaker 1: Yeah fall, winter '99 [1999].  Okay.  And it's been--I mean, been reviewed favorably, Wall Street Journal [The Wall Street Journal] and The Boston Globe, and every--you know, so it's got the, you know, the stamp of approv- you know, it's out here, all the business schools are using this book that people are talk--talking about.  In the book you profile, not profile, but you ask questions of people who have been able to matriculate to top management positions, executive positions in major corporations in the United States.  I think about twenty people you dealt with in the book, their stories are?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, th- twenty people are the focus, you know, there's also a piece of the book that's statistical (unclear), but yeah there are twenty people--twenty executives of color whose careers we studied in depth.
Speaker 1: And you used pseudonyms and you don't use their real names or the names of the corporations.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And then we also studied along with them a comparative group of white executives and people of color who had plateaued in middle management and weren't able to break through, so that we didn't just have the stories, but we also had the comparisons.  And for each of those individuals that we called our focal people, we interviewed three or four people who knew them during the course of their career, you know, developed their--the course of their careers to get some external perspective about 'em.  So it's--so it's not just, you know, kind of your--your usual book of, you know, let me tell people's stories, but it's really kind of multifaceted study of these individuals careers, as well as the dynamics of race and careers.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.  It's more--that's a good point, it's more than just a--a inspirational stories.  We--we have a lot of books with inspirational stories about how somebody made it.  This is a study for what the difference is.  And there's a--I think you make some points about why people wind up moving laterally and as you say plateauing out rather than rising.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What--what are some of those differences just to, you know, maybe if you could sum up a couple of 'em?  People need to read the book, but.
Speaker 2: Right, people need, right, people need to read the book.  Well one, is that what we found--one of the things we found was that a--a key ingredient for people who breakthrough is having what we call a developmentally rich first stage of your career, regardless of how fast you're moving.  So, having mentors, having challenge, learning how to build a social network and--and--and developing a good reputation, and being in a part of the organization and staying in jobs that are at the core of the organization.  So ways in which people often plateau is they come in with just as much talent, but very quickly, you know, you come in as an engineer, you want to get promoted to manager and you see your white colleagues getting promoted faster than you.  You think you're doing just as good a job, you're getting good reviews, now somebody comes along and they say, "Hey Larry [Larry Crowe] I got a jo- I got a manager's job over here.  It's a--it's a engineering staff manager and so what you're going to, you know, you're going to be in charge of this engineering support function."  Well, that takes you out of the line of the core of the--of the engineering group, puts you over in a staff job.  Now the jobs that are rich in opportunity are called engineering manager, not engineering staff manager.  So--so one dynamic of plateauing is being moved too early out of the core of the organization.
Story_ID: 322910
Speaker 1: Another dynamic is in that early career, you know, not being able to find your way to get mentoring and career development and begin to develop a network.  Now so--so--so when people don't build that foundation we often find them later trying to make up for it, right, 'cause that's the spring board.  Now another dynamic of the plateauing is, excuse me, where you get a pattern of assignments that pigeon hole you.  Like, you become the guy who's good at turning around operations that aren't working, but you're never given any other kind of assignment as a middle manager.  So you're doing a good job, but it's like, you know, there's no signal to the noise, it's just what--that's what Larry does.  You know and after a while people take that for granted.  Now, you know, and all that said, right, there's also--and--and this is in the, you know, there's also, you know, dynamics that lots of people talk about that have to do with race and plateauing, like when people think about, you know, what a CEO looks like, their image, their imagination usually goes to white and male.  And now if I'm thinking about you--you and I don't have you in that path, you know, that's likely to influence my expectations if you're not somehow able to transform those and to--to intervene.  That--that frequently is what happens to people when they get into middle management.  And after a while, because people aren't thinking about you in that way, you look up and, you know, five or ten ye- five or six years have passed and now you're feeling like gee I should be moving.  You know, this felt okay to me for a while.  And then people are saying to you, "Yeah, you know, Larry [Larry Crowe] but you don't have the requisite X, Y or Z to get that general manager's job."  And then, you know, you look around and you're like, "Well, I started with Dave [HistoryMaker David A. Thomas] and then Dave and I had the same middle management job."  "Well but, you know, Dave had this assignment and this assignment and this assignment while he was a middle manager and all those things put together prepared him to go be a general manager, whereas, you know, what you basically have been doing is kind of the same middle management job the whole time."  Well, now if you want to get those experiences to put yourself on that track, you almost have to take a step back.  And--and suddenly you're at the ceiling, right.  And it's a--it's a--it's a subtle set of processes that--that frequently add up so that by the time you're ready to pu- you're ready to push against the ceiling, there actually is a case for why you don't fit, right.  But it all relates back to the fact that people didn't see you as fitting, so they didn't develop you in a way that would prepare you to fit, even though they thought you were doing fine with the job they gave you.  And with no ability to see around that corner, you know, which again is where mentoring comes into play, where your peer relationships come into play, being in the network comes into play, influences that plateauing dynamic.

Speaker 1: When you talk about people like Julie (unclear) King [ph.].  Then I mention people like Franklin Raines and Ken Chenault [Kenneth Chenault].  Are they--are their stories basically, you know, do they fit your model?
Speaker 2: Ken's story definitely fits my model.  So, you know, if you look at Ken, he went to Bain [Bain & Company], was a successful consultant there, stayed for a good amount of time, really built that foundation and then when he goes into American Express [American Express Company], he has mentors from day one, people who really want to invest in him and believe in him.  And to the point where he's even able to take a risk coming in, which is he decides not to go to the flashiest part of the organization, but to go to somewhere that, you know, really can be transformed.  Now the risk is, if he had gone there without having good mentoring and sponsorship, he could've been lost in the back water.  But because he had that, those people were then able to take what he had done and use it to justify giving him extraordinary opportunities moving forward.  So he--he definitely fits the model.  Frank is, I don't know his story as well, you know.  So, you know, and--and--and he's this kind of amalgam of law, politics, and finance.
Speaker 1: He became the head of Fannie Mae [Federal National Mortgage Association]?
Speaker 2: He became the head of Fannie Mae after having gone to be the head of OMB [Office of Management and Budget] in the Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] administration.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's a different path, you know, in a lot of ways?
Speaker 2: Yeah, slightly yeah, yeah.  And I think he mov- he had moved in and out of government a couple of times, you know, at other junctures for very brief stints.  And--and really leveraged his political connections, as well as, you know, his--his actual business acumen.
Speaker 1: Ann Fudge is a name that you know?
Speaker 2: Ann fits the model perfectly.  You know, went into marketing.  I think initially it was General Mills or one of those--one of those Generals--not--not was it the Mills?
Speaker 1: General Foods?
Speaker 2: General Foods [sic. General Mills Inc.].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, got good assignments, got identified by some key mentors who helped her to develop.  Didn't move extremely fast in the first period of her career, but was getting good assignments and then just skyrocketed for a number of years as she moved to senior management jobs.  And, you know, highly likely had she not left General Foods when she did, you know, that she would have been the CEO of--of--of General Foods.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, there's Lloyd Ward or someone you wanted me to ask you about?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We were talking about him, I think, before we even started the interview.
Speaker 2: Right, yep, yep.  Lloyd is another one who definitely fits the pattern.  Ll- Lloyd worked for PepsiCo, Frito-Lay in his early career, was identified as having talent, had people invest in him, wasn't put on--on an extraordinary fast track early on.  And then, but always managed to get very high-quality assignments that when they--when he did get promoted, he always got promotions that were significantly higher and more challenging then the job he had had before.  What frequently happens to people of color is that you'll get a promotion, but if you look at the quality of the ne- of the job you got promoted to, it's not a whole lot different than the job you had.  You know, as opposed to people like Barry [ph.] and Lloyd, who, if you look at their pattern of promotions, regardless of how quickly they came, they were always a quantum leap from one to the next.  And there's a lot of signal to other people when you get promoted in that pattern, right.
Speaker 1: It's like the movie 'How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying' (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, Lloyd--Lloyd's mistake or at least I think a piece, you know, Lloyd left Frito and went to Maytag [Maytag Corporation].  It was either Maytag or Whirlpool [sic. Maytag Corporation].  And I think, you know, initially had some success, but I think it was a business that he didn't understand as well.  You know, it's a very different kind of business, as well as the fact that, you know, he didn't understand the board dynamics that he was going to get himself into.  But I think he fits--he fits the pattern very well.
Story_ID: 322912
Speaker 1: What about the--about ethics.  There's been something called a Sarbanes-Oxley [Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002]?
Speaker 2: Sarbanes-Oxley, yep.  What do you want to know about it?
Speaker 1: Well, we were--I think we were talking before we started about the high profile that black people had when they're CEOs and how they really have to stay on their toes in this age where we've had a lot of like big corporations crash, the Enron [Enron Corporation] thing was really horrendous and messed up a whole lot of people.  We weren't in that, you know, as far as I know, but just.
Speaker 2: Right, well, [HistoryMaker] Frank Savage was on the board at Enron, but other than that, right, there weren't any black people at this, you know, at the epicenter of that scandal.  But, I guess I'm not--I'm not sure what the question is you want me to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I guess the question might be, and I don't know if you deal with this in your work or not, I haven't read the whole book ['Breaking Through: The Making of Minority Executives in Corporate America,' David A. Thomas and John J. Gabarro], you know, and I don't--that's not--it's not the subject of the book--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but is it, when--when people are trying to rise in corporate America, in corporate America you, I mean, I--my education, like yours, was largely political in school, and but I didn't see it as the most ethical place in the first place.  And trying to rise at such a--at such a--in such a environment may require you to do things that may not be the most ethical--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I mean I don't know.  I mean is there--is there--are there any--do you discuss that at all?
Speaker 2: I--I don't discuss that at all in the book, but those questions, you know, frequently come up when, you know, people--when I'm talking to people about, you know, organizations or about careers.  I also do work with--around boards of directors.  In fact, I run a conference [Black Corporate Directors Conference] every year for African Americans who are on Fortune 500 boards in Chicago [Illinois] sponsored by Ariel mutual fund company [Ariel Investments] and Russell Reynolds [Russell Reynolds Associates].  But, you know, in my view th- there--there are lots of opportunities if people want to be unethical--to be unethical in business.  But I think that--that the same is true, you know, if you look on the not for profit side.  And my guess is the difference between the level of unethical practice in the not for profit sector and the business sector is only in the amounts.  So, you know, if you think back, it's not too long ago that we had big scandals at the United Way [United Way of America].  And, you know, those--those not for profits where the money, you know, disappears (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, on the CEO level of the United Way the money is--is pretty good.  I mean, management level, they get paid pretty good.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, but--
Speaker 1: The head of the Red Cross [American Red Cross] or United Way.
Speaker 2: Right, but--but even at that it's not--it's not going to be Enron or WorldCom [MCI Inc., Ashburn, Virginia] or Tyco [Tyco International], right.  So it's not going to get that kind of, you know, it's not going to get that kind of scrutiny, right, just because of the nature of the dollars.  But I don't--I don't think the ethical tendencies are any greater for people in business or, you know, the--the--the tendency to be unethical are any greater for people in business then they are for people in other institutions.  It's just that the amounts (laughter) are much greater.  And, you know, one thing I think about to--to your point about the Sarbanes-Oxley, in my view the--the increased scrutiny that those crashes of Enron and WorldCom that they brought has actually been very beneficial to governance in companies.  I thought, excuse me, that would also come with those--with that legislation, as well as some of the other, is that it would open up corporate boards so that people of color and women would have more opportunity to go on boards because companies would become much more sensitive to not having their boards simply look like clubs.  And we've seen some of that opening, but--but it's mostly been in the largest companies in the country.  And--and so if you kind of look at the Fortune 500 you've seen lot--a lot more opportunity for people of color on board--the boards of the top 200, but not very much change on the boards of the--of the, you know, numbers 201 down to 500.  So, but--but I think in general, the corporate landscape is now better with Sarbanes-Oxley.

Speaker 1: You said in your book ['Breaking Through: The Making of Minority Executives in Corporate America,' David A. Thomas and John J. Gabarro] and this is a quote here, and I hope I wrote it out right (laughter), "The role of leadership is evolving out of the command and control paradigm."  And so--and you teach leadership and or--organizational de- development, now what--what--do you really see that happening now, it--it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.  If for no other reason than, you know, the world's moving so fast that companies have to be responsive on the ground.  So the old days when things moved slow enough that we could run every decision all the way back up to the CEO or to the top manager, companies that are operating like that just can't move fast enough.  So--so--so if--that--and that's what command and control is about, right, command and control is about I give a command and I can, you know, make that happen all the way down to the--to--to the level that, you know, we're putting products in customers hands.  And any change that needs to happen comes back up the line to me because, you know, I'm the--I'm the commander, right.  Now organizations have to go--have to work in ways that decentralize power and control.  And what you've got to manage with is a--a--a greater understanding of the business strategy of the--the--the systems that create the controls in the organization so that you're not off, you know, in the Southwest running a different version of McDonald's then we're running in, you know, Iowa.  But it--but it can't be dependent any longer on everything, all the decisions having to be made at the center, right.  But--but what that requires now is everybody's got to understand the strategy.  It used to be only the guys at the top needed to know the strategy and everybody else just had to be worker bees.  So that's definitely changing.  You can see it in the airline industry.  If you look at the successful airlines like Southwest [Southwest Airlines Co.], Jet Blue [Jet Blue Airways], everybody thinks it's just because they're low-cost carriers.  But in reality, it's because they're able to do things on the ground that empower their crews to turn those aircraft around quickly.  You know, people know p- nowadays, you know, when those airlines, everybody on a ground crew understands how that ground crew is supposed to work, it's not just dependent on a, you know, on a single supervisor.  People swap and share, you know, jobs in the moment, right, 'cause people are now multiply trained in those--in those kinds of environments.  Same thing in the [U.S.] military.  The military has become much less command and control, much more about putting tools in the hands of officers who are down on the ground to be able to do things that, you know, they used to be req- that used to be required for central command to do in terms of directing troops, you know, all kinds of things.  So, yeah, so absolutely.  That--I think that change is pervasive everywhere.
Speaker 1: So more serious responsibilities are being spread out for--
Speaker 2: More serious, exactly, more serious responsibilities are being spread out.  The challenge becomes also spreading the accountability, and at the same time not creating a system where--where--where people at the top can distance themselves from mistakes made at the bottom, right, you know.  So it's a--it's a--it's not an easy dance to get it right and to have it balanced.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--so someone now--an executive nowadays is m- has--has got to do a lot of coordination rather than just commanding and so forth, right?  I mean, it's about setting the tone--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --and setting an environment?
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.  That's exactly right.  That's exactly right.  It's about creating the conditions under which others can act affectively and act in a way that's aligned with that strategic direction, strategic intent.

Speaker 1: You are now a full professor [at Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts]--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --and you--you interact with the department of--with the Graduate School of Education [Harvard Graduate School of Education] here at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and with the--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --and with the Howard Divinity Sch- I mean the Harvard Divinity School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] too.  So, I mean (laughter), how do you interact with them, those two?
Speaker 2: Well, with the ed school [Harvard Graduate School of Education], we--the Harvard Business School has a joint effort underway with the ed school, and I'm one of the core faculty members in it who helps to design and run it.  Where we're working with ten school districts across the United States that have within those districts over two million kids and the aim is to work with them in a sustained way.  We are now in the third year of this process to impact student achievement by working with the superintendents and the leadership teams, sort of bringing--bringing together the understandings about education that exists at the ed school and the understandings about organizations and how you run systems and these very issues that you and I were talking about around command and control.  How do you get the right kinds of accountability?  How do you design an organization around the core work?  So a lot of education reform has not succeeded because it hasn't addressed teaching and learning.  On the other hand, a lot of interventions around teaching and learning that get put into schools haven't succeeded, because people didn't understand that you also have to put an organization around them that will support 'em, right.  And so what we're trying to do is to bring both of those together and--and to help superintendents have what we call a systems perspective about how they manage.  I also for, I guess, almost since I've been at the school, must be at least twelve years, I've been a--done lectures in the Urban Superintendents Program over at the ed school.  At the divinity school, I've been part of something called the Summer Leadership Institute, which is an institute that was created, I guess now seven years ago, that's designed as an executive education program for ministers and lay people who are part of churches that have an economic development component to their ministry.  And I basically teach them the--the leadership and management component of that.
Story_ID: 322915
Speaker 1: What do you enjoy most about your job [at Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: What I enjoy most about my job?  I think it's--it's a couple things.  One, the ability to pursue things that I think are important.  So I--I can study or work with--I can study any topic I want to study, that I think is important.  And the Harvard Business School is particularly focused on, you know, making your ideas have impact out in the world.  So--so I'm able to study things that I think are important with an explicit emphasis or purpose of trying to make a difference in the world, as opposed to, you know, in political science, right, you're not supposed to really make it public.  Then what you actually want to do is create theories that are going to have some influence out in the world.  You know, you're supposed to be a kind of, you know, in the ivory tower doing the pure research, you know, kind of thing.  Whereas at the business school, those things have to come together.  And you know, like I told you, you know, I'm working on a theme trying to change the world.  And not that I've been successful at that, but you know, it's--it's great to get up every day and feel like, you know, you got a shot because the kind of job you have lends itself to that.
Speaker 1: Is that--is there a lot of co- collaboration here?  I know--know your--the co-author [John J. Gabarro] of your book ['Breaking Through: The Making of Minority Executives in Corporate America,' David A. Thomas and John J. Gabarro], we haven't mentioned him, but is there a lot of collaboration in the business school there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There is a--there is at the Harvard Business School.  There's a lot of collaboration and--and--and a lot of that is helped by the way we teach, you know, ever--we teach using the case method, we teach in what we call teaching groups for our required courses.  So it breeds, it is a very collaborative atmosphere, much more so then most academic institutions.  I mean, you know, I won't name any names, but you know, one way to measure that is on any given day go to any university or any other business school and find out who's not scheduled to teach on that day and then find out whether or not they're in the office.  You look at most universities, when people don't have to be there, they're not there, 'cause there's not much community.  You come to the Harvard Business School and most days whether people are teaching or not, unless they're traveling, they're at the school, 'cause it's a community, right.  And--and we collaborate in a host of ways that are voluntary, as well as, you know, required.
Story_ID: 322916
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My hopes and concerns, well I--I'll just descri- well the first one is, I think that twenty-five years from now we are likely to have, the urban black community will essentially be the equivalent of Indian [Native American] reservations because the--the crisis of education disproportionally impacts communities of color.  The--the black community, in particular, is creating a genera- generation now I think we're into our second generation of--of people whose skills so ill-equip them to connect to and compete in the world that we're in now.  That they'll sort of be written off and taken care of kind of in the way that if you stay on the Indian reservation you can get your basic needs met.  But, you know, there's just this disconnect from the rest of what's going, if you, you know, of what's going on out there in the larger world.  So, I remember the first time I went to the Navajo reservation [Navajo Nation] in New Mexico.  And I, you know, it--it was like going to a true third world country, totally disconnected from the rest of the U.S.  I'm imaging that because of the crisis in education and the lack of jobs that help to pull people into a middle class that are available there that, you know, there's a set of us now who are middle class and upper middle class black folks who moved out and whose identities, I think, are becoming much more complex and less racialized, right.  But there'll be this group left that nobody will really identify with in the same way that I think, you know, the--Native Americans are a group that very few people who kind of operate in the mainstream of the society actually identify with.  That heritage is not part of their experience and to the extent it is, it's kind of romanticized, like I'm one-fifth Cherokee, you know, but I don't really have any connection to it.  Well, you know, people will be, you know, I'm one-quarter black, but--so--so--I'm--I'm in--and I think it all comes back to education primarily and the lack of investment in what's required to--to effectively educate urban poor and underprivileged, you know, kids and communities, and economic opportunity.  So that's my--and you know, connected to that, right, is this--is the class gulf, I think, in the black community is--is widening.  And I think that the bridge between the haves and the haves nots in the black community is--is starting to be pulled up.  And so--and you know, this is all happening kind of in the context of a set of global forces that is not clear to me that we can do much about.  So, you know, if--if we could spin black America off from the rest of the nation, we would then qualify as a country kind of like India, you know, where we could get some of that outsourcing work (laughter) that's going other places.  But you can't do, you know, right, but you can't pay those wages here even though, you know.
Speaker 1: If--if we had to earn a living making the shoes that we wear, we'd probably wouldn't make much money.
Speaker 2: We probably wouldn't, right, exactly, we'd probably--
Speaker 1: Not enough money to buy 'em.
Speaker 2: --right, we probably wouldn't make enough money to buy 'em.  So--so that's, you know, my, my concern.
Story_ID: 322917
Speaker 1: I think that some of what we've got to--we've also have to become better at and where I think there's some hope is if we accelerate our activities and abilities to build bridges across communities of color.  You know, so black folks have, for a long time, you know, because we've sort of been the lead minority group, operated in a silo as if the world is just us and white people, and that all the negotiation is between the black elites and white elites.  And I--I can remember back when I lived in New York [New York] and Herman Badillo wanted to run for mayor of New York, and the black leadership said no 'cause a black guy has got to be the first non-white mayor of New York.  Or out in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], where the black folks decided to support Hahn [James Hahn]--
Speaker 2: Instead of--
Speaker 1: --right and not the--the Hispanic candidate [Antonio Villaraigosa] first time around and then they got burned, and now this time around they built that bridge.  So, but I--I--I think, you know, that if we can begin to build those bridges and find those commonalities, we can create a different kind of political context that has to be responded to.  And you know, the other--so--so I think that's--that--that's potentially where the hope lies, as well as I think the--the--the hope lies in the fact that while I think the poorest of us are actually in the worst place, vis-a-vis, the world that we've ever been in.  The community as a whole now has more access, more skill, more knowledge than ever before.  You know, I--I look at some of my black students, I can think of one person in particular, he's now in D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  He's kind of a, you know, a protegee of mine, you know, I advise him.  A young kid, thirty-three or thirty-four years old, he's right now, as we speak, negotiating to buy his third company.  He now, so--so and he owns all these companies in a portfolio of companies.  And I got--I can think of five other former students of mine, blacks, who are doing the exact same thing.  Nobody hears about 'em, but you know, they're out there building that economic base and wherewithal.  And I think if we can leverage that and the knowledge represented in that to also affect some of the problems at the other end of our spectrum, you know, there's some hope there, you know.

Speaker 1: Now, when you look back at everything you've done to this point in your life, is there anything that you would do differently, any major thing?
Speaker 2: Any major things I would do differently.  Yep.  I would've started investing money much, much earlier in my career in my--in my--my work life.  Yeah, I think that the--the things I would've done differently is I would've--I would've thought very differently about money.  And that would have led me to make some different decisions than I made.  'Cause that is, you know, I never had any concept of wealth until much later in my life then I hope is the case for my kids and your ki- how do you build wealth so that by the time you're fifty you've got a lot more choice and control then you otherwise would.  And mind you, you know, I mean I make, you know, more money then I need, you know, and you know, I'm--I'm doing pretty good and you know, there's nothing I want that I--that I don't have.  But I also see the ways in which, you know, had I been better early on in investing and building wealth, you know, I could be much more valuable and effective in the community in terms of being able to support and make things happen and to be more philanthropic, you know, than--than I think I am.

Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done to this point, it's similar to the other question, but like what would you consider today to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I would consider my legacy to be, I think that I am one of the people who made the study of race and organizations and race and careers a legitimate and important field of study in the academy.  And as a result, I think that it's--and I, you know, not--I'm forty-nine years old so I usually feel a little, I don't know what the right word is, but a little disconnect.  But, you know, today, you know, I have young scholars come up and say, you know, I've read all your work, you know, and it's because of that that I decided to pursue studying, you know, a similar set of issues.  And when my--when my advisor, you know, didn't understand it, I was able to show 'em your work, right, and that made all the difference.  So I think that behind me there's a group of black scholars, as well as white scholars and--and--and Hispanic scholars for whom the study of race has become a central part of their work as a result of the work that--that--that I've done or--or at least partially as a--as a result of the work that I've done.  And, you know, just to give you a sense of that, in 1987 myself and four other people approached all five of the major journals in my field about doing a special edition on race and careers.  And I never will forget, I got back a letter from the editor of the Academy of Management Journal, which is the number two journal in the field, and it said this is not a topic about which a sufficient number of our readers would be interested in, right.  Now, you fast forward to the year 2000 and four of those five journals have all done at least two special issues having to do with diversity and race, right, just in the last five years.  So the world's come around in that twenty-year almost arc, right, or at least the--the academy in a very different way (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well the last five years are the years that your book's ['Breaking Through: The Making of Minority Executives in Corporate America,' David A. Thomas and John J. Gabarro] been out basically.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah in the last five years my book's been out.  So I think, you know, I think that's part of my legacy, you know.  And--and I--I hope that people would also see as part of my legacy the way that I've approached my work, you know, which I think has--has been in a--in a--in a way that hasn't compromised the integrity of it in order to have it be successful or accepted, so.

Speaker 1: Can you tell us something about your family now, you're--we've talked about your wife and where you met her and this is--is re- I'm telling is remarkable to find somebody your age that's been married this long--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --it really is, to the same person.  And do you have children?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we have three kids.  My daughter is sixteen, she's the oldest.  She's a student at a school called Dana Hall [Dana Hall School, Wellesley, Massachusetts], she's a junior.  And then I have a son who'll be fourteen in November, his name is David, Jr. [David Thomas, Jr.] and he's in the eighth grade and goes to a school called Shady Hill [Shady Hill School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And then I've got a nine year old who's a boy named Nelson.  He's actually Nelson Dubois [ph.], Dubois is his--is his middle name because my two heroes were Nelson Mandela and W.E.B. Du Bois.
Speaker 1: Yeah you opened your book with a quote from Du Bois about the color line?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, yeah, right, right, right.  And he's nine, yeah.
Story_ID: 323201
Speaker 1: Is there anything we have not asked you?  Now I'm sure there are--I can think of some things right now I haven't asked, but I don't know if I want to wear you out.  But there's a--is there anything you think you want to address on this particular--in this interview that we haven't touched upon here?
Speaker 2: Something we haven't touched upon.
Speaker 1: There is--there is one thing, and I think I would be remiss if I didn't ask about it.  And I--I was thinking about this when you were--we were discussing how it's necessary for black folks to maybe to--to make alliances with other minorities, and I was just thinking about who's a minority and who isn't.  Is--is--is--did you find in you're--in you're book ['Breaking Through: The Making of Minority Executives in Corporate America,' David A. Thomas and John J. Gabarro] that it was different, fundamentally different for--for--did--women then it was for--white women as opposed to black men or--or black women as opposed to--you hear so much scuttlebutt about who has it easier and who's there more of in the workplace (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well I--I didn't-- I didn't look at--we had white women and women of color in our--in our study, but I didn't look at the comparison--we didn't have enough to look at it in all the different, you know, ways.  I think what you find is that white women have done better as a affirmative action class followed by men of color, followed by, you know, kind of at the bottom is women of color and black women in particular.  In the corporate sphere, especially if you--if you think about it in terms of rising to the top job.  And the dynamic is that between--around black men and black women, is particularly interesting in--in--'cause you also hear a lot that, you know, it's harder for bl- for black men then for black women.  And the way that works, is that the data supports that when you're looking at people at lower levels of the organization.  But if you can stay long enough to make it into middle management, then the dynamic shifts and starts to favor black men.  Because they're then able to trade on maleness, right, which allows them to create, you know, where the opportunity exists a different kind of relationship and a more comfortable relationship in that predominately white male environment that black women don't have access to, but that becomes much more important if you're going to move beyond those middle tier jobs.
Story_ID: 323202
Speaker 1: So in some senses then, we're saying that--what we're saying is that if a black male can last in a corporation long enough for the white males to get beyond a fear fact--a fear level--now--now we get into anthropology (laughter) level--
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: --then he--he might stay there.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.  Then the table shifts in his favor in relationship to a black woman.
Speaker 1: That's incredible, I never--I never would have thought, yeah.
Speaker 2: But early in career, the fear factor, as you call it, right, and it's the fear factor on two sides.  There's the white fear factor that leads to the exaggeration of black male stereotypes like, you know, the first time a black male appears to be overly emotional, the projection that he usually gets is that he's angry, that he's out of control, right.  But there's also the fear that black men bring in that somehow the institution is designed to compromise me, so I'm going to resist it.  Especially if they haven't grown up or spent a lot of time in predominately white environments, or when they did, they had negative experiences.  And the way that they coped with it is by creating a set a defenses that actually undermined their ability to be successful, right.
Speaker 1: What--what were some of these defenses be?
Speaker 2: Oh some of these defenses are being perfect, in which case I become overly defensive about feedback that suggests that I've made a mistake, because I know I'm working at being perfect.  Not seeking feedback in a ways that increase the likelihood that you'll get it.  So for example, I'll say to you, "Larry [Larry Crowe], tell me how I'm doing."  And you'll say, "You're doing fine."  Now, who knows how you're judging fine.  If you don't have the highest expectations of me, the fact that I'm doing average means I'm doing fine.  But now I could come to you and I could say, "You know what Larry," 'cause you just saw me give a presentation, and I could come out and I could say, "Larry, how was the presentation," you say, "It was fine," right.  You know, in other words, you didn't make any blunders and you got your message across, you know, something like that.  Or I could come to you and I could say, "You know Larry, when I hit this part in the presentation I expected to get this kind of reaction from the--from the people in the room and I didn't get it."  Well now you say, "Well you know what, here's what you could've done to get that," and you start to provide me a level of feedback and critique that's about--that's much more related to my becoming excellent, 'cause I've opened up to you the fact that I didn't think it was perfect and that there's some areas where, you know, I wan--I want to seek feedback and can be open to being vulnerable.  You know, a--another kind of defense is bifurcating your life.  So, you know, I got my black life and I got my white life, and never the 'twain shall meet.  And it creates a kind of stiffness, you know, that's not really who you are, and people experience it and it's distancing.  The other, you know, right, for you just get a kind of, you know, exaggeration that people engage in that doesn't help 'em build relationships, you know, 'cause-'cause so--so like the person who has to be, you know, kind of everybody's best friend, you know, shaking everybody's hand, meeting everybody, very well networked, often times to the expense of kind of feeling phony, right.  But what I'm trying to do is to, you know, 'cause I read the books, you know, you're supposed to network and get out there and know everybody.  You know, and it's kind of like you're executing, you know, they go in executing against this plan that's about managing all this stuff that's coming to get 'em.  You know, it gets in the way.

Speaker 1: Do you see us making any progress towards, I guess, being more accepting of women at that corporate level at that high level then--then your study indicates that we are?
Speaker 2: Of women?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Once they get to that point, the maleness thing kicks in and they are at a disadvantage.
Speaker 2: Yep.  I don't see evidence of things getting much easier for black women.  I see evidence of that for white women, I see evidence of that for black men, but I don't see a lot of evidence of that for black women.
Speaker 1: Can you elaborate a little bit on that?
Speaker 2: I just think that when I--when I--when I look at the numbers, when I look at the complexity of the experience, I think that black women are having the most difficulty at the very tops of their organizations, being able to break through and sustain themselves and to make those connections, those--those--those high-quality identifying connections.  They're--they are having the most difficulty and the organizations, you know, haven't developed the ability to address that.  You know, we tend to think race or we tend to think gender, but we, you know, we don't tend to think in the complex way that I think deals with multiple identities.  And black women frequently feel, you know, the pressure to--they--they frequently feel that--that--that split.  They're the least likely group among senior women to be married, more likely to be single parents, there's just a host of things that I think complicate that experience.
Story_ID: 323204
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything else before I ask my final question?
Speaker 2: Nope.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well the final question is similar to legacy, and it's, sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  I'd like to be remembered as a great father and a great life partner as a husband, and a dutiful son.  And I'd like to be remembered as somebody who simply, you know, sort of whatever he did he tried to bring his best and he was generous with it.
Speaker 1: All right.  Thank you sir.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
