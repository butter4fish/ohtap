Speaker 1: All right.  Before we go into depth, there are five People Magazine-ish-type questions that we always ask.  They are light-weight questions, and they only require a short answer--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --And the first is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Sausage.
Speaker 1: Of course.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Orange.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have a favorite time of the year?

Speaker 2: Yes.  "It's not where you start, it's where you finish."
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: That runs second sometimes to, "Do what you want to, but for God sakes, know what you're doing."
Story_ID: 87593
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well, let me ask you about your family history.  How far back can you trace your family?
Speaker 2: Well, you know when "Roots" came along, I've began to investigate, and I found I could only go back about three generations.  To Willie Iron Beater Haysbert out of Louisiana and Puerto Rico.  And then I progressed since then into my present family.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what was that name again?
Speaker 2: Willie Iron Beater.
Speaker 1: Iron?
Speaker 2: Iron--Irons.
Speaker 1: Like iron like metal?
Speaker 2: Metal, yes.
Speaker 1: And what was the last name?
Speaker 2: Haysbert.
Speaker 1: Beater, you said Iron Beater.
Speaker 2: Iron Beater.
Speaker 1: Iron Beater.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a blacksmith.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So they called him Iron Beater, that was his nickname.
Speaker 1: All right.  Willie Iron Beater Haysbert.  And he lived in Louisiana--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --And he had a background in Puerto Rico?
Speaker 2: Baton Rouge [Louisiana].  But I understand he came from Puerto Rico.  But I haven't been able to get too much information.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he was also the ancestor Dennis Haysbert, the Hollywood star.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Several generations removed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Dennis Haysbert.  I know the name, I can't place where or what he's--
Speaker 2: Well, Battlefield Galactica, he's the president of the United States in "24 Hours" [sic, 24] and he's been in Whitney Houston theaters--movies.
Speaker 1: He was in "Love Field" too, right, Dennis Haysbert, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when did Willie Iron Beater Haysbert live, I mean, do you know the period of time?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see, I've been able to figure out is around 1860, 1850, 1860.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was he in slavery?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Yes he was in slavery because it was a time for slaves.  In addition to that my maternal grandfather was a slave.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know his name?
Speaker 2: His name is Ike Walton, Isiah Walton.
Speaker 1: Were they from the same part of the country?
Speaker 2: No they were from Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they moved to Georgetown, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Are there any stories about your ancestors that were passed down?
Speaker 2: Well, certainly my maternal ancestor escaped from slavery, went across into Ohio.  And he was a common-law husband of a young Caucasian girl.  And out of that offspring came my mother and so when my father came in from Haysbert side that's the reason why my complexion is what it is.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Any other stories about your ancestors?
Speaker 2: Oh, several stories have come down that my father could--was one of the strongest men around, could lift up the old Model T Ford just to show off his strength. Things of that particular type, but as I say I didn't start until I saw "Roots" and it was too late, people forgotten, the past like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One of my ancestors, I understand, was itinerant minister, preacher.  And he would go from town to town delivering the service.  His name was Doc Houston and my fraternal [sic paternal] grandmother was a Haysbert, Mary Haysbert, who was the daughter--one of the daughters of Willie Haysbert.
Story_ID: 87594
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Can you tell us about your mother?  Can you give us her full name and spell it for us and her date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Well her name was Emma Haysbert, her maiden name was Emma Walton.  And she was born in Roanoke, Virginia.  The--she was born in 1898 on August of 1898.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was she like and what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: Well, she was a beautiful woman, fine hair and she was a maid and a laundress.  And she met my father, she had a fifth grade education, and she met my father who didn't have any education.  So she taught him how to read and write and later he moved up to be a stationery engineer for the City of Cincinnati [Ohio] in high schools and so on and also a rail road engineer.  In fact he taught stationery engineering at the Ninth Street YMCA in Cincinnati, so that again it's not where you start, it's where you finish.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How many children did your mother have?
Speaker 2: My mother had nine children.  She was married to a Ben Taylor with three and with my father, she had six.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Can you name all of your brothers and sisters for us?
Speaker 2: Well, yes in descending order.  My oldest brother, Bill Junior, very logically, was backed up by Harry H. Haysbert, who became a Lutheran minister.  Bill was an engineer like his dad and played a guitar, but he smoked too much and so he has a fairly early death.  Harry only passed when he was 86 in New Jersey, Princeton Junction, New Jersey.  He, as I say, he was a minister there.  My brother, Elmer, passed in Cincinnati, Ohio.  He was an engineer in the county system and retired on a pension in Cincinnati, still in Cincinnati.  So we still have ties.  My sister, oldest sister, Alice, passed at nine, she had a tuberculosis problem and I have a sister, Viola, who stayed in Cincinnati, was married twice and had nine children.  And then of course I was the youngest, well next to the youngest, second youngest.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you have a younger brother or sister.
Speaker 2: Younger sister whose name was Viola.
Story_ID: 87595
Speaker 1: Now tell us about your father, what was his full name and place and date of birth?
Speaker 2: Well, William Haysbert is spelled, W-I-L-L-I-A-M, was born in Roanoke, Virginia too.  And he traveled around.  He went to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], worked in the steel mills, came to Cincinnati [Ohio] to work in the Lukens Rail Road Company and the Lukens Steel Mill operation there.
Speaker 1: Is that company run by the Lukens that the politicians in Ohio--
Speaker 2: Yeah back with some of their ancestors--
Speaker 1: --Okay.
Speaker 2: --Started that and that's part of their background.  After that he went to Middletown, Ohio and then back to Cincinnati where he and my mother, at the Old City Hospital lot, that was their first home and that's when I--my first remembering hiding under sink that we had there.
Speaker 1: Now did your mother and father get married in Virginia, I guess.  Did they meet in Virginia to get married?
Speaker 2: Well, they were common-law marriages in those days because of the way slaves were treated and offspring of slaves.  You had more common-law marriages than you had civil marriages.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they met in Roanoke?
Speaker 2: Yes, in Roanoke, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right then they moved to Cincinnati?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So tell me now what was your father like?  What kind of person was he?
Speaker 2: Well, they called him Big Bill, as I said, because he was powerful, but he was a very talented and he was given to positive affirmations and that's the impact he had on me.  As I recall dimly as the one thing that helped me determine my success, it was the positive affirmations that he would get from famous mottos and slogans.  And after he and my mother separated, I would still go by there and he would tell about the stories of how the set of your sails determine which way you go, that it's the selfsame winds that blow for anybody else, but there is possible to make progress even though the wind is blowing against you as such because you can tack forth, move back and forward, depending on how you set your sails and that stuck with me, and I try to set my sails so that no matter what happens I was going to make progress.
Speaker 1: So what he's doing is telling you that you have control of your destiny?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's what he did, and he did it to, not only personal admonition, but also through giving me poems or statements, that two ships on a sea by the selfsame winds they blow and one goes east and one goes west but it's a set of the sails that determines which way to go.  And that stuck with me through the years.  So I try to set my sails.
Speaker 1: So you got a positive relationship with your father?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, very smart man, very smart man.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you say he was an engineer?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh, for the public school system in Cincinnati.  He grew into that.  He started off shoveling coal and when I went home from college one year, I shoveled coal too at the Cincinnati Water Works.  So I inherited an ability to shovel coal.
Story_ID: 87596
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, tell me about growing up in Cincinnati [Ohio], the neighborhood you lived in, was there a name for the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  It was called the West End, that where I grew up and like most poor families, we moved from spot to spot.  I was all over the West End.  We'd stay about two years in one location and then moved to another one.  We were--we came up during the [Great] Depression.  And during those years in the early '30s' (1930s), we were poor, they tell us, but we didn't think we were poor.  I found out when I was eighteen that I was poor, or that I was supposed to be poor.  I never felt poor.  I know I was broke, but never poor.  So when the relief wagons, they called these Hoover Hogs, they brought in food from the Midwest and I'd have to unfreeze a big chunk of beef or something to have breakfast--to get breakfast before I could go to school.  Bacon was selling for five cent a pound and Wall Street was tumbling, but I didn't even know what Wall Street was.  And Salvation Army and Goodwill would come down and feed us or we'd go out to a church and be fed on the holidays.  But I always thought I was there sneaking in, because they were for the poor boys and girls, and I had to hide my face so they couldn't tell that I was poor, that I had no business there, but I had great fun, until I found out I was just the kind of kid that they were looking for.  But what do you say it's a condition of the mind.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me about growing up, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, when you're growing up, especially during the depression, ideas about bicycles were out.  You made scooters out of skates, you--my first job was an apprentice junk man.  I would go and look in the trashcans to help a guy push his cart up and down the hills of Cincinnati because it's pretty heavy to push a cart up a hill.  So I was one of the people that helped.  We played the usual games, Tom Mix, we played cowboys and Indians and made rubber band guns to shoot at each other, that sort of thing, and during that same period of time, we had our heroes.  There was Ezzard Charles, who was heavyweight champion and I used to play with him.  And it was--
Speaker 1: He was a kid in your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 87597
Speaker 1: I went to school for two years and regular schools, city schools and then went to a Parochial school for six years.  So I studied Bible history and Bible geography and went from there to junior high school where I found out that if you wanted to be exceptional, you had to desire to be exceptional, and mathematics was a exceptional, I didn't like math you see.  So then I decided one way to be exceptional would be to study math, and so when I finally got to Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], I specialized in mathematics.
Speaker 2: Let me go back to grade school for a minute.  What grade school did you attend in Cincinnati [Ohio]?
Speaker 1: Well, I attended Immanuel Lutheran Day School in Cincinnati, it was on Lynn Street, and I stayed there for you know quite a time until I went to junior high school, and that was, I guess, sometime they call it middle school now, but it was Rothenburg R-O-T-H-E-N-B-U-R-G  Junior High.  Then I got to--went to high school at Woodward High School.  This was old Woodward, they moved it out of Center City now, but I used to walk to those schools, and due to my vocation, I would look in the trash cans as I went on the way walking to school, because some valuable stuff in there you know that I would look for.  It was very interesting, and of course I made all state in volley ball, tried to play basketball, my hands were too small, but I ran track, half mile, and had a good old time and was just dismayed to find that I didn't know as much as I should have since I wound up going to college.  My father said well I can give you two years.  And he saw that I got in Wilberforce, and he saw that I got in Wilberforce.  It wasn't too expensive in those days either, but I worked my way through college waiting table.
Speaker 2: Okay, now I want to go back to high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now high school and grade school at the same time.  Did you have any teachers that were like particularly helpful to you as a mentor?
Speaker 1: Well, those that stuck with me was a Mrs. Levy who was a history teacher.  Miss Levy was painstaking and really imbued me with a sense of--a consciousness of history in terms of living it and the impact it would have on the future.  And so as opposed to English or something else, it was history, but it turned me on and it was Miss Levy.
Speaker 2: She was in grade school or high school?
Speaker 1: She was in high school.  In grade school it was a Mr. Hendly, Mr. Henly.  In the grade school, at Immanuel Lutheran, you only had one teacher, and you only had one hall, so he taught everything, Mr.--his name was Huber, Mr. Huber, H-U-B-E-R.  And he was a very fair-minded person and they sent my brother to college to be a minister from Cincinnati, and one of the white benefactors did that.  And of course it was all on account of a pity basis that the school was opened.  A missionary, maybe would be a better--sort of a missionary school.  There's a mission to the inner city.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Lutheran, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  And you say well what do I remember, I just--each time I read about Palestine, I always think of it in the historical sense of what I learned in junior school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So the Sea of Galilee, I know where it is, that type of thing.
Speaker 2: They taught you a lot of geography from the Bible?
Speaker 1: Yes.  It was Bible geography, it was Bible history, they got the inferences so I always thought of geography in terms of Biblical sense.
Speaker 2: Now did you get much of African American History in school?
Speaker 1: I beg your pardon?  This was 1930, there was no African American History, at least I don't think it was written.  I don't think anyone considered it.  Anything that was brought forward was verbal.  It was sort of a verbal history, but it wasn't taken in total concept, it wasn't--the perspective was not global, it was just one individual family, and what happened yesterday.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 87598
Speaker 1: Now in terms of the black community in Cincinnati [Ohio], was there a black side of town in Cincinnati or black community?
Speaker 2: Oh, abosolutely, West End was it.  If you remember, in fact, the day of my birth, 1920, there was a riot in Cincinnati, and I thought about that with the recent news.  The riot ended up with the African Americans using their rifles to defend their area of town and there was a cannon fired and then the white people fired a cannon down the middle of the street and destroyed--that was the area in which I was born and that would seem normal and now when they hear about Cincinnati and problems, I think of--yeah, the animosity and what is evidently a health problem for Cincinnati presently.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, the recent riots over police brutality?
Speaker 2: Yeah, things of that type, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah and I say it's a health problem because it can't get healthy as long as that kind of racism or polarization exist.
Speaker 1: What would be your assessment of the condition of black people in Cincinnati when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: Well, it was very segregated town, segregated and isolated.  We were--we had no power, except within our own community, voting rights weren't available.  But what we did was to cope, we had our own taverns, I played as a high school student with my brothers in a tavern on Central Avenue called the "Bucket of Blood".
Speaker 1: Now, what did you play?
Speaker 2: I played guitar, tenor guitar.  And my other brother played--Elmer played piano and Harry played saxophone and Bill played bass guitar.
Speaker 1: The place was called the "Bucket of Blood"?
Speaker 2: "Bucket of Blood" and you could imagine what that was.  We smelled (unclear), of course there weren't no shootings.  I don't think anyone had a gun.  You couldn't afford a gun, but there was a lot of knife play.  And at the time I remembered that you always carried a knife as such.  And in the "Bucket of Blood" my brothers protected me and you know.  I was not drinking or anything of that type.  I don't mean that, but I liked the music and liked being in with my family and playing songs.  I suggest that maybe they just took me along, but it's the first money I earned in that sense.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 87599
Speaker 1: All right.  Now when you were in high school, now you said you ran track, tried to play a little basketball and you were an all-city volley ball player?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, cause you're fairly tall.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I was tall that helped.  Especially in volleyball net was such, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now how did you do academically?
Speaker 2: Academically, I didn't do too well.  I played hooky too much.  I was away.  I didn't do as well as I could have.  I guess I was about a C plus student there and when I got to college then I realized that, oh boy, I stayed away from school too much.  But I finished in college a cum laude in mathematics and my second degree was cum laude, so.
Speaker 1: Now when did you--so when you were a senior in high school getting ready to graduate, what were your aspirations, what field did you think you would go into?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be an engineer.  In fact, it just seemed natural since my brothers were going into it, my father was doing it, I was going to be an engineer.  And because of that, I had took math and that was one of my majors, to take math, although I had some French in high school, but I was going to be an engineer.  In fact I went to college and took a pre-engineering degree.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty-eight.
Speaker 1: Okay, '38 [1938].
Speaker 2: This was a long time ago, let me just say that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 87742
Speaker 1: All right. Now you're at Wilberforce [University in Wilberforce, Ohio].  Now how did you like Wilberforce?  Can you tell us something about the history of what Wilberforce was like and what kind of school it is?
Speaker 2: Well, Wilberforce University is probably the oldest black operated school in the United States.  The name came from William Wilberforce, the English diplomat, and it was named after him, and some of the funds for Wilberforce was raised in England to support it.  The African Methodist Episcopal Church took over. and it was 125, almost 125 years old when I went to school there.  It was outside of a small town called Xenia, Ohio and you probably have to walk from that town the five miles to Wilberforce, Ohio.
Speaker 1: They didn't have a shuttle bus?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.  It was nothing in those days to walk.  Now it's, you're a hero if you walk five miles.  But that was--rail roads were very extensively used so I went there by rail road.  And everyone was a work student because of the poor population that was there, and they realized that.  I worked for example during the summer for two dollars a week.  And to try to help out you know my father.  My father couldn't send me with so much money and I think he sent me two dollars a week to live off of.  So I had to work in the dining rooms and do whatever else I had to do to survive.  I had no clothes, I had one pair of trousers, the other pair had a rip in the back and I had no way to sew it up.  So I wore my ROTC uniform almost every day and they said well, I didn't know there was a class today and I still had it.  And the rip in my pants was found about nine times.  People would slide up to me and say hey you got a hole in your pants.  And I'd say, oh, I got a hole in my pants? But, oh, okay, sure."  But I knew it.  I knew I was broke, but I was not poor.
Speaker 1: I was even called--I used to dance and sing, I was tap dancer.  My nickname was Jitterbug.  And I tried dancing at the Cotton Club in Dayton.
Speaker 2: Really they had a Cotton Club?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, in Dayton and Cincinnati.  And a fellow by the name of Dennis Dowdale(ph), we tapped and danced together and we tried (unclear) dancing with some of the kids on the campus and what not.  I played a guitar so I was known as a very happy go lucky person?
Speaker 2: Okay.  So did you get paid for dancing at all?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, oh yes.  Now that's the proudest part of it.
Speaker 2: Did they have a theater department at Wilberforce then?
Speaker 1: They had a music and drama department there.  Leontyne Price you know went through the school the same time that we did, and we knew her and of course obviously she--she had come up from Mississippi and had some voice training.  The Wilberforce Choir was well known in those days and they traveled, the Wilberforce singers, traveled the country, and Leontyne was part of that, and later of course she wound up in the Metropolitan Opera.  So Wilberforce in those days did--was primarily music.  There was art in terms of painting that was done very well, but physical ed, and we used to compete with other black colleges in the area, West Virginia State and Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama], the annual games with those colleges.
Story_ID: 87743
Speaker 1: Central State [University] wasn't established yet, right?
Speaker 2: No, no.  It started out as Wilberforce University.  It was a peculiar set up in which the State of Ohio was paying Wilberforce University ex number of dollars, but it operated as--The College of Education was still staffed by state employers, even though--so when they had a disagreement, that's the operation of college, then the state and the church, as they say.  The church side split from the state side or--then they operated two separated colleges almost on the same land.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: And Central State evolved from first Wilberforce State and then it went from Wilberforce State to Central State and then it went to Central State College to Central State University.  And of course Wilberforce expanded across the road.  There was a tornado that knocked out the campus that swept through Xenia, Ohio--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was in '74 (1974).
Speaker 2: --In '74 (1974), and we rebuilt the campus on the other side of--what was it '25 (1925)--
Speaker 1: Forty-two (1942).
Speaker 2: Forty-two, yes, uh-huh.  And so I was--I remember as a freshman in the Battle of Tawawa there was  a--there was a ravine, and the freshman would get on one side of the ravine with the rope and the sophomores would be on the other and we'd try to pull each other into the ravine.  It's almost like the [U.S.] Navy does.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's Tawawa Creek, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes, Tawawa Creek.  In fact they call it Tawawa Springs, you know.
Speaker 1: Of course Right, the original name of Wilberforce was Tawawa Springs Resort.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Back in the 1850s.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the water was good.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Makes us live long.
Speaker 1: Sorry I didn't read about the history of it.  Okay.  So you had an active college life then, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, I did.  I enjoyed the heck out of college, you know.  I couldn't afford anything.  There was a liquor store in town we went to.  We all put together our money to go into the liquor store.
Speaker 1: Did you have to walk in?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we had to walk in, but we didn't mind because we had to put in--we weren't drinking large quantities like they do nowadays, but then again we could drink--have one drink and pretend that we were just really looped.  It was a lot of fun indeed--
Story_ID: 87744
Speaker 1: But your college career was interrupted, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, in the first place my father [William Haysbert] was able to extend my stay there from two years to three years.  But he couldn't make it the fourth year.  So I had to go back to Cincinnati [Ohio].  And I got a job in Cincinnati as a laborer in a power plant, the Water Works, and shoveled coal.  And while I was there, I worked as a bartender--bus boy, really at Mariemont Inn and then the war [World War II] started, I left college in '41 (1941), later on, September--war started September, the seventh, 1941, and I started to go head and join the air force and suppose--my buddy was supposed to meet me down that recruiting station the same day and I went in and he wasn't there.  So we wanted to go in together, but we wound up, both of us, in the Army, but it was the Army Air Corps in those days.  After they tested us, they sent us off into different training programs, that's in Tallahassee, Florida, Harding Field, outside of Baton Rouge [Louisiana].  Southern University is right there and some of my distant relatives were there.  But in any case we joined up with the 332nd Fighter Group in Selfridge Field, Michigan and went to aerial gunnery practice and some of us was stationed at Oscoda, Michigan, let's see, Alpena and we flew target practice.  But this was the Tuskegee Airmen.
Speaker 1: But you never were trained in Tuskegee [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: No. I never trained in Tuskegee, I joined them.  At that time Colonel [Benjamin] Davis came back.  He had been over with the 99th Fighter Squadron and he came by and picked up the rest of us the 301st of 100s and the 302nd in Michigan.  But you see in those days the white population did not believe that blacks could handle such mechanical intricacies as planes, it's just too much beyond our capabilities.  So that when they were reluctantly forced to do it, by politics, by the leaders at the time and Mary McLeod Bethune and Philip Randolph and they pressured them from the NAACP, pressured to have blacks in black colleges go into the Air Force.  Well they could make em do that, but if people don't believe in you, they have lower expectations and they give us a pretty rough time in trying to get through the courses, trying to get through the barriers that were set.  And then they would spend time after we did that, we'd have to spend a lot of time training.
Story_ID: 87745
Speaker 1: So and then of course in North Africa and in Italy, we landed in Bari, Italy.
Speaker 2: How do you spell that?
Speaker 1: B-A-R-I, Bari, Italy.  And of course the ships had been bombed by the Germans at the time, so it was you know pretty hectic at time as such.  But they just didn't believe that we could fly or that blacks could fly.  And so they kept sending us around to do different things, keep us busy.  Matter of fact of it was that after fighting through all that adversity, this was not an ordinary group of people.  Because all the ordinary people were washed up.  And those that did get through had in any case--in any case the results as you know, especially in the HBO movie, came out, was that the Tuskegee Airmen never lost a plane due to enemy fire, one hundred percent, which almost seems almost impossible.  And of course that sounds as if our people were super humans or something of that type because the unlikelihood of never failing, I mean, you can't be better than 100 percent.  Well but the truth of the matter is, is that the rigorous of screening out and the rigorous training and the taking people over to North Africa when everybody else was over in Italy fighting and sending people over here for gunnery practice and what not, that we had gotten two to three times the training of the rest of the Americans.  So that when we finally got there, we were highly trained, highly select group.  And we had one other thing which was Colonel Ben Davis who said don't leave the bombers.  He was tough.  We were afraid to go off fighting the German planes.  We had to stick with the bombers.  As a result they were better protected.  And as they say the rest is history.
Speaker 2: Right.  Now that's something that other Tuskegee Airmen say too that the training was--you all were trained and retrained and over trained.  Some people had even became trainers because they were trained so much--
Speaker 1: Oh, they just did.  So the need for pilots were so bad that's the only way we got into the fight in the end.  But the need for pilot was so bad that the average American, non-black pilot, well maybe get six months of training, and they needed them.  And they would throw them into the breech, you know.  And yet you had all these black troops getting extra training, extra training.  So when they did come into the battle, we could sleep in the plane, we could eat or we could dance in em, do everything else in them.  And the Germans found that out too.  These guys could really do it, but they can.  It's one of those things where adversity made you know not be all that bad, because you had to be so tough you get through it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So after that I came back from the service.  I went back to Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].
Story_ID: 87746
Speaker 1: Now, I just want to ask you a little bit about some of your personal experiences as a pilot.  Now did you pilot a plane?
Speaker 2: No, no, I didn't pilot, no, no.  I was just part of the ground crew.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So you all prepped the planes?
Speaker 2: Oh, you see, actually, when you have a squadrons, you don't have but 72 planes in the group, but for every person that was flying, there was 10, 20, 30 people on the ground because they had to eat, they had to have someplace to sleep, they have to have fuel ready, they had to get the ammunition and provide that, your cameras in the planes, the radios, they had--the intelligence, they had to do the administrative side of it, they had echelons or maintenance.  If a motor went out, you know, if you had to do something to the plane, they couldn't do it right there, they had to turn it over to, was a 366 or 367 Air Service Squadrons.  There was an air service group there was supply just to support those.  But there were all black, there were no replacements because it was only the end of the world mostly they begin to see, hey, maybe we should train some more people like these.
Speaker 1: Now you were in the--what was the name of your squadron?
Speaker 2: The 96th Air Service Squadron.
Speaker 1: Okay, 96th Air Service Squadron.  Okay.  All right now when you came back, what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, we lift off of the boats and we had been treated as men in combat and in Italy and Ramitelli at Foggia Main, those are some of the names of places where we were.  But when we came back we began to be Negros again.  And you know subject to all the laws of segregation, and disrespect and contempt with the uniform or without, we were considered as low caste and separated from that so--
Story_ID: 87747
Speaker 1: On a personal note I went to Wilberforce [University in Wilberforce, Ohio]  to finish my--well the first place I married my sweetheart, my college sweetheart.  She was still working there in the registrar at Wilberforce.  So the first thing I did as soon as I got off--off of the boat, it wasn't 48 hours we were married.  And then I went to work for the college--ran the college book store, and met thousands of students along the way.  Finished my degree in mathematics cum laude because I'm mature now, I mean I found that I could do things that I couldn't do as a high schooler, so to speak, cause I knew the world and appreciated it.  So then I decided I would want to go into business.  So I went to Central State and finished my degree in business and did pretty well and had some good grades.  I think I was second highest rated in Ohio on my comprehensive exams.  But I don't know how I got it, but I did.  And when I finished that I started teaching in business classes and running the college book store.
Story_ID: 87748
Speaker 1: And so it went from there until I came to Baltimore [Maryland] to join the Parks Sausage Company, fledgling, Parks Sausage Company in 1952.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right, so Parks Sausage has already started when you got here.  Yes, it had started the previous September, and I came in August.  So it had been about eleven months in existence.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell us about that.  Now how did Parks Sausage get started?  Who started it and what's the significance?
Speaker 2: Well a Dayton fellow, from Dayton, Ohio by the name of Henry G. Parks, Jr.  Henry Green Parks, Jr. had worked in the NYA at Wilberforce University, that was his first job.  Then he went to be a Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer salesman and was asked to come to Baltimore to be in real estate with a local hero by the name of Little Willie Adams who was in the lottery business before the State of Maryland was in the lottery business.
Speaker 1: In Chicago they called it policy, they called it the numbers game--
Speaker 2: The numbers, well they called it the numbers here, but if I say lottery at least people currently know what you're talking about, trying to figure out what those three numbers would be daily.  But in any case that's what got Henry to come to Baltimore.  And a relative to my wife who was with him and left and they say well we know someone in business, and that was me setting out in Ohio.  So I came there.  And I was very much impressed because Willie Adams was running a resort down on the shore of Annapolis [Maryland] and they had slot machines.  Where did I hear that before?  They had slot machines there and I saw these people carrying out--these nine people carrying out bags of coins under armed guard.  And I say wow, that's where the money is and so I joined the Parks Sausage Company at that time.
Story_ID: 87749
Speaker 1: We were just selling in Baltimore, Maryland, and had just--while I was starting the--we went into Washington, D.C., cold selling door-to-door, up and down with--we went through all kinds of things like we had to go back in the store sometimes and buy our own sausage to get some kind of flow.  We would have people, stop them on the outside and ask them to take the money for forty-nine cents, and go in and buy a pound of sausage and we'd give them the sausage to keep the circulation going.  And of course we ran up against the usual things of segregation, discrimination.  For example, they would take our sausage instead of putting it in a refrigerated case would put it on top of the refrigerated case so it would spoil and then that would turn the customers off, that type of thing, or take the product and put in the back in the back room and when we came back the next week said it didn't sell.  People never saw it. But Mr. Henry Parks told me, he said, Ray, I think I was 32 at the time, he said, how long you been black, and I said, I think I've been conscious about 15 years.  He said well, you shouldn't be surprised, stop worrying about it.  He said racism is like a telephone pole in the middle of your road is not true in the middle of someone else's road.  Now the way you address the problem will make the difference.  If you run yourself up against that pole, you'll knock your brains out, but you got to deal with it, sometime you have to go around it, maybe it's there.  It impedes your progress, but what are you so excited about it, it's not new, it's nothing new.  He said you know what you have to do then is to deal with it, and I thought of my father then in terms of where your sails are set, to deal with it, not ignoring the fact that the wind is blowing against you or that the telephone pole is in your road, but to deal with it by changing the set of your sails and so on.
Speaker 2: --Okay.  So you had to devise strategies like you were just describing to--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --To make sure that your product stayed in the stores.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: You had to monitor where the product was?
Speaker 1: Monitor where it was and then we had to use our brain power.  For example, Henry Parks would go into, say a A and P section in New York area and he was very handsome, and he would always take a gift for the receptionist and she sees this handsome guy come in and that he always got a little (unclear).  One retail chain says well we don't sell nigger sausage.  And so Henry said that's okay, he said because we make our sausage out of pork, we don't make it out of niggers.  So we had to be ingenious in terms of the way that we were selling and the way we were approaching them.  And that influenced our commercials, for example a little boy saying more Park Sausages, mom, was a white woman and our image was a wolf of red-haired freckled-face boy.  And in later years I'd go down to--when I was teaching a class down at the University of Virginia in the grad school there.  They asked me why did you use a little white boy for your ads and we said well, that's marketing, you adjust to what the market needs and the grocery industry wasn't controlled by blacks so that there was a psychology that you had to deal with both within the black community who deplored anything that was black as well as in the non-black community.
Speaker 2: That's interesting, so internal cost of racism, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's the first time you run up against psyconomics so to speak, where your mindset changes the economic facts of life and where you know--it was better off that we not--that our race not be considered, if you understand what I mean.  I mean we didn't deny it but we didn't play it up either.
Story_ID: 87608
Speaker 1: We were just discussing off camera how the visual image paints a picture of someone's mind.  How did you apply that to your sausage sales?
Speaker 2: Well, we realized that early on that the English language in particular had many interpretations.  And that what we wanted to get people to see was an image that was in our mind.  So the challenge was how will we transmit it to another human being, so that we had to come with words and scenes that evoked the same picture.  For example, when we were trying to sell sausage, we wanted people to think about breakfast, well we wanted to think about breakfast at home in a home environment.  So that our--our package colors, red, white and blue and orange for the sun glow of breakfast so we had a starburst--a sunburst to say breakfast because when the sun comes up and immediately thought breakfast sausage as such, and the red, white and blue, hey space, you got it.  I mean who was gonna be against that color?  So we had the strong basic colors that we did that.  And then of course on our visual advertising we had a little boy, motherhood.  I mean, gee, that's American as apple pie, right, motherhood, home, sunburst (unclear) not and then of course "more Parks sausages, mom."  The phrase was--was at the voice level that little boys use.  It was almost monotonous, there was no empathy, I mean no variation, more Parks sausages, mom, please.  So what happened by accident was that the slight pause was supposed to be--had the sound of a little boy eating this gorgeous superior sausage, but it didn't come through orally and as a result it was a little gap there and people had been deluged by continuous sound, so when there's a pause, everybody's attention focused or refocused on our commercials.  And that refocusing got us--got us into--a salesman be driving on a road in Utah and all of a sudden his radio would stop working, he thought, it was not, it was a little boy pausing to eat that great sausage.  So that's how we used that to promote the visual image in the minds of people.
Speaker 1: Now, did you use an ad agency for this?
Speaker 2: Oh, we did, we did.  We had Leon Dialnik(ph), Dialnik Advertising we used it.  In fact, we tested a number of ads that they had produced.  And the last ad that they produced was a sort of a throw-a-way ad called "More Parks Sausages Mom" you know.  We had a rather orthodox things as little pig saying they wanted to wind up in sausage, in our sausage.  We had the one with the hula singers in Hawaiian tones, we had Madam Chiquita talking about--they usually had More Parks University using a computer to say what's the best sausage?  But in the tail end of all of that was this little thing, it was a woman who could talk like a little boy and she did that and Henry and I went around to the different cities where we were operating and let our salesmen hear them and they picked everything else but that one.  But we heard that sucker so many times that we decided you know what I remember, I remember more Parks sausages mom, that when we chose that.  Oh, yes, we had an agency.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I wondered if it was a little boy or a woman or who it was?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was that.  People were surprised to find out.  That made her career.  She lasted for about twenty-five years as a woman who made "More Parks Sausages."
Story_ID: 87609
Speaker 1: You know, Parks Sausage is unusual from a historical viewpoint because we've been through every variation of American business that exists.  We've had mergers, we went public as you know, Parks Sausage was the first African American company to go public in January 22, 1969.  Later on that year, Johnson Publication went public, Johnson Products, I'm sorry, of Chicago [Illinois], went public in I think it was August or September.  But we've had mergers, we've had acquisitions.  In 1980, we executed a leveraged buyout, we've had dissolution, bankruptcies, the whole thing.  It's been very rewarding.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Been to the big town, heard the big talks, you know, that kind of thing.  I personally been on the--I'm director emeritus of Verizon, having served on that board, the bank boards, federal reserve bank boards, I've just been exposed to this--really been blessed, been blessed.
Speaker 2: Okay.  How extensive was the distribution of Parks Sausage?
Speaker 1: Parks Sausage had in its core area was eight states.  As you know eight states, we operated some people sort to speak where we would ship sausage and they would take smaller units, trucks, to spread it out, but actually in the end, we were national, we were shipping wholesale quantities to Safeway in California all the way to the east coast of Florida is really our stomping grounds because of the letters from Florida to Massachusetts, that was the major--east of the Mississippi, that was the major sales areas as such.  We did have some products like chitterlings where we fixed 100 truckloads a year and shipped it to Cincinnati [Ohio] to Dayton [Ohio] to Cleveland to Chicago.
Story_ID: 87610
Speaker 1: We, we're all over the place. And some of our advertising was sent all over.  We used Essence Magazine and Black Enterprise and several others nationally, but then again we advertise in Life Magazine and Look Magazine and Reader's Digest too.  We've had--again it's the graphic picture as I recall about Reader's Digest is our ad was titled "Food is Love" and the idea--and it showed a little boy, but the idea was that people associate their mothers with love because she feeds them and people tend to relate food to comfort, like comfort foods if nothing else.  And so therefore we used it to paint a graphic picture in Reader's Digest which did as well.  But then again we've advertised in New Yorker Magazine.  Let me tell you one of the things that we had to do.  In our very early days in the '50s (1950s), you go through stages such as awareness, acceptability and ultimately preference for your product.  We had, as a black firm, had to get credibility.  One of the ways we did that was to buy an ad in the New Yorker Magazine.  And then take that ad from the New Yorker Magazine and send it out as advertised in the New York Magazine and the New Yorker.  So everyone says, oh, so you were in the New Yorker, oh, wow, you probably must be good, right?  We also used that device or strategy with the New York Giants football team.  When they broke the radio broadcast into four segments and we bought one segment of the four and injected "More Parks Sausages Mom" in those ads.  Wow, you're sponsoring the New York Giants, you must be, your product must be, you know, high level.
Speaker 2: That's interesting.
Speaker 1: You know, we rubbed some of the New York Giants on us and we rubbed some of the New Yorker Magazines and the Reader's Digest, that's just a respectable company, right?
Story_ID: 87611
Speaker 1: Now what about the product itself, is there a special recipe for Parks Sausage that made it taste different?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.  Our recipe was concocted so to speak by Henry Parks.  Henry Parks had originally come from Georgia.  I think he was spirited out of Georgia in Atlanta area, Green County, that's the reason why his name was Green early on.  But he had the most sensitive taste of anybody I've ever known.  It was developed when his parents, his grandmother, would send him out to get herbs and spices.  Back in those days you seasoned your food, you couldn't go to the super market and get ground coriander or thyme or something of that type.  What you had to do was to get lot of herbs yourself.  So she would let him taste some of the herb and send him out to look for that among the trees and then taste it, and if it tasted like the one it was before then that was it.  So he could detect an ounce of salt or pepper in 7000 ounces of a batch of sausage.  He would say, oh, just one ounce, so you had one ounce of sage or one ounce of pepper or whatever.  So the recipe, we called it the golden bowl.  One of my ads says he brings into the golden bowl every morning for him to taste to see if its right on time, that if its (unclear).  And we did have taste panels every day.  We ate sausage because we didn't find any technology that could duplicate flavor and that's what we were selling in a sense, it was flavor.  And so we had to taste every batch of spices that came in.  We had it overlapped so that it tasted just like the other one and we could tell it and make the modifications with that one.  So in some batches from say McCormick or from some of the Chicago spice houses, we would take the original recipe and add two ounces of sage.  When that was gone the next batch we might not have to add the two ounces of sage, and that's where you move you're through, because we knew what we were selling, we were selling satisfaction.  We called ourselves the Parks Satisfaction Company, not sausage company so--and flavor was our--so yes, it was unique.
Story_ID: 87612
Speaker 1: Now, now was the president ever shown on any of the ads?  You never showed who owned it?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, it was a--we knew that America was pre-disposed.  That's a nice word, right?  They were predisposed.  So therefore in order to avoid that telephone pole we didn't say who made it, just focused.  And there were people even in our neighborhood that never knew that.  It was a sort of inside story or inside joke in Chicago [Illinois] or say Detroit [Michigan].  But you never knew it because number one we never emphasized and secondly Henry Parks had gone to Ohio State [University] in marketing and as a marketing person, you do what the market demands, you don't do what you think is quote, unquote right.  Flavor--so if the market expects your ethnicity not to be a factor in foods then a good marketer doesn't let it be, so you don't have to worry about who runs the company.  Besides the way things operated they didn't believe that you could run a company, not with modern TV and radio and Reader's Digest, are you kidding, come on, the brothers and the sisters, they wouldn't believe that if you told them.
Speaker 1: Well that's incredible.  I mean it's true, I understand what you're saying, but it's kind of a sad comment on the way society is working then and now, I guess.
Speaker 2: Well, even if you don't say sad, even if you don't have any emotional aspect of it too, it's the fact that that's the way it is.  My nieces told me reality is very real, it's not good anyway, but what you're saying it's reality, people think like that.  People already got their ideas made up.  So a business person fits in with their ideas.
Speaker 1: Is there an inner corp of black people around the country that really knew that Parks sausages are--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh yeah, they did.  The newspapers, primarily we took the ads in, the damn news, Amsterdam news, the Pittsburgh Courier and the Chicago--
Speaker 1: Defender?
Speaker 2: --Defender, yeah, the Defender, you know, the sing stack boys what they do, but it was sort of like an inside secret, you know.
Story_ID: 87613
Speaker 1: So what was the biggest--what was the apex of the Parks Sausage in terms of sales and popularity?
Speaker 2: Well, along the way we were sold in 1977 by Henry Parks and the other stockholders.  We went public in '69 (1969), we sold a majority share in '77 (1977).  There was executed a tender offer, we pulled in the rest of the stock and we were bought out by Noren Corp(ph) Corporation out of Florida, out of Miami in 1977.  1980, we were swallowed up and they asked us if we wanted to buy the Parks Sausage Company, so I got together with some of the other employees and used--we collateralized the company, used it for collateral to borrow two and a half million dollars and I bought the company.  Have some stories about that too.  Like for example, we were a $100,000 short the night before the purchase (unclear).  So we borrowed from commercial credit, a $100,000 overnight and paid em back the next day.  I got some stories--one of the things that--you say well how could you buy a five million dollar company?  Well, first we negotiated a price by being very cagey.  We went to New York and got some of the guys who knew something about finance to help us set the price.  The United--and a guy at J.P. Morgan, who had been working--some of the brothers had been working in the system and they told us how to do that, and we came back and negotiated a price and we had to get it financed.  Well, it was leveraged of ten to one that is for every dollar we were able to get together, there was ten dollars worth of assets that we could buy.  So my chief financial officer who had only had one thousand all of a sudden showed up with $ll,000.  So I said where did you get it, and he says, he used his credit card.  Well I had four credit cards with $5,000 limits each and an American Express card for two thousand.  So I was able to take that $22,000 and buy almost a quarter of a million dollars worth of Parks Sausage in assets.  And then of course I had to pay those credit cards off afterwards, but then we were owners.  We had bigger salaries and we paid off the credit cards.  So to that extent, the sausage company was bought with credit cards--
Speaker 1: That's amazing.
Speaker 2: --See.  And what it shows is that possibility thinking.  That you just have to--it's not a question of shortage of money out there, it's a shortage of ideas and how to get the money.  And we came up with this type of thing to do that.  We used bond financing from. industrial bonds from the City of Baltimore [Maryland] to put up some of the money, we used ideas, that's all.  There's possibilities, which is encouraging because if you had to wait for people to have material assets all the time, you know, you'd never do anything.
Story_ID: 87614
Speaker 1: So Parks Sausage went through this so the highest peak in sales, I guess, we were doing when we did the buyout, we were doing about sixty million dollars a year.  And the high point came in '92' (1992), I think when we did thirty million dollars in sales.  And along the way, after I bought the company, I was the majority stock holder, we did a joint venture with Sara Lee.  We sold to Sara Lee, 49 percent of the company.  And then I bought it back in 1994, that 49 percent.  And so that kind of inter-relatedness and specialized deals that, you know, you see in the papers, we were right in the middle of all of that.  We done it, been there, done that, that type of thing.  That was--that was one of the high points.  And along the way, well we learned a lot.  We were continually, continually training and learning.  Some of them wanted mergers with us primarily because they saw the way we were operating.  And one firm, out of Detroit [Michigan], wanted us to be their flagship company because of the techniques we had adopted.  For example, as early as '54 (1954) we were using close-circuit TV to monitor our manufacturing process.  We were just way ahead.  We were using material-management systems, inventory control, weekly profit and loss statements.  We came up with something called a cost workout which we took off of the numbers bankers, because they had to work out what the payout was gonna be on the numbers, and so some of our people had numbers' background, we just set technology, because we had three hundred students and that would apply to sausage.  So inventory control--especially--we had a perishable product.  So just in time of warehousing that people were talking about, we would go to seminars in Chicago [Illinois], the American Meat Institute to talk about just in time.  We said if you got fresh sausage, you gotta have just in time stocking inventory taking, control.  We'd use coded numbers on our packages to see how old they were, because no matter if someone got some old sausage, they wouldn't blame the store, they'd blame the manufacturer of the product.  So we used to pick up all of those transfers and exchanges, part of our cost of doing business.  And we made a lot of people happy because we--I figured that if we would have to fill Raven Stadium ten times a week with customers to get us the volume that we were doing, we had to please 600,000 people a week, and it was like having an election every week now.  Because there's six candidates, six brands of sausage, right?  And we would have to win an election every week because they could choose to pick somebody else.  That's what made it fun.
Story_ID: 87615
Speaker 1: Now do you think that this is your, well, your father [William Haysbert]'s advice about sailing your own ship, you know, that the wind may be blowing against you and your experiences in the war, the Tuskegee Airmen being trained and retrained and then having to fight racism and all that, do you think that the fighting of racism in the business world gave you, I mean, once you got good at it, did it give you an advantage you think over other companies that didn't have to fight as hard?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, because you didn't have the resources that you could fall back on, that you--opponents were.  And of course we--there were some that we just couldn't handle or deal with.  For example, if we joined, Sara Lee had Jimmy Dean, so we had our own brand of expertise, but if they had resources that we didn't have, then the assumption was that we would join with them in a joint venture and share some of that clout as such, share some that banking situation.  So if we were to get financing at the Sara Lee rate, which might be on two or three percentage points below anybody else.  We adapted because, you know, basically an educated person adapts, you know, you learn and changes the way they act.  So that is the way we set our sails, S-A-I-L-S, by adapting to a business conditions.
Speaker 1: So it's sort of you get like your adapted vitality increases sort of with a number of obstacles in places where you go around those telephone poles?
Speaker 2: Yeah. You adapt.  You don't ignore it, you don't say it shouldn't be, but you don't spend any time crying because it exists.  Sure you try to get it out of the way, but you do something about it, that's part of this adaptive philosophy, and then of course the positive affirmations, over and over and over, not the negative, if you will, because negative people make you (unclear).
Story_ID: 87616
Speaker 1: Tell me about the employees, how you dealt with employees vis-a-vis, their attitude by having more positive-thinking people around?
Speaker 2: Well, actually we would tell people that we didn't allow negative people to be around us socially because it spoils the sausage.  Essentially saying that a ugly situation isn't good for you, and we would pick positive people who may not have the skills, but because their predisposition to look at what they could do and what they could be.  Then we could train them in how to do, rather than taking negative people and try to change their minds.  If you are down, if you had loser syndrome then we didn't try to reform you, we would donate to you but we're not gonna do it.  And as we would tell our people as we hired them, look we are playing in the major leagues.  We're out here competing with Armour, Swift, the biggies, okay, so we have to have an A team.  Now if you want to be a C person or a B person then you want to get in the minor leagues where they're other Cs before, because we cannot afford to compete against their A players with a set of B players, it's just not rational.  So we love you, we'll give you $50.00, we will tell you how to start a sausage company across the street, but we can't afford you unless you are capable and positive.  Competency is a must. You gotta be able because America is a competitive economy.  That's the way it is.  If you're gonna compete, you got to cut the mustard, you gotta be able to do it.  So this is what we taught.  And, again the question of our attitude toward people showed up in our discipline.  We use step discipline long before they talked about it as such.  So that when a person actually left the Parks Sausage Company, there's some that would apologize for having messed up, so to speak.  And we treated them with dignity.  We put signs allowing them to stop manufacturing a product if it wasn't of the right quality.  Supervisor or no, if they felt it wasn't right, don't do it, you are quality control person yourself and that gives power to them.  So that they felt you know, I'm in to this from a positive viewpoint.  If they had to come up and get me because the line has stopped, then he would.  But we never took that power away from the people themselves when it comes to quality or safety, and that paid off big time, because again we didn't have ordinary people then.  We transformed them by a positive and repeating it over and over, and over, positive, positive, positive, can do it.  And the people believed.  And when you believe you got a different person.
Story_ID: 87617
Speaker 1: How many different products did you make?
Speaker 2: Well, we wound up with about sixty-two different products, sizes or "SKUs" I think they called them, stock, borders, numbers or whatever, units, stock keeping units.  And for an example, we would add an eight ounce package of link sausage, a one pound package of link sausage, we would have a five-pound wholesale package of link sausage and of rope sausage, we would have you know, different sizes and beef sausage, we had beef sausage which is very big in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], for an example, and we would adapt to the market.  So therefore we wound up with maybe sixty different products and sizes as such.  Not all different flavors, but we would adapt.  Okay if people don't eat pork then you can eat chicken sausage.  We tried fish sausage, we would adapt and we would adapt from city to city.  Packaging, if pork sausage was not your thing and beef was your thing, we knew that you would look for beef rather than looking for sausage.  And so our letters on our packaging would be higher or our beef sausage because we would advertise beef sausage by Parks, or we're selling pork sausage, we would say Parks sausage, because it sounds very much like pork, and we would vary.  And then those people that wanted it pre-cooked, we had a brown and served pre-cooked sausage, a special flavor of its own, and so we adapted.  We've done chili, we did hog maws, we've had barbecue, pulled barbecue, whatever it took to succeed, because we had to keep our eye on the ball.

Speaker 1: Now at one time, you went into ice cream too?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We took a flyer into ice cream.  We had a vice president of sales and marketing come from Kraft Foods and (unclear) test.  And he always had a dream of doing ice cream plant.  And we did, we got the--we started off with a plant making it in Chicago, called Certified Foods, there was a chain of--and then they had an ice cream plant, and we had them manufacture.  And we were selling in Baltimore and New York and Chicago, but we bit off more than we could chew in it.  For example, and it's interesting, we were one of the biggest Italian sausage makers in the east coast, not all under our brand name as such.  In fact, one of the people we were making sausage for saw a box on TV which they did a TV shoot and his brand was shown as coming out of the Parks' plant.  We could never sell Italian sausage in New York.  It's a preferred product.  It was not to our benefit, if you understand what I'm saying.  If it is not one of the Pisanos you didn't sell any Italian sausage there as such.  When it came to ice cream, we sent in two truckloads out of Chicago [Illinois] into New York and to a depot terminal in New Jersey, Newark and they left the doors opened on the trailer and the guy says open it up so we can see if it's the right temperature?  So we opened it up, then he decided to see about something.  He ran away and stayed twenty minutes.  When he came back and tested the ice cream, it was too warm, he rejected it.  Later on we found we used the wrong trucking company.  We didn't use a preferred trucking company.  So as a result we had 80,000 pounds of ice cream floating around trying to sell it to somebody.  We lost a lot of money on that deal I think for that particular type, so we trashed.
Speaker 1: So the ice cream deal didn't work out?
Speaker 2: No, it didn't work out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We turned it down.  People only remember the successes, but it was a lot of failures along the way.  But we felt, on a positive viewpoint, there was a business that failed, we didn't fail you know.  And I try to pass that on to people that some projects you have may fail, but the human being didn't fail, but some people take it like they had failed and they're down.
Speaker 1: I guess people need some successes to counterbalance those failures?
Speaker 2: Oh sure, absolutely, absolutely.
Story_ID: 87619
Speaker 1: Now, one thing you've been very successful in is the--you've been successful at getting the attention of politicians and community people and--tell us about that.  I know you've been conversant with some presidents?
Speaker 2: Again, it was all based upon our appreciation for people and how people work and how people think.  In other words as I mentioned that you know as a marketer, the psychology of the consumer is critical and so it is with politics that if you understand people, or if you care for people then you try to learn something about them and their desires and so on.  In line with that in order to empower people then political, it is a way of empowering people to decide on your own future, and so I was really intrigued by that as both as a power source.  When I say power I mean the ability to make some things happen, good things.  Again, it's a question of adapting.  If you're in an urban area in the United States, you know that politics is gonna play some big portion, especially in the African American community, because we estimate that seventy percent of the black people, in Baltimore [Maryland], for example work for the government at some point.  Private industry is not big, blacks' employment is not big in the private industry.  Take a look at the Yellow Pages, you'll see how many businesses in the yellow book there are.  Now if seventy percent of the people in the city, and you care about them, if seventy percent of the jobs are related to government, then you almost have to make two decisions, one what would be the most efficient, which might be privatized, but when you throw in the C factor of color or caste or class, it may be that you have to sustain government control because if there's a layoffs you know who it's going to be, seventy percent of them are going to be black.  I mean it's fair since there's seventy percent of the population.  But that would tend to say that government has an inordinate impact on the black community.  And like you--I feel because of that that I sort of a semi-pro in the area of politics.  You say well, how do you do that?  Well, I befriended, say an Italian who was about to lose his senatorship.  When I befriended him by endorsing him and helping him to win, he accepted my recommendation as to who should get his seat, if he had to leave, and he did.  So to that particular extent that kinds of story spreads out and--you see I was an advisory if you read the Kweisi Mfume's book, you know "Mean Streets", you'll find that I was his political advisor.  When he came in his situation then with an African name,
Speaker 1: It's not the easiest thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so therefore when he went to Congress that meant that I had connections.  So I'm fairly well connected.  Every American businessman has to realize that the regulations that you're gonna operate by is by--due to public policy, and as you can see, the insurance industry, the media, the media right now with Mike Powell in the commission from FEC or is it FCC.  This impact the business, so any business person that is ignorant, the fact that it is a political economic system, you see.  So what looks like to be a nasty word is just a practical thing that an American business person has to consider.
Story_ID: 87620
Speaker 1: Have you ever felt like-have you ever felt yourself in a difficult situation in terms of a political choice based on your--
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely, definitely.  It's tough sometimes when you realize that the people with the highest index of need and the lowest index of resources to fill those needs are black.  But then as an American you have to decide or make any--that if the operation of the city or the state is not well done and that the fact that he's of some other ethnic group isn't the factor if you're (unclear), in terms of how all the people are going to be impacted, you know with all due respect.  That makes some difficult choices and sometimes unpopular choices.
Speaker 1: --Sometimes, for instance, you might have a black candidate for a position who you really know doesn't have connections or the wherewithal to really do the job.  And we got to make a decision either to support the black community or the person because he's black.  He may not even have the support of the community.  Sometimes we have to profile a black candidate really have a broad base of black approval but no real connections for doing anything else.
Speaker 2: That's right.  They can't do it.  For example, if the black candidate does not inspire the people to come out and work for the betterment of the city then it doesn't matter what personality, because one person cannot run a city or a state or a government.  So no matter who the mayor is or who the governor is, if he cannot get the people to come together to act a cohesive force, you're not gonna get better education, you're not gonna get a better economy, you're not gonna get jobs, you just can't do it.  So although sometimes, there in [Washington] D.C. the guy may not have a charismatic attitude, but he can indenture, engender trust, which the people can coalesce around okay, but that isn't based ethnicity per se.  Wherever it's possible I think that co-play is such a big part that if you do have in a majority a black situation, if you can't have a black leader then the kids who need to be inspired you know can aspire and hope and do that.  It doesn't work all the time because there's been a lot of gains made among the black community.  You know 8000 people elected and yet per person median income the rate of home ownership, the net worth or the financial condition has not been better.  So maybe it's just cause I'm a bottom-line person.  So that the political choices may not be as important, you know, the civil rights may not be as important as the silver rights in terms of the movement.  And so even while you're involved in helping the congressman or advising the president of the city council or something of that particular type, you always have to keep in mind is that have the people benefited so that you can actually see what the impact has been.  There was a time of course you had someone set up and make their point, be the voice.  Well I'm passing the voice over and over, what's the bottom line, how many cars do you have out in your parking lot when you employ people and they can have a living wage and buy a car.  If you go out there and everybody is, you know, using raggle-taggle cars in the parking lot, then don't show me how good it is for you, people are not benefiting.  I'm not being moralistic, just being real.
Story_ID: 87621
Speaker 1: Now, well tell me about that.  You know, you've been conversing with several presidents.  What's your impression of say [President] Bill Clinton?
Speaker 2: Well, as you know, I was once, supposed to run for mayor.  People have asked me over and over, I'm too old now, but someone asked me yesterday, cause they would kill me, that kind of pressure.  As far as Bill Clinton is concerned, again, you have to judge him like you judge [President Lyndon B.] Johnson or [President Ronald] Reagan or anyone else.  What has been the impact?  I think that Bill Clinton's impact on the black community has been tremendous.  I think it's tremendous.  And it may just be a confluence of events, but the economy was really booming.  We got rid of the deficits and so on under him.  Now, I think he's extremely bright, but I don't think he adapted.  What I mean by that is that I think other presidents have strayed from the narrow path and passed, but the media's attitude towards thim was different.  It has evolved.  We had an attorney general--we had a adjutant general by the name of Galston in Baltimore City during the Civil Rights furor and he would get drunk and go into bad driving, you know and that kind of thing.  (Unclear) we said wait a minute, this man is too valuable to lose, we can't let this get out because it's irrelevant in terms of how much good he does.  [John F.] Kennedy, all those who come along, are you kidding, they were all men, I mean (unclear).  And what I mean by that is not only they were male, but they were also human, but it was a practice not to bring those things out.  Bill Clinton didn't realize it was not like that anymore, that nobody was, you know, you weren't protected anymore.  So I think that's from his quote, moral turpitude and what not that he wasn't any worse than anyone else.  The impact wise, I think he was the first black president.  I think he had a real feel for the black population for example and God knows why, but he had a tremendous amount of appeal.  He was a saxophone player.
Story_ID: 87622
Speaker 1: What about the first black mayor of Baltimore [Maryland], Kurt Schmoke?
Speaker 2: The first black mayor one because he was a extremely bright guy, well credentialed, and well meaning, Yale, Harvard, Rhode Scholar and so on.  And just to an extent that was needed because it was symbolic.  I don't think that he had any special aptitudes towards the market.  He used business terms, he didn't have any special aptitude towards the market in the city, which was predominantly black.  He was a legal person, and I think he protected the people who studied from a legal viewpoint.  But I don't think he had more than academic interest in the economic plight.  I don't mean he didn't feel for it, but he just--he just didn't have insights on it, and that was not his agenda.  He was in law, and of course he's at Howard [University] now in law.  And that's a good place, good place, cause that's what he was, but as far as weathering the medium income and the conditions--financial conditions of the city, the mass of the city improved, no.  There were no millionaires made in the black community as there were in Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 87623
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today in Baltimore [Maryland] and the rest of the country?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's a time to step back.  There have been approximately 35 years since the Civil Rights Act and amendments were passed.  I think there have been battles won, both by the civil or the physical revolution of the civil war, that freed the bodies, I think the fights for civil rights in terms of being able to eat anyplace you want, that's true.  There's been the right to vote and so on have been acquired.  But with all of those things, the general condition of the population has not progressed that much.  It's weird what people coming from every country, coming in and joining and doing better--and now the Hispanic community, in doing better.  We have fought in every war, we built America, America's superiority in the world that's been because they had free labor and you see what low paid labor is doing with China and the rest of the countries.  We had that advantage here when blacks--but weirdly enough, blacks they're only up to 65 percent, 66 percent on the income of the non-black population.  And I say non-black because certainly the Japanese and Chinese and now the Hispanics are exceeding the median income.  So you have to step back in my hopes that we recognize the fact that America is a competitive economy.  And that you have to know--you have to be financially literate to make it in America.  You're gonna have to understand money.  And so my hopes is that that will be along with others a silver rights movement among black people, working first to free their psychology because even as we said about adaptive and setting your sails and what not, we gonna have to have that type of adjustment a mental adjustment on the port, because blacks have the brains, we have the cash flow in billions, we have talents, we have skills, we don't have yet the psychology, and so I see that growing, but I do see it growing.  We have to realize the fact that having all these law makers, the city councilman, the house of delegates and whatnot, the impact is very little in terms of the welfare of the people.
Story_ID: 88509
Speaker 1: It's been said that you are like an unofficial mayor of your district in Baltimore [Maryland].  How do you, I mean, I know there's a move to get you to run for mayor at one time?
Speaker 2: Well, that's true, but I found out what it's like on the inside and that was not for me.  That the truth of the matter is is that the political rights in that whole particular area has to go along with the economic rights.  And so being cognizant of that, I didn't feel necessarily that I could get the people to be cohesive.  I'm about for getting some cohesion in the community.  I'm chairman of the local Urban League, and we realize we take a pro-realistic approach, although the people with the highest index of need and the lowest index of resources to the needs happen to be black if that's true.  But the home ownership rate is more important to me and to the life of the city because you see racism can be a health problem for a city.  In other words I'm saying the health of the city is affected by these things and so the life of economic know-how, the lack of joining in the American system in the mainstream can be a problem for the city.  People are coming to me asking for my endorsement and they tell me that I am the like the unofficial mayor of northeast Baltimore, if you will.  Meaning the fact that maybe because of my longevity or because people trust me, trust my judgment, they look for me to send a signal as to whether it's all right or it's not.  And there have been some instances where I've taken some unpopular views because I was more interested in the welfare of the people under that particular person than it would be someone who necessarily looked like me.  So some people say, well, you have to think about your people first.  I do, but that doesn't necessarily mean that an incompetent person of the same pluralistic group, if you will, and that's what modern cities are.  See everything--see everybody is a group on this or a group on that, and you got to keep so many of them satisfied, but that that's necessarily good for the bottom line in it, and I say there's such a lack of hope in our cities.
Story_ID: 88510
Speaker 1: They show up and we kill more people in Baltimore [Maryland] than the Israelis have lost in the last 32 months of warfare in Palestine.  So I added two (unclear) terrorists out of fear, I knew I was (unclear), but then why.  Well, I think one of the prime ingredients is that our young people don't have hope.  They don't expect to be better off next year or in ten years.  So they live fast, they live now and they've lost so many friends and relatives to murder, if you will, that you don't have a ten-year plan or a 15-year plan, so why save, for what, you know.  And so I think that that lack of hope is keyed into financial literacy for one thing, it's a sense that, you know, one day I'm gonna be in a good spot.  That doesn't exist.
Speaker 2: Have you had any success speaking to young people about--and some young people involved in drug sales or other things have some business sense that is really  highly developed, like the numbers people in the early day?
Speaker 1: The numbers people--well you know during my generation, if you--and many alert, intelligent people went into numbers, because for some reason in that sense they could apply their know-how.  And I think now that there's a sense that that's the only way to apply your know-how is to be in drugs, that's where the money is.  Now the realities of it, because everything is perception.  The reality is that for young kid, high school kid to be selling dope, he makes less than the minimum wage.  And what we mean by that is--although he thinks he's got a lot of money, the number of hours he has to spend out on the streets to hustle up these lower level sales, he's making $5.15 an hour.  So that lack of financial literacy, and I say it like, you know, you talk about computer literacy, I don't mean you had to know how to make a computer or even why the programs are run the way they run, but you have to be literate to survive, and I think that we've got a lot of people who don't have financial literacy and they're not surviving very well and there has been created a dependency syndrome which means I don't have to depend on myself, it's always you, you know, blame games.  That it's not about me adapting my sales, it's about what they gonna do, what's the government, police or the parents or my cousin or the hip hop guy, or what, it's always someone else, it's not--it's never me, and that's lack of pro-activity is, it's an extent and I think we can do something about that if we realize that the bag is up above the shoulders.
Story_ID: 88511
Speaker 1: Okay. Now you did at one time you explored running for mayor as a Republican, I think you explored (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I'm from Ohio, remember that.  I was born in Cincinnati, Ohio.  If you were in Ohio you were a Republican.
Speaker 1: --[William Howard] Taft
Speaker 2: Yeah [William Howard] Taft and the whole bit.  So when I moved here from Ohio to Maryland, not finding a democratic environment, but a number of us got together behind a Republican candidate for State Senator and broke open the entire state senate behind a republican.  Because the Republicans can get through the primary, a black could get through the Republican primary when the Democratic bosses had the locks on the regular channels.  So I remained a Republican.  Eight years after that there was so much overwhelming Democratic rule, I turned my election card over and on the other side it said Democrat, so I had permanent interest, I don't have a permanent party.  And to that particular extent, I was prepared to move from being a Democrat to go on the Republican side and run for mayor.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That makes sense.
Speaker 2: Now we have a Republican governor, so I can talk to him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I understand.
Story_ID: 88512
Speaker 1: Tell me, when you look back on all of your accomplishments, what do you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I see that while I'm not a leader, in my mind, and other people may see it differently, I'm an helper, I'm an assistant, that's the high point that I have assisted.  I helped found two banks.  I helped with the formation of an insurance companies.  I helped with this, I helped with that, so you know, basically, a helper.  So that's my high point, cause I have helped.  Now that sounds kind of weird, but after you make some money, you know I, due the one financial move in the '80s (1980s), I made a million dollars over night.  But what you do you sort of look back and say, is this all there is, you know, you had the Dom Perignon parties and you know, you had that gratification, and when you come up on welfare, you know, having enough food is a real victory, that's a turn on, but after you've gone through it, and I see some of the young basketball stars and millionaires now are going through it now, and you look back and say, okay, is this all there is?  I mean what happens now.  When I do that then I realize that that impact, and there's a growing number of young blacks in the Urban League Movement now, for example, the young professionals who say, hey, okay, I can eat a steak when I want to.  But what impact am I having as a human being on things.  So it's a high point to me I have had some impact.  I thought I, you know, be much further along now than we were, but so I hope to have some impact in the future on the psychology of the black population, that's, that's where my head is now.
Story_ID: 88513
Speaker 1: Okay.  And is there anything that you would do differently, when you look back on things?
Speaker 2: Yes.  What I find is that my project program failure rate was highly affected by misspent time.  When you think about it, it's just misspent time.  You know I spent my time doing the wrong thing.  Now, I got a know-how--a lot of know-how as to  how to do things properly, but in order to be effective, you've got to pick, you know, you learn how to climb the ladder, but the ladder is against the wrong wall.  You didn't make any progress, but you're great at climbing ladders.  Picking out the right wall means that you have spent your time ladder-climbing better than somebody who has spent their time climbing the ladder against the wrong wall.  So what I have found is that I have spent a lot of time on the wrong things.  You know, maybe spent too much time playing computer games when I should have been taking care of business in terms of priorities, that's what I'm saying.  You need to set priorities and goals and spend your time on what's important, first thing's first.  Misspent time, and I suggest to anyone, check it out.  You got 24 hours a day just like I have and every other human beings.  The difference between us is how you spend your time.
Story_ID: 88514
Speaker 1: And sir, one last question.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: It sure sound like a platitude.  It has been said so many times before that I had to plead guilty to it.  I'd like to be remembered as an assistant.  I'd like to be remembered as an assistant, that I helped things happen, you know for people, and in the process I'd be rewarded by a lot of experiences, assistant to the Secretary of the Army, (unclear) the secretary of the army, I've been on the Federal Reserve Bank, I've eaten well, lived well, been to the big resorts and known some great people and whatnot, but that's been, I think, more of a reward than it has been the high point of what I was shooting after, or how I got there, I just helped out.  I helped out with the United Way and won the first Bloom award for reconciling difference between the two ethnic groups.  That's reward for helping, and because of that, I was in position to be on boards that paid me $100,000 a year.  Because the people who are helping the community are the people who are going to be able to run those giant corporations, so it's sort of like a byproduct.  So I see my quote material success as being a byproduct for helping.  And didn't the Bible say something about that, being a servant, and so on. Yeah.  So you know I'm in good company.
Story_ID: 88515
Speaker 1: Okay.  Warfield, in 1992 had me appear on the cover of their magazine.  I was holding one of our new products that the smoke sausage held in my hand there.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  Okay, ready?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Black Enterprise Magazine in September, 1996 had a feature of our sales of the Parks Sausage Company to Franco Harris.  He purchased the company there and this is the headlines that came out of it.
Speaker 2: This is a picture in the Black Enterprise's story of 1996, showing me, Ray Haysbert heading off the Parks Sausage Company hat to Mr. Lydell Mitchell who was the new president.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  Okay.
Speaker 2: This was the magazine--the Baltimore Magazine's anointing of me as an executive of the year and shows in the background the Parks Sausage Company plant.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  You don't think we're crazy in the computer later on.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I suspected that, but I said now they're either crazy or they know something I don't know.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  Okay, ready?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In 1993 we had a nationwide launch on a new product called Chitterlings and this is a picture of the ad showing my lovely wife and myself with chitterlings and champagne.
Speaker 1: Okay, Parks.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me as appeared in a magazine put out by the Hertz Motor Rental Company showing me and the plant before a rack of smoked sausage.
Speaker 1: This was my picture that was shown in a calendar put out by the state government in Maryland in 1991.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  Why were you chosen for that?
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was chosen for this honor as being a distinguished citizen of Maryland.
Speaker 2: This is a picture taken with the then congressman, now president of the NAACP, Kweisi Mfume and a local industrialist, at the opening of the new three-acre plant of the Parks Sausage Company.
Speaker 1: This is the picture of the then governor of the State of Maryland, Mr. Agnew, he was later to be the vice president of the United States, and he was handing me a check for the United Way.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  Do you know what year that was?  Do you remember the year?
Speaker 1: Sixty-eight, I guess.
Speaker 2: Probably '68' (1968).  Let me see if it's--probably 1968, yeah.  This is a picture of myself and the founder of Parks Sausage, Henry Parks, taken in the early 1980s, about 1981.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of Mr. Henry Parks and myself as vice-president of the Parks Sausage Company at our building which was then on the site of currently Ravens Stadium.  This is a picture of me and the Parks Sausage bowling team, the others are employees of the company, along with me.  I was about 38 at that time.
Speaker 1: Did you guys have to pick up spare ribs or something?
Speaker 2: This is a picture of the governor of Maryland and the secretary of economic development awarding me the Manufacturer of the Year Award.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of the cutting of the ribbon on the new sixteen and half million dollar Parks Sausage Manufacturing Plant along with city officials and the then congressman Kweisi Mfume.  It was approximately 1990.
Speaker 1: In 1991 I was awarded the National Minority Entrepreneur of the Year given by--at the White House, by then President George 41 Bush [George H.W. Bush].
Speaker 2: This is a picture taken of me in the late '60s (1960s) when I was a member of the Urban League and wore it proudly.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a picture taken in 1954 at the inauguration of the Woodbrook Avenue Plant of the Parks Sausage Company.  The speaker was to be a Maryland Supreme Court Judge and the first Senator of the Maryland General Assembly to be African American.  The other two people are Bishop Hogard of the AME Zion Church, the historian, and Mr. Henry G. Parks, Jr., the founder.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of the Woodbrook Avenue Plant of the Parks Sausage Company in reference to Camden Yards is the reference to our movement into a new building and people are trying to buy the company.  This picture was taken in July of 1990 at the dedication ceremonies of the new Parks Circle Business.  See when you try to do something you always (unclear).  This is a second picture taken at the dedication of the 1990 building.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  All right.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of a Ray Haysbert taken in 1982 in my office at the Camden Yards site.  This is a picture taken in the Central Park in New York when we were doing a promotion along with the Park's Department.  It started a campaign called "Take a New Look at your parks." OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  Let's start with the big one.
Speaker 1: You'll start with the big one.  This is a picture of me in 1952 being visited by a number of models who were making a tour of the Parks Sausage Company.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me in 1945 when I was a member--in Italy, when I was a member of the Tuskegee Airmen in World War II.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  All right.  Can you tell us about this?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.  This was November of 2002 a photo in which I was headlining the Union Memorial Hospital brochure.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  And what was the occasion.  Why did they choose you?
