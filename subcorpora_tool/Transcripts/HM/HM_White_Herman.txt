Speaker 1: Hello Dr. White.  My name is Linda Williams and I am the interviewer.
Speaker 2: Hello.
Speaker 1: And the videographer is Matthew Hickey and Julieanna Richardson is observing today.  And sir, I would like to start out by having you to state and spell your entire name.
Speaker 2: My name is Herman Brenner White, Jr.  That's H-E-R-M-A-N, B-R-E-N-N-E-R, W-H-I-T-E.
Speaker 1: And your date of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born in September 28th, 1948.
Speaker 1: The location of your birth?
Speaker 2: In Tuskegee, Alabama.  Macon County as it says.
Speaker 1: And today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is October 13th -- no?  How about November 13th?  November 13th, 2006.
Speaker 1: And the place and location of this interview?
Speaker 2: This is the University of Illinois, Chicago, Circle Campus in the City of Chicago.
Speaker 1: And Dr. White, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am a research high energy elementary particle physicist.  I do work in experimental particle physics at a large research laboratory.  Some people say that I smash atoms for a living.
Story_ID: 31564
Speaker 1: And now I would like to engage you in five short answer warm up questions.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Number one, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food?  That would probably be apple pie.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: With ice cream.
Speaker 1: (Laughter). With ice cream of course.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And what is your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I actually don't have a favorite time of year.  I'm somewhat partial I suppose to the fall of the year.  But I find something very important to do in all of the seasons.
Speaker 1: And your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: And your favorite place or vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well I--it's almost embarrassing.  I don't really take many vacations.  I think this year I took a vacation to the Grand Canyon for the first time.  I've traveled so many places in the world, it's hard to even think of them as places that I might go to vacate.  But I do have friends in many, on many continents.  So I don't really have much of a leisure location if you like.  I tend to try to go toward places that have water or now with the Grand Canyon, places that are very deep in the ground.
Speaker 1: And last, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Actually I don't.  But I think that some of my students might quote me as saying "outstanding" in response to how well they can do on their work.  That's about it.
Story_ID: 31565
Speaker 1: Now let's talk a bit about your mother's background and your mother's side of the family.  Could you first state and spell your mother's entire name, including her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother's name, Susie Mae Fort White, that's S-U-S-I-E, M-A-E, F-O-R-T, W-H-I-T-E.  And my mother was born in Macon County, Alabama into a family of farmers basically. All of my parents, my grandparents were farmers, into a large family.
Speaker 1: And what is your mother's date of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother was born July, 1924.  July 22nd, 1924.
Speaker 1: And Macon County would be considered Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: Macon County is the--essentially the county in the mid-portion of Alabama.  Tuskegee is considered the county seat.  So basically it's the largest city or largest community that was, that's in that county.  So to some extent, people don't make a significant distinction between Macon County and Tuskegee, however Tuskegee does have universities and federal facilities and that sort of thing. But Macon County has a lot of agrarian type of activities there as well, a lot of farms, very large farms and tree, tree farms and that sort of thing.
Story_ID: 31566
Speaker 1: Speaking of Tuskegee [Alabama], is the Booker T. Washington [Booker Taliaferro Washington] Machine still strong in that area?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Booker T. Washington certainly was a founder of what was now--what was then called Tuskegee Institute.  Now the university is much larger and it's actually officially known as Tuskegee University.  And Booker T. Washington has a large history in that town.  In fact, the church that I grew up in was his home church, the Mount Olive Missionary Baptist Church.  And Booker T. Washington High School, I went to a high school called the Tuskegee Institute High School.  They built a larger high school to encompass a larger population of students and the high school that I went to is now a middle school.  It's called the Tuskegee Institute Middle School or something of that sort. But the high school is called Booker T. Washington High School.
Speaker 1: Was it near the campus or on the campus?
Speaker 2: The Tuskegee Institute High School where I went to school was very close to the campus within probably about three or four blocks.  The school that is now the Booker T. Washington High School is on the other side of town.  It's fairly far away from the university.
Speaker 1: And also, is there a George Washington Carver legacy still there or--?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, very much so.  And I'm sorry to interrupt you.  I--George Washington Carver was a great, great scientist.  And it turns out that the Carver Museum which I have not really been to cause I left Tuskegee when I was seventeen years old to go to college.  But the Washington, George Washington Carver Museum has an incredible amount of artifacts of this man's history and so the impact that he had at that time and now on Tuskegee is really quite substantial.  I used to remember people telling me that Henry Ford came down to Tuskegee every year to try to encourage George Washington Carver to leave Tuskegee and come work for him.
Speaker 1: Oh really?
Speaker 2: And it was very interesting to know that sort of connection between what Mr. Carver was doing in terms of his research on potatoes and sweet potatoes and all the sort of peanuts particularly making shoe polish and various types of energy saving oils and so forth, absolutely an amazing fellow.  And he also was an artist.  He had oil paintings and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: That (unclear) I did not know.  That had to have been a tremendous time in history with both Booker T. Washington and George Washington Carver at the same time at Tuskegee University during that period.  And I'm wondering, do you have any stories that your mother often spoke about during that era or anything that came up in her background that related to the educational facilities at Tuskegee at that time?
Speaker 2: Well actually my mother [Susie Mae Fort White] worked for the John A. Andrew Hospital where I was born it turns out.  The John Andrew Hospital was a hospital run by the Tuskegee Institute community so basically the doctors and the nursing facilities there basically were tied into all of the medical services for the town and in fact for the county.  The nursing school which was a very famous nursing school produced a significant number of nurses and they of course fed right into the hospital and then to other parts of the south usually, but also other parts of the world as well.  My mother was a part of the pediatrics nursing group there for quite a number of years.  She was a nursing assistant.  And it was very interesting certainly to know that the university itself actually had this particular training aspect to it in terms of medical health and medical training and so forth. But the college also had a broad base of structure in terms of veterinary medicine.  There was certainly aviation because of the Tuskegee Airmen [332nd Fighter Group and the 477th Bombardment Group of the U.S. Army Air Corps, 1940-1946] there was a very strong impact with regard to the history of the town with what's going on at the university.  So Booker T. Washington and George Washington Carver I think to some extent provided the basis by which you could actually build a very famous institute, because their initial work was just to bring people who had been former slaves and try to provide them with the--what we call the technical skills to do things such as plumbing and brick laying and that sort of thing.  The farming that was done in the area because of the fact that many of the slaves who had been part of the eighteenth century area there in Tuskegee now were land owners.  They had the forty acres and that sort of thing so there was a tendency to try to bring this group of people up to a level where they could actually maintain not only their lives but also build up the entire community.  So for example the idea of contour plotting, you know where you actually contour plow various areas in terms of crop rotation was something that was pioneered in that general area and about that time.  So it was a community of just innovation, lots of scientific innovation from my point of view.  There was also art going on as well.
Story_ID: 31567
Speaker 1: It is amazing that Booker T.'s [Booker Taliaferro Washington]  whole principle was based upon industrial technology in that he had no perception of or at that point did not have an interest in science at that time.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And law and all of the other areas that other people at that particular time.  How in your opinion did this change over a period of time?
Speaker 2: Well I think when you think about the founding of Tuskegee Institute, certainly the institute itself was designed particularly to provide a population of people who could essentially be contributors to society, but not necessary professionals.  The thought process was not so much--and I imagine it was probably some restrictions and constraints on the institution itself in terms of what you are actually teaching people.  When you have various other parts of the country where you had a lot more access to things and perhaps a smaller population, certainly of African Americans engaged in just learning how to be professionals or to pursue professional activities.  In my life time certainly when I was born there in the late 1940s and early 1950s, after World War II [1939-1945], there was a significant number of people who were coming back to Tuskegee, particularly because of the Tuskegee Airmen [332nd Fighter Group and the 477th Bombardment Group of the U.S. Army Air Corps, 1940-1946] and because of the military participation of African American men in World War II.  So a great deal of education effort, the G.I. Bill [Readjustment Act of 1944] and all those sort of things, provided a basis by which the institute could essentially exploit all of those resources and particularly all of the people because there was still segregation.  So there wasn't really a large number of historically black colleges and universities that existed.  And all of the people who wanted to have academic training had to essentially go to some of these institutions.  So the population of people at Tuskegee slowly grew as a result of just the time.  So if you wanted to take the nineteenth century up to the twentieth century from the time that Booker T. Washington and George Washington Carver and all--and Moton [Robert Russa Moton] and a number of other people, Lewis Adams, started that community in terms of making it a place where you have a major, I won't say research institution but it eventually became that, but a major educational center to where it would be now as the Tuskegee University.  You have to give some credit to the fact that the times somewhat generated the need to have these institutions, but also provided all of the infrastructure and the motivation to provide the technical training and the academic training that was necessary to be able to keep the community going.  I think personally that George Washington Carver and Booker T. Washington really had some vision.
Speaker 1: Oh yes.
Speaker 2: You would have to have vision to be able to even think about how you would actually put such an institution together.  And if you go now to the university there, it's a national historic site, the home where George Washington Carver and where Booker T. Washington lived.  In fact you can take tours of it.  It's very interesting.  I've actually took a tour of that building about ten years ago.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I hadn't taken the time.  I was too busy doing physics.  I had to go back and look at that history.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 31568
Speaker 1: Well do you remember any stories or songs or legends that your mother often spoke of during her background growing up in Tuskegee [Alabama] or Macon County [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Not really.  My parents, both my mother [Susie Mae Fort White] and my father [Herman Brenner White, Senior] grew up not too far from each other but they were in the rural part of Macon County.  And being members of the farm family, their efforts there was primarily to work on bringing in the crop.  They had certainly the usual sort of tasks that you would have if you were going to be a farmer.  She usually would tell us about the family, not so much about the community per se because they had a very large family.  My mother's family I believe was thirteen or fourteen children in that family.  And during those times, those years in the early part of the twentieth century, people who lived on farms usually had large families.  So there was a tendency for my parents to tell me about basically what was happening when they were growing up with the distribution of brothers and sisters in their families was fairly large.  So the young ones--and the old ones were grown-ups at some level by the time the young ones were getting up and remembering what was going on.  But it was a very close family.  It was very structured in a lot of ways.  My mother --my grandmother and my grandfather on my mother's side were somewhat pillars of the community and they had a very large farm.  They were very prominent in the church which was right across the street as a matter of fact.
Speaker 1: And what did you say your mother's name was again?
Speaker 2: Fort.
Speaker 1: Fort?
Speaker 2: Fort.  My grandfather was Pierce Fort and he was--
Speaker 1: P-I-E-R-C-E?
Speaker 2: P-I-E-R-C-E.  And he was a farmer and my grandmother or my mother's mother was Mary Ann Fort.  And there is a host of uncles and aunts, not many of them are left yet.  My mother and my aunt and one uncle are still alive.  And my aunt and my uncle live in Detroit.  There were quite a number of people who actually moved from Alabama to Detroit and my mother still lives in Tuskegee, Alabama in the same house that she and my father built in the early 1940s or late 1940s I should say.  There weren't very many stories.  The stories were usually about things they did when they were kids and we sort of overheard these stories.  The interactions outside of the family and outside of the rural community for the most part just didn't happen.  There was incidences of going into the city, going into town and so forth. But beyond that and school, they really had very much a focused life in terms of doing agricultural work and maintaining their lives that way.
Story_ID: 31569
Speaker 1: Well how far back can you trace your ancestors?  Do you remember your grandparents on either your mother's [Susie Mae Fort White] side or your father's [Herman Brenner White, Senior]side?
Speaker 2: Yes, I remember my grandparents very well.  My sister [Zepherine Finch] and I would go down and spend the summers with them.  Well part of the summer I should say.  My grandfather on my father's side I remember and we interacted with him quite a lot.  My grandmother on my father's side I never knew.  There are no photographs of her as well.  There was a tendency for people to say she was a very beautiful woman and during that particular time there was also a question about the history I think, of my--I--when I say question, I don't mean in terms of people not knowing but certainly the fact that there was a tendency if you look basically at the structure of my father's family, there was some indication that those individuals who were part of ancestry there came from native people in the southeastern United States.  On my mother's side--I think my father's family probably were immigrants.  My father--my mother's grandfather for example, my grandfather on my mother's side and his ancestry probably his--come outside, probably started outside of the United States.  My grandmother, I believe in fact there's some effort that was being done to try to trace her ancestry back to Africa.  There's one cousin, a young woman who works in New Jersey and she is taking this task on to try to find out where everyone came from and she's very, very energetic about it and she's doing a good job.  So perhaps later on if this interview is being given a few years from now we probably would have all the information back to at least a few more generations.  But the details of letters and material just doesn't exist, as far as I know, with regard to my family beyond my grandparents.  My mother does remember her grandfather, but not very much about him.  We don't hear very much about him.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your grandfather on your father's side's name?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My grandfather's name on my father's side was Archie, Archie White and my grandmother was named Sylvia, Sylvia White.  But I never knew my grandmother, my paternal grandmother and I really would have liked to have seen photographs of her.  And from what my father said there was never any photographs taken or there were none that he actually knew about.  But they were also farmers in Fort Davis, Alabama which is not far from--it's not in Macon County but it's an adjacent community to Macon County, Alabama.
Speaker 1: And on your mother's side do you remember your grandfather's entire name?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My grandfather's name was, well it was just Pierce Fort.  He was sort of a pillar of the community but I--growing up it was hard for me to understand much of the Spring Hill Community.  In fact, the Spring Hill Community is well known now as being one of those places that's maintained a great deal of the kind of historical characteristics that it had perhaps even in the last century.  I mean there's modern things and modern houses and that sort of thing.  But if you go to some of the churches there, they still sing in sort of a plain song type of a gospel singing and so forth, very unusual.  And this was pointed out to me by a colleague of mine in Virginia who was doing a music history and looked up and said oh, it shows up Spring Hill Baptist Church as a part of the very historical work that he was doing.  So I was very pleased to hear about that.
Speaker 1: And earlier on you said that on your mother's side was the African ancestry.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But on your father's side was the Native American?
Speaker 2: I think that's true.  I don't know--as I understood it from the stories that I've heard that my father had said that in fact the Choctaw tribes [Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians] were somehow connected with our family.  I don't know in fact how that is.  I don't know the details about it.  My mother said certainly my grandfather was fairly Caucasian looking and my grandmother was very African heritage looking.  And we don't know where in Africa she came from.  We don't know where outside of the U.S. where my grandfather's heritage comes from.  But there were a number of indications and certainly of my grandfather's side--it's unfortunate that I don't have a photograph to show you--that his heritage might have been somewhere in Western Europe, but it's not clear.
Story_ID: 31570
Speaker 1: In terms of personality who would you think that your personality is a part of your mother's [Susie Mae Fort White] tradition or of your father's [Herman Brenner White, Senior] tradition?  In terms of--?
Speaker 2: My personality?  Oh that's a toughie.  I would say in all likelihood I have a lot of characteristics like my father.  My father was a very disciplined man.  He went to the military and as a person growing up, he certainly imparted on me a significant amount of desire to see the world.  He was a person who taught me a little French when I was five years old because he had come back from the war and he knew a certain amount about the rest of the planet and I was very impressed with the amount of retention that I had as a result of that.  But he was also a hunter and I think a lot of my characteristics are very much like my father in terms of certainly my mannerisms or at least I've been told that.  I think my thought processes and my curiosity really comes from my mother.  My mother is a very smart woman and she understands some of the things that I actually do for a living which is really quite remarkable because some things I don't quite understand as a research scientist.  But I think probably my personality is closer to my father's I think, sense of discipline and so forth.  But it's hard to say, I think.
Speaker 1: And you said your father was involved in World War I [1914-1918], that is, correct?
Speaker 2: World War II [1939-1945].
Speaker 1: World War II?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My father joined the Navy initially I think when he was about seventeen which is a little too early to join the military.  But this was probably a time that he could find an avenue to go into the military and he decided to join the Navy and he stayed in the Navy for a year and then went into the Army.  He served in the army during World War II in Belgium and Paris [France] and England and he was in the--he was a quarter master sergeant I guess dealing with food services and that sort of thing.  Being from Tuskegee of course and having the heritage certainly of the Tuskegee Airmen where he received his honorary dismissal, I guess--what do you call it, the honorary discharge, he went to work at the Moton Field [Moton Field Municipal Airport, Tuskegee, Alabama] which is the place where the Tuskegee Airmen had been training and then he left there and went to the Veteran's Hospital [Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System (CAVHCS), Tuskegee, Alabama] where he remained for thirty-three years in the special diet cook area of that hospital.  But he served, he told me very few stories about World War II.  He would tell me about some of the places that he went and the things that he saw and the people that he interacted with.  But he did not tell me a great deal about the war.  I think he felt very strongly that engaging--being a religious man that engaging in the taking of life and so forth was something that you know you really had to sort of keep to yourself.  It was some horrors presumably.  And of course being an African American man in World War II was a difficult activity.  He would tell me some things sort of father to son about the military and about his experiences in the military.  And of course we've heard all of the stories about various people who had been engaged in World War II and the kind of difficulties that certainly existed in a segregated army up to 1948.  So it was really a difficult time.  It did make a difference I think when I was a graduating senior or graduating--or near a junior in high school there was an effort to try to find various African American young men to go into the Air Force Academy, various academies in the United States.  And of course people focused a great deal on Tuskegee, because Tuskegee was a place where--that had a lot of history and a lot of success with regard to military training.  And my father encouraged me to be drafted rather than to seek out a position in the Air Force Academy which is something I thought about in fact.  So I went from there to a small college.
Story_ID: 31571
Speaker 1: And now you said that both of your parents had an immense amount of siblings on both sides.  Your mother had--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --about nine siblings and your father.  Do you have any favorite aunties or uncles on either of your--?
Speaker 2: Favorite?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah I had a few aunts and uncles who were closer to me I think than some of the other aunts and uncles, mostly on my mother's [Susie Mae Fort White] side.  When I was a student and going to undergraduate school during the summer times I would go to Detroit and stay with some of my relatives there, work in some of the industries there to be able to get money to continue my undergraduate education.  And my uncles and aunts were extremely kind to me.  And so I wouldn't say favorite but I certainly had more interaction with three or four of my aunts and uncles in the Chicago [Illinois], not--I'm sorry, the Detroit [Michigan] and Cleveland [Ohio] area than I had with some of my other aunts and uncles who were spread around Alabama and various other places because I had left the area.  But growing up we did not have for the most part any preference.  All of my aunts and uncles had their own very unique personalities and we were always having such a good time with them.
Story_ID: 31572
Speaker 1: Could you tell me more about your immediate family?  How many siblings--?
Speaker 2: I have one sister and that's it.  It was just my sister and myself.  She is older than I am by a year and nine months, born in 1947.  She has two children and one grandchild so I have a great niece now.  My sister is named Zepherine Finch, Zepherine White Finch.  I'll--
Speaker 1: Spell that.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Z-E-P-H-E-R-I-N-E.  Finch is F-I-N-C-H, that's her married name.  And Zepherine went to the same high school that I went to.  She lives in Birmingham, Alabama where she has lived for quite a number of years, more than thirty years.  She made her home there.  Her husband, Clarence Finch, is from Birmingham and they met in undergraduate school.
Speaker 1: And Zepherine, what a unique name.  Is there any way to recall how she received that name?
Speaker 2: Now that question I can answer exactly and precisely.  My father named her and how he got it, I have no idea.  But he was very clear about naming her Zepherine and from what I understand the historical studies--the historical stories are that they sort of went around and tried to find all sorts of names and he just decided you know she will be named Zepherine.  And of course that took a little bit--I've known maybe two people in my lifetime to be named Zepherine.  They didn't spell it the same way.  But I'm not sure even what the origin of the name is or where it came from but it's certainly unique.
Speaker 1: Speaking of names, who named you?
Speaker 2: I'm named after my father and I suspect that he probably did that too in all likelihood.  So I'm a junior, Herman B. White, Jr.
Story_ID: 31573
Speaker 1: And what are some of your earliest memories of one--what is your earliest memory?
Speaker 2: Earliest memory?  It's--well it's hard to say.  I certainly have a number of memories of around my home, my ancestral home.  We had a number of woods--we lived in the city but we did have a lot of trees and growth around the, around our home.  And I would play in those woods quite a lot.  In fact I had a dog and we'd just go into the woods and that was a lot of fun.  And I think that's probably some of my earliest memories.  As a baby, certainly as a child, I don't remember very much of that at all.  In fact, I do remember I was a very curious child, some of which I actually admit to taking Christmas gifts apart and that sort of thing.  My parents were very kind cause they decided they didn't have a juvenile delinquent, just a very curious kid.  So they got me inexpensive Christmas gifts for a while until I figured out how to put things back together again.  But I think my earliest memories are basically of just running and playing in the woods next to our house with my dog.  Otherwise I was a pretty quiet kid I think.
Speaker 1: And you said your sister [Zepherine Finch] was a year older?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: So could you tell me more about the houses you grew up in, more about how you spent your holidays or special occasions or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We--my--photographs I've seen, there aren't really any baby photographs of me but there are baby photographs of my sister.  And the home that we grew up in actually I think was built about the time that I was born.  My parents lived down the street, in fact Laslie Street, before I was born.
Speaker 1: L-A-S-E-R?
Speaker 2: L-A-S-L-I-E.  My mother [Susie Mae Fort White] still lives on Laslie Street in Tuskegee, Alabama.  It turns out that my uncle and my father [Herman Brenner White, Senior] built the home that I grew up in and we very much enjoyed the surroundings.  It was a very nice community.  It was somewhat of an isolated community in terms of the fact that our household was on Laslie Street and Laslie Street in Tuskegee is bordered by the city lake which is the Tuskegee Lake, by the city park, the Tuskegee Park and also by two communities on either side.  Now it turns out of course that one community on one side of Tuskegee historically was actually a street that was actually occupied by Caucasian people.  So we had a segregated society.  So during the time that voting rights and that sort of thing was important, this was the one street that could not be cut out because we were right in the middle of town so to speak.  And so we grew up in a somewhat of a, not a fishbowl so to speak, but we grew up sort of in the center of things.  But it was a very, very nice street.  All of the kids in the street were very cohesive.  We played in the street for the most part.  Many of us had pets.  I had two pets myself over the--two different pets I should say.  And our household was pretty much structured with daily work, my parents, daily work, going to school, going to church on the weekends.  There would be occasionally cookouts and that sort of thing and a significant number of aunts, uncles, cousins coming by.  Because if you live in the town where you actually have a significant amount of family there was a tendency to also keep in contact and a lot of that was done by telephone but a lot of that was also done by visits.  And we lived in the city and many of my aunts and uncles and cousins, a significant number of my cousins lived in the rural part of Macon County.  So for my sister and my sister, we would spend some significant amount of time during the summer time particularly going down to my grandparents' farm and spending some time there during the summer and also interacting with my cousins who also lived in that general area.  So it was a lot of fun in those regards but we did the usual sort of things that you would do.  Christmas time and Thanksgiving of course was a big holiday.  People would come by and people would just come by to eat and people within the community certainly would also stop by.  So it was very social.  I don't mean in terms of what we consider now to be modern parties but sociability in terms of people coming by just to see how you're doing, just to chat a bit, sitting in the living room.  We had a piano in our house so I was taught to play the piano and I really enjoyed it for a few years.  And my sister and I both actually played the piano and we had a few recitals once upon a time, yeah in the living room.  So it was a lot of sociable activities there.  I also had a lot of freedom in terms of being able to get in and out of the community around to visit friends and so forth.  But we were also certainly prior to the time of integration and that sort of thing, we were also very careful.  And I say we were careful, I mean my parents and certainly the adults were very careful about teaching us about safety and being reasonable and so forth.  It's a fairly conservative town it turns out.  Tuskegee is a place where there's a lot of, not a lot of rules but a lot of structure and that was very good.
Story_ID: 31574
Speaker 1: And you said both you and your sister took piano lessons?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  She was better than I was, but I actually developed a certain love for music and in fact I've done a little bit of it in--when I went off to college I sang in the chorus.  I was also a student conductor of a chamber orchestra and singers that traveled around the country and had my, I guess you would call it--I call it a debut but it really wasn't a debut at Carnegie Recital Hall in New York City.  And I say that because it turns out that we did some amateur work in my laboratory that people wanted to do, Gilbert and Sullivan operettas and things of that sort and I was the one person who actually had conducted an orchestra and so I got that job which was a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Amazing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But I don't really do much.  I mean I listen to music a lot now but I don't sing or play--I play the piano for my own personal interests but not very well.
Speaker 1: So you are classically trained?
Speaker 2: I was trained at six years old if you want to call that classical, like classically trained.  But it was you know Fair Louise [SIC] [Fur Elise] and Beethoven and Bach and a few of the Biserkas and things of that sort.  But also you know church music as well.
Speaker 1: Does your sister still perform?
Speaker 2: No.  My sister never--she took it I think as a good skill to learn and something that her daughters actually really did well.  I mean they play oboe and clarinet and they really understood and did music quite well.  And I think a lot of it came from her experience but she never really actually did very much with it. She's a business woman so she sort of gave it up.  I just had fun with it myself.
Speaker 1: Well with a piano in your home, were either of your parents musicians?
Speaker 2: No, neither of my parents were musicians and neither played the piano.  I think they liked to sing.  My father was in the chorus at the--at church and my mother liked to certainly listen to a lot of music.  She listened to particularly gospel music, but I never heard them actually engaged in any instrument or instruments.

Speaker 1: Well reaching back to some of the other nostalgic experiences, what are some of the sights, sounds, and smells that remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well I would say the, you know the, certainly the smells of nature.  I mean going down--if you've ever been on a farm, I really am very grateful, I'm very happy to have had the opportunity in my young life at that time to be able to not only be in sort of a small city but also have access to a farm, to my grandparents' farm because it's a different environment to wake up in such quiet but only the quiet being broken by animals, by roosters and horses and dogs and that sort of thing.  Not the mechanical sort of environment that you might hear if you're in a city with sirens and so forth.  And those are sounds that I really I think early on got a good distinction.  Those are things that I can very distinctly remember and that's a good thing because if you can recall some things in your past, sometimes there are one or two things can trigger those particular recollections.  And for me certainly on the farm, my grandfather's farm, it was very much an expectation of remembering how things actually worked going out among the crops for example and even working on some of the crops from time to time.  That was kind of fun.  Of course, I said it was fun.  My cousins didn't think it was so much fun.  They had to do it everyday.  But we had a lot of sights and sounds I think in terms of that.  Within my household, I would--certainly at home it was Christmas time.  You know Christmas music and that sort of thing and perhaps the smells coming out of my mother's kitchen.  Now that still of course becomes olfactory type of information that I get even now when I talk to her on the phone, sort of still remember that.
Speaker 1: What was the approximate distance between your home and your grandparents' home in the rural area from where you lived?
Speaker 2: About seventeen and a half miles.  About seventeen and a half miles.  In fact, we would quite easily be able to go down Route Twenty-Nine which is right in the middle of the state and go from Tuskegee [Alabama] right down to the Spring Hill Community.  It was a very short trip and very easily, very easily done.  And the whole way was of course just farms on either side of the road with the exception of one or two buildings that were housing different things other than farms.  I mean there were commercial sort of activities.  So they were not that far away and it was easy to go down.  When I would come home from college for example, I would always go and visit my aunts and visit my family that was in the rural part of town and that would be sort of an evening to go down and spend a couple of hours and then come back.  So--
Story_ID: 31576
Speaker 1: And you as an adolescent, little boy, could you give me--did they always call you Herman or did you have a nickname or--?
Speaker 2: I had no nickname.  There was an attempt once to give me a nickname and it just never stuck.  And I can't quite remember what it was.  I think I had some large shoes on and people thought they were snow shoes or something like that but it never really worked.  As an adolescent, certainly within elementary school and high school, I was pretty much known as a study person.  Now I won't say book worm because you know that's a lot--that's considerably more modern than what happened to me, but I remember as a sophomore, was it a sophomore?  Yes.  As a freshman or sophomore in high school I was elected the class president, the first class president of my class.  And I did a lot of other things in terms of being a part of the honor society and president of this and president of that.  So I enjoyed I guess a reputation as the guy who could sort of keep organizations together and make things run smoothly but it wasn't something that I actually sought out very much.  I was pretty quiet I would say.  I was quite quiet.  I was very busy.  I was reading a lot and doing various things at work important to me, but I also was engaged in music in the choir.  I was engaged in a little bit of dramatic arts and certainly a significant engagement in the science club and photography.  As the editor of our high school yearbook, I was also the chair of the photography club which was, which took upon itself to do most of the photographs for the high school yearbook.  That was perhaps more than we should have, but we had a significant amount of time in developing the film and taking the film and so forth.  It was very, very much an interesting activity.  But during my time as a young person and prior to high school, I basically was engaged in a lot of activities.  The activities were not community activities for the most part.  I didn't--I wasn't a Boy Scout or I didn't play on a community baseball team or anything like that, but I was engaged in activities with the church.  I was engaged in activities pretty much around home.
Speaker 1: You said the first class president, what do you mean by the first class president?
Speaker 2: Well as a freshman in high school, we didn't really have a sort of organizational you know organizational class structure.  So by the time we had actually all gotten together as freshmen in high school, we sort of organized ourselves during that year and then the--and I think this was actually mandated by the school administration.  During the sophomore year the first sort of thing that you do as a sophomore because you now have classmates from, not junior high school cause we didn't have junior high school, but you had classmates from the ninth grade and then you could in fact have elections and you choose people who are going to be the president and the secretary and treasurer and so forth.  And that structure sort of moves all the way through high school.  And I basically did that, played football and a few other things.  They were just sort of normal activities I think for a high school student.
Story_ID: 31577
Speaker 1: And when actually did your interest in science evolve?  Were you up in age or (unclear)?
Speaker 2: It's still evolving.  Well I would say my interest in science was--I cannot remember when I wasn't interested in science.  And of course, now I call it science but I think certainly when I was growing up it was just curiosity.  My concerns was really answering some very basic questions.  My--I go back and give my parents a great deal of credit for tolerating some of my eccentricities.  I would always try to mix things up in my mother's kitchen and I learned how to clean the kitchen very well as a result of that mixing up experiments. But I was given a great deal of latitude to try to explore and to understand in fact how nature worked around me.  I recall actually being in the woods next to my house finding a--the bottom part of one of these old Coca Cola bottles and this effectively turns out to be a lens because these were thick pieces of glass.  And it was fascinating to me that I could actually use this thick piece of class to essentially focus down the rays of the sun and start--I'm not a pyrotechnic person but focus down the sun's rays and cause a little heat combustion with some leaves.  That was very fascinating to me.  I could not understand how it would be possible to do that and I could put my hand, not at the focus, but put my hand underneath this lens and nothing would happen to it.  But there would be enough heat concentrated at the focal point to actually cause combustion.  And I think this sort of thing was the, sort of the basis by which I actually started to study and to think about how things really work.  You know why the sky is the color it is?  Why the stars look the way they do?  And of course in Alabama in the early 1950s, you could actually see the sky rather clearly.  You didn't have as much pollution and that sort of--light pollution or any other type of pollution.  So it was very, very fascinating for me to be able to put these things together to see in fact the environment that I lived in and also to understand something about the science that would probably answer some of these questions.  And I had a great deal of, how do I put it?  I had a great deal of support with regard to the community as well.  Tuskegee, Alabama is a real significant place with regard to education activities.  Certainly as a young person growing up there and having a university town essentially where you could go and talk to chemists or you could talk to physicists or you could talk to people who were aviation pioneers, this was a very easy thing to do.  So it was, it seemed normal to me to be able to actually exercise some of the resources that I had to be able to do things.  And I really enjoyed that a great deal.  I think once I started down this path of asking these questions and being able to do little, small experiments and so forth, I think that sort of provided the, at least the direction, at some level the motivation as well to continue to do scientific work.
Story_ID: 31578
Speaker 1: Do you remember like your favorite teachers in elementary school or--?
Speaker 2: In elementary school, well I had a number of people who were very good teachers.  I think--I don't remember people per se prior to high school.  High school had a really definite impact on me with regard to science and with regard to just education.  I mean I was a fairly decent student.  I was third in my class of two hundred and something or other.  And it was a fairly substantial, competitive school.  There were a lot of individuals who we now know, probably will be interviewed with your program here, the--I was editor of our school yearbook and the editor of the yearbook in my sister's class was Myron Thompson [Federal District Court Judge Myron Thompson] who's now a federal judge in Alabama and the youngest federal judge in the system it turns out.  And I recall that our teachers--there was a Mr. Poole (ph.) who taught us biology and he was also the vice principal.  Mr. Poole was an exceptional man because he not only provided that kind of educational instruction but he was very much a, if you liked the term role model, but he was very much a person who actually cared about the students, in particularly the young men students. And we had sort of a structure in terms of the way in which we actually did things because he could very easily point to the university and say, well you know you young men if you have studied very hard, you do good work then you can go right up into the university and take classes and be a much more substantial person.  My physics teacher was Miss Harriette Jeffries [Harriette W. Jeffries].  And Ms. Jeffries was a Masters Degree holding physicist.  I think she studied physics.  She studied chemistry but she also was the physics teacher as well. I can make this one sort of blanket statement with regard to just about all of my teachers and that was in the fifties [1950s], certainly in the south, the ability for a number of people who went to undergraduate school or even graduate school to be able to go out and get competitive jobs in industry didn't exist, certainly or African American people.  So a number of these individuals actually provided a very beneficial education for myself.  I mean today we talk about teachers who don't have a certain amount of training, teachers who don't have graduate education.  We had graduate educated teachers and they were very dedicated teachers but they were extremely well trained as well. So all of our teachers in fact were in some sense not so much favorites, but they were very, very good. They did not give us much flexibility.  We had to take French.  Ms. Martin or I should say Madame Martin actually taught us French and it was a lot of fun to teach French.  And when I went to visit Switzerland once upon a time, I went back to Tuskegee.  I had not seen my French teacher in oh perhaps twenty-five years and we're both in the bank at the same time and I didn't recognize her but she started to speak to me in French and I told her a great deal about how her French lessons had helped me in terms of places I had been in the world.  My mathematics teacher Mr. Richardson was an exceptional man and he taught two years I think of mathematics, algebra and algebra I and algebra II. But chemistry, physics, mathematics, English, history--history was one of those classes that just about everybody was very weary of. The instructor who taught history and I have to remember her name, but she was very tough.  She was the toughest teacher in the school.  It was rare that you got an A from Mrs. Williams.  I did get an A from her.  It was rare.  And, but she really challenged you and that was the whole point.  It takes many years afterwards to understand in fact what the teachers were actually doing and not so much in terms of the fact in the 1950s and certainly in the early 1960s, the whole question had to do with the fact your preparation to go out into the world was becoming a lot more homogeneous.  And you had to essentially have the skills to be able to do that and you had to be competitive.  And I think our teachers understood something about the end of segregation and what we would be faced with when we actually left that particular cocoon of science and educational work that we would have to go out into a broader world that would allow you or demand that you compete with major research institution students.  And we were tested really well.  And of course it was Tuskegee so the thought was that you know you should be very good and it taught me how to actually study hard.  It taught me how to study hard.  And I really liked my teachers.  I enjoyed my teachers a great deal.  They were not only teachers who instructed you well, but they also gave you a little bit of a push to do a little bit more than perhaps you might see in the classroom.  On occasion we would have students actually get up and talk about independent things that they had done in our math class and our English class.  People were engaged in dramatic arts and music and so forth.  It was really quite a heavy time.
Story_ID: 31579
Speaker 1: And of course this is during the time of segregation--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at that period.  What was the name of the elementary school that you attended?
Speaker 2: The elementary schools I attended was John Adams Elementary School for the first three years and then I transferred to Washington Public School.  That's that name Washington again--
Speaker 1: Right
Speaker 2: --see, Booker T. Washington.  Washington Public School was where I went to school until I went into high school. And both of these institutions were focused on providing education for the students within that particular part of town because the town was large enough to have a number of elementary schools.  There were a couple of private schools and there were elementary schools on--near the university and there were elementary schools that were on the other side of town.
Story_ID: 31580
Speaker 1: Could we talk a little bit about your church experiences growing up as a child?
Speaker 2: Yes.  As a church experience, I got a chance--I was a, I was one of what they call a junior usher so I got a chance to actually not only just participate in church in terms of just understanding the philosophy and religious structure of the Mount Olive Missionary Baptist Church, but also to get a chance to interact at a level in what we would call now a safe environment.  You know the churches was really the place where you actually had a real community, the structure of that community was not being isolated from anything else.  But I recall that the church provided a avenue for me in some ways, to interact not unlike I did when I was in school, but it was the first time I actually had to stand up in front of an audience and that was really--I was very happy with church because you know people are very kind in church.  But this was really, really one of the first things I remember as an usher because part of being the chair of the usher group for the other young people is that you know you take the--when you're taking up collection and that sort of thing you take all of the plates and then you distribute the plates and they go off into various parts of the church and you have to stand there right in front of the entire congregation until they get all of the contributions and bring it back to you and then you give it to the deacon board.  But the concept of being able to stand there and know that everyone is looking at you was something I think that really helped me a great deal in terms of what I do today.  But church for me was very important.  My father read the bible every day.  My entire family grew up with a certain focus and respect for religious practice.  I went to an undergraduate school that was a Quaker school and so my interactions as a scholar at a liberal arts school where I had to take religion and philosophy and so forth and then bring that back to my ancestral community was really quite a contrast.  Because in one sense you're thinking of it as an academic activity and the other you think of as a matter of faith and the practices associated with faith and the practices associated with birth and death and marriage and the sort of things that churches and religious communities help families with particularly.  The interaction with the minister certainly in the '50s [1950s] was something that was very, very different because as you know the civil rights activities certainly in the south were going on at that time.  And so ministers were essentially the front line.  I mean Martin Luther King [Jr.] didn't become a leader just because of who he was.  He was a minister.  And ministers were the leaders of the community by definition. And so there was sort of an overlap, not in terms of the religious faith that you have and the teachings of the church and learning about, in Sunday school about all of the religious ideas that you see in the bible and that you were taught about at home.  But also the fact that this was rules, regulations, various types of ways that you might actually want to live your life and also the definitions of good and not good.
Story_ID: 31581
Speaker 1: I really enjoyed just being a part of that particular activity [going to church].  Religious practice and matters of faith were things that we pretty much took for granted because I also went as I told you earlier, I went also down to the rural part of Alabama and that was a little different than being in the city.  And small rural churches without air conditioning and so forth was a real testament to peoples' faith and it was very serious.  No one missed church in the, particularly in the rural part of town.  Everyone expected it to be almost a social occasion in some level, outside of the minister and outside of particular practices that were going on in the church.  And that was always a grand time.  It was a time for people to dress up and a time for people to interact with one another and to sing very strongly in that church.  The modern churches certainly, the number of churches that we had in Tuskegee [Alabama] had people who had Ph.D.s in divinity and that sort of thing.  And they weren't country preachers but there was always a certain nod toward the procedures and the kind of activities that you might see in the rural churches that you would see also in the city churches.  And it was very, very interesting now after many years to think about it, to look in fact at the very well-trained and professional and very wealthy churches also having some of the same sort of historical practices that you might see in some of the rural, very poor churches.  And in each one they had a certain amount of, I found out much later, certain amount of connection between the leadership of some of those churches.  In fact the minister at my parents' church where I grew up now is the son of the minister of my father's church where he grew up.  Of course that minister has recently passed but his son essentially went into the ministry and that's really quite fascinating in that particular sense because there's a tremendous connection in that.  I feel in terms of my own morals and in terms of my, the way in which I process good and evil and right and wrong were attitudes and ideas that were essentially laid as a structure in my church upbringing.  And it's not something that you don't, you necessarily wave the flag at, it was a part of my history.  It's a part of my heritage.  And in fact, growing up at Tuskegee, you had a lot of opportunities in terms of different types of churches but the historical church of Booker T. Washington [Booker Taliaferro Washington] was really a great focus and you take a lot for granted too.  There are a number of individuals who were a part of that church who were truly history making individuals but they saw them as regular part--you know practitioners who were--parishioners I guess is the right word who were just sitting on the pew with you.  I speak specifically of Lucius Amerson [Lucius D. Amerson] for example, who was the first African American who was a--elected sheriff since reconstruction in the United States.  He went to Booker--he went to Mount Olive Missionary Baptist Church.  This was also--of course Rosa Parks was born in Tuskegee and she was not a part of that church, not continuously part of that church.  She was a part of the Green, Greenwood Baptist Church before she left town.  There was a man named--I forget his name but he was also the first chief of police.  Oh, Harrison [Eugene Harrison Sr.], he was chief of police.  He was the first African American chief of police in that part of the south.  They--he also went to that church.  And so if you look at a number of individuals who are actually a part of the community, the church also becomes an integral component of that so there's a great deal of structure within the history of my town and certainly within my background in terms of having that connection with church.
Story_ID: 31582
Speaker 1: Were you involved indirectly or directly with the civil rights struggle during the time that you grew up or--
Speaker 2: I would have to--
Speaker 1: --indirectly, indirect--?
Speaker 2: I would have to say indirectly.  I recall--I can tell you one story and I say indirectly because it was just the decision of my parents.  Remember earlier I told you about Laslie Street being a street that was bordered by the city park and by the city lake and by a white community basically.  Well it turns out when the civil rights act was signed and schools were told to desegregate, that particular street became a real hot bed because the city high school was the closest high school to my house and I was a junior and my sister was a senior in high school.  So we literally passed that high school and went to the university or to Tuskegee Institute High School which was about six miles away every day.  So when the civil rights laws were passed, the assumption was that we had the ability and we had the option of going to the Tuskegee High School which was right up the street.  You literally could throw a stone and hit it.  This led to Governor Wallace [George Corley Wallace, Jr.] essentially isolating that school with state troopers and we were not allowed to even drive past it.  We had to go completely around the lake to get to our high school.  Now of course at this time there was a group of people mostly with the university and then the religious leaders who decided that we had to integrate the Tuskegee High School and I was the most eligible person, closest eligible person on that street to do exactly that.  And students, certainly African American students who were supposed to integrate that high school, they were for the most part chosen by various people in the community had to take an examination to demonstrate that you were academically worthy to go to the Tuskegee High School with white children.  Of course we aced the exam.  It was fairly simple.  However, there were individuals and it's been said they weren't from Tuskegee who came down our street and shot at houses, literally.  This is what we would call today a terrorist act.  And the idea was essentially to make sure that people understood that it was a matter of life and death if you wanted to integrate the school that you walked right past every day.  And this did not deter a number of people.  In my senior year, my father and mother decided that my career and what I wanted to do in terms of going to college was very important.  And to integrate the school I would lose a year of school.  Their assumption--and they were absolutely correct.  I don't know how they knew, but to be a part of the integration process I would lose essentially that year, my senior year of high school.  So we decided not to be a part of the group that--it was integrated and sure enough all of the Caucasian students left and went to a different school because they did not want to go to school, or their parents did not want them to go to school with African American students.
Speaker 1: Went to a different school in another town or there were more than one high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They went--they boycotted that school and there was a school called Macon Academy [Tuskegee, Alabama 1957-1995, Macon-East Montgomery Academy, Cecil, Alabama, 1995- ] which was generated by Governor George Wallace and with funds that are still somewhat questionable but I imagine it probably came from state funds, I don't know.  But the students then left that school, went to Notasulga [Notasulga High School, Notasulga, Alabama] and went to various other community schools that were not being integrated basically.  It turns out that the twelve students--there was one young woman on our street, much further down the street in fact who did.  She was an eighth grader I think or ninth grader who did in fact become--became a part of this particular group and they did integrate the school.  The teachers for the most part had one student per class because all of the majority students had left basically.  It was a very strange time.  It was a very dangerous time.
Story_ID: 31583
Speaker 1: There were--I guess the first student killed in the Civil Rights Movement was killed at Tuskegee [Alabama], Sammy Younge, Jr. [Samuel "Sammy" Leamon Younge Jr.] His brother was in my class, Steve Younge.  And this happened around the same time that in fact the integration was going on.
Speaker 2: How and why was he killed?
Speaker 1: I think he was a college student.  He was a college student and a veteran from the U.S. Navy and he was somewhat of a radical.  He was a person who joined with other groups of people to try to integrate the churches for example.  I do recall him being involved with one church or going to a white church and suggesting they wanted to come in and pray with them.  And of course that didn't go over well.  But he was also part of the college student--and this is the early--mid-1960s.  So he was part of the college students radical movement and a very, very smart guy and a very charismatic person.  But he was killed by a--by Marvin Segrest who was a owner of a gasoline station near the, right next to the bus station.  The claim was that he had assaulted him or he wanted to use the bathroom or something to that effect, but he was shot dead.  And this was a very unusual thing and I say this only from the following point of view.  The Civil Rights Movement could very well have just passed right over Tuskegee because the intellectual level of the town was all in the hands of African Americans.  The head of the veterinary medical school, all of the doctors at the John Andrew Hospital, the professors at the university, all the Ph.D.s, M.D.s, Tuskegee Airmen [332nd Fighter Group and the 477th Bombardment Group of the U.S. Army Air Corps, 1940-1946]folk, I mean all, you know this was a real intellectual cadre of place--this was a place where a significant number of people who had a tremendous amount of academic training.  So you could very easily have thought that well okay with the Civil Rights Movement coming in, change the voting rights and all of a sudden everything would be fine because we never had the kind of conflict between African Americans and white Americans in that town because the intellectual leadership of that town were all African Americans.  The merchants and many of the large landowners were white Americans.  So now when we, when you stop and think about that you have to say what kind of point of view did people have when Sammy Young was killed or when they were shooting at houses on Laslie Street?  And the reason is that people just assumed that because we had a structure within the town that that structure in fact would carry us through.  That we would actually be able to intellectually do the things that we knew everybody in the country was already trying to do.  There weren't any demonstrations, say the demonstrations from the undergraduate students at Tuskegee Institute because this was sort of the standard sort of thing.  Martin Luther King [Jr.] certainly came to Tuskegee a number of times to give talks and presentations at the institute. (Brief pause).
Story_ID: 31584
Speaker 1: So if you think about the Civil Rights Movement and certainly my participation in it, my thought process was one that was really focused just on Tuskegee [Alabama] and Macon County [Alabama].  Certainly the history of the town that I grew up in and how, what role it would actually play in the Civil Rights Movement.  As a high school student I was thinking more about going to college and the opportunities that were available to me to go to college expanded significantly in 1964.  There were people who were coming to recruit students left and right to go to majority institutions, Michigan State University [East Lansing, Michigan] I think.  There was my good friend and actually I should say my sister's classmate, Myron Thompson [Myron Herbert Thompson] went off to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] in 1965 and these were some new activities that were going on in a number of universities particularly in the northeast United States and the northern part of the United States were looking for African American students to be a part of their entering classes.  You didn't see this sort of focus with the large universities and the majority white universities in the southeast United States.  That was later.  That was to come later.  But this was the time of what we consider, at least I personally consider to be the pioneering effort.  We were going to be pioneers whether we liked it or not.  I think that's what my high school teachers had basically been preparing us for because there were a few people, in fact the three top students in my class, myself, Arnold Mindingall and George Whitaker.  Arnold is a child psychologist at the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] now and George is a dentist in Columbia, Maryland and myself, all effectively doctors, went to the same undergraduate school.  And we chose it basically as a place where we basically could focus on our research, focus on our academic work and also understand that it was going to be a significantly challenging effort because most of the schools that were in the United States at that time had no large population of African American students and had never had a large population of African American students and this was a time when they would have such a population.  In our case it was eleven people, but nonetheless that was a large population.  So in some sense the Civil Rights Movement was essentially going on, but the students, the people who had to essentially take it upon themselves to be not just the representatives but the real focus of why in fact there was a Civil Rights Movement, why the 1964 Civil Rights Act and why access to equal education and all that sort of thing was going to either succeed or not succeed based upon how well we did.  And it's something that we didn't quite understand at the time.  We understood you don't fail.  You don't have the choice because coming from a segregated society, the expectation was that you're not prepared to be a part of the regular community of the United States because you don't have the talent, you're not able to do things, you just aren't smart enough, you don't have any experiences in your background.  And Tuskegee of course was a very unusual place because not only did we have the experience in our background but it was a very substantial experience.  Essentially the same sort of attitude that existed prior to the Tuskegee Airmen [332nd Fighter Group and the 477th Bombardment Group of the U.S. Army Air Corps, 1940-1946] was the attitude that had changed because these men had been so successful in World War II.  So that same sort of philosophy suggested that yes, these are students who happen to be African American who came from a primarily black community who are now coming to your primary university that doesn't have African American students and you shouldn't be too concerned about whether they're going to be successful students or not because they're really hand selected.  They're the top students that we have and we expect them to be successful.  That was sort of the, I guess the responsibilities that we took on as part of the Civil Rights Movement.  It was not so much demonstrations.  There were still demonstrations.  There were young people that I know of, Freeman Hrabowski [Freeman Alphonsa Hrabowski, III] for example.  And Freeman and I were--
Speaker 2: Spell Hrabowski's last name.
Speaker 1: Freeman Hrabowski, III and you know I can't really spell Freeman's name.  He's the president of the University of Maryland. H-B-R-O-S-I--
Speaker 2: H-B-R-O-S-W-- --S-K-I.
Speaker 1: --S-K-I.  And Freeman is a mathematician, physicist. He's written a great deal about African American performance in science.  And I mention him because during the summer of 1965, there was a National Science Foundation grant provided for high school students to go to college and learn mathematics and that sort of thing.  And a significant number of people from all over Alabama, men and women, were brought to Tuskegee University, Tuskegee Institute at that time, to study math during the summer.  Freeman was part of that, I was part of that, Myron Thompson was part of that, a number of other people who have been fairly successful in their lives in terms of leadership.  And to some extent I thought of that as being a part of the Civil Rights Movement as well because here was a focus on high school students studying mathematics and these are high school students studying college mathematics at the end of their junior year.  And I really, I enjoyed that opportunity but I also understood it just looking around Tuskegee and knowing the people there, I understood what was actually at stake.  I understood what was going on.  It wasn't so much that we wanted to be a part of the Civil Rights Movement as a testament to conflict, but it was a matter of here's an opportunity and we must take advantage of it because the ones who are coming after us will have to carry the burden of how successful we were or not and I think we did fairly well in terms of that.  The Civil Rights Movement was something I think that did provide an opportunity for us.  I mean I thought certainly when I was a high school student or prior to a high school student that various people would come to our house and my mother's friends from the institutes and say they couldn't wait to have your son in their class.  And the reason being of course was that you know I knew all about the university and they knew all about the students who were coming out of the high school.  So it was sort of a fait accompli [an accomplished fact] that I would be expected to finish high school and go to the hometown college.  But I chose to go somewhere else that was I think probably a significant part of just doing the work but also a significant part of the times, the Civil Rights Movement and so forth.  And you couldn't quite say no.  Those who wanted to leave college, leave and go away to college as opposed to going to a home town school understood in fact what they were doing, but also understood that not all the students who went away were successful.  Some actually did not do what they thought they would do.  Some did not quite--they weren't quite successful in terms of dealing not only with their academic development but with the fact that you did have a burden to carry with regard to civil rights and the fact that you were really going to be the pioneer.  It wasn't the nice cocoon you know highly trained African American community that you grew up in.  You were now the identified one in a much larger community.  So I thought the Civil Rights Movement was very important and I understood it from, not from the periphery but just my part in it.  And I say my part because certainly from the integration as well as from this effort of going in and integrating schools and college was essentially where I thought my contribution was going to be.

Speaker 1: Was there some recruitment on the side of Earlham College [Richmond, Indiana] to come down to Tuskegee [Alabama] to recruit the three of you or did the three of you investigate on your own the possibilities of going to Earlham?  I'm trying to figure out the connection with Earlham.
Speaker 2: I think they started--Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana started to--
Speaker 1: Earlham is E-A-R-L-H--
Speaker 2: E-A-R-L-H-A-M.  It's a Quaker school and they started making the effort to try to find African American students about a year or so before we graduated.  In fact, two individuals, let's see, Thomas Campbell and--who was in my sister's class and Lloyd Williams who was also in my sister's class, went to Earlham the previous year.  So they were the first students to actually go off to Earlham College to study.  Tom stayed for a year and then came back home.  I don't know quite what he's doing now but he didn't find it to be an atmosphere or a community that he could actually thrive in.
Speaker 1: Thomas Campbell, C-A-M-P-B-E-L-L?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Lloyd Williams was the son of the head of the veterinary medical school at Tuskegee Institute.  And it's--the veterinary medical school was a world class institution.  It was a tremendous place.  People came from all over the world, particularly Africa to study there because they actually had one of the best veterinary medical schools in the country.  Lloyd I believe was interested in doing veterinary medicine.  You don't study veterinary medicine at Earlham.  And of course with the war coming up and that sort of thing I think he studied, he went into the ministry.
Speaker 1: And this is the Vietnam War you're speaking of now?
Speaker 2: That's the Vietnam War, yes.  When I went off to college in 1966 and I graduated, George Whittaker and Arnold Mindingall had already gone to Earlham as summer students.
Speaker 1: Mindingall, M-E-N--?
Speaker 2: M-I-N--
Speaker 1: M-I-N--
Speaker 2: --D-I-N-G-A-L-L.  And Arnold both essentially communicated to me that it was a great place and that they were going to essentially study there.  And I basically had a choice.  I had applied to Yale University, Johns Hopkins University, Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts and Earlham College.  I believe I applied to Tuskegee University also but I'm not sure about that one.  I decided that their commentary and certainly their investigation of the institution made sense to me and it seemed a reasonable place to go.  So I also chose to do that but I did not go to any pre-college activities there.  I worked for the Agricultural Stabilization Service in the summer of 1965 using my mathematics to try to calculate the land acreage of farmers in the county to determine in fact what crops they're planting and how much the Agricultural Stabilization Service would pay them for not planting certain crops.  It was a great education that summer.
Story_ID: 31586
Speaker 1: --you know if you're at a university and you see some young person who's interested in the subject you know you tend to always encourage them along.  I had one student, and I teach a class now for graduating seniors in undergraduate school, I had a fifteen year old in my class who was just as smart as can be and not very mature but he really liked physics and he liked mathematics and you always want to encourage them.  And I remember when I was a--when I was fifteen years old I would actually be studying mathematics and go up to the university [Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama], go up to the college and talk to them about various things and I was lucky.  I was very lucky to be able to actually read and talk to various people who knew a lot more about things that were outside of my community.  And so when I was asked in one interview I think with a man who was interviewing just the three of us for Yale University [New Haven, Connecticut], what I wanted to do in terms of my study and I said I wanted to do nuclear engineering.
Speaker 2: And you knew this at age sixteen?
Speaker 1: Yeah, this was--I was sixteen.  Now I didn't turn out to be a nuclear engineer, but this was very fascinating stuff to me. And of course you could read about nuclear reactors, you could read about nuclear submarines and things of that sort or the potential for nuclear submarines.  So I actually read a lot and I think not in terms of actually having access to people but I actually read everything I could get my hands on.  And so I could essentially envision an enormous number of things that were possibilities.  But when I made the decision to go to undergraduate school it was more practical than anything else.  I knew that my parents would do whatever they could--my sister was already in college and here I was going to go to college and they didn't make a lot of money.  So the question was you know should I try to go to one of the military academies and have my undergraduate training essentially paid for with the obligation because certainly at that time we young men assumed we're all going into the military anyway.  But I chose to go to Earlham College.  It was--I had a scholarship and it was as reasonable place to actually start out in terms of the study.  A large university may have made a difference I think in my career to some extent but I think it was a place that I really thought was reasonable to actually start my studies.  And there were two individuals who had been to the institution the previous year and I could actually talk to them about it.  I didn't really talk to them very much about it but I certainly talked to my classmates who had spent the summer.  And I had made the decision that yeah, this was a reasonable place to go.
Speaker 2: Earlham [College]is in Indiana, correct?
Speaker 1: It's in Richmond, Indiana.  It's a small school right on Route 40.  It's a Quaker School and in fact it's limited, at least at that time it was limited to 1,000 students.  So there was a population of 1,000 students at the college and this was, you know this was truly pioneering sort of activity.  They had had minority students before, maybe one or two every decade or so, but this was a large cadre of students perhaps about eleven students from various parts of Georgia, Mississippi--no, I'm sorry, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama and some people from Washington, D.C., and various other parts of the country.  But the minority students were unusual students because this was a time when they actually had an identifiable large group of students who were not international students for example, who were there as a part of this whole effort in terms of integration.
Story_ID: 31587
Speaker 1: And at what point during your undergraduate career did you--were determined to become a physicist?
Speaker 2: My undergraduate career, I think it was more of an evolution I think you would call it.  I did go into Earlham College [Richmond, Indiana] with the idea that I might do nuclear engineering and that was really fascinating to me.  But I realized also that the hard work that I put in, in terms of trying to get through the classes and get through all of them by the third year because you didn't get your undergraduate degree until after you finished your two years of graduate study.  I decided that maybe I could get an undergraduate degree in physics and maybe go to graduate school in physics.  There was a couple of people who came to the college during my senior year and gave talks about studies and about the graduate program and various esoteric topics of things that I thought were really fascinating and suggested that you know, you could do this kind of work by just studying in graduate school.
Speaker 1: Give an example of some of the ideas that was proposed in the fascinating work that you said that you thought was--
Speaker 2: Well I had basically studied elementary physics.  I studied electricity and magnetism, mechanics, nuclear physics, modern physics, quantum mechanics and we had various seminars also within our physics curriculum.  There were only seven physics students, seven physics majors in my class.  So there was a small group of people who pretty much did everything together.  We had individuals who would come as colloquium speakers and they would talk about cosmic ray physics, they would talk about nuclear physics, they would talk particularly about solid state physics and this has to do with the atomic physics and the structure that you might find that would be applied to electronics for example.
Speaker 1: And you say solid state?
Speaker 2: Solid state physics, yeah or--
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: S-O-L-I-D S-T-A-T-E.  Traditionally we call it condensed matter physics but solid state physics is the sort of subject matter that's associated with basically the electronics industry.  So we were thinking at some level about the application of our science to industrial development, to building things and so forth and I still have sort of a thought process about building things.  But there came a time when I started to really ask some very fundamental questions about, particularly about nuclear structure and I didn't quite understand it and I began to read, to think more about it and decided that this might be a reasonable thing for me to start to study.  The instruments associated with nuclear structure and the subject itself.  So instead of graduating or leaving in three years to study engineering, I decided to stay an additional year and finish my undergraduate thesis work as well as a bachelors, AB degree, Bachelor of Arts degree in physics.  And in fact, the undergraduate work in--my undergraduate thesis work was really sort of the beginning of my thought process in terms of just doing basic research for a career.  This work had to do with the study of the contamination for want of a better word, a contamination of soil as a result of above-ground nuclear testing.  And one of the professors had been doing this for quite a number of decades and during the summer of 1968 I took a class at Wayne State University [Detroit, Michigan] in computer programming because our college was getting its first computer.  And so part of my undergraduate thesis work was to essentially adapt all of the hand scribed calculations and data taking had been done for a number of years in terms of soil samples and measuring of thorium and various types of radioactive content to a computer.  And so this was my contribution to that research and I made it essentially very smooth and now you can take a soil sample in various parts of the United States, put it through our analysis programs, get the data out, put it right into the computer and tell essentially what the thorium and what various types of radioactive content was of the soil as a function of time and as a function of locale within the country.
Story_ID: 31588
Speaker 1: So at Wayne State [University, Detroit, Michigan]  you studied there during your summers at Earlham?
Speaker 2: This, no, this--yeah, this was my summer--I actually, I worked my first summer as a power steering sub-assembler for the Chrysler Corporation.  I worked on the assembly line in 19--
Speaker 1: What was that again, a power steering--?
Speaker 2: Power steering, you know you have a power steering sub-assembler.
Speaker 1: And subly, how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Sub, S-U-B-A-S-S-E-M-B-L-E-R.  So it's a subassembly of a component that you put on each one of these cars as they come by on the assembly line.  So I was a part of the United Auto Workers which I'm proud to say when I talk to some of the people in the political community because they say oh you high energy physicists and you very smart guys and you don't know anything about real work.  And I said well I was a member of the UAW and that sort of straightens things out.  But anyway, during that summer of 1967, I did work on the assembly line and the very next year I went back to Detroit and stayed with my uncle and my aunt and allowed me to actually study for the summer.  I wanted to take a class in computer programming and that computer programming was extremely important to me when I did my undergraduate thesis because then I actually had a computer class that I had taken, passed and I could actually program the computer.  And I believe I was one of the, one of maybe two or three students in the entire college who actually knew computer programming.  Now of course that didn't last for very long because this was very important to be able to use the computers in the analysis of things as well as the business practices of the college.  But I had access to that computer and became the part of my research that in fact I still did some of that kind of work when I went off to graduate school.
Speaker 1: And the concept of your initially majoring or having the interest to major in nuclear engineering did this share the same department at Earlham [College, Richmond, Indiana] or was there a different department for engineering and physics (unclear)?
Speaker 2: There was no engineering department at Earlham.  Basically you had to major in physics as a sort of an entre into the engineering studies.  So when you went to Earlham College you would have either a program where you studied as a physics student for three years and then you went to an associated or a connected university where you would then study the engineering curriculum.  I believe it was Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute [Troy, New York] that had an agreement with Earlham College to take their three year study physic students and also allow them to study for an engineering degree.  But I chose--
Speaker 1: Rensselaer, how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Rensselaer?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It's R-E-N-S-S-E-L-E-A-R I believe.  I'm not so sure about that.
Speaker 1: And is that also in Indiana or--?
Speaker 2: It's in New York.
Speaker 1: New York?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think this is where Dr. Shirley--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --Dr. Shirley Jackson is the new president of Rensselaer.  Anyway, in 1969 I basically during the summer instead of going to Detroit, I became a--I taught a class in photography and also became a resident at Earlham College during the summer for incoming students for a what they call it, outward bound--upward bound program.  So students from high schools would come to the college during the summer and I would basically be an instructor as well as a counselor for those students and that's the job I had during that summer.  But I had pretty much made up my mind that the next year I was going to finish my undergraduate degree and then pursue a graduate degree in physics.
Story_ID: 31589
Speaker 1: And when did you make the leap from nuclear physics to particle physics?
Speaker 2: Oh that, yeah that's right.  That's exactly right.  I made, I--and it was a leap.  It was a significant leap.  I left Earlham College and graduated in 1970 and went to Michigan State University [East Lansing, Michigan].  During the summer after graduation I did a little, a few jobs but I went off to graduate work at the Michigan State University Cyclotron Laboratory.  Dr. Henry Blosser, B-L-O-S-S-E-R was my mentor at the super--at the cyclotron laboratory and I did not go in with a, basically with a scholarship or a fellowship or anything like that, I just went to graduate school and I asked for help in terms of having some financial support from the Michigan State University Cyclotron Lab.  And he was very kind to me and he said yes okay fine, come in and you know start doing some research with us.  And I was very lucky.  I got a project which was a very nice project, not significantly different than what I--well somewhat significantly different but the procedures and the ideas are very much the same as what I did as an undergraduate.  And one of my first--my first research paper that I published had to do with the study of looking for heavy elements in an environment of bulk light elements.  So this came out of a study that was motivated by the concern people had about mercury in tuna fish.  So we were looking for trace amounts of heavy elements in biological materials.  So I had already done radioactive materials in soil samples so this was not significantly different to some extent but I got to use a cyclotron to do the work and that was very significantly different rather than just counting the activated materials that were coming off soil. So during this particular year I began to study the heavy element or trace elements in various types of biological materials including cows' milk, tuna fish, some petrified tuna fish so that you could tell the difference between the trace elements that were in very old fish versus the trace elements that were in very new fish and then you could tell the difference between whether you had a significant amount of mercury particularly or other heavy elements.  And we also looked at human blood and guess whose blood?
Speaker 1: Yours.
Speaker 2: My blood.  And so my first paper not only talks about the identification of trace elements in heavy--heavy trace elements in biological material, but it also has the distribution for all of the trace elements and all of the elemental compounds in my blood which I was very proud of.  When I have to teach this now I can actually go back to a published article and say the human blood there is my blood.  So it's a little bit better than the horror movies that you see on TV.  But I had a lot of fun doing that and it's very interesting because I learned a great deal about new techniques about making thing targets, about using alpha particles scattering from cyclotrons and also about building and performing an experiment as well as the analysis of it.  And I was--I think that contributed a great deal to my success at Michigan State University.  In fact I got an assistance-ship as a result of actually doing that good work.  But after that work I also received an Alfred P. Sloan found-- [Foundation] travel fellowship basically which was actually a--it was suggested by the what's now the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory but I received a--I received funds to be able to do work outside of Michigan State University.  And my mentor Dr. Henry Blosser suggested I take these funds to the Central European Laboratory for particle physics research in Geneva, Switzerland.  And so this would be the first time that I'd actually gone to Europe and while at CERN [Conseil Europeen pour la Recherche Nucleaire/European Council for Nuclear Research], the Central European Laboratory, I made the transition perhaps to the disappointment of my mentor from nuclear and accelerator physics into particle physics.  And that's another incredible story actually because it was a big change for me.  I had thought about accelerators while I have a Masters degree in accelerator physics and I had thought about nuclear physics where I published my first set of papers but I was really bitten so to speak.  When you ask me about a leap, it truly was a leap and it was really because I was at the CERN laboratory and I was interacting with people who were true what we now would call textbook named scientists.  People that you, whose books you read and whose names follow equations and so forth and you think were perhaps long dead.  But they were actually walking around and you could walk right up to them and go to their office.  And I said oh this has got to be the stuff that I should be doing.  And I made the transition from that nuclear structure.  Nuclear engineering was something I just gave up.  And I said I do understand it, I think it would be a great career but this is a lot more exciting for me.  And during the summer of 1972, I made the decision that I would come back to the United States and I would change from nuclear accelerator physics and go into elementary particle high energy physics.
Story_ID: 31590
Speaker 1: And getting back to your professors at Michigan State, who were some of the professors that influenced you mostly during your graduate years at Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Well almost exclusively Professor Henry Blosser. He was the head of the Michigan State cyclotron laboratory, in fact one of the founding--he was the person who actually created that laboratory.  He was from Tennessee I believe and Blosser was a very smart fellow and he really understood how to build cyclotrons.  I mean that was his passion.  And he was--I think he watched me very carefully and in fact he came to Europe when I was there to talk to me about the work that I was doing and the kind of support that he had given me.  But he and I talked about science and all the struggles that I had as an undergraduate and as a graduate student because to be able to make the transition from even a small college to a major research institution is not a trivial one.  So there's a lot of expectations that people have of how much physics that you know and what skills you have and how well you can do that.  I have to admit I think I was certainly better as an experimenter than I was a regular student.  I took a lot of the classes and that sort of thing.  And you know you take the class and you pass it as a graduate student, but the real focus is on whether you have skills to be able to do research and whether you can actually pass the candidacy exam for a Ph.D., which I did not do at Michigan State.  I just focused on a Masters degree in nuclear physics.  And elementary particle physics I think was going to be in my future but nuclear accelerator physics was my focus.  And so I decided that I had to make some changes and try to understand in fact where I needed to go and Henry Blosser was very helpful in doing that, in helping me with that.  He gave me good advice and I--there were other professors I think that I interacted with but not professors that I actually spent any time in terms of just talking to.  And it was a short amount of time but I was away from the university not quite as much as I was there, but during the first year after I went to Michigan State I actually went to Argonne National Laboratory [Argonne, Illinois] outside of Chicago as a resident research associate.  And I worked with a man there who was in charge of nuclear physics experiments and so I learned about doing more nuclear physics experiments and then went back to Michigan State.  And then the next year is when I went to Europe as a Sloan fellow and changed from nuclear physics altogether into particle physics.
Story_ID: 31591
Speaker 1: Who was the president at Michigan State University [East Lansing, Michigan] during that time?
Speaker 2: The president at Michigan State University during that time was, let's see, he was the first African American President at Michigan State.
Speaker 1: Dr. Clifton Wharton.
Speaker 2: Dr. Clifton Wharton.  And I had the dubious honor of flying back out of someplace with President Wharton, he was in, certainly in the first class compartment and he offered me a ride back to the university so I had a chance to actually meet him and talk with him.  And he was a--he really provided a real atmosphere I think for Michigan State at that time and there weren't I don't recall, very many African American students in the physics department.  In fact there was only one other African American student and he was studying really philosophy and theoretical physics but he was sort of a dual-religion philosophy student.  But I--
Speaker 1: It's 1972, correct?
Speaker 2: This was in 1972 yes.  This was about 1972 and it was a real interesting time.  I mean the big ten of course is--this is 42,000 students so I mean you could easily get lost at this institution.  But I stayed right across from the cyclotron lab so I spent most of my time--well there was some young ladies but I spent most of my time actually studying in the laboratory and doing my experiments at night and then also--
Speaker 1: A little socializing on the side?
Speaker 2: A little socializing.  I think my former wife was also an Earlham College student and she came to Michigan State to study urban planning so she got her Masters degree in urban planning.  I think that's where we became a lot closer because we knew each other in undergraduate school but not in--we got married actually after graduate school.
Story_ID: 31592
Speaker 1: Well just, could you tell us a little bit more about the work at the cyclotron lab?
Speaker 2: Yes.  The cyclotron laboratory was a--this was a very interesting laboratory because unlike many--the large accelerators were things that were I think going to be in the future.  There were large synchrotron accelerators but this was a cyclotron accelerator that was essentially unique in the following fashion.  The two individuals and I forgot the other professor's name but Professor Blosser and a couple of other individuals had actually designed this accelerator using the basic structure of electrodynamics.  They actually used the physics and designed and engineered the, all of the aspects of this accelerator, built the accelerator and then it worked just like they built it.  And it was a fascinating sort of thing because the basic ideas about orbit studies and about the production of the high energy particle beams, these are like twenty-four, twenty-five MeV or twenty-two MeV alpha particles which is what I use for my experiments, were really well divine--well defined and well designed structures.  And so you would find a significant amount of capability as a physicist, certainly as a nuclear physicist to do some of the better nuclear physics that you could do anywhere in the world.  And the cyclotron laboratory actually attracted a significant number of people who wanted to actually use some of these very, very precise accelerator beams.
Story_ID: 31593
Speaker 1: Can you define the difference between a nuclear physicist and a particle physicist?
Speaker 2: Well at some level the difference between nuclear physics and particle physics is designed to be associated with the energy.  So in fact if I'm dealing with particles that are in the range of millions of electron volts and I look at the structure of the nucleus of the atom which means the protons and neutrons that make up the structure of the atom, I'm doing nuclear physics.  If in fact I want to do particle physics, I have to go to much, much higher energies because you have to have a high energy beam to be able to probe not just into the nucleus of the atom but into the particles that make up the particles of the nucleus of the atom and those particles are known as quarks or partons.  So what we do essentially as an atom smasher so to speak is that we break apart the structures that hold the nuclear forces that hold the nuclear components together within an atom and that is essentially nuclear interactions.  And then we also take some of the individual particles with high energy particle beams and we break up the components that are inside of the protons and neutrons that are the massive parts of the atomic structure and we look at the particles that come out.  This is true conversion between the energy that's in particle beams and the mass that's equivalent to the energy.  The E=mc2 really means something when you're actually dealing with the production of elementary particles because the higher the energy that you're going to have, the more energy conversion that you are, you can produce and in fact the more precision you can have in terms of studying the particles inside of the nuclear structure.
Speaker 1: But does that change the dimension from three dimensional to something different if it's much smaller than the proton and neutron?
Speaker 2: Well at some level if you want to be really precise about it, particles that are inside of a proton and neutron have no dimension.  They're that small.  It's, it--to think of it in this way.  The limitations that you have in terms of describing any elementary particle is how close can you get to it?  What kind of characteristics does it have in terms of its mass, in terms of its charge, in terms of various other types of characteristics?  But the amount of energy that you need to be able to probe close to the particles that make up the protons and neutron are so enormous that you can never dissociate those particles completely.  That is to say if I have three quarks which make up the proton and the neutron, I can never dissociate those three quarks from each other.  They must be in the same general structure to be able to make the proton because to dissociate them does not make a proton any longer.  And the particles that hold the structure, the force structure that holds these particles together that makes a composite particle like a proton and neutron are known as gluons.  And the more energy you put in to try to separate the protons and the neutrons, the more gluons you produce to try to hold them together.  So when I think about nuclear structure and nuclear annihilation, it's very easy to be able to actually, well relatively speaking, to take a particle beam and millions of electron volts, collide that particle beam with the nucleus of an atom and break that atom completely apart.
Story_ID: 31594
Speaker 1: --there are some ways that you could put the two atoms together, they combine in such a way that you get table salt but they combine because they have bonds that are well defined in terms of the laws of physics.  I can combine these particular atoms together.  Now suppose I want to--and this gets back to this question about the difference between nuclear physics and particle physics.  Suppose I want to actually study the atom itself, and I want to know the difference between the two.  Well the way we do it in physics is we just break them apart just like we would do the cookie.  You'd break a little--break them apart by essentially dissociating the electrons that are associated with the atom from the protons and the neutrons that make up the nucleus.  And I can do this by just adding energy to the atom so it gets excited or I can knock off the electrons by putting a projectile in that takes the electron structure away.  Now as a particle physicist, I can study the electron on its own because it can be dissociated, you can put them together as beams, you can probe things with them.  But it has nothing inside of the electron.  There's nothing inside of the electron.  But the proton and neutron are sitting over there.  They're held together by a nuclear force which is a fairly strong force and I can actually study that nuclear structure by doing exactly the same thing, producing a beam of energetic particles, higher and higher energies and that will essentially then break the nucleus apart so now I can dissociate protons and neutrons.  So I have a beam of particles that would dissociate these two and mind you the reason for having higher energy beams is the fact that you have to overcome the energy that's holding the proton and neutron together.  So that's why we have to have higher energy particles.  Now I've dissociated the protons and the neutrons and you might say well let's see.  What's inside of the proton and neutron and how do I get it?  Well in our crude way of doing things, we continue to smash atoms apart and we create a beam of particles that is even more energetic than it took to actually dissociate the protons and neutrons in the nuclear structure.  So now I have a very large synchrotron high energy beam of particles and I smash the proton and neutron and I look for the particles that are inside of those and those are called quarks and partons.  And those particles require you to have extremely high energies to be able to isolate them and they do not allow themselves to be completely dissociated from the other quarks.  So three quarks will make up some of these hadronic structures and a quark and an anti-quark or matter or anti-matter will make up other types of particles which we call mesons.  So the difference between nuclear physics and particle physics is pretty much associated with the things you want to study and the energy of the probing particle that you use to do that study.

Speaker 1: Well who developed the high energy beam?
Speaker 2: Well high energy beams have basically have been a historical consequence of making particle accelerators.  The first accelerators were essentially produced by E.O. Lawrence [Ernest Orlando Lawrence] in California back in the last century and it's easy to say the last century now that we're twenty-first Century people.  But those particles were basically produced as a result of trying to essentially produce a beam of particles from an accelerator which is about this size basically.  That was the first accelerated beam, which were cyclotrons.  Now admittedly there are some particles, there are some radioactive materials that will just decay in such a way that they liberate say an electron or a proton.  And you can get some of this radioactive material, collimate the radiation that's coming off of it and produce yourself a particle beam as a result of this so you don't have to accelerate it.  But strictly speaking, that particular type of beam though you can control it a little bit, does not have enough penetrating energy to do the kind of research that has been done over the last hundred years.  So now when we produce particle beams such as high energy beams from the accelerator, we use the accelerator as the source of the particle beam and then we use electromagnetic optics as a means by which we can collimate the particles that come out of the accelerator and point them where we want to.  I've been doing that kind of work myself when I first joined the Fermi Laboratory [Fermilab - Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, Illinois] for thirty years or so.  And the idea here of course is not only to understand that the particle beam is going to go all over the place but to be able to collimate them, to control them and to essentially use electromagnetic optics to force them to essentially be the kind of flashlight if you like beam of particles that you can use for your basic research and of course to point them where you need to point them.
Speaker 1: So during the time that you were at Fermilab, this was also during your summers at Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: No.  Actually I did go to Fermilab for the first time in 1971 and I was at Michigan State at the time, at the same time and that's correct but I was actually a resident research associate at Argonne National Laboratory.  Fermilab was basically mud.  There was construction being done at Fermi Lab.  The groundbreaking for the laboratory was in December of 1968.  I had not finished Earlham College then but the laboratory itself was still under construction in 1971.  And I came over to give a talk to summer students who were working here in 1971 on the research that I was telling you about that I had done in nuclear physics having to do with nuclear structure and looking for heavy elements in my blood.  So I came over to see Fermilab and it was called The National Accelerator Laboratory at that time in 1971 and it was a very interesting laboratory at that time.  It was certainly the future of high energy physics though I did not realize it at the time.  In fact the very next year when Fermilab was turning on its accelerator during the summer of 1972, I had already gone to live in Europe.  So I was working at the CERN Laboratory in 1972 at the same, at that time when Fermilab was turning on its beam for the first time in 1972.  And that was a real exciting time because people really finally realized that they could actually go to two hundred billion electron volts in terms of the energy production.  And it was very exciting here but I wasn't on this continent at the time.  It would be another couple of years in fact before I would actually join the laboratory as a research scientist in 1974.
Speaker 1: And Argonne Lab [Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois], how different was that laboratory than Fermilab here?
Speaker 2: Oh, Argonne is considerably different in terms of the multi-disciplined research that goes on there.  Now Argonne had something called the zero gradient synchrotron accelerator and in fact when I was working in Argonne in 1971, that accelerator was still operating but was being prepared to be shut down so that the research that would be done in high energy accelerators would be done at Fermilab and not at Argonne.  However, the work that I was doing was in the nuclear physics laboratory and in fact Argonne has multi-disciplined activities going on at the laboratory for a very long time.  So you would have biology, you'd have metallurgy, you'd have chemistry, computer science as well as physics going on at Argonne whereas at Fermilab you only have high energy particle physics.  And rightly so it's the highest energy particle accelerator in the world.  It has been since the summer of 1972.
Story_ID: 31596
Speaker 1: So you were at Fermilab [Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, Illinois]approximately ten years before you re-enrolled in school for your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: I was at Fermilab from 1974 to 1976 and I did, I guess every chapter of my life is going to a new place and doing a good piece of physics that gets me going to the next place.  And in 1972, I basically was at CERN and changed to particle physics.  In 1974, I joined the laboratory as a research scientist because I already had Sloan Fellowship at the CERN lab so the assumption was that I actually had some skills that were competitive essentially with all the other scientists.  And I studied at, on doing experiments at Fermilab in 1974 and by 1975 I had done some research having to do with the calculation of the neutrino flexes that led to an equation that bared my name known as the Stefanski and White model for neutrino production which was used all over the world and it was somewhat of a surprise to the collaboration that I was working with at the time that I did not have a Ph.D. degree.  So I was invited to be a university fellow and teaching fellow at Yale University [New Haven, Connecticut] where I went off to graduate school in 1976.  And I--when you think about my career and I, you know I know that many of my colleagues have much smoother careers because either they chose to essentially focus on a particular thing or they went through each one of their universities in a very systematic sort of way.  Mine basically has been tied with not the promise of doing well as a scientist but actually having demonstrated it before I got the chance to be able to go to these very competitive and substantial institutions as well as universities.  So up to this point I had been a Sloan Fellow and an equation named after me.  I had a masters degree, a bachelors degree, had been a resident research associate at a national laboratory and then I was going off to the Ivy League to study effectively theoretical physics because I had pretty much done experimental physics fairly well.  In fact I joined an experimental group at Fermilab in 1975, and that's one of the reasons that I was invited rather strongly in fact to come off to Yale University to study so I did that in 1976.
Story_ID: 31597
Speaker 1: Well at CERN, at CERN laboratory in 1972, I--my work there was, it was, it was a great revelation for me to be able to go from a graduate student at Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan] studying nuclear and particle physics to actually the possibility of doing something different.  I was in the, what's known as the MSC division [Machine Synchro-Cyclotron], which is the nuclear physics accelerator division but I also got a chance to hang out with European students who were over in the PS division, which is the Proton Synchrotron division and also to study during the summer--well during the fall, spring, fall and--spring, summer and fall with the, with the students who were studying particle physics.  And I was very lucky to be able to do this being one of the first Americans who ever was allowed to be in this particular program.  I got a chance to essentially interact with some people who were truly textbook named scientists and indeed I studied with a number of people who provided lectures for us.  Professor Victor Weisskopf who was chairman of the physics department at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Professor Valentine Telegdi who was a professor of physics at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and Professor Kurt Gottfried who was a professor of physics at State University of New York [sic. Cornell University, Ithaca, New York].  And I had the opportunity to interact with people some of whom I didn't realize who they were.  In particular, and I don't mind actually telling this story.  We had a meeting after our lecture series that day that Professor Weisskopf invited all the students to come and have lunch with him and so we sat around.  And I made some comment at the lunch about the, the quark theory that I wasn't so sure about this theory.  And of course it was interpreted that I was criticizing the theory as opposed to just not being well read in that particular area of particle physics.  And Mr. Weisskopf said, "Well perhaps we should all introduce ourselves."  We went around the table and just to two o'clock on the other side of the table from me a man introduced himself as Murray Gell-Mann.  And I said, "You're not the uh--?" And he says, "Yes I am the uh."  Murray Gell-Mann was the most recent Nobel Prize winner in physics for the quark theory and here was this young, energetic summer student saying he wasn't so sure about it.  So I spent about three hours with Professor Gell-Mann after that walking around the laboratory, going to his office, going to the library trying to essentially recover myself in terms of understanding the quark theory and understanding something about, about the science.  He was a very kind person, and he didn't tell me to go away.  I mean this was about three hours with a Nobel Laureate and I was somewhat depressed after that point because I really sort of figured I had blown it pretty well.  But actually he understood that I wasn't actually criticizing the quark theory, I was basically expressing a lack of knowledge about it and so I got a real lesson so to speak.  My work primarily at CERN was the development of certain types of measuring systems for the MSC, for the synchro-cyclotron and I had a very good opportunity to do scientific computing as well as to interact with people from other countries.  In particular, my officemate was from the Duvna Laboratory in what was the former Soviet Union [Duvna U.S.S.R. Laboratory of Theoretical Physics].  And that was a very interesting experience of course because we, our interactions with various individuals during those times was somewhat limited, but being an American citizen of course you didn't expect to actually interact--I didn't expect certainly to.  But I did research work there and I also did research work, I also did research work in, in kaon physics as a student assistant to Professor Valentine Telegdi who gave a series of lectures on kaon physics.  And being a summer student and somewhat not in the European tradition I would intro- introduce myself and interrupt the professor during his presentation, which was not done.  So at the conclusion of his lecture series, I was asked to be his lecture assistant and write up his lectures on the K0K0 bar complex and little did I know that maybe twenty years later I would be doing an experiment on the K0K0 bar complex.
Story_ID: 31598
Speaker 1: And what particularly is the kaon?  What is kaon?
Speaker 2: Kaons is a type of meson that is made up of a quark and anti-quark pair and the work at that time certainly in 1972, there was a great deal of study on symmetry properties.  So people had actually begun to try to understand what was known as parity and parity violation and weak interactions but also the fact that matter and anti-matter are partners.  That is every particle has an anti-matter partner and when you group the two together known as CP [charge conjugation symmetry and parity symmetry] violation, you can in fact produce a symmetry that was lost in terms of the mirroring that exists and bring that symmetry back by having particles and anti-particles coupled with particles that are left handed and particles that are right handed to produce a real symmetry.  It turns out that even this symmetry was actually violated in the mid to late 1960s.  So the study of this violation was really in the kaon system, that is the structure of the K0 which is a neutral kaon and the neutral kaon's anti-particle partner allowed you essentially to study the long live and short live kaon structure.  And this led to essentially a parameterization that allows you to measure something called CP violation and this CP violation becomes a necessary, mind you, a necessary element for the existence of us.  Because matter and anti-matter has to have a slight imbalance based upon the Big Bang Theory that has to be more matter than anti-matter because when the two get together they completely annihilate.  And so CP violation became essentially one of these particular studies and particularly within the kaon system where it was discovered.  Nowadays of course we also study CP violation in the B system or the bottom quark system.  The bottom quarks of course weren't discovered until much later and we discover and discuss CP violation also in neutrino studies which is some of my current work.
Speaker 1: So all this new information, was that--will high school textbooks have to be rewritten because of this new information on the quarks and--?
Speaker 2: Some of them have been rewritten.  High school textbooks actually have gotten considerably more sophisticated now than they were say twenty years ago.  I mean we're paying a lot more attention these days to science and technology development and also to competitiveness within our country so we're focusing very sharply on how it is that we can actually get some of the young people in our country up to the point where they're competitive with the rest of the world, on mass not just a few students here and there.  And to do that of course you have to have the best modern physics and the most up to date information about the structure of our universe and about the science that we actually know to be correct now.  So you might have to actually re-do a number of the textbooks or at least adjust them somehow so that you can have more specific activities associated with particle physics that is modern as opposed to some of the historical work that's there that's also still good but not necessarily as modern and up to date and precise as we have now.
Story_ID: 31599
Speaker 1: Well why did the name of the Fermilab [Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, Illinois]change?
Speaker 2: Well the laboratory as I said before started out as the National Accelerator Laboratory.  Argonne was known as the Argonne National Laboratory [Argonne, Illinois] and the Brookhaven was known as the Brookhaven National Laboratory [Upton, New York].  The laboratory in 1970--I think 1974, 1975 was renamed in honor of Enrico Fermi and Enrico Fermi was an Italian physicist who was the ultimate physicist.  He also contributed to the development of the atomic bomb and also he was a tremendous theoretical as well as an experimental physicist.  And to honor his contributions to science and his contributions particularly to modern physics and to that kind of research work, that particular effort was made by the laboratory and by the University's research association to honor Enrico Fermi by naming Fermi Laboratory or at least changing the name from the National Accelerator Lab to the Fermi National Accelerator Lab.  And of course it's been shortened and made a little bit more sexy by calling it Fermilab over the last thirty or so years.
Speaker 1: Well who was in charge of the Fermilab when you returned from CERN?
Speaker 2: When I joined the laboratory in fact the first director of the laboratory was Robert R. Wilson [Robert Rathbun Wilson].  And Bob Wilson was also one of the architects of the atomic bomb and worked on the Manhattan Project but he was also very much of a renaissance man because he did art and drama and that sort of thing.  But when I joined the laboratory in 1974, Dr. Wilson was the director of the laboratory and he provided essentially the real structure and basis of that laboratory and essentially the kind of atmosphere that would allow you essentially to do some really fantastic things.  It required that kind of leadership to do something that was that pioneering in 1972.  And so Bob Wilson was the director of the laboratory.  He had come from Cornell University where he was also director of the electron laboratory there.
Story_ID: 31600
Speaker 1: Well could you tell us a little more about the experiment that was named after you?
Speaker 2: Oh you mean the equation?
Speaker 1: Equation, yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well one of the problems that you have in neutrino physics and it was not just me but my colleague and myself. But one of the problems that you have in neutrino physics is trying to understand what the flux of the neutrinos are.  Neutrinos are very weakly interacting particles.  In fact a hundred billion neutrinos can go through a square centimeter of my hand right now.  They go through the entire earth without interacting because they're very weakly interacting particles.  Now in turns out that when you do a neutrino experiment, we can produce neutrinos in a way that is very, very controlled by assuming that all of the neutrinos come from the decay of kaons which we talked about before and pions which is another type of meson.  So if I take a proton beam, hit a target and produce secondary particles of muons and pions and kaons, when the kaons and the pions decay, one of the decayed products is a neutrino.  So to be able to try to understand how many neutrinos you have if you're just looking at a neutrino beam of particles and looking at the interaction of those particles with your detector, you have to make some kind of conclusion, some kind of guess about how many neutrinos there are because very few of them interact.  So what Raymond J. Stefanski and I did during my first years at Fermilab was to come up with an empirical formula that essentially would be based upon certain adjustable parameters but understanding that kaons and pions were the parents and most of the neutrinos came from those parents and we would essentially make a measurement of all the kaons and pions in our beam and all of the muons that are the other associated decay product and then use the kinematics of physics to determine where the neutrino was going to be produced.  And we were extremely successful at this and put out a small, short paper saying that this is in fact how you would determine what the flux of neutrinos would be for all of the neutrino experiments at Fermilab and all of the neutrino experiments at the Central European Laboratory in Switzerland.  And this was a small thing and I didn't think much of it at the time until I actually saw it written down in someone else's document to say you know we use the flux formula of Stefanski and White to produce the flux estimations for our proposals for the experiments.  And I was very--I think it took a number of years before I became fairly proud of that work.  There were some problems with the formula I have to say, but we adjusted those and in fact people have used that as sort of a basis by which they can actually come up with neutrino fluxes in the future.  But the idea, you know it was the idea that this was not a great theoretical, it wasn't an E=mc2 type of thing.  It was an empirical formula that was extremely practical but you had to have this number to be able do neutrino experiments.  In fact today you still have to have the number.  What we had done essentially was to provide a mechanism that was a lot more accurate than people had used for at least fifty years before that.  And in fact this was one of those things as I said before, that I had done just before I went to Yale University [New Haven, Connecticut].
Story_ID: 31601
Speaker 1: Now given your experiences at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and teaching there and your research at the laboratory, this prepared you quite impressively for University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida] when you began work on your Ph.D.
Speaker 2: At Florida State University [Tallahassee, Florida]?
Speaker 1: Florida State University.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Yeah, this was something that I guess when I decided that--I was proposing experiments at Fermilab [Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, Illinois] and one of our trustees, Professor Joseph Lannutti who was also on the board of trustees and senior professor at Florida State University in Tallahassee would stop by my office from time to time and say you know you should finish your Ph.D.  I was really enjoying myself.  I was doing experiments.  I had all of the, you know accolades of being able to do physics any way I wanted to because after all at Fermi Laboratory, if you were a clever person and you actually did good science the degree was not something that really made that much of a difference.  And I should point out of course before I went down to Florida State I actually, when I came back from Yale University, I was an administrator.  I was actually pushed into a position--when I say pushed it was just everyone did an assignment where they actually had to do eighteen months as a department head or something to this sort of thing.  Not just physics but service to the laboratory.  And so my service was actually as an administrator of the research division which is a pretty big job for the most part but it didn't leave you much time to do experimental work.  And one of the reasons that I got out of that essentially was to go off to Florida State and to do an experiment that I already proposed as a means of making a study in, a different study on constituent particle scattering which also would turn out to be a Ph.D. as well.  Some people have said that throughout my career I've done at least three or four experiments that I could have gotten a Ph.D. off of that I just kept going to the next experiment.  And in fact the list of experiments that I've done at Fermilab is fairly long experiment.  And they were numbered.  These are numbered experiments so Experiment 48, 435, 436, 701, 711, 799, 832, 964.  And usually you do maybe about three experiments your entire career these days and I've done eight or nine.  I've been very busy.
Story_ID: 31602
Speaker 1: Fermilab [Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, Illinois] was located in Illinois because of a nationwide search basically for the best place to build this new laboratory.  And I think Senator Everett Dirksen [Everett McKinley Dirksen], at least some stories are told that Senator Dirksen made the effort to try to bring the laboratory there by essentially going to his colleagues and asking them or essentially cajoling them in some way to bring the laboratory to Illinois.  The town of Weston, Illinois was essentially collected or taken by the State of Illinois and offered to the federal government as a site, a Greenville site for the laboratory.  I might add also relative to some issues, the--one of the problems that existed with Illinois was there was not an open housing ordinance.  There was not an open housing law in Illinois in 1966 and 1967, so that had to be on the books before the federal government would actually bring the laboratory here.  And one of the representatives from the 13th District of Illinois, I think Representative Harris Fawell I believe, was the person or one of the persons who actually introduced the bill in the Illinois House, Illinois Congress legislature that actually produced an open housing law that actually got around that roadblock in terms of bringing Fermilab to Illinois.  It was quite a successful venture in terms of doing that.  And we still use the laboratory pretty much the same way it was used in the past.  In fact we rent out some parts of our 6,800 acres to area farmers because we have some of the best farm land in Illinois.  And so since all of our work is deep underground the surface work could still be the same as it has been historically in that town by having farmers come in and they plant soybeans and field corn and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: You mentioned earlier some of the experiments that you've done.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And one in particular was 711, hydronic collisions and eject fragmentations.  What exactly (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the experiment 711 was known as a constituent scattering experiment and the point of that experiment was to actually study mass dependence, angular dependence and energy dependence of constituent scattering.  Now what we did was essentially to make the following conclusion that particles in a high energy particle beam mostly made of protons have quarks inside of those particles.  An particles inside of our target are particles at the level of quarks as well but they happen to be in the construct basically of a compound.  Now it turns out at very high energies, it's not the proton in the beam and the proton in the target that are actually interacting.  It's actually the sub-constituent of the proton and the beam meaning the quarks and the sub-constituents of the protons and the target that are actually interacting.  So our question was, does it make a difference in terms of the angular production, the energy production or the mass production of the target when you actually do these particular type of scatterings?  And what we've concluded was of course that there was no direct correlation essentially between the angular production, the energy production or the mass production of proton, proton scattering or constituent scattering.  There were other studies that we actually did for 711 in terms of the constituent scattering experiment that we also published.
Story_ID: 31603
Speaker 1: And you also mentioned in our telephone conversation about ten years of an experiment.  What allows an experiment to take the consistency of ten years to--in physics?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well in particle physics, one of the problems--I shouldn't say a problem but one of the challenges that you have is that you have to match an enormous number of constraints with regard to doing particle experiments.  And the reason is that you have a national or in this case or many cases international facilities that provide the source of the particle beams for you to do your experiment.  There are other people who are using the same source of particle beams so you essentially have to get in line.  But it turns out that the length of the experiment is really tied into the ability to go through the process of proposing your experiment, getting the resources for the experiment, building the detector and calibrating it properly, conditioning the detector in such a way and then having the access to the particle beam source so that you get your data at a particular time that your detector is ready to receive that data.  Now once you have the data then you have to analyze the data, have access to computer facilities and so forth and all of that time collectively can take many, many years.  In fact just to get your collaborators together, your colleagues might take you a few years because the resources that are required to build and to perform one of these experiments are sometimes in excess of twenty-five and thirty million dollars.  And so having those kind of resource and having the reviews that are required to be able to use those resources effectively and efficiently requires a significant amount of time usually.  I've thought of telling some of my students that I have--my first experiment at Fermilab took ten months and my last experiment took ten years.  So the time frame is really tied in with all of the peripheral activities as well as the analysis of the data but more to the point also is when you're doing these kind of experiments there are some real specific, high precision measurements that you need to make and you have to essentially take into consideration all of the components of the detector and all the components of the research activities that you're engaged in.  So you have to pay attention to just about every event and there are ten million events a second for a period of many, many months.  And so you write all of that data onto your storage magnetic tapes of your computer and then you analyze and deduce the information that you want to deduce from that information, from that data and that takes a long time sometimes.  And you have to do it right.  You know you have--your colleagues will help you by making sure in fact that they evaluate it and question you about the specifics of the analysis as well as the data taking in the control mechanisms that you put in place.
Story_ID: 31604
Speaker 1: Well are there any of your experiments that stand out more prominently in your mind in terms of time frame difficulty or innovation?
Speaker 2: I would say that probably the most difficult experiment and perhaps the most successful experiment that I've been involved in is the one that we've just completed known as the kaons of the tevatron [KTeV] project.  This experiment not only was a challenging detector in terms of its precision and in terms of the kind of resources that are required to put it together.  But the fact is that we had at least three different experiments being done at exactly the same time.  Experiments doing hyperon physics and experiments doing rare kaon decay physics and experiments doing CP [charge conjugation symmetry and parity symmetry ]violation in the neutral kaon system.  And it all uses the same type of detector and basically the same detector but with different adjustments that are made as a result of the experimental interest that we had for those experiments.  It was a very, very rewarding experimental effort because I think we actually published extremely good data, we made some of the highest precise measurements that had ever been made in the kaon system and in fact we had at least three or four discoveries made in our experiment that had never been measured before.  Hyperon beta decay for example was first observed in our work and we saw T-odd effects or time reversal effects in our experiment and we measured to high precision what we call the parameter of CP violation known as epsilon prime over epsilon to high precision.
Speaker 1: Well your latest, one of your latest essays entitled:  "When Physics Needs the Public"--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --what does the or at what point does the public need to scrutinize what you as a physicist does?
Speaker 2: Well one of the things that I'm involved in now has to do with the, essentially the next generation.  Currently high energy particle facilities are so large and so complicated they are nation state decisions.  The Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory or Fermilab in fact was basically a nation state decision in terms of the United States putting the resources what would now be billions of dollars into building a high energy research facility that would be used for basic scientific research.  This is also true of the Large Hadron Collider [LHC, near Geneva, Switzerland] which is a large accelerator that's seven times the size of Fermilab in the European theater that is on the border between France and Switzerland.  Now the next step in the international world of high energy physics is the production of what's known as the international linear collider and the international linear collider will probably test as much of the complexity and capability of the entire physics community as any machine has ever done.  And it would be approximately eighteen miles long and would be a straight, laser straight production of electrons and positrons, the anti-particles of electrons as an attempt to try to do high precision collisions with a beam that is so small that it's smaller than the size of a human hair over eighteen miles.  That's a very challenging, technically challenging effort.  Now it turns out of course this effort and it's no surprise will cost a significant amount of money.  It will be an international effort which means that nation states around the world would contribute to it.  However, hard earned money and tax dollars, not just from the United States but throughout the world, in fact should in fact be supported by the general public because that's the source of all those tax dollars.  So international and nation state ministers of science are making decisions about how to use those tax dollars to be able to actually do this basic science.  Now that money could be used for something else, but we go to the public because we think that the public is the only one, the source for all of the support for basic scientific research to be able to make the case that the public thinks this is a worthwhile effort to be done, and that in fact the world community should in fact invest in this international linear collider.  So when I wrote an article for the CERN Courier, basically the statement I was trying to make and I think the case I was trying to make was that we as scientists who traditionally not made the case to the general public mainly for many, many reasons, have to start making that case because the support of doing basic research different than applied research is that we will reduce ignorance in the world.  We will solve problems that we don't even know we have yet.  We will ask the hardest questions that can be asked and we will pursue the answers to those questions.  And they may not in fact have an understanding of where those answers will lead us or how important those answers will be.  But if we don't develop the methodology, if we don't develop the students basically, if we don't develop the skills to be able to pursue them, then we won't be able to in fact solve the problems that we don't know we have.  But when they do show themselves, we will have to solve them then.  So we like to be ahead of the game so to speak by continuing to support our skills and continuing to support the kind of basic research that will actually help us to essentially find solutions to problems like AIDS and solutions to problems like poverty and solutions to problems like the development of new energy sources that are required to continue the civilization that we have on our planet. So I think the public really needs to be shoulder to shoulder with the scientist doing this work even if you're not in fact doing the work as a scientist but supporting the work as a public person.

Speaker 1: Well do you think that under a discipline such as physics that there is a kinder or gentler way of increasing representation of women or minorities in the field?
Speaker 2: A kinder way, I don't believe that there is a kinder way to do this.  I think you have to be essentially very deliberate.  Certainly the participation of under-represented groups, women and minority people and particularly African American people in my field of study is something that basically does not have a great deal of effort behind it.  It turns out that in, certainly in our nation and perhaps even in the world for that matter, when the decision is made that this is something that will be supported, this is something that has to be supported and done, we usually get it done.  I don't know of any other thing that actually has been suggested as being important to our nation or important to the world that hasn't been identified as such and then we pursue it.  I don't know in fact what the actual mechanism that should exist to be able to do this.  I would love to know what that is and I thought about it and talked about it with my colleagues.  And I know we're making a significant effort in terms of talking about it.  But making that effort in terms of being able to produce a scientist is something that's quite complicated.  And not to belay the question, if you want to make a scientist that's even close to being say a high energy particle physicist, you have to start in the eighth grade.  You have to get someone not necessarily whether that person is a member of an under-represented group, but you have to look at members of under-represented groups and say who's interested in understanding gravitational lensing, black holes, why the sun shines, how nuclear structure works, how particles work, CP violation?  Anyone who's interested in doing those sorts of things is the person that you want to support because once you get that particular interest, that you get that I guess you would call it that spark in the eye, that asks questions that are fundamental to our entire existence, you don't need to actually do any other work but just support that person because they will do all the work for you.  And it turns out I believe that we're just not identifying those individuals and we're not making the kind of effort that we need to do that.  We believe, I certainly believe that children are inherently interested and inherently curious and that's all it takes.  If we don't beat that interest out of them, if we don't say you shouldn't do this, you shouldn't study physics you should, you know you should maybe study basketball or something we could have as many scientists as we want.  We could have problem more scientists than we would ever want.  But we tend to make heroes and we tend to put things in a way that people believe that the best definition of success are the definitions that we see on TV and in the entertainment industry.  And that's not to denigrate the entertainment industry.  I think it's great for people to actually use and expose their talent and develop that talent.  My history as you just heard in fact comes from basically a significant number of people over a very long number of decades that have said oh, you want to study nuclear physics?  You want to study nuclear engineering?  You want to study accelerators? You want to study particle physics?  You're interested in a lot of things.  Well fine, we'll help you.  And that's in my personal opinion all it takes.
Story_ID: 31606
Speaker 1: Well what do you still want to do that you have not done yet?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  I'm doing one, what I consider to be one last experiment where I can stay up with graduate students and this is an experiment that was actually already operating in Japan and we took the detector apart in, at the KEK Laboratory in Tsukuba, Japan and brought the detector to Fermilab where we're now building a new building and we're going to put the detector in a neutrino B line and do studies on neutrino cross-section production.  I suspect probably I will not have as much time or as much energy to pursue that kind of experiment or long term types of experiments in the future.  I am working on the international linear collider.  In some sense technically working on it but also in the same sense of trying to generate public interest and public support as well as support within the Congress of the United States and within the political community.  So I spent a significant amount of time in the political community and many of my colleagues, kind as they are, have been suggesting that perhaps I should think about doing more in the political community.  And like a true politician I shouldn't say more than that.  But it's my intention to actually do a little bit more writing and also to--I teach at North Central College in Naperville, Illinois and I sit on the board of the Edward Health Services Corporation in Naperville and the Teachers' Academy for Mathematics and Science in Chicago [Illinois] and I enjoy all of those activities in terms of what I consider to be civic duty and in terms of making a contribution I think to the society and to my community.  So it may be that my best contributions to society may be to do more physics, but that may be also coupled with actually being able to communicate the physics and the science that we do to the general public or perhaps to stakeholders and people who are decision makers.  So I spent a considerable amount of time doing that and I think perhaps I might do some more of that actually in the future if I make a decision to change from the scientific community to one that is more political.
Speaker 1: You're running for office?
Speaker 2: I am not running for office yet.
Speaker 1: Yet?
Speaker 2: See, now you got that on tape.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: No, I have been asked by a number of my friends, people at my church, people who are within the physics community because of the work that I do outside of my laboratory and I've been doing for many years and certainly the kind of leadership that I have shown within the physics community taking groups from Fermilab and the SLAC, the Standard Linear Accelerator Center in California to Washington, talking to people within the Congress of the United States and the executive branch office about this science. And it very well may be and I haven't concluded myself yet, it very well may be that people believe that scientists should have more of a place at the table in terms of the decision making that is done with regard to technical issues because I don't know any issue that confronts our country or confronts the world today that doesn't have a technical component to a solution.  Even if you pick up the telephone, that's a technical component.  But I believe in fact that when we think about world AIDS, we think about energy production, we think about food security or just security for that matter, we think about education, we think about communication, about travel, all of these things have right at the base of them a concern about how the technology actually will help solve the problem.  You can't do technology without science.  And sometimes when you add that particular element to decision making and that's not to denigrate anyone who actually has studied law or sociology or any of the other areas of academic study, but a background that is very steeped in basic scientific research provides you with a way of thinking that is a little bit different because not so much that you can be more logical than anyone else, but you have a connection, you have an understanding about how to get from this defined problem to this defined solution.  And we're trained in science slightly differently than the rest of the academic world in terms of how to do that.  And that might actually be fairly useful for some of the problems that we have today.
Story_ID: 31607
Speaker 1: What do you mean by that goal--what do you mean by that, you're trained differently in that way?  I mean how would you quantify that?
Speaker 2: Well that's, part of the question that you asked is part of the answer.  You would quantify some things.  For example, suppose you are confronted with a problem of how to count votes and you have a little concern about the electronic part of it.  Not so much in terms of whether the electronic part of the machines work but concern about whether in fact they are secure?  So you've got two problems.  One has to do with the security and the other has to do with whether the machine works at all.  Now every Nintendo that's put out, every television for the most part works.  We put them out in mass quantities, they're very simple things.  And counting a vote should be just as simple.  So the complexity has nothing to do with just being able to put you finger onto a surface screen, surface sensitive screen, it has to do with the integrity of whether that in fact is consistent with what the voter wanted.  Now if you spent all of your time and concern about whether in fact there's going to be honesty involved in it, then you can't actually see that you can program in a significant amount of constraint that allows you essentially to dismiss some of the concerns that you might have.  The technical background that allows you to essentially approach that problem to the ultimate level that has all the technical complexity and all the technical simplicity to the solution is something that perhaps you might not be trained with if you happen to just think about the legal issues.  The legal issues are certainly there and there's constraints and there's interpretation.  Science and technology doesn't give you a lot of leeway.  There's not a lot of interpretation.  There's some interpretation with string theory and a few other things.  But with regard to things that we call the laws of physics, there's not a lot of interpretation unless you find a counter example to it.  So the training I have, mathematics, statistics, the laws of nature are things that I have a lot of confidence in because we haven't found any counter examples.  So when I start to think about how it is that this particular training can be slightly different in terms of the way in which you approach problems, I mean that's really the answer to the question.  I approach problems and I know I approach problems somewhat differently than many people whom I interact with and I interact with a number of people who are financiers, people who are attorneys, people who are medical doctors for that matter.  I'm a director of a hospital corporation.  I am a director of a teacher's academy that helps to improve the science literacy of elementary school teachers.  How do we look at a problem for example of trying to improve the capability of students to be better students in science and technology?  Now some people would say, well you have to get better students, you have to give them more homework.  You have to do whatever is necessary.  And I think of it as yes, those things are just fine but what about the source of their knowledge?  It's not the books it's the teacher.  And that's not to denigrate the teacher it's to give the teacher as much support as the teacher needs to be able to get the information to the student because the teacher is a smaller unit and the teacher has more of an influence on all the students than you would ever have if you just put a computer in their hand.  So the way I look at things really is directional and maybe it's actually part of my training, maybe it's not.  But I would suspect in fact that there are some things that I have been trained to do and ways in which I have been trained to approach problems that are probably significantly different and maybe even contribute a great deal more to problem-solving than you would find other places.
Speaker 1: Well when you look back on your life--
Speaker 2: Can I ask two more questions?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Just two.  What--this is related to that.  If you were starting out again would you choose a career in physical science?
Speaker 1: If I were starting out again I would choose a career in physical science.  I would choose a active, inquisitive-based career.  I would certainly choose a career that would almost demand that I study, that I read, that I learn new things.  I'm motivated almost every single day by assuming that I am going to learn something that I didn't know the previous day.  And to some extent it just makes me an academic.  But I think in the physical sciences the world and universe is enormous.  It's unbounded which means that I have lots of room to pursue what I want to pursue.  So as a scientist, when I started to be a scientist, I guess you--what's that country song says I was country before it was cool to be country.  Well I was a scientist before it was even cool to consider that the science was something that would be very attractive to anybody.  And I really think that I would do the same thing if I was doing it again.  Of course I don't have that opportunity but I know that working for thirty years doing this basic science has been very, very rewarding to me even with all of the difficulties and with all of the challenges that I certainly have being in the competitive field that I'm in and being with all of the issues that one has to deal with you know being who I am.  But I would try it again.
Story_ID: 31608
Speaker 1: --really interact a great deal in terms of--it's a competitive sort of thing you know.  And you expect that at some level.  But it's the young people who actually look at some of the older people and I've had people ask me all the time, says, how in the world could you actually have been--survived at the world's most competitive laboratory, highest energy machine on the planet, let alone done anything significant there?  And I said consistency.  I said if you go to anything that you want to do you find something that you can become an expert on.  Everything else is just going to be added on to that.  And that's what I did.  I know your question was about--?
Speaker 2: I wanted to ask the 1600, you know the --
Speaker 1: Yeah, the ground, from the ground.  Now the laboratory--Fermilab of course--because you have to have things underground and twenty, thirty, forty feet inside of a, basically a concrete shell and the reason being is that when the particle beam hits a material, the possibility of producing activated material, it's radioactive material happens.  You don't have it if you're just going through an evacuated tube because you don't hit anything.  But as soon as you hit a target or you dump the beam into a dump, then you have the capability of having radioactive materials and you must isolate all of the radioactive materials from the environment which means that you cannot let any activated material get into the ground water.  You can't get it into the atmosphere and the amount that you actually allow to expose is specified by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and by the National Environmental Policy Act.  And so what happens is that all accelerators are basically deep underground.  They're usually isolated for safety reasons but there are also detectors that are deep underground isolated because you don't want the cosmic rays that are coming from deep space to produce spurious radiation and spurious signals in your detector.  You only want the ones that are produced by your accelerator so that you have the opportunity to actually do the experiment.  And so the background information that you want to essentially not only identify but you want to get rid of is a part of that work and that's why it's underground.  So at Fermi Lab, we can do our experiments underground and the area farmers can essentially use the ground at the surface because it's not that much surface that you use to actually grow soybeans and crops because we're many, many feet underground.
Speaker 2: How many feet?
Speaker 1: Depending on what area you're looking at, usually it's about twenty-eight to thirty-two feet is where the actual center of the beam lies. And so you have not only a cut and fill area that's about twenty-five feet or so underground, but on top of this you actually build up soil and ground to provide something called berm and this becomes additional radiation protection.  So if you're on top of the berm then it might be forty feet.
Story_ID: 31609
Speaker 1: And how do you, you as employees, protect yourselves?
Speaker 2: As employees, we tend to not only be monitored as radiation workers, but we're never in an area where the beam is actually being produced or transported or dumped.  We tend to only be exposed if it's possible to be exposed to residual radiation but we also have monitors that monitor not only the air but monitors different types of radiation by badges that get red periodically and we also put on various suits to make sure in fact we get no contamination from the areas inside of the research facility where we might actually have to go and do work.  It should be understood of course that at Fermilab there's a history of control and doing safe activities.  In fact as our philosophy at the laboratory during the early days is that whatever the government's limit on radiation exposure to radiation workers, we would keep that to half.  It doesn't matter what number they came up with, we would not expose our people to more than half of that and in fact you usually kept it much, much less than that as well.  So the safety of the employee is primary and certainly the safety of doing the research work is also primary.  So we're a very safe environment and we are very precise of course in what we do.
Speaker 1: And then I was just thinking about the--well ask the question about the teachers and just how they (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did she ask the question about teachers (unclear) just his career in light of the people who (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  The--when I think about my high school teachers and where I've been and what I've done, I'm not sure that they would look at me significantly different than they would look at you know some of the other students who've graduated from there.  I think about you know famous people like Lionel Richie who was you know--is a great entertainer and I think he was a sophomore or something in--when I was in high school and Tom Joyner who is a, you know a great journalist and entertainer.  There's also Myron Thompson who is a federal judge in Montgomery [Alabama] and one of the youngest federal judges in the system when he became a federal judge, a graduate of Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] law school.  And when you start to think about you know all of the people that you know who have a large profile in terms of publicity, it's not so clear that your mentors or people who actually taught you would think that you've done anything exceptional.  Except that I think I'm the only physicist who ever graduated from my high school.  And in fact, I think even from my undergraduate school I may be the only one who's still doing physics.  But it turns out that I believe they would be extremely proud of me.  I think they would be proud in the sense that they had the idea that I would do something exceptional perhaps but also that their training made a big difference in my success.  When I ran into my high school French teacher in Alabama just coming home for Christmas and we were both in line at the--in the bank, I did not recognize her but she recognized me.  And we were talking and we started to say something in French.  And I told her and thanked her so much for the kind of training that she gave me because I, when I was in Switzerland I was lucky enough to live in a village that no one spoke English, everyone spoke French.  And I said between her and the little French translation booklet my father gave me that he used in World War II, I was able to pay my bills and go to the post office and essentially interact with the people of that village.  And I said had I not had the kind of training that I had in high school, because I studied German in college, I would never have been successful in being able to have a good type of community interaction with the people in Commune, France.  I'm sorry, Commune, Switzerland.
Story_ID: 31610
Speaker 1: But in terms of African American participation, approximately how many active physicists are there in the U.S., African American active physicists?
Speaker 2: African American active physicists it's a hard number for me to know.  In 1983, I hosted the National Society of Black Physicists conference at Fermilab and I knew the number then because we invited everybody.  And there were about I think 286 or 287, something like--less than 500 people who were actually on our active list as Ph.D. level physicists within the United States.  Now I think that number is much, much larger and this is 1983 to 2006.  I would say it's probably a few thousand people.  I don't know--I know that the statistics are actually kept by the American Institute of Physics and I have read some of the statistics in terms of people who have finished their degrees and who are pursuing activities within industry and so forth.  Within high energy physics which is a very narrow and somewhat purely academic environment including theoretical physicists and experimental physicists.  It's probably less than a hundred people and that's a very, very exaggerated number probably.  I know at Fermi Laboratory, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory [Batavia, Illinois], I joined the laboratory in 1974 and as I said I went to the laboratory in 1971.  And I believe in 1974, there was one post-doctoral fellow, which was not a permanent position held by Professor Shirley Jackson who was in the theoretical physics department and there was myself who was doing neutrino physics.  And as far as African Americans are concerned, we were the first two and certainly I was the first staff African American physicist at the laboratory.  And we've had a number of people who've come to the laboratory over the years, four people actually and I'm the first I guess you could say, I'm the last as well.  So out of the 2,000 employees that we have at the laboratory, I'm the only African American scientist.  Let me point out however that we do have a number of visitors and visitors come to the laboratory from all over the world and some of these visitors are African American.  We've had graduate students and we've had people who did post-doctoral studies there as well.  And so African Americans are popular in terms of physics and physics training particularly at the bachelor's level, but there's a tendency for African American students to actually go into engineering when they finish a bachelor's degree in physics.  And this is true when you look at a number of the historically black colleges and universities as well as the major research institutions in the United States.  And of course the motivations are very clear.  The ability to actually get you know gainful employment and significant employment is fairly high for people who do engineering work as opposed to those who do basic scientific or academically focused work.
Story_ID: 31611
Speaker 1: Well how do you want to be remembered and what do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: Well it's--I'm not--I would imagine that I want people to say that I did good science.  For three decades I have a body of work that is really tied to just the science.  I'm not--I mean I was an administrator within my laboratory for a few months, well eighteen months.  But I did a lot of experiments.  I taught a number of students.  I published a bunch of papers.  I made a difference in terms of the research science that was being done at perhaps the most unique laboratory in the world and that's pretty much all there should be said.  However, I think people understand I was also a first in doing things as well and a lot of that first really had to do with my history and with the things that I was interested in doing.  We have a summer student lecture series on particle physics that I started in 1979 and I'm still happy that it's still done every year.  I would like people and certainly my colleagues to know that the work that I have done was highly motivated by the science and the participation in the science.  In some cases I had to fight pretty hard just to participate but I think that comes with the territory, not necessarily of the physics community but of just the community, of our whole society.  I would hope that people would understand that the efforts that were made, certainly the work that I did was tied in with trying to make contributions and to try to participate in basic scientific research.  And that would be good I think in terms of just you know just my scientific career.  But I may do something else.  I think this is good work and there's a point at which you come to think that this is pretty much what you set out to do and you accomplished it, albeit maybe not quite like you wanted to, but it looks like a good piece of work.  It looks like a good career and you either can do something else or you can actually add to it.  And I'm very, very pleased to feel I'm at a position that I can actually do that and the skills that I have now are actually not only useful for basic physics but can be done, be useful for other areas as well.  And then I was probably a reasonable person to work with.
Story_ID: 31612
Speaker 1: Well one closing question.  What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well I think I would like to know, to think that perhaps I was an innovator, that I didn't do things the way everyone else did, that I was a trailblazer basically.  And I think when I look back I really did pioneer a lot of things.  I did some things that, from conducting orchestras to learning neutrino physics in a way that was special at some level, teaching students, creating lecture series, writing, being in movies, that the things that I did were somewhat pioneering and I would like that to be thought of as not only important but also as being a reasonable way to pursue things, to make your contribution, good citizen contribution sort of thing.  My nieces you know are--always thought I was a fairly unusual person because I was different than most of the people that they interacted with as they grew up.  And the whole concept of smashing atoms for a living makes you a little bit different than perhaps the people around you.  But if you didn't know I smashed atoms for a living, you might just think I was the regular guy who just sat down and watched the Bears' [Chicago Bears, National Football League] game, maybe.
Speaker 1: Well thank you Dr. White.  We're appreciative and thank you for being so gracious with your time.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: And thank you for the contributions, we are sincerely appreciative of all this.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much.
