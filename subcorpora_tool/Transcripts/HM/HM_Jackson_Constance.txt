Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that I am compelled to ask you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure.
Speaker 1: --and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And the first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Sure (laughter) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay, what--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You said a short answer?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I do (laughter).  I couldn't resist that, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: That's good.  I--
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'll get better as the interview goes on.

Story_ID: 284300
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Lewis B. Jackson, Sr.] side.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: But we're gonna start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Sweetie, S-W-E-E-T-I-E, Beatrice, B-E-A-T-R-I-C-E, Crawford, C-R-A-W-F-O-R-D, Jackson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Crawford is the maiden name.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story behind Sweetie as a first name?
Speaker 2: It is.  My grandmother [Alfreida Fennell Crawford] was going to name my mom, Shrieda [ph.], cause there is some French in the family.  And the siblings could not pronounce it, so they named her Sweetie.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, they called her that and, basically, that's what it's become?
Speaker 2: No, that's actually (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's actually what--
Speaker 2: --on her birth certificate, Sweetie B. Jackson, or Sweetie B. Crawford, yes, that is her actual name.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Date of birth, my mom was born in Cuero, Texas, C-U-E-R-O, and her birthdate is twelve, twelve, twenty-nine [December 12, 1929]12/12/29.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, you know, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back, first of all, can you trace them?  Do they go back to the 19th century or further or--
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sure, but that, which I'm familiar with, is my great-grandfather, I believe, who was a Baptist preacher, and he was William C. Crawford.  And also, my mom's father was a Baptist preacher/pastor, and his name was Ira DeWitt Crawford.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, there are lots of ministers in the family on that side, I guess?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  In fact, my mom's sister, who is still living, Alfreida Crawford Lucky [ph.], is a Pentecostal minister, and she's in her eighties, and still a pastorate.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, are there any stories that are passed down on your mother's side of the family from way back from the days of slavery or Reconstruction or even further?
Speaker 2: My mom's--one of the stories that I, I've heard over and over again were the floods of Cuero, where the flooding of what occurred so bad that they really had to sleep on top of the roofs until the water would drain down.  And then, of course, that's one of the stories.  And then, the other stories that most people had to leave Cuero after their children got to a certain age because their high school only went to the eleventh grade.  And those people would move to San Antonio [Texas], which is where my mom moved to, and finished up at Wheatley, Phillis Wheatley High School [G.W. Brackenridge High School], in San Antonio.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, why didn't the high school simply have another grade?
Speaker 2: Now, that I don't know, that I don't know.
Speaker 1: Or--
Speaker 2: But I, I know that was pretty much the way everything went.
Speaker 1: There's probably a reason.  Now, this is a black high school, I'm sure (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --probably dependent upon state funds on some level, or city funds for part of this operation at least.  And they were only allowed to teach--maybe it was a rule.  I mean, it's something to--I've heard that before in Texas--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --where the school only goes to the eleventh grade.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And it seems by some design not, as to not benefit the black population, I think.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, but I'll be sure and ask my mom that question.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, any other stories about, you know.  Now, that part of Texas, was that--did, do your ancestors have any stories about being the early people out in that part of Texas or--
Speaker 2: I believe for Cuero [Texas], many of them came and settled there early on, I think.  We can go back to the 1800s, but I don't have any specifics on that.  That side of the family, really, there were three different family lines--same mother who married, whose husbands died, and married again, so there were three different lines.  And so, there was the Blackwells, there was the Crawfords, and, gosh, there was another that, that I'm not familiar with.  And so, really, just now are they getting to the point where they're holding family reunions, and trying to gather back.  But many of the old-timers have now, of course, gone on.  They've, they're deceased now.  But there is one coming up July 2 of this year, whereby I think the Blackwell side of the family, and I think that's sort of how the history has been diluted because there's been marriages, and then different families have taken off.
Speaker 1: So, a lot of fragmentation of the story?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Story_ID: 284301
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Sweetie Crawford Jackson] have--did she tell about growing up?  Did she talk about how--what it was like to grow up there?
Speaker 2: I'm sure there are some stories, but I can't recall any right now.  Just, really, it was a rural area.  The church [Grove Hill Missionary Baptist Church, Pledger, Texas] was a major part.  In fact, my grandmother [Alfreida Fennell Crawford] was A.M.E.  She grew up African Methodist Episcopal, but married a black Baptist minister [Reverend Ira D. Crawford].  And that's how, really, my mother's side of the family became Baptist.  And several of her brothers are Baptist ministers, or were Baptist ministers.  They're deceased now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your mother have a chance to go to school?  Now, she went to San Antonio [Texas], you said, to finish high school.
Speaker 2: She went to San Antonio and graduated from Phillis Wheatley High School [G.W. Brackenridge High School, San Antonio, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, do you remember the name of school in Cuero [Texas]?
Speaker 2: I surely don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But she finished at Phillis Wheatley in San Antonio?
Speaker 2: Phillis, Phillis Wheatley in San Antonio, that's correct.
Speaker 1: Now, did she move--go on to higher education or--
Speaker 2: She went--and I cannot tell you the name of the particular junior college that she went to.  I should have asked her all of that.
Story_ID: 284302
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Sure.  My father's name is Lewis and that's L-E-W-I-S, B. Jackson.  There's a story behind the B, Senior.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, well, tell us the story behind the B.
Speaker 2: Well, the story behind the B has its genesis in the original family name.  The story goes that the original family name was Buns, and not Jackson, B-U-N-S.  Now, we're told that there was a slave owner, who fell in love with one of the slaves, who was my great-great-grandmother and, actually, married her, and changed the family name to Jackson.  And that's how we became major landowners in my home town, Pledger, Texas.  We own a third of the town.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, my father maintained and, of course, back then, as you may remember, a lot of people used initials.  My, my father's older brother, J.C., was called J.C. Jackson.  That's what they named him--J.C.
Speaker 1: His name was J.C.  It didn't stand for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) His name was J.C.  And when he went into the [U.S.] Army, he had to have a name, so he named himself Julius Caesar.  And so, he's Julius Caesar Jackson, according to the United States Army.
Speaker 1: And that's something that comes out of the South.  Black folks in the South do have like those initial names.  I had several in school with me--O.S. Benjamin or O.Z. Enton [ph.].
Speaker 2: Sure--
Speaker 1: And people just have the initials without the--
Speaker 2: --just the initials.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: So, my father, in honor of the original family name, took upon the B for the original family name.  Now, my older brother, who's a Junior, they, of course, had his name mean something, stamp or something, and it's Benjamin.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they still call him Lewis B. Jackson, Jr.
Speaker 1: So this all goes back to the plantation owner named Buns?
Speaker 2: No, the plantation owner's name was Jackson.  But the family name that evidently existed prior to them being, you know, enslaved, or what have you, was Buns.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I'm trying to get--so, the plantation owner's name was Jackson?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And he fell in love with one of the slaves who was a Buns.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.  And he decided to name all of them Jackson?
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because really, because really, you know, slaves and, you know--
Speaker 1: Didn't make--yeah.
Speaker 2: --you weren't recognized.  You know, that marriage wasn't recognized, according to anybody at that time, but, however, evidently, he was pretty powerful.  And he was allowed to do whatever, and she was even allowed to inherit the property, which is how we got it.
Speaker 1: Now, that's incredible.  I mean, yeah, so I can see your grandfather who kept the--well, your father kept the B in his name?
Speaker 2: Uh-hm, uh-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, was trying to hang onto the family, the original family name?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And you're saying that your--was it your grandmother that inherited this?  Was it your grandmother or--
Speaker 2: Right.  It was my great-great-grandmother--
Speaker 1: --or great-grandmother?
Speaker 2: --and, of course, it passed on.
Speaker 1: Great-great-great-grandmother?
Speaker 2: Um-hm [sic. great-great-grandmother].
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's great-great-great-grandmother inherited--
Speaker 2: All of the property from her--
Speaker 1: --this Jackson property?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, from her slave owner husband.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, of course, it's only, you know, a mysterious history how that happened because, of course, he had another family.  So, how that actually occurred, but the, but the property is still in the family today.  In fact, that's where I grew up.
Speaker 1: That's interesting because, you know, I tell you--before I started doing these interviews, I did not know.  I used to wonder how black people got property in the South and stuff.  And this is a common story, that someone would really have a serious relationship with someone, and leave it to the family, you know, leave to the black side of the family, or a portion of it--if not, all of it.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: That's kind of--it's interesting.  Okay.  So, your family has some means as a result.  At least your father's side has some means as a result of this--
Speaker 2: We were, we were land rich, as people would say, and cash poor (laughter).  But having lots of property, of course, gave you, gave you influence, gave you clout.  I absolutely remember being treated very, very differently when I was growing up as a child by those store owners in town.  I would always ask my dad, and it was a long time before we knew the history behind why we lived where we lived, and why we had, what we had.  We lived on the outskirts of town.  Pledger proper, which is where I grew up, pretty much--I guess, maybe at the time, when I was growing up, probably had about six or seven hundred people.  You probably had more horses, and cows, and hogs, and chickens, than you had people, of course.  And, but I was treated very, very differently by the white store owners and post- postmaster in town, than I could see my other friends were.  And that was because we owned property and were considered, I guess, (air quotes) equals in town.
Story_ID: 284303
Speaker 1: I think I forgot to ask you, your father's [Lewis B. Jackson, Sr.] birthdate and place of birth.  Was he born in Pledger?
Speaker 2: My father was born in Pledger, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was his birthdate?
Speaker 2: February 12, '21, 1921.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Right now, is--did your father talk about growing up?  Did he have any significant stories about growing up that you can share with us?
Speaker 2: My father talked about it being very, very difficult growing up on the farm.  They were farmers, of course.  My father wanted to be educated.  They had--he had quite a few siblings.  And you were expected to work the farm.  An incredible story--my aunt, my Aunt Cleo [ph.], who just passed, who was eighty years old when she passed, kept it a secret that my father was doing an FHA [sic.] project, and that was, you know, Farmers of America [Future Farmers of America; National FFA Organization] back then in, in the rural area.  He would keep it a secret because he'd come home late.  And his mom [Ella Jackson] would just, you know, whip him beyond recognition almost because he had been gone, but he wanted to do these projects because he was preparing to go to college.  He wanted to go to Prairie View [State Normal and Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas].  And he kept it a secret for those two years, and my aunt would give him money to, you know, buy lunch and what have you, to--so, he'd have enough to complete these projects.  Well, they made a pact--my father and his sister--that both of them could not go to college.  So, she actually chose not to go to college and to support him, so that he could go to school.  And once his mom found out, she really felt so very bad.  But he would never tell her that, that's what he was doing--that he was trying to complete his education and requirements so.
Speaker 1: Now, why didn't he tell you in the first place?  Would she be against it, or would she thought it just impossible to do or what?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, education really was not--once you had that kind of land, you had that kind of property.  You worked to keep it, you worked to make sure that it was prosperous, that you had to harvest each year.  And so, that was your, that was your payback.  Even if you went to college, you came back to work the land.  And they felt that, that's what you owe them.  And so, my father had a very difficult time because he went on to be a school teacher.  He did not come back to the farm to work.  And just an, just an interesting time of how people thought back then that, you know, you grew up.  They gave you a good upbringing.  They brought you up Christian and your, your--I guess your due, them, was to come and help them work the farm, you know, once they got older, and what have you.  But it didn't work out that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I guess I'm glad for that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did he go on to Prairie View to school?
Speaker 2: He did, he did go on to Prairie View and graduated, and became a wonderful educator in science and math and a football coach, and taught during the years of the Negro schools, and stopped teaching after integration.  My father said the quality of education would never be the same.  And he said he would not teach white children, black children together, 'cause he would never be allowed to teach white children, like he was allowed to teach black children.  And he'd rather quit than go through that.
Speaker 1: Now this is true to some extent, isn't it, I mean, that he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, sure, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --in a black school, they really focused on mentoring black children, and teaching them what they had to do as black children, which is different from what you have to do to white children to succeed--
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: --and always the--
Speaker 2: And you need to teach them, like they were their own children.  You didn't have really any boundaries with them, you know.  If you want to spank them, or knock them upside their head, or throw keys at them, or shoes at them, or what have you, but you wouldn't dare, in the '60s [1960s], do that with a white child.  So, my father said he, he would not go through that.  And especially, he saw so many of his friends--oh, and our relatives who were principals, of course, and the black school relegated to being in the classroom.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He said he would not suffer that indignity.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a tragic story you hear all the time about people.  And what's strange is that a lot of the black teachers had degrees that were superior to the white teachers--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --and, yet, were not given the same status in--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --during integration.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Story_ID: 284304
Speaker 1: Now is there a story that your parents tell about how they met?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mom [Sweetie Crawford Jackson] and dad [Lewis B. Jackson, Sr.] met in San Antonio, Texas.  My dad was in the [U.S.] Army at the time.  And, of course, you have Lackland Air Force Base [Bexar County, Texas] there, and you have Kelly, Kelly Air Force Base [San Antonio, Texas] there.  And he was there in training.  Of course, my mom and her folks [Alfreida Fennell Crawford and Reverend Ira D. Crawford] had moved to San Antonio by the time that she had graduated from high school [Phillis Wheatley High School; G.W. Brackenridge High School, San Antonio, Texas], and they met there.  Her brothers introduced him.  They knew my dad from the base, and they introduced them.  And, in fact, there's an old picture of them walking down the street.  They had just gotten their engagement rings.  And that would be a picture--it would be great to send you guys.  But, yeah, they were introduced by her brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he was in the [U.S.] Air Force when they met?
Speaker 2: He was, he was in the Army, and I guess there was, there was a training, there was a training, I guess, where they all came through, pretty much everything came through San Antonio at that time, and that's how they met.
Story_ID: 284305
Speaker 1: What are your parents' personalities like?
Speaker 2: Interesting.  My dad [Lewis B. Jackson, Sr.] was a very stern person because I think that was, that was the product of his, of his upbringing--very stern, pretty much no nonsense.  He lightened up later on in life, but pretty stern--just promoted education every day.  There was no talk about finding yourself.  He knew where you were, and pretty much dictated what you were going to do.  There was not a matter of going through and saying, "Okay, gosh, what am I going to do after I graduate from high school?"  It was understood that you wanted, that you were going to go to college.  But they, they also--I keep talking about these pacts.  They made a pact.  He wanted to have lots of children.  He wanted to educate them all.  He wanted my mom [Sweetie Crawford Jackson] to be a stay-at-home mom.  That was just very, very clear.  It worked out that way.  My mom did not work until my little brother [Ira A. Jackson] was in the sixth grade.  You'll see from some of the report there that all of us were five years apart, except, except for two of us.  And so, that was pretty crazy to us, but that was a--and my mom said, my father actually did the family planning.
Speaker 1: How many of you is it again?
Speaker 2: There were five.
Speaker 1: Five--if everybody is five years apart except--
Speaker 2: Uh-hm, except, except for one--my, my two sisters [Janet Jackson McNeil and Kathy Jackson Thompson].
Speaker 1: You were born in a span of twenty-five years?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: That's, that's something, yeah.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, and my father planned it that way.  I think that's pretty unusual for that era 'cause they were married in '59 [1959], so yeah.  Mom, very sweet, very spiritual, church musician, has been for the last, oh, about fifty years there in Pledger, Texas since moving.  There was my dad.  She was an urban girl, urban socialite, pastor's daughter, and beautiful, long gorgeous hair, very polished, who married an educated country boy.  And so, that's an interesting combination--I think, probably I'm half and half.  I think I got the best of both of them.  But, yeah, they're, they're an interesting pair.  Probably, if you would say, let's put these two people together.  You'd probably say no, that would not work, but it did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were an interesting pair.  My dad was a disciplinarian but, mainly, left it up to my mom.  He'd pretty much say what needed to be done, and she'd sort of carry out or carry out the punishment, I guess.
Story_ID: 284306
Speaker 1: Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I was telling my mom [Sweetie Crawford Jackson] today, my earliest childhood memory, and it's really ridiculous, but I remember how beautiful she looked.  My mom was always dressed up around the house--always had her hair beautifully combed, and with earrings.  And we'd call ear-bobs back then, matching shoes, and all of that.  And I remember the day she went to the hospital to give birth to my little brother [Ira A. Jackson].  She had on this beautiful crisp, navy blue, and white polka dot dress, with matching shoes and all of that.  And going off to have a baby--it just did not look like.  And she was just--"So, baby, I'll be back in a couple of days--going to have your," you know, the whatever it was.  I don't think they were doing testing back then.  But that was, that was pretty interesting.  Talks with my grandfather [Ira P. Jackson], my dad's [Lewis B. Jackson, Sr.] father, how he always talked about keeping the family property.  Whenever they would sit us down, it was always talking about--because we did herding of cows, hauling of hay, and whenever they were with us, it was about, "You see all of this?  This will be yours one day, and never sell family property.  I don't care what you have to do--always make sure you hold on to family property."  Those talks were given to all of us.  And so far, I think we've adhered to them.
Story_ID: 284307
Speaker 1: Now, what were some of the--could you describe where you grew up and, now you were born in Wharton [Texas], you said--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but you were raised in Pledger [Texas]?
Speaker 2: Pledger, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And describe where you lived, and what were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Hmm.  Wharton, Texas, where I was born, was about eleven miles from Pledger, Texas.  Pledger is probably your typical rural town, but there was nothing sweeter smelling than--we lived on an asphalt--it wasn't an asphalt.  It was a gravel, paved road.  Major trucks came through all the time, so it, it was a very, very nice road.  But we lived off of the highway, and nothing was sweeter smelling than when the fresh rain hit that pavement and freshly cut grass.  We had, between the two houses, my [paternal] grandfather's [Ira P. Jackson] house and my parents' [Sweetie Crawford Jackson and Lewis B. Jackson, Sr.] house, about five acres that we needed to cut because the houses sat on that property.  Nothing sweeter smelling than that freshly cut grass and the clover, the rain hitting that pavement.  I can smell it now, just one of those country smells that you don't get anywhere else.  You'd never get it in the city.  You have no smog to contend with.  Fresh cut alfalfa, when, when we were bailing hay, is a sweet smell of that as it cuts through the Johnson grass.  And you see the hay baler bailing it, and you're following behind it--gives off a wonderfully sweet smell.  Sounds--just big trucks really.  In fact, that was the reason why I, I hated eighteen-wheelers growing up because that was the reason why I never got a bicycle, 'cause they said it'd be too dangerous.  And so, I grew up without a bicycle.  I don't know if that's anything that puts you in therapy, but (laughter), I grew up without a bicycle because we had so many eighteen-wheelers that passed through.  It was a major thoroughfare because they were industrial plants.
Speaker 1: What route was that came by your place?
Speaker 2: Farm to Market Road 1301.  And so, from the Baytown [Texas] area, the Texas City [Texas] area, that had lots and lots of refineries--of course, it's a big refinery town, to Bay City [Texas], which is also a refinery town.  That route always had lots of eighteen-wheelers.  I mean, all day, every day, all night, every night.  And so, those were some of the major sounds.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well--
Speaker 2: Tractors, tractors, of course you know, in a farming community, you know, always have lots of tractors around.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were there tremendous distances between places, you know, in the, out of, plains like that?  I mean, you know, it's flat.  You could ride--was it flat where you lived in--
Speaker 2: Mostly, mostly, it was flat.  If you wanted to go into town, you went into Wharton, Texas.  That's where the major stores were, the department stores, and what have you.  Also, any fast food, that's where that was.  Houston [Texas], of course, was a, was a major trip, Houston was a major trip.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that's like sixty-two miles away?
Speaker 2: About sixty-two miles, yes, southwest.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, how often did you get into Houston, would you say?
Speaker 2: We got into Houston fairly often because my father had brothers there.  We were, we were a very mobile family, and more so mobile than most of the folks in town.  Once again, to me, I thought we were incredibly rich.  Of course, you grow up and don't, don't know that.  But we always had a wonderful car, and so we were quite mobile.  We went to San Antonio [Texas] a lot because that was--my mom was from there, so we spent our summers in San Antonio.  So, Houston was really not a big deal for us because but, but it was a big trip still.  I remember my, you know, friends hang out.  I would tell them, I'd say, "Well we're going to Houston this weekend."  And they just thought that was such a big deal because they just never got to get out of the rural area.  It was pretty normal for us.

Speaker 1: Well tell me about growing up, and--was music a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Music was a big part of growing up.  My mom [Sweetie Crawford Jackson] was a musician and, in fact, her story about having my oldest brother [Lewis B. Jackson, Jr.]--there was a, there was an engagement that she wanted to go to one night.  Well, she was too pregnant to go.  And she says, "One day, I'll have a child who'll be able to go in my stead."  And my older brother started playing at the age of three.  He's a master musician today.  In fact, he has a bachelor's [degree] and master's [degree] in music, and just a genius when it comes to, to music.  So, we, we--all of us sang.
Speaker 1: So, it's a keyboard they're on for the most, right, part, right, they're big keyboard artists?
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't keyboard back then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your mother--
Speaker 2: --It was true pianos--
Speaker 1: Piano, okay.
Speaker 2: --back then, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, it was often the pianist plays the organ, too, in church, you know?
Speaker 2: Uh-hm, absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: But in this case--
Speaker 2: My mom is, yeah, the church organist still today, yeah.  But my older brother grew up on a piano--in fact, prefers that to a keyboard 'cause that's just how he was trained.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were called the Jackson Five Spiritual Singers [ph.], you know.  Of course, when the Jackson Five [The Jackson 5], you know, came out, they said, "They took our name (laughter)."  But we sang, we sang a lot in various places and what have you, but we--none of us had an aspiration to go any further than that.  And all of us played a musical instrument and made sure that all of us were in the band.  And when you talk about music, my older brother made history in 19-, let's see, '69 [1969].  He became--and Boling High School's [Boling High School, Boling, Texas] an all-white high school--became the first black student band director.  And ten years later, I became the second black student band director.  And so, we still hold that history.
Speaker 1: So, as a student, you were a student director?  Or, okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, student band director, um-hm, um-hm.  I was part of the band.  I was part of the band.
Story_ID: 284309
Speaker 1: It was interesting.  Growing up there in Pledger [Texas], we didn't--gosh, I guess, you can call it blatant racism or subtle racism.  It seems as if pretty much, everybody got along there.  Of course, we didn't know all of the, you know, goings-on back then that probably my [paternal] grandfather [Ira P. Jackson] had to contend with or my father [Lewis B. Jackson, Sr.] had to contend with.  I remember, though, that growing up, most of my friends were white because my black friends really didn't like me all that much.  And I was wondering what was going on.  My father had taught everybody in town, first off.  And so, I was Professor Jackson's daughter and so, I think people thought that maybe I should be snooty or something.  But I found it interesting growing up in a majority black town that I really didn't have a lot of black friends.  And we weren't allowed to go to everybody's house.  You probably know about that.  They could come visit you, but you couldn't go and visit them.  So, my folks were pretty strict when it came to that.  So, it sort of limited our area of friendships.
Speaker 2: Did you have many--I mean, were there any black peers?  I mean, other black children that had similar aspirations and goals as your family or that you--
Speaker 1: I, I think, I think we were the family to aspire to be--I remember my father being criticized by people in town by sending his kids off to college instead of going to maybe the local junior college [Wharton County Junior College] which was there in Wharton, Texas.  Somehow, they thought that was uppity.  And it's not as if their children could not, but I think they had--I think so many of the parents had suffered, so many of the effects of racism that they really, they really passed their hopelessness on to their children.  And so, even if those children were talented and gifted, they still did not have the belief system that they could go.  That was something those Jackson kids did.  And so, it was very, very tough because we did have, we did have some peers that we encouraged because for us, it was just something that you did.  But to have a college-educated father or parent or what have you, really was not heard of in Pledger.  And so, there was really not a model for children to look at.  And so, for us, it was a matter-of-fact thing, but for them, I can just remember so many.  And I think it was because of what their parents had gone through, were just talked down, like one of my older brother's [Lewis B. Jackson, Jr.] friends, who also was very wonderful at music, had learned to play the piano.  My older brother had taught him, and they called him a sissy.  They didn't dare call my older brother that because of my dad.  They may have called him that behind his back.  But just gave up on it because he could not stand the teasing from his mom and his dad.  And that's just probably one of the, that's one of the tough stories.  And then, that same family, this young man had a sister, who could speak very well, very eloquently, and, of course, you know, she was teased, you know, by her other siblings and her, you know, folks and grandparents as she was trying to talk white, and just really gave into it, gave into it, and those were probably some of the really--
Speaker 2: No, even as we speak, the same dynamic goes on, we often hear--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --of black children being ostracized--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in a black community, often times for being too proper.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: And even in the middle class black community--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --where, you know, when, where, you know, music styles and patterns of speech are, you know--
Speaker 1: Right, yes.
Speaker 2: --associated with, you know, a certain amount of--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I guess, hipness and coolness or something--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was very hurtful.  And I'm, I'm just trying to, beat back some stuff there, but, you know, especially when you had kids that you knew could make it.
Story_ID: 284310
Speaker 1: And my [paternal] grandfather [Ira P. Jackson] always told us that we, we possessed so much and he would always tell us that.  He says, "If you ever find yourself in a situation where you have more than you can use, you have more than you can eat, you have more money than you can spend, that overage doesn't belong to you.  So, you need to find out who that overage belongs to, and spend the rest of your life finding out who that overage belongs to."  And so, we were Parks and Recreation in Pledger [Texas].  When folks wanted to play football, you know, a weekend game of football or baseball, we'd cut out one of the fields.  We were the employment office.
Speaker 2: So, your family was (laughter) Parks and Recreation?
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure, we were--I mean, you know, we were the employment office.  If you wanted a summer job, you'd haul hay, you'd herd the cows, you know, horses, groom horses, you know, for my dad [Lewis B. Jackson, Sr.] and granddad.  So, we were brought up that we were supposed to make ways for people.  And so all of us--it doesn't surprise me now that all of us are in professions that, that help people, you know.  We're, we're school teachers, we're nurse practitioners, we're city council folks who champion the cause, causes of people who can't, who have no voice.  So, that, that was just a part of, of who we were.  My mom [Sweetie Crawford Jackson], I can remember, you know, just talking about growing up in this dichotomy, with having a really not many black friends and kids who treat you very, very poorly, my mom would make these wonderful dresses.  My mom was an incredible seamstress and could sew anything.  She could look at something on television or see something in, in a department store, and go home, and cut out a pattern, and make it.  And so, we were always dressed to the nines.  She made all of our clothes and what have you, but she would sew for the neighborhood kids.  And we knew these folks didn't like us, but she says--but they don't know any better, baby.  So, just always, that's how we were, we were brought up.  I didn't like it.  I can promise you that because it just seemed, it seemed unfair.  But as I grew older, I realized that a lot of the issues that my peers had came from their parents, and I think a lot of their issues came from, came from poverty.
Speaker 2: Sort of a vicious cycle of all of this.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 284311
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a little girl?  I mean, what were you--I know you had music and church and, but what were you like?  What did you like to do?  What kind of personality did you have?
Speaker 2: I think I was the clown in the family.  I was, I was, I was a lot of fun, I think, a lot of fun, fascinated by words, very, very quick.  I liked to hang out with older folks.  Well, you could always find me sitting somewhere on the periphery, and sometimes in the middle, of older conversations, just sitting quietly and listening.  And, you know, folks always thought I was so very serious when, really, I, I was not.  There was a story told at my commencement a couple of weeks ago that I couldn't remember that they used to call me Reverend Seister [ph.]--my, my siblings--'cause they said I was always preaching somewhere, pretending as if--
Speaker 1: Reverend--
Speaker 2: --you know, I was, I was preaching, you know, something.
Speaker 1: Now what was Reverend, what was the Seister?  What does that--
Speaker 2: Well, that was just, you know, that was--I, I think, there was a Hispanic character on television who pronounced sister as seister, and so they called me Reverend Seister.  And that is just so funny to me because I don't remember that.  But all of my siblings say that, that's true, so I guess I'm the only one who, who chooses to have selective amnesia about that.  So, I think I was a pretty fun kid.  I was a smart kid, uh, very athletic.  Once again, half my dad [Lewis B. Jackson, Sr.], half my mom [Sweetie Crawford Jackson].  I think I enjoyed being as much of a country girl, as I did being the daughter of an urban mother.  I liked to wear my cowboy boots.  I liked to get all, you know, dusty and dirty and, you know, walk with my dad out in the, you know, out in the pastures, and what have you.  And then, of course, I'd come back in, and my mom would, you know, try to transform me into this pretty little princess.  And so, I went through that pretty much each day, you know, the rugged kid and then, you know, the princess, and what have you.  So, I think I'm still that way.
Speaker 1: Okay, now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think that sort of shaped me for, for life.
Story_ID: 284312
Speaker 1: What about popular culture?  Did you listen to a lot of radio or television, or did you go to the movies and do that?
Speaker 2: Wow, I, I wish I could have gone to a movie.  No, there were not any movie houses that close by and once again--here, here's the deal.  My father [Lewis B. Jackson, Sr.] worked away from home after he stopped teaching.  My father worked from home all week in a place called Gidding, Texas, Giddings, Texas, for the [Texas] Department of Agriculture.  And so, he left on Sunday nights, and came back on Friday nights.  And Friday nights were game nights, so he always came back in time to see us perform because we were in the band.  And so, you didn't go to the movies because, once again, it was just mom [Sweetie Crawford Jackson] there.  It was a long time before my mom learned to drive.  I can remember my older brother [Lewis B. Jackson, Jr.] teaching my mom to drive because she truly was a stay-at-home mom.  So, recreation really was around the house.  My mom always did word games with us.  We always came up with ways to entertain ourselves, did a lot of outdoors type of things, but movies were out.  We listened to lots of radio, lots of television.  Of course, at that time, there were three stations, you know, we were, you know, we got them out of Houston [Texas].  The signal came through in Houston, and it was black and white.  I can't tell you when we got a colored TV, but yeah, black and white, three stations, Channel 8, you know, of course, it's probably still the educational station.  And then you had Channel 11 and Channel 13, and that was pretty much it for us when it came to entertainment.  Of course, you know, in the summer, we went to San Antonio [Texas] for holidays.  We'd get a chance to see a movie, and it sounds really primitive talking about this now, but we got a chance to see a movie.  We went to San Antonio on holidays because our older cousins could take us.  But, yeah, yeah, I did not grow up--I remember the blaxplotation movies that came out, you know, 'Three the Hard Way' with Jim Brown and Fred Williamson and all that.  And I just thought that was the coolest thing in the whole world.  But about once a year, I saw a movie, yeah, it, that sounds so horrible now, doesn't it (laughter)?
Speaker 1: It's different now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it really does.
Speaker 1: When you--by the time you started going to movies, where they, they weren't segregated or anything, or were they?  You didn't have to--
Speaker 2: I don't remember them being, but you're talking about the Majestic [Theatre, San Antonio, Texas] downtown in San Antonio.  And so, I think it was all black as far as, far as I know.  But, once again, I just don't have any memory.  By the time I came along and started going to school, I don't have any memory of any separate anything.  There were no signs that I know of that had whites only, Negroes only, or colored only, so I, I missed that, I missed that, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I missed that.
Story_ID: 284313
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about school.  Now, what school did you attend?
Speaker 2: School, as far as my earlier years?
Speaker 1: Yeah, grade, what grade school did you start at?
Speaker 2: I started off at Newgulf Elementary School which was in Newgulf, Texas.  And it was a plant town, interestingly enough, it was a sulfur company.  And it was, once again, a company town.  All the houses were white.  We were--we rode the school bus there.  I guess it was about five miles away, and the one thing that I noticed was that there were not any black people that lived, lived in Newgulf because, you know, you could only live in those houses if you worked for the plant.  And I guess I'm looking back on it now--evidently, black people couldn't work at the plant.
Speaker 1: I mean, you, were you the only black student?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, not at all.  I mean, everybody, everybody in Pledger [Texas], and Boling [Texas], and Iago [Texas], that was the school district, Boling Independent School District, in those three towns, Newgulf, Iago, and Boling, all went to the same elementary school, all went to same, to the same junior high, and all went to the same high school.  So, you saw everybody growing up.  There was not, you know, a choice of two elementary schools, and a choice--there were fifty-five people in my high school graduating class if that tells you anything, yeah.
Speaker 1: Fifty-five?
Speaker 2: Fifty-five, fifty-five, (speaking Spanish) muy poquito, very small class, yes.  And so, elementary, I remember I had one black teacher, and that was in the fifth grade.  I did not--and that was Ms. Effie Kemp [ph.].  She and my father [Lewis B. Jackson, Sr.] were classmates.  And she was so stylish--I mean really, I compare her now to a Lena Horne or compare her to a [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson--always dressed to the nines spoke very properly insisted and really, really stuck to her guns when it came to teaching the Negro school way as, as she would say in private conversations, and got away with it, got away with it because she was teaching, you know, black, Hispanic, and white all in the same setting.
Speaker 1: But how--speaking of that, how were race relations there, and did you have any--were there any American Indians in your--
Speaker 2: Not that I know of--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --not that I know of.
Speaker 1: The black, Hispanic--would there be any Mexicans, you know, Mexican-Americans and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: In fact, my, my, my kindergarten, we called it Mrs. Samora's [ph.] kindergarten.  It was Hispanic--of course, we'd call it Mexican then--but it's amazing to me, you know, as I think back on it, she taught black, white, Hispanic, all there, and she was the only teacher we ever had in kindergarten.  That's where we all came, and that was to recognize kindergarten there for that three-town area.  So, race relations, once again, was either a very, very undercover, or because of the small area, people that made their agreements to get along.  But I did not, I just didn't experience it as far as my memory would go back.  I, I know my father was quite upset about a couple of things but, of course, they kept all of that piece from us. I remember--I think, at the age of seven, when [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated.  They kept us home on the day of the funeral.  It was a very, very rainy day, and my father and mother [Sweetie Crawford Jackson] said, "You will not go to school today.  You will stay home and watch this."
Speaker 1: Did you have a good sense at that time of who he was--who your parents--
Speaker 2: I, I think, I think our parents tried to give us a sense of what was going on.  But, really at seven, there was not a grasp on my part of what was going on because we really were removed from--I won't say the struggle, but I guess the actual violence, and what have you.  I mean, nobody bombed our church.  We had white churches and black churches right down the street from each other.  Blacks and whites were friends, as I knew it.  Nobody ever called me a nigger, you know, none of my white teachers ever gave me a lower grade.  I mean I was an A student, so I'm not sure.  Maybe we certainly weren't a microcosm of what was going on in the real world, so I have to think that we were, we were just a pretty special situation in that area because I absolutely know, from what I know now in the '60s [1960s], people were not getting along that well everywhere else.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we were unusual.  We had an unusual situation.  We really did.
Story_ID: 284314
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: English.  English was a favorite subject of mine.  And, once again, Mrs. Effie Kemp [ph.], was the person who instilled that.  She always talked about and you don't see that now.  She would correct you--if you said anything at all that was grammatically incorrect, you know, subject, verb, didn't agree, Ms. Kemp was right there with the ruler, you know, tapping your wrist, or popping your wrist.  And so, she gave me a love, gave me a great love for, for English.  And then, in sixth grade, had a, had a white teacher who gave me a love for travel, and geography, and sociology.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what high school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Boling High School [Boling, Texas].
Speaker 1: Am I going too fast?  Is there a middle school first?
Speaker 2: There's a middle school.  That's Iago Junior High School [Iago, Texas].
Speaker 1: Now, that's an interesting name.  We were at--we were talking before we started the interview that it's the same name, no matter how it's pronounced, the same name is the villain in 'Othello,' the man who betrays 'Othello' in the play, [William] Shakespeare play.  Is--do you know of any story behind that name or--
Speaker 2: No, I do not.  I always, I thought it was a strange name when I was growing up, but, of course, that's, that's where you went, so I don't know what the genesis, how that name is, but I'll certainly go and ask now.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, this is the middle school?
Speaker 2: Middle school, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, well--
Speaker 2: Those grades then were sixth through the--sixth through eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're in sixth through eighth.  And are things any different in there than they were in the grade school in terms of--
Speaker 2: Interestingly enough, during my junior high years, there was a, all-black school that got shut down.  And all of those kids came into the Boling Independent School District.  There was in Hungerford, Texas about two or three miles [sic.] from Wharton [Texas] and, but none of their teachers were absorbed into the system.  They brought one coach, they allowed one coach to come into our school district.  And then, I think he was bumped down to an assistant coach.  He was the major guy there.  But I remember there being lots of tension between the black kids who came in because, you know, once again, we had this sort of huggy-huggy, kissy-kissy, kind of environment.  And they were very frustrated by this all-white system, and being forced.  And they were actually bussed in, so I think that's probably maybe my first exposure to a bussing situation, but I certainly didn't feel it, like they felt it.  I was wondering why they were so angry because they talked about what, what, if we were at our school, we would have this.  And they--every time there was a play, of course, they were in charge of their own plays, you know, there.  Blacks, you know, weren't given the participation, you know.  And so, that was interesting, but I, I still didn't understand at that point what was going on because things had been so very calm in our little part of the world.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that was, that was a different dynamic.  They came in, and really occupied most of the top sports spots, and our teams got exponentially better.  All of a sudden, you know, we were winning football games and basketball games, and what have you.  So, that was, that was a major dynamic to have this influx of African Americans--well, blacks then--come into a system, and pretty much create a lot of tension.
Story_ID: 284315
Speaker 1: Now, what about high school?  Now, where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: High school, Boling High School [Boling, Texas], which about, this is about two miles from Iago [Texas].  It's where everybody went to high school, and that's when I put down all of my sports, and got serious about band, got serious about academics, and there, as we were discussing before, became the second black student bank director.  And then the first black president of the National Honor Society, which created quite a stir that had never been.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did you play in the band, what--
Speaker 2: Played the trombone because my older brother [Lewis B. Jackson, Jr.] played the trombone.  I wanted to do everything that he did, so I--we all had, which, interestingly enough, that was pretty unusual for other African Americans.  My folks [Sweetie Crawford Jackson and Lewis B. Jackson, Sr.] purchased all of our own instruments.  So, whatever we played, they bought for us.  And so, I had my own trombone.  I inherited my older brother's trombone for a while, of course, and then I got my own. But, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you became the student band director?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, student band director, and the big deal about that was, was that you got to direct at all the games on the fields on Friday night.  And, of course, while the band was in the stands, you did all the directing.  You know, the band director--well, I guess, himself and herself, I went through two while I was there, pretty much sat down, and let the student band director, so that was a big deal, especially for the black community, you know, to have, you know, a black person there out on the field on this ladder, you know, directing, you know, the half-time show, and then to come back into the stands and direct that.  So, it was, that was a proud moment for the--that, that we were doing something other than football.
Story_ID: 284316
Speaker 1: Now we were talking before we started the interview about the tradition of football in Texas.  And, you know, there's been a movie made, 'Friday Night Lights,' about football in Texas and they, so much talk about it.  And, you know, we interviewed Mel Farr [HistoryMaker Mel Farr, Sr.], and you talked about Elvin Bethea--
Speaker 2: Sure, Elvin Bethea plays a good front line man, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and all these other great football players that came up, that came out of Texas.  Was, were the Friday night games, like a real big deal there?  You said your father [Lewis B. Jackson, Sr.] would come back to the games, right?
Speaker 2: It was the only thing in town.  Friday night, everything shut down.  I mean, everything started shutting down probably about three o'clock.  Folks were let out of school.  The plants let, you know, let their workers go early.  Football was king in Texas, especially if you had a winning team.  But even if you didn't, once again, it was the only thing in town.  And, you know, the parents were very, very supportive, you know, with the booster clubs and all that.  You really don't hear a lot about that now.  But with the booster clubs and all of that, it was fantastic.  And the whole, you know, the--we were the Bulldogs [at Boling High School, Boling, Texas], green and white, and we had, you know, especially when we got a black quarterback, Billy Waddy, I'll never forget.  And in the '70's [1970s]--
Speaker 1: Whiting [ph.], is it?
Speaker 2: Waddy, W-A-D-D-Y.
Speaker 1: Waddy, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, Billy Waddy took us to state and boy, I'll tell you.  It was, it was just really, it was just really something.  Football, football, probably still is king in Texas, but it certainly was when I was growing up.  And the whole, whole band and football team was, was a part of it because I can remember we got a fairly young band director in.  Of course, you started playing the latest tunes, and what have you.  And I just thought I was hot stuff because I got to direct all of that.  But, yeah, it was, it was an interesting time.  And, and when you're in a rural area, I think football in Texas transcends race.  People who would normally maybe not even sit beside each other--when it comes to football in Texas, everybody, you know, you're my brother, you know.  And, you know, people sort of forget about it for those, you know, for that sixty minutes, you know, or those four quarters.  And they may go back to business as usual after that.  But, during that time, your kid and my kid are on the same team, yeah.
Speaker 1: It's interesting that, you know, they need to describe church as the most segregated couple of hours in America, you know, and yet, football--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --a lot of times in--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --those small towns, it's the most integrated time.
Speaker 2: That's, that's exactly right, exactly right.  It's as if people forget all of that ugliness, and put it aside because winning, winning is everything.
Speaker 1: And the identity of the town, it seemed to be, you know, very closely aligned to what the football and some case, the basketball team does political discussion--I mean, discussion about who should have did--should the coach have done this or that.
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, oh, sure.
Speaker 1: And I mean, it becomes really deep, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, sure, oh, sure.
Speaker 1: --that people speak about it as if they're talking about the Iraq War or something, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --they didn't talk about who should have been a quarterback--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --or who should have been--
Speaker 2: Oh, well, those decisions absolutely were made in coffee houses and all of that--who was starting.  You would think that would be left up to the coach, but if there was a banker son, that he wanted played, you, you can bet, you know, or the principal's son, or superintendent's son, or what have you.  Oh, yeah, yeah, that decision was not made by the coach.  It was made by the, by the town, by the town powers, so to speak.
Speaker 1: And even the, even a story I heard once about a manipulation of cheerleaders.  They had a mother on 'The Oprah [Winfrey] Show' or something like that who had gone as to far as to, you know, do something to manipulate the--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, to, yeah, try to take out the competition--
Speaker 1: --the, pick up, yeah.
Speaker 2: --so her child could be a kind--yeah, that, that came on later but, but my growing up, that, that kind of thing, probably, probably the biggest thing was that it was tough to get a black cheerleader, very, very tough, and so, if you were, you know, the right hue of, of skin, and what have you, you could make it.  But other than that, you really didn't see a lot of black cheerleaders and that was, that was the one off limits area, it seemed, and I'm not, not sure why that was (unclear).
Speaker 1: I think maybe because it's subjective--
Speaker 2: I'm sure why that was (laughter), I know why that was.
Speaker 1: --yeah, it's subjective, you know, where playing football, you can run fast.  You either can or you can't, you know.
Speaker 2: Sure, yeah, but you were not supposed to be beautiful if you were black and that, of course, was reserved for, you know, the beautiful girls.  And, of course, black couldn't be beautiful so yeah.
Story_ID: 284317
Speaker 1: Well, we're just--we're talking about the football, but another dramatic part of growing up is baptism in the river.  Now, I want you to talk about (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Good segue right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: One of my greatest memories was my whole joining church and getting baptized.  My initial reason for joining church was so I could take communion, drink the grape juice.
Speaker 1: Now, how old were you when you when you (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I was seven when I started my quest to get to that front seat to join church, but I was always pulled back 'cause I was too young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  And I tried again at eight 'cause there were always revivals that, that went on during the week, and they would end on Friday night.  So, you know, Friday night was your last chance, you know, to join, unless you waited for Sunday morning.  So, I remember there was a revival--can't remember if the revival was named.  But I was determined at that Friday night I was going to join church.  And by Sunday, 'cause, you know, communion was first Sunday, and I wanted to be, you know, a member, you know, so I could have the grape juice and, and the bread on Sunday morning.  So, I got up there before anybody, you know, because I knew when the invitation was coming, and what have you.  And so, you know, I took my first opportunity.  I was up there on that first row before anybody could, could stop me.  And, of course, I joined church and by that time, certainly I knew what I was doing.  And in fact, I believe that's when I actually received my call as I, as I knew it, as far as ministry was concerned, but didn't know what to call it at that time.  And so, the baptismal was planned, once again, as I was saying.  They didn't have baptismal pools in, in most of the churches.  You just couldn't afford to, to build them then.  So, everybody was baptized in Caney Creek which was right behind our property [in Pledger, Texas] right in the back.  We owned half of Caney Creek.  That was an interesting piece and which is why, now that I think about it, that's why black people were baptized on that side of the creek.  It was because it was owned by black people.  But it was contiguous to one of our pastors.  And so, you rode from the church, which was just like a mile and a half away, down this dusty road.  And we opened up the fence and all the cars could park in, park in the fields.  Everybody had on white.  I'll never forget the Sisters, and they lined up along the bank.  You know, now that's recorded in all of these wonderful paintings, you know, that artists are doing now, but that was actually how my baptismal day looked.  And there was like, maybe five or six of us.  The creek was very, very high.  And I remember my father [Lewis B. Jackson, Sr.] getting me from my mother's [Sweetie Crawford Jackson] arms and taking--I was dressed in white and had a cap, you know, a white cap on.  And my father, you know, was carrying me out to the minister who's in the middle of the creek.  And, you know, just saying, you know, asked me again that I believe in Jesus, that I want to be baptized.  And he said, "Now, I baptize you, Little Sister Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Constance Jackson], in the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost."  You know, you go down in this water, and then somebody breaks out, you know, and wade in the water, you know, there from the river bank from the creek bank.  It's just nothing like it.  I mean, I, I wouldn't be baptized all over again to save my life.  Some people say that, you know, they'd like to be baptized again because they really don't remember being baptized.  That was such a pivotal time in my life and aww, gal, when I see those pictures now that, you know, artists' renderings of that time, I, I tell people, you guys, that's how it really was.  That's how people used to really dress.  And, you know, literally, but it was, it was interesting that, you know, my father, you know, took me out.  He was a deacon in the church and took me out there to the pastor.  And it was, it was really, it was a spiritual time for me.  And I can just remember that, of course, and those folks think, you know, this is a lot of fun, or either you're afraid, but I was looking forward to it.  And I'll just never forget that sight of all those people 'cause, once again, when a child got baptized, when I was coming up, it was a big deal.  You know, this child is now coming into the knowledge, you know, the Lord, and what have you, and this child is saved, and the whole, you know, just the whole community came out, not just your church.  And people would call up, you know, my child is getting baptized.
Story_ID: 284318
Speaker 1: And so, that's something that's missing now, I think from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's--I would say it's probably rites of passage because, you know, in some way.
Speaker 1: Yes--
Speaker 2: A rite of passage.
Speaker 1: --absolutely, absolutely, absolutely.  And for, you know, the reward was that all of the rights and privileges of membership weren't afforded to you then, until you were baptized.  You know, now, you know, you really don't have to join the church.  They say, oh, c'mon, and sing with us and what have you, and participate, but you couldn't sing in the choir.  And, of course, you couldn't partake of communion until you were baptized.  And so, that was, that was, yeah, you're exactly right--rite of passage.  And the seriousness associated with baptismal, or the sacraments as we call them now, with communion--I remember our pastor saying, you know, "If you eateth and drinketh this cup and bread unworthily, you eat and drink damnation unto your soul."  They don't say that anymore, but it's actually in the Bible that, you know, if you, you know, take communion, and what have you, and you have an ought against your brother, or an offense against your brother, or what have you, God won't accept you.  That was so serious.  And, and the ladies had to cover their hair, cover their heads, and what have you--just a really, really different time than what we see now with the little plastic cups, you know, with the little juice in, and you flip the top back and pop it, and keep on going.  They say, have a nice day.  That's not how I grew up, so I, I long for those days, I long for those days when, when communion and baptismal was a more serious event in the church.
Speaker 2: Now was the--did you, would you say in those days that you were baptized in the church that the church--did the church really offer instruction about, you know, serious instruction about life, and how to live in a--I mean, for members of the church community or--
Speaker 1: From, from the biblical perspective, that was the talk about holiness, about living right, you know, this whole thing now of, you know, how do you handle your money and, gosh, being a better social person and all of that.  We didn't have any of that.  It was about do unto others, the Golden Rule, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."  The Ten Commandments, I think I'm a better preacher now to this day because I can tell you just about any Old Testament story that you'd want to know.  I have a lot of my friends now that I've gone to seminary with, have no idea many times what I'm talking about when I'm saying, well, you know, just like, you know, Jeremiah did this, or when Moses did this, they may have heard of the Red Sea, but the story is just missing.  And I had a Sunday school teacher, Mrs. Henrietta Jenkins [ph.].  She had to be there when those stories were happening.  She could tell you, she could tell you a biblical story, and you'd swear that she was one of the characters in there.  It was just so much a part of her, and I think that's where I got my great love for the Bible 'cause she could just really make it come alive, and make it apply, and make it applicable to your life.  But, you know, now I think we do a lot of--boy, I'll probably get in trouble for saying this.  But I, I think a lot of what I hear in some pulpits and on television, and it's a spill good kind of stuff.  And, and it really isn't lasting, it really isn't lasting.
Speaker 2: Now, in terms of African American life and culture, was there much history and culture passed along in the church or at school when you were coming along?
Speaker 1: Not, well once again, by the time I went to school, it was integrated.  So, you really, you know, there was, there was not any history, and that's the one thing I was so jealous of with my older brothers and sisters.  They actually got the Negro school experience.  And so, of course, there was loads and loads of history that they knew about that I didn't know, other than what I got at home and what I got at church.  They talk about it at church, but of course, I spent more time in school than I spent in either one of those places.  And so, I was always very, very jealous of, of friends or cousins who had an opportunity to go to majority black schools.  And they just knew all of this wonderful African American history.  And, and, you know, I could give you American history or what have you, or the part that they put in the books, but there was just nothing, and I'm, and I'm catching up even now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 284319
Speaker 1: Now, in high school [Boling High School, Boling, Texas], now you were a member, you said of the National Honor Society?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, this is a big deal.
Speaker 2: It's a big deal.
Speaker 1: It's not easy to be a member of that National Honor Society.
Speaker 2: That's right, and especially if you were black.
Speaker 1: Right, and--
Speaker 2: They let one in each year and, yeah, pretty much one a year, and it was usually--
Speaker 1: So, you were quite a student then, you had to be quite a student.
Speaker 2: I, I, I believe I was, and not just quite a black student.  I was, I was quite a student.  And, and I think I was pretty radical.  I, I remember our high school counselor was the sponsor for the National Honor Society--did not like me.  And, in fact, I was elected president of the National Honor Society as protest because, of course, you know, the white kids had to elect me 'cause there was no black kids in it, you know, but me.  But usually the person that graduated, if you were in there, of course they went some years without having a black there.  And so, in protest, because she was so very prejudiced, they elected me president.  We had, you know, secret elections, and what have you, and she had put in her, you know, bid as to who should be president.  And they elected me, and I--we just thought she was going to stroke.  Just, just an interesting time, so I think some of my militancy, I, I think I became, became aware, or began to become aware of what was going on in the outside world 'cause insulated is the word I like to use for, for my school existence coming up.
Speaker 1: And you're starting, you were starting to become more aware and sensitive to what was going on otherwise?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, of what the real world was like.
Speaker 1: Were there any--did you have any heroes at that point, in terms of black leaders, maybe that you follow the activities of [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson, or anybody else in terms of--
Speaker 2: Follow Barbara Jordan and Shirley Chisholm.  Barbara Jordan just had a long history.  Her uncle, Reverend Ezra Edmund [ph.], used to pastor my home church.  Of course, this was before I was born, but I'd hear stories of how she used to come with him to the church.  And I just find it interesting that our paths would cross, you know, at some point later.  But Barbara Jordan and Shirley Chisholm were, were my she-roes at the time.  And, once again, you, you got your information from what news, whatever news, that you could get from your three stations.
Speaker 1: Now, yeah, they made quite an impact during the Civ- I mean, both Shirley Chisholm and Barbara Jordan--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, sure.
Speaker 1: --both of them articulate and, you know, often would go against the grain if they had to make a point.  Did you ever get a chance to meet either one of them, you know--I mean, while you were in high school?
Speaker 2: No, not at all, not at all.  I, I would not, I would not ever meet Shirley Chisholm, but I certainly would meet Barbara Jordan in my freshman year in college at the University of Texas at Austin [Austin, Texas].
Speaker 1: Well, Okay. Now, let's, let's finish up high school.  Now, did you go to the prom, and all that sort of thing in high school, did you?
Speaker 2: I, I managed to get out and, and go to the prom.  Once again, my folks [Sweetie Crawford Jackson and Lewis B. Jackson, Sr.] were very strict, so pretty much, your date was sort of hand-picked for you.  I wouldn't say from birth exactly, but you certainly understood there was a certain kind of guy that could take you out, and from a certain kind of family.  And so, junior and senior year, we went to the prom.  On the prom committee, so we got a deejay that played black music, you know, it was a big coup by that time because in previous years, it just hadn't that--I mean, you know, once I look back on this thing, really--
Speaker 1: Was Archie Bell still popular then?
Speaker 2: Archie Bell and The Drells, of course, from Houston, Texas--yes, absolutely, absolutely.  'Tighten Up' was, was the name of the song I guess that sort of made him famous down in those parts, yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Story_ID: 284320
Speaker 1: When it came time to choose a school, though, did you, how did you--you went to the University of Texas [at Austin, Austin, Texas], but how did you end up choosing the University of Texas, 'cause with a president of the National Honor Society, you could go anywhere almost, you would think.
Speaker 2: Well, what, what's interesting is I--well, I'll just fast forward.  I received a four-year academic scholarship from the University of Texas.  And I think that was probably a part of their recruitment efforts to take the top ten percent. And certainly if you were African American, you know, they were still doing the affirmative action thing back then.  If you were African American, you know, you were a shoo-in, and, and got four years paid for.  Interestingly enough, that same counselor, who did not like me, was the one who gave me the application for, uh, to fill out, to attend the University of Texas.  But, you, you know, I think about it now, and I had no idea of places like Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] or Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  You know, I think now, gosh, if I'd gone to Spelman, or if I'd gone to Howard, you know, and I meet people, of course, and, you know, they're wonderful people, but certainly not necessarily more extraordinary than, than anyone else.  But I just, I just think that, you know, there would have been such a rich educational experience had I known because my brother [Lewis B. Jackson, Jr.] had gone to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  And, gosh, ten years earlier, so it was not as if, you know, my folks [Sweetie Crawford Jackson and Lewis B. Jackson, Sr.] were opposed to sending their kids out of state.  So, I just, I, I think sometimes I go back because the University of Texas was forty-eight to one.  We were like one percent of the population.  Blacks were one percent of the population.  So, it was, it was an interesting experience, but it was the same ratio that I'd experienced in high school [Boling High School, Boling, Texas], so it really wasn't a big jump.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, how did you like the University of Texas?
Speaker 2: The University of Texas, I found out very, very early, that it was about contacts.  It was about connections, making connections, that the University of Texas was, you know, gosh, if you were majoring in biology, and you wanted to be a doctor, or you wanted to go into law school, fine.  But I came there as a pharmacy major.  My parents thought that if you went into the medical field, or the educational field, that you had a safe, you know, you had a reasonably safe assurance that you were going to get a great job.  Well, you know, I sort of faked them out.  I knew that I wasn't interested in pharmacy, but I didn't know what I wanted to do.  So, I told them I was going to major in pharmacy.  My sister before me had gone to Texas Woman's University, an all-white institution in Denton, Texas near Dallas [Texas].  So after, you know, after that, I said, oh, I'll major in pharmacy.  That sounds good.  That got you out of the house, right?  But as soon as I found out that Barbara Jordan had just come out of [U.S.] Congress, and had been appointed as ethics professor at the LBJ School of Public Affairs [Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], I changed my major my second semester of my freshman year to government, and never looked back, never looked back.
Story_ID: 284321
Speaker 1: Okay well, tell us about meeting Barbara Jordan.
Speaker 2: You know, it's just pretty interesting.  It, it's just something.  By that time, she had become larger than life, you know--the, the whole Watergate proceedings, and all of that.  And her role in that, she was just larger than life back then.  She was certainly not the person that had been referenced that she came with her uncle to your home church in Pledger, Texas.  So, to go over there, to apply for an internship, and to find out that you were going to be a door down from her was just almost too much to believe.  And then to get an opportunity to meet her, and I think I spent most of my time in her presence being so in awe.  I think I could have taken a lot more from her (laughter) had I not been so in awe every day because, really, when, when you talk about integrity, when you talk about presence, and it was almost as if she was trying to be intimidating, but just in your mind, you knew this, this is history, you know, that you're in front of.  And you're small potatoes, and she's talking to you.  And I don't think I translated that, that made me pretty special also that she would take time to pour into me, and to talk to me, and to mentor me in the time that she had because everybody was vying, you know, for an audience with Barbara Jordan.  And at nineteen, God, do you really grasp, you know, the, the importance of that?  But certainly as time went on, settle down a little bit, and begin to learn that which she was laying down, as the kids would say.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the most valuable, what were some of the most valuable lessons that you learned from Barbara Jordan?
Speaker 2: I, I think we can talk about integrity.  When, when it talks, you know, when you think about her being a professor of ethics, that, that really was, that really was innate for her, I believe.  And, and I'm sure she got it growing up, and I'm sure she learned it as she came up through the ranks of Texas Senate, and the U.S. Congress and what have you.  But that was just a part of who she was, and so she was always talking about being true to yourself, making sure that you couldn't be purchased by anybody, to always make sure you knew who you were, and not waiting on someone to give you an identity or to validate you.  And I think so many times, people in politics had a tendency to put on a persona for the public, and then had a private, another private persona.  And I think the one thing that she instilled in those who came close enough to her was that to always make sure that you could remain the same, whether you were in public or in private, and that which you were willing to say--I think she, she would always say, you know, never say anything in private that you aren't willing to say in public.  You have to always be willing to go on the record.  And that which you aren't willing to go on the record or don't say.  Wow, and, you know, [President] Richard [Milhous] Nixon probably could have used that, that lesson (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Earl Butz, remember his comments on the plane and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --even [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson got in trouble saying--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --something in private that he--
Speaker 2: --sure.
Speaker 1: --he wouldn't have said in public.
Speaker 2: --sure.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: I think she said there really isn't a private sphere.  Everything is public.  Anything can be repeated.  It's not a matter of that you trust someone.  Can you trust yourself?  It--
Speaker 1: Well, you know, the whole idea of a private life being separate from public life, you know, it's something that started to break down during the--I guess, the late, latter '60s [1960s], back in the day when Kennedy was, John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was president.  I mean, he had a private life, was completely separate from his public life--
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: --and reporters knew about it, but wouldn't touch it.
Speaker 2: Right, absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: By this time, things changed, right?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Well, and we live in a time now where people are really more interested in your private life than they're interested in the public office that you've been called to.  It's like, you may have passed a great bill in Congress one day, but, you know, that may get, you know, a couple of words in print.  But what you did last night, you know, at the bar you went to, or at your home, or what have you, is the fodder for, you know, the news story.  And that's just amazing to me because I think a lot of good things get pushed to the side because people are so obsessed with knowing who you really are.
Story_ID: 284322
Speaker 1: And I think, of course, when it comes to politics, when it comes to ministry, I took the Barbara Jordan ethic with me.  When it, when it came to politics, I wouldn't let anybody buy me anything.  I wouldn't let anybody buy me a hamburger.  People just thought, you know, I was just really silly.  And so, "Well, C.J. [HistoryMaker Reverend Constance Jackson], you're taking it, you know, too far," and I went, "You know what, but I never want you to be able to say that you bought me anything because it wouldn't be a hamburger that you would say you bought me."  And, and I just think, I, I think I carried that from, from her teachings.  And I, I don't regret that.  And in ministry, I don't want people to have to wonder whether or not that's really me in that pulpit.  I want them to know that any time you catch me, this is who I'm going to be.  This is what I'm going to say.  This is what I'm going to do, that I'm not a person who has situational ethics.  And I think that's lost a lot on today's politicians and today's ministers that they think my private life is none of the public's business, so I actually be two different people, or three different people.  And I think that's hurt, or that's caused politicians and ministers to lose the respect that used to be--gosh, so very widespread.  And in the earlier years, you know, there used to be a time when the minister passed by, the person who had a beer bottle, you know, in their hand with, you know, hide it behind their back now.  And now, they'll take a swig, and say, "Hey, Rev., how are you doing?"  But I think it's because, by and large, we've lost the ability.  I don't think we've lost the ability--I think now we've, we've changed our ethics for some pie in the sky, I think, thinking that we can be a movie star and a minister at the same time or, or dibble and dabble in what we would call worldly things, and be holy at the same time.  And I just think--my mentor would say, you can't do it.
Story_ID: 284323
Speaker 1: Now, that era there, you were in school [at University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] when you met Barbara Jordan at the time when, as I recall, quite a few reverends, big name reverends or popular reverends, like--oh, I'm trying to think of the reverend from Louisiana that, who was caught with a prostitute and, you know, and he was a big TV reverend.
Speaker 2: Swaggart?
Speaker 1: Jimmy Swaggart, right, Jimmy Swaggart, and Billy--
Speaker 2: And Jim Bakker.
Speaker 1: And Jim Bakker.
Speaker 2: --yeah, during that time, sure.
Speaker 1: Billy--I think, Ray Hargis [sic. Billy James Hargis] or what, in Tulsa, [Oklahoma] was caught with something bad.  I mean, a lot of people were, you know, a lot of them were caught doing things that were antithetical in what they were preaching.  And has it--do you think it's a door that swings both ways in the way that people are not ashamed to drink a beer in front of the reverend 'cause they figure, well, is this really wrong or not wrong (laughter), you know, is it really, is it having a beer or something wrong actually or is it something that--
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think, I think '60s [1960s], '70s [1970s], we taught that drinking was, was sinful.  We taught that drinking was a sin.  We, we actually taught that, you know, having an adulterous affair was sin.  And, now, of course, you know, everything that you see in commercials, and soap operas, and every movie, or what have you is infidelity.  Drinking, and not just drinking, more of a drugging. Gosh, and so now, I think the message is do what you want to do--just don't get caught.  So, I, I, I think, I think the Christian message has been overwhelmed by the introduction of so much that's on TV.  When you have not ministers who are being emulated now, but, you know, gangster rappers, and what have you.  So, you know, I just think we've lost our, you know, as the kids would say, our juice, when it comes to the, when it comes to the public.  Oh, I don't think the minister is the, is necessarily the spokesperson for the community any more.  It used to be the time when you wanted to, you know, get the pulse of the black community, you went to the church.  And now, you could almost go to a person who owns a car dealership, or a person who is a, you know, our radio personality, or TV personality, you know, when you take a look at, you know, polls that have been taken as to the impact of Oprah [Winfrey] versus, you know, a minister, or what have you.  You know, we find that, you know, her TV persona really carries more weight than most ministers do.  So, that's, that's been a big shift.  And so, I think, you know, people are now, if Oprah says, it's okay, I really don't need my minister's opinion.  So, yeah, I, I think we've made a giant shift.  And I don't think it's necessarily the fault of the media.  I think, I think we've sort of given in to it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but is it a bad thing, you think or--
Speaker 2: I, I think so, I think so when I look at the condition of our children, when taking a life for them really has no meaning.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's something to say, Oprah wouldn't promote that.
Speaker 2: Well, no, absolutely not.
Speaker 1: She's popular, I think, a different, yeah, in terms of (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, you mean, as far as is that a bad thing that, that Oprah--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that ministers necessarily, are not, necessarily the, you know, the models, you know, so much as someone who preaches, you know--I mean, who may have an ethical point of view, but is not a minister, you know, or--
Speaker 2: Well, well, let's, let's deal with that for a moment because the thing is Oprah's not going to counsel you, she's not going to give you marital counsel (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I don't know now.  On her show, she's--
Speaker 2: --when you get ready to get married.  Well, yeah, I, I know, but when we talk about being local, when we talk about--well, and maybe I'm thinking from, from my upbringing, that the minister is where, you know, you went to for crisis management, or crisis intervention.  So, maybe I'm, maybe I'm thinking back to a time that is no more, but I think that the church has to have a major place in the community.  I, I think when, when Oprah is no longer on, you may say another person, you know, may raise up.  And so, she's replaced by another voice.  But for me, I think the church has to regain its place, but it has to regain it by having integrity.  It has to regain it, not by the glitz and the glamour by the, but by the compassion that it has upon people.  And right now, we're, we're selling a, a wrong message,  You know, we have this sort of--as we talk about prosperity gospel and all of this, sort of naming and claim it, blab it, and grab it kind of thing.  There are people who are just too poor to buy into that kind of thing.  You have folks who come to church and they're hoping, you know, for this miracle.  They send in seven dollars, or if they give seventy dollars in an offering, you know, it's, it's gonna happen for them.  And I, I think that's just the wrong way to go.
Story_ID: 284324
Speaker 1: Tell us a couple of--well, you know, some good Barbara Jordan stories.  I mean, there's got to be a couple that we don't, you know, that we probably--
Speaker 2: Wow, just when we were talking about how you conduct your life and, and I think many people don't realize how very seriously she took life.  We were talking about how men handle political life, how men handle ministry, and how women handle it.  I think you will find that Barbara Jordan carried the weight of her gender, of her race, of the political timeline that she found herself in, being a person with so many firsts.  Whenever she did anything, it was the first time anybody did anything, whether it was addressing, the [1976] Democratic National Convention [New York, New York], or going to [U.S.] Congress, or obtaining a [Texas] Senate seat in Texas, she was always first.  And I think there's a weight that's associated with that.  And maybe it's a self-inflicted weight, but I think it's a weight that's inflicted by your community and by your race because we always want you to do so good.  And you don't have to do good just for you--you have to do good for all of us.  And I think, I think that's--
Speaker 1: Us meaning black people and women, too, I guess, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Us meaning the black, the black race--well, yeah, and women as that time, as more women were coming into the political arena.  So, to carry all of those banners for people, I think, maybe made you a bit more cautious about letting your hair down.  I can remember her saying that you had to make a choice of whether you wanted to be popular and make popular decisions that satisfied, you know, some of the people or the, or the power base, or whether you wanted to sleep well at night.  And so, to start making decisions every day of, of what you were going to do, and how you were going to do it, it would no longer become a choice.  It would become a way of life.  It would become who you were.  And I think, I, I think for her, and I think for myself, for other women who are in high profile careers--the, the stories that we would tell you is that maybe, maybe we don't smile as much.  Maybe we don't cut up as much.  Maybe there isn't a big enough peer group for us to let our hair down and, and really be ourselves because you never know who's expecting you to be this image that they concocted in their minds.  I don't think it's very fair, but I think when you would see those times when you would--the press would capture her laughing, or what have you.  Usually, it was laughing because she had made a very, very smart quip, or told a very amusing anecdote, or what have you.  But I'm not sure if it was just, you know, what we would call belly laughter because I'm not sure if you can, if you can just sort of let your, let, let your hair down like that.  Funny stories, I don't have any.  But probably the more serious ones because, once again, you know, her time was very, very limited.  So, usually, you know, we were down in the business and you're, and you're passing, you know, knowledge or wisdom on, you know, in the times that you have.  Gosh, one of the things that, that I, that I always thought was funny, that she said one of the things to live by--to never be envious of or, or wanting to be like someone else, or wanting to have what someone else had because chances are all the other people wanted to be who you were.  I always thought that was applicable to her, but I sort of didn't think it applied to me.  The other thing she talked about was never say anything, you know, in, in private that, you know, you couldn't say in public.  And we were talking about that before.  And so, I, I think it's those kinds of things that, that really mark the true test of who she was and how, and how she behaved.  And I think maybe she adhered to those particular type lessons, even for herself.  And maybe some people would say too closely, but I would think, among friends and family, I, I think maybe there was, you know, a more jovial Barbara Jordan.  But I think for the public's sake, there was a need to be serious and a need to always be on point.
Story_ID: 284325
Speaker 1: I know we--during the break, we were talking about some of the other black women in public life, and the serious, you know, the serious bearing, I think.  And Shirley Chisholm was certainly a very serious woman, and maybe a little lighter in terms of spirit than Barbara Jordan.
Speaker 2: I'd agree with that.
Speaker 1: But, you know, we talked about Condoleezza Rice even and, you know, [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Height was a very serious presence.  In fact, she, when I interviewed her, she talked about how people used to tell this little girl--why are you so serious, you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: She wouldn't, you know, she was a, she just had a serious kind (unclear) but, you know, yeah, you know, it's certainly possible that women don't get the same break from the public as the men do in public life.  I mean they have to be more serious to stay in it.
Speaker 2: I'll never forget, when Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] came on the '[The] Arsenio Hall Show' with his shades and, and played the saxophone, you would think, wow, is, is this a serious person?  Is this a presidential candidate?  Is this someone who wants to lead, you know, the free world?  I don't think a woman could have gotten away with that.  I really don't.
Speaker 1: I know, I've never seen--in fact, a woman politician on 'Saturday Night Live,' you know, but you see the men activists and elected officials are.
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: Everybody--Mel Sharpe [ph.] and, you know--
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.  There, there is a freedom.  There is, there is leeway.  I think the boundaries are wider for men in, in the public office.  I think men are forgiven more so.  Gosh, you know, I hate to keep going to Clinton, but when he said, "I did not have sex with that woman."  And then, you know, a couple of weeks later, "Okay, well, Bill, we always thought you did, but the fact that you lied on national television (laughter), and then you have to come back."  But, but just the seriousness that, that, that Hillary [Rodham Clinton] stood there and, you know, nodded your head, and what have you, and stand by your man, and all this, but then runs on board for a [U.S.] Senate seat herself.  You, you certainly didn't see her campaign with a kind of freedom and frivolity, I guess, that her husband was allowed to do.  So, I mean, we, we just have--it's, it's a different dynamic.
Speaker 1: Now, is this, you know, a generally held opinion among black women in politics that you really can't mess around, and expect to have a place in public life?  I mean, as far as you know, talking to other women in politics, are they really sort of feeling that that's what the deal is?
Speaker 2: Well, you said black women in politics, I think it's women in politics, period, but then, you also have the matter of privilege.  White women have larger boundaries, greater boundaries.  And, and, I guess, I should say, looser boundaries, and greater freedom than black women do.  And, and I'm speaking from a person who, who was in, you know, political life, for really twenty years, one foreign office holder, and then ten as an office holder.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I, I think, I think we, we say we have to play it pretty close to the vest.  You take, Sheila Jackson Lee out of Houston [Texas].  Really, I, I think she has five clones because she is everywhere because she has a constituency that really expects her to be there.  But she also enjoys being in as many places as she can, but I think you'll see her with the seriousness that I, I think probably the most open and, and looking as if they're having fun is [HistoryMaker] Maxine Waters.  I think Maxine Waters has a great time.  I, I think she's living life on her own terms, and maybe that has to do with her tenure that, that she's been around for a long time and, and her constituency dictates something else.  I mean, when you talk about Watts [Los Angeles, California], and all of that there in California, so, yeah, yeah, I, I think, I think she's having fun.

Speaker 1: Now, let's get you out of the University of Texas [at Austin, Austin, Texas].  Now, you majored in government. You're mentored by (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Majored in government, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Barbara Jordan.  Are there any stories, other stories from the University of Texas that you could tell us?
Speaker 2: Well, the one thing that after two years of attending the University of Texas, I just took off.  Much to the chagrin of my, of my family--I found out at that time, once again, it was about making connections and, and, and being in contact with people, being exposed.  So, I told my folks [Sweetie Crawford Jackson and Lewis B. Jackson, Sr.] I was leaving school.  And I was going to take advantage of this campaign opportunity for the Texas land commissioner who was Garry Mauro at the time.  There was a fundraising.  There was an executive secretary for the fundraiser position at that time.  And some folks at the church, my church that I was going to in Austin [Texas] at the time, they told me about it, 'cause they were trying to get, you know, more black faces involved in the campaigns there around Austin.  And so, gosh, you know, people couldn't believe it, but I, but I kept saying my, my white colleagues during these internships and what have you, and they seemed to understand the game.  Of course, you know, the black story was you go all the way through college, and then you get a great job.  But that's not what I was seeing in government.  I see, you know, government is different.  Majoring in government is not like majoring in pharmacy or majoring in, in, you know, business, or what have you.  You really don't have to go all the way through this thing.  And once you, you know, it, it's about what you know, you know, it's about who you know, and not what you know.  And so, once I got connected into that and start, you know, meeting the movers and shakers, you know, in the Austin, Capitol Hill scene, I went, heck, I don't have to go back to school.  And then, when I found out that most of the senators didn't have college degrees--oh, gee, you know, I, I'm on easy street now.  But there were some things, though, that I never forgot from my training from Barbara Jordan--one, always keep your eye on where you want to go.  So, I never took a job that didn't have anything to do with government.  So, I didn't work at Jack in the Box.  I didn't do fast food or what have you.  And I would pass up stuff that would pay me, you know, good money for a college student, but it would always have to do, always have to deal with politics or government.  From there, from the stint with Garry Mauro, the land commissioner, he was successful.  We raised lots of money.  I went to the Texas Democratic Party and that's a direct result of having worked for Garry Mauro.  I mean, that's just how it works in politics.  You get to know one particular group of people and they lead you to another group of people.
Story_ID: 284327
Speaker 1: Probably the most fascinating story that I have from the land commissioner [Garry Mauro] days--a guy, Ken Meters [ph.] and I were working late one night, and we probably had about six dollars between the two of us.  And there was an Arby's down the street from the campaign office and we went down to Arby's.  We split a burger and put two straws in a chocolate shake 'cause that's all the money we had.  Well, Ken Meters just looked like, you know, a regular guy, you know, who's a decent guy, had on, you know, khakis and, you know, a button-down shirt, you know, polo, what have you, but so did everybody in Austin [Texas].  You know, everybody on the Hill dressed that way.  He was from South Texas, a white gentleman, and we just had a great time, you know, just raising money and, well, I didn't know where Ken went after that.  People saw my work with Garry Mauro, recommended me for the Democratic Party.  I became an elections administrator there, and what have you.  And then about--I guess, a year later, that [President Ronald Wilson] Reagan machine was coming through in '84 [1984], you know, slamming, you know, everything.  And we were just trying to salvage, you know, what few offices that we could there in Texas.  And I get this call, and someone tells me, you know, "Hey, Connie [HistoryMaker Reverend Constance Jackson], a Senator Brooks is on the phone for you."  No way.  Yeah, right.  You know, so I don't even, you know, silly me, I don't even go and pick up the phone.  The folks were always, you know, playing that some big congressional member was on the line, right?  So, the phone rings again.  And they said, "Connie, there's this Senator Brooks on the phone for you."  So, I pick it up, and I went, "Yeah, this is Connie, you know."  And he says, "Connie," you know--had--a very southern gentleman, genteel kind of guy, says, you know, "Connie, this is Senator Chet Brooks.  And I've heard about your work, and I'd like for you to come over and talk to me."  Well, you know, the Democratic Party office was pretty much directly across the street from the [Texas] State Capitol [Austin, Texas].  So, I went, "Well, I really don't have time right now."  You know, once again, I'm still not taking this seriously, you know.  And, and so, you know, I said, "Well, I'll give you a call back tomorrow.  I'll call your secretary and let's set up something, right?"  So, you know, I check him out.  And they said, "This guy is dean of the [Texas] Senate."  I went, yeah, okay, so this guy is dean of the Texas Senate.  What the heck does he want with me, right?  Nobody knows me, you know, I'm here doing my own thing at the Texas Democratic Party, right?  Well, I go over there.  And I'm, I'm trashed out, you know, we're in the middle of an election.  We've been hauling, you know, ballot boxes, and all this kind of stuff, and trying to get everything ready for the upcoming election.  And, you know, I go over, you know, to the Senator's office and, you know, I walk in and I say, "I'm here to see Senator Brooks."  And they said, "Who are you?"  I said, "My name is Connie Jackson.  He called me the other day."  And of course, the people in his office are looking like, "Yeah, right," you know, I see this white sea of faces, right, there's nobody black in there.  And so, finally, somebody else walks through the door.  That's his administrative assistant.  She happened to be African American.  And she says, "Oh, yeah, Connie, we've been expecting you," says, "the senator is inside."  So, he walks me, and you know, once again, you know, I'm still not realizing what's going on here.  God's really trying to bless me, right?  And so, you know, I'm in some old jeans and, you know, probably a party, some kind of political T-shirt with some tennis shoes on.  And so, I'm sitting across from him and he says, "Well, you know, Connie, I've heard about your work.  And I really think you'd be an asset, you know, to my organization over here."  Now, I'm looking at him.  And I'm going, what do you really want with this African American woman, man, you know?  And he says, "Really."  He says, "I, I've heard about your work, and I have a great position open, and I want you to come work for me."  And so, you know, I don't know how it's done, you know.  I just came from Pledger, Texas, you know, I've been at the University of Texas [at Austin, Austin, Texas] for about a year and a half, two years, or what have you.  And I've been exposed to a few things, but I certainly didn't know how it worked on the Hill, right?  So he takes this piece of paper, right?  And he, you know, writes this figure on it and he, you know, shoves it across, you know, the desk from me.  I start passing out.  I'm just laughing, right?  I'm just falling out.  He said, "Well, they tell me, you'd be a tough cookie."  So, he takes the paper back.  He scratches out this figure, and he writes another number on it.  It's even higher than the last one.  And I went, "Okay, are we talking about salary here?"  He said, "Boy, you really are tough."  So, he takes it back, right?  He scratches it out, and he says, "This is the best I can do."  And it's like the Spirit of the Lord says, "Connie Jackson, listen to me now (laughter).  This man is offering you a job, and you're going to make more money than the law allows."  And I went, "I think that'll be okay."  And I am shaking in my boots, right, because I'm thinking, first of all, I've never applied for this job, right?  Secondly, this man has offered me twice now more money.  He's thinking I'm talking about, are you kidding--peanuts for what I'm going to do for you?  I have no clue that he's talking about salary, right?  That's how green I was.
Story_ID: 284328
Speaker 1: He says, "Okay, well, hey, you know, when you get through with the election, you know, just come over, you know, sign the right papers, and all of that," and says, "you'll be working for me from then on."  I walk out of the office.  And there's this sign that says budget officer's nameplate.  On the nameplate it says, Budget Officer, Senator Chet Brooks, Ken Meters [ph.].  The guy I work with, two years before on the Garry Mauro campaign, 'cause he said, he said, the last thing we said after we shared that burger and that, that shake that night, he says, "Connie Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Constance Jackson], I'm going to remember you."  Had no idea he worked for Senator Chet Brooks.  We'd never talked about it, never knew where he was from, but we had kindred spirits.  And when something came open, he says, "There's only one person for this job."  And without an interview, sight unseen, I was hired before I walked in the office.  And it--that, you know, that, that kind of stuff, you know, just doesn't happen.  That's just amazing.  I called my dad [Lewis B. Jackson, Sr.], of course, my dad, you know, at that time, thought, you know, blacks don't work in government.  You can't find a job in government.  They held a family conference when I told them, you know, I was changing my major to government and all this.  I'd lost my mind, you know, somebody had influenced me poorly, you know.  And I told him how much money I was going to be making.  He went, "Ah, it won't last"--I mean, he, just really, it was education or, or medicine, you know, those were the only thing black people could do and, you know, be paid for.  Of course, about three years later, you would have thought I was the governor of Texas, according to my dad, you know, in Pledger [Texas].  You know, if you needed anything, social security--call my baby.  She's running stuff up there in Austin [Texas]--don't worry about it.  Oh, my dad, look, I'm running one office (laughter), and I ain't running the state.  But, yeah, yeah, I think he finally caught it.  I think he got a whole different view of government.  The first time he saw me on TV, you know, doing an interview, or what have you, it was like, this kid tried to tell me.  Of course, I told him, you know, that when I, when I, I left school [at University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], and I changed my major that the Lord was leading me, right?  And, you know, of course, that was like blasphemy to say (laughter), the Lord was leading one of his children to leave school, right?  So, yeah, yeah, life, life is strange and so, always be kind to people because you never know who you're sitting in front of, and when they say, they'll remember you, sometimes people actually do.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that's how I, that's how I got my job with, with Senator Brooks, but, you know, it's about taking a chance and it's who you know.
Speaker 2: That's an incredible story, it is that--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --it is interesting. Now, how long did you work for Senator Brooks and, and when did you actually do, you, you were a--
Speaker 1: I was district chief of staff.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was the only one on staff really for the entire time I was there that had campaign experience and [Texas State] Capitol [Austin, Texas] experience.
Speaker 2: Now, this is 1984, you said?
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-four [1984], yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was, I was, I was twenty-four years old, yeah.  And, first of all, it was unheard of.  There was only two blacks in the [Texas] Senate at the time that had positions like that, and one worked for a Republican.  So, basically, you had two female, women, who occupied the top spot, and one for a Democrat, and one for a Republican.  And the other, you know, let's just, you know, keep talking about how things connect.  When Barbara Jordan left for [U.S.] Congress from the Texas Senate, there was nobody who would pick up her employees, and most of her employees were black.  Guess who hired all of her staff so that they wouldn't leave without a job? Chet Brooks, yeah, yeah.  They were very, very close.  And the interesting thing is she wasn't the one who told him about me, yeah.  So, pretty, pretty weird how, how paths cross, and how things come back around.  But I, I can't tell you that I climbed the ladder and that I was, you know, I, you know, I was making connections, and moving around, and meeting the right people, and what have you.  Sometimes it comes down to half a burger and half a shake, being decent to people and, and not necessarily, you know, looking over people trying to see who looks important.  Sometimes you're sitting with the important people, and you don't know it.
Speaker 2: That's quite a story.
Story_ID: 284329
Speaker 1: How long were you with Senator [Chet] Brooks?
Speaker 2: Ten years, ten years.  I went from Austin [Texas] working for him at the [Texas State] Capitol [Austin, Texas].  We had a very, very tough campaign in 1990.  One of the state reps and his district ran against him.  They felt--trial lawyers felt that he had made a bad decision on tort reform, was the big issue then.  And so, he cast the vote evidently against trial lawyers, and they didn't forgive him.  And they had millions of dollars that they were willing to spend on whatever candidate wanted to run against him.  And one of the representative, state representatives ran against him--a long-time friend of his, both of them big labor guys and what have you, and we couldn't believe it.  I was the only person with campaign experience, so Chet sends me down to Galveston County [Texas].  I don't realize what a hornet's nest it is down there.  I mean, they had, they had told people, you know, that Chet Brooks was this horrible person.  Of course now, a lot of this district, part of that district was majority black.  They had told them, "He had no blacks on staff.  He never had any blacks on staff, right?"  So, there's this NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and AFL-CIO [American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations] meeting that they're holding at this church.  I'll never forget it.  In January 1990, and you know, they were only letting people in.  I mean, the place was packed but, you know, they always said, you know, if you see any of Brooks' people, you know, don't let them in.  Lloyd Criss was the guy that was running against him.  And he, and what's interesting, paths crossing again--Lloyd Criss' daughter and I had both been student ombudsmen at the University of Texas [at Austin, Austin, Texas] together, didn't know our paths would cross campus.  Her father there was running against my boss.  And so, I just came and sat in the back very quietly.  And this political boss--'cause nobody knew me.  Nobody had ever seen me and, besides, Chet Brooks wasn't supposed to have any blacks on staff, right?  So, this guy--never forget, Johnny Henderson, the big, the big labor whip, big NAACP guy, was there just railing, railing against Chet Brooks--how down and dirty he was.  Of course, you know, this guy had been given lots of money by trial lawyers to say whatever, and it was about money.  It didn't matter, you know, who had been on your side for the last twenty-five years.  It was about, it was this--all this money being spread around, and whoever wanted to get in on it, could.  Well, evidently, he decided to take the bait, and he was there railing against my boss.  And the meeting was about, always going on about two hours, and they were about to endorse, endorse Lloyd Criss, my boss' opponent.  And so, you know, Johnny Henderson says, "Is there anybody else who has anything else to say before we take this vote to endorse my good friend, Lloyd Criss for the Senate, District 11?"  I stood up.  I said, "Sir, if I may?"  He said, "Sure, young lady, have your say."  I said, "My name is Connie Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Constance Jackson], and I'm the district chief of staff for State Senator Chet Brooks.  Don't let my looks throw you off--I really am black (laughter)."  And there was such an uproar in that audience.  I said, "I know what you folks have heard today."  I said, "Well, let me tell you what I know about Senator Brooks."  Of course, I'd start with the Barbara Jordan story when she goes from the Senate to Congress.  I said, "Where was Lloyd Criss when Barbara Jordan's staff people needed a job?  And nobody would hire them.  There was one man who said, I'll take them, and not pay bottom wages.  I'll pay them what they were making with Barbara Jordan."  I said, "Where was Lloyd Criss when other blacks needed a job in his office as state rep?"  I said, "We can't find one person, black person, who's ever worked for this man."  He said, "Aw, yeah," he says, "I, I hire black people."  I said, name one.  So, he named a Debbie Berks [ph.].  And I said, Deborah Berk--now paths crossing, Deborah Berks was the ombudsman at the University of Texas who hired his daughter to work as a student ombudsman with me.  I said, "Debbie Berks and her parents are supporting Chet Brooks."  I said, "So at what point did you make an impact on her, whereby her parents wouldn't be supporting you?"  I said, "See, folks," and I think this was my first big speech that I ever made.  I said, "See, folks, there's, there's, there's something wrong here."
Story_ID: 284330
Speaker 1: I said, "This guy [Lloyd Criss] cannot be all he's made to be."  I said, "Well, let me tell you what, what happened in Austin [Texas]."  I said, "Evidently, [Senator] Chet Brooks, you know, cast a vote that pissed a lot of rich people off."  And I said, and they've come down today.  I said, "They aren't here."  I say, "But they have their henchmen here who are going to sell you, you know, some wooden nickels here, and you're supposed to believe that this person has protected your rights that's been on the side of labor," because, you know, it's a big refinery area,  "has been on the side of labor all these years.  And all of a sudden, you're going to believe propaganda against him."  I said, "I am the black person that they said does not exist at the [Texas State] Capitol [Austin, Texas]."  I said, "And I also have another black person that works right here in town."  I said, "But because you guys are so lazy, you won't even go over to the office to see."  I said, "You'd believe whatever anybody tells you."  I said, "I just need you to give me a couple of months to get to know you."  And I said, "And I bet you, you'll be voting for Chet Brooks again."  These people are standing up.  They're clapping, and what have you.  My life was threatened.  It was that much money.  And all, but two black clergy--I'm talking in the whole county [Galveston County, Texs]--all but two black clergy took payoffs.  Everybody was against my boss.  And I went, y'all don't know who they've sent down.  And my friend, Wayne Johnson, who's now deceased, who was the county commissioner, but could not be on either side because he's saying people voted for him, you know, and he was an attorney.  He had come out of that whole aura of trial lawyers and all this, was my Deep Throat because he was able to be in both camps at the same time.  And so, he would call me late at night and tell me what the other side was planning, so I could call our political consultant in Houston [Texas] to counteract it.  And they never could figure out because, you know, certainly not Wayne Johnson.  Ahh, God, those were the days, but, yeah, yeah, my life was threatened.  I, I was told I'd be run out of town.  I stayed at the Holiday Inn on the beach there in Galveston [Texas] for the whole time for, for three months until the election.  There were people who actually watched outside my room because that's how volatile it was, and it wasn't that I was running anything for me, but that's how serious the election was, yeah.
Story_ID: 284331
Speaker 1: Tell us more about Wayne Johnson.  Now, you know, he's now passed, and but he's someone like Mickey Leland, who was another Texas politician that really--black politician that really had an impact beyond the--
Speaker 2: Sure.  Wayne was an assistant attorney general there in Texas, went to the University of Texas [at Austin, Austin, Texas], always just a person who excelled.  Wayne lived really in, in two worlds.  Wayne was this champion of civil rights, rights for black people, Hispanics, or what have you, and both of his wives were white.  And people always asked him, "Wayne, how can you go and raise heck with white people all day, and go home to a white wife?"  Great story about Wayne, great story about Wayne.  He's running for county commissioner for the very first time against a guy by the name of Ron Crowder, a big funeral home owner, there in Galveston County [Texas].  And so, of course, they were playing the race card then because it was his first time.  He comes from Austin [Texas], pretty much like I did, and, you know, it's his hometown La Marque, Texas.  And so, he's running for county commissioner.  He's going to be the first black if he wins since Reconstruction.  And so, they were in this big--once again, most of the political meetings occurred in labor halls, and what have you.  So, they're in this meeting, you know, the Democratic Party is there, labor unions are there, and what have you.  And so, Ron Crowder gets up, and, of course, Wayne could debate, you know, anything, up anytime, anywhere.  You, you just didn't have a chance of winning.  And so, anyway, Ron Crowder, he's desperate and, you know, he gets up and he says, "All right, people, I'm going to put it all on the table here.  I don't know how you can ever vote for this man."  Of course, you know, he was playing to this white crowd, you know.  And so, Wayne is sitting there, wondering what he's gonna, what he's gonna say.  He said, "This man has a white wife."  Wayne stands up--"So do you (laughter)."  Oh, God, that--just neutralized it, you know, if this is gonna be, you know, something that's gonna disqualify me, well, this guy ain't fit for office either 'cause he goes home to a white wife, too, right?  Only Wayne, only Wayne could do that--just quick on his feet.  That, that, that was him.  Any fight--Wayne would think of stuff, Wayne would think of stuff just to mess with people about.  But he was so, so incredibly smart, so incredibly committed to his community.  And, once again, I can tell you, he's the reason why I was successful with, with the Senator [Chet] Brooks' campaign because he allowed me to.
Story_ID: 284332
Speaker 1: Senator [Chet] Brooks won--
Speaker 2: Senator Brooks won.  A long story short (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He won that campaign and--
Speaker 2: --we, we squeaked it out.
Speaker 1: --and so, how were you--now you, your foray into Galveston County [Texas], you know, attracted people to you as a personality, attracted negative attention, but also positive attention, right?
Speaker 2: Sure.  And, and I certainly didn't know that at the time.  I was just really doing what it took to, you know, have my boss win this election.  Once again, it was also my job that I would say anything along with jobs of others, but I really believed, I believed in Chet Brooks.  And I believed in the work I, you know, I worked with him side by side.  I saw the bills that he worked on, and passed that were not popular.  So, I, I believed the district needed this man.  The one thing that I kept hearing from those, from those folks who dared to go against their ministers, who dared to go against the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and support, openly support me, and, and Senator Brooks.  They kept saying, we know you're going to leave because when I came from Austin [Texas], I went off payroll, and came down to campaign.  That's how we had to do it.  And I went--no, we're going to open up a district office.  I told Chet after the election--I'm like, "Look, man," I said, "it's not enough to just have, you know," we call it the island and the mainland.  Galveston Island [Texas], of course, we had an office there, but on the mainland, Texas City [Texas], La Marque [Texas], Hitchcock [Texas], Dickinson [Texas]--all of that did not have a senatorial presence.  I said, "Chet, you need to open up an office in Texas City."  That's the biggest city on the mainland.  So, he said, "Okay, let's do it."  I mean, at that point, anything I suggested went, you know.  I was, I was the stuff in his eyes because he, he just didn't have a clue.  But, of course, it was, it was God working through all of that--can't take any credit.  Wayne [Johnson] probably would (laughter).  "I am God," Wayne would say.  So, we opened up a district office.  And I was really supposed to be there for two weeks, hire somebody, and leave, you know.  I handled the lease, and all of that, got all that done, and I got furniture in, and all of that.  And it was like, you know, everybody I interviewed wanted the job, but just to say they worked for Chet Brooks.  They really weren't qualified, and I want you to know we really do, after this hard-, you know, fought election, we really didn't need to put a person of quality there.  Wayne Johnson, again, but I didn't know that he had been going back and forth to Austin talking to Chet and say, "You know, the person you need to put down there in that district office is Connie Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Constance Jackson]."  Well, you know, I told Chet, I said, "Well, it really isn't going well.  I could hire some administrative support, but your main person who needs to be down there," I said, "I just haven't found anybody."  Well, unbeknownst to me, I go back to my regular job, you know, we have administrative support down there.  But we really don't have a person to do constituent case work, and all of that.  I go back to the office, and Chet says, "You know, you know, Connie, come into my office for a minute."  And I noticed, you know, Wayne's in there, and I went, something is not right.  And I look at Wayne and I went, "Wayne, what have you done?"  He says, "What, what do you mean, what have I done?"  I said, "You're always doing something, so what have you done?"  Chet says, "Well, you know, we've been talking and, and, and Wayne says"--I went, "Wayne says?"  And by that time, I knew the fix was in.  "Well, Wayne says that, that he believes that you're really, you know, the person to go down there and, and run the district office."  We had a Pasadena [Texas] office, Galveston office, Texas City office.  "I want you to run that whole thing down there and keep it altogether."  I went, "No, my life is here.  I've been here twelve years.  All my friends are here.  My church is here."  I was choir director, you know, at this huge church.  "Are you crazy?"  I said, "I've been down to Texas City, and I ain't trying to move down there."  I said, "The people are nice and all, but no."  Well, you know, I was even closer to my parents [Sweetie Crawford Jackson and Lewis B. Jackson, Sr.], you know.  Of course, it took me about four hours to get to my parents from Austin, but I didn't want any of that.  It was about me at that point, you know, I was already making more money.  And so, Chet does his thing.  It's reminiscent of what he had done, like seven years before then.  He takes out his little slip of paper, you know, and hands it over to me.  I'm like, "That ain't enough to get me to move, Chet," right?  He scratches it out.  Wayne, he said, "Connie," he says, "just think, you and I'll be down there together.  Can you think how much hell we can raise down there together and all?" "Wayne, I'm not interested in raising hell."  I said, "I want my friends and I want my church life here."  I said, "This is where I belong."  Chet scratches to something else out.  I said, "You need to go get a budget officer or something 'cause you don't have enough money, you don't have enough numbers to write down on that piece of paper to get me to move to Texas City."  Chet says, "Connie, I really need you down there."  I said, "I'll tell you what.  I'll go down there for a little bit," and I said, "and it's not gonna work out," but I said, "I'm gonna find somebody, right, to work."
Story_ID: 284333
Speaker 1: Well, I go down there [Texas City, Texas].  We have a big, you know, district office opening [for Senator Chet Brooks], and all this kind of stuff, and people come, of course, you know.  So many of the black people come.  And they says, "You cannot leave us."  And it wasn't for the money, but it was for the look in those people's eyes that says, we really need you down there.  And I felt so horrible because I'd never felt that kind of tug or that kind of pull before, you know.  And then, you know, I understood then a little bit what Barbara Jordan was talking about--when, when you're responsible for people, and when you represent, you know, people.  They say, "You came down, and you literally put your life on the line, you know, for those of us who didn't believe, you know, in the shenanigans that were going on.  And we had somebody that we could sort of believe in.  So, what, why wouldn't you?"  And I was trying to tell them about my life in Austin [Texas], and all this kind of stuff.  Aww, but that was not, that was really not my decision.  I, I still believe that was a God decision.  I would find out--gosh, I can still remember the date when I moved down here, May 12, 1990--if that tells you anything that's crazy--moved down there.  And it would be three months later that I found out my father [Lewis B. Jackson, Sr.] was terminal with cancer.  And so, I just thought, okay, yeah, that would have really killed me to have to travel back and forth.  So, I was able to go home every weekend 'cause I was close enough.  I was, you know, literally forty-five minutes, you know, fifty minutes away, instead of being four hours away.  And so, that was--and then I lost dad in, in '91 [1991], almost a year later after, after moving down there.
Story_ID: 284334
Speaker 1: And it's going, you know, it was going well--the whole district office piece and, and what have you.  I was getting settled into it.  And then, one day, you know, about five guys from this labor union, you know, these same people that had fought me--well, not fought me, but fought my boss [Senator Chet Brooks] two years earlier, you know, in this campaign, said, "We'd like for you to run for office, and we think you could win."  And I just thought they were crazy 'cause I had sworn to myself that I would never run for office 'cause I saw what officeholders went through.  And I certainly never wanted to be that beholden to the people.  So, I said, "You know, I'll work for an officeholder, but I don't want to be one."  They kept talking to me, kept talking to me, and I talked with the senator.  He said, "Oh, yeah, it'll be fun."  Of course, Wayne [Wayne Johnson] was out of his mind, you know, by saying--he says, "Do you know the hell we can raise, you know?"  And I went, "Wayne--," he says, "Oh, yeah, you'll going to have to raise some hell if you get on council."  He said, "You're going to be the only woman, too."  I went, "Wayne, I'm not interested in making history.  I'm not interested in raising hell," right?  Well, following deadline day, 1992, in April, I called my mom [Sweetie Jackson Crawford].  I believe my mom has breakfast with God every morning.  This is how spiritual I believe my mom is.  And I believe, you know, Mom, you know, Mom can, you know, go up to Heaven, or God can come down to earth and talk to my mom, and she has an instant answer, instant answer.  So, I call her, it was that morning.  I said, "Mom," I said, "you know, I, you know, I've told you some people have approached me, you know, about running for office."  And she says, "Yeah, baby, I know."  I said, "Well, mom, I need you to pray and, you know, talk to the Lord," I said, "'cause I need an answer."  I said, "I really don't know what to do.  I really don't want to do this, but if you tell me that the Lord says yes, then I'll go down there and file."  It's about 4:40 p.m. on filing deadline day--the last day that you can file for a place on the ballot.  And I call my mom.  I went, "Mom, have you been praying?  Did you talk to the Lord?"  And she said, "Well, yeah, baby."  I said, "Well, what did He say?"  She said, "I told Him to talk to you" (laughter).  Y- I, I was so frustrated, and I still can't tell you.  I don't know if it was a lapse of sanity or, or what it was, but I still don't remember going down to city hall, and filling out the papers.  All I know is that I did.
Story_ID: 284335
Speaker 1: And what was interesting--it, you know, paths crossing.  I, I guess maybe that's the theme of this particular interview.  When people found out that I was running against a fourteen-year incumbent, an African American male, who had taught at the black school there.  He was now teaching at the college there, and what have you.  Of course, everybody said I was nuts.  And I went, "Well, I don't get in anything to lose, so I don't know how this thing is going to play out, but I know, you know, that at the end, we have to be victorious." Well, I couldn't find anybody except for those folks who came to ask me to run, that, that wanted to support me.  And a few folks, you know, who said, well, yeah, but you know, once against, the power base--small town politics.  The mayor was a banker, you know, had the mortgage to everybody's house, everybody's business, or what have you, banks all over the county.  So, I mean, you know, lock, stock, and barrel, he had the influence.  Oh, God, they called me some of everything.  In fact, people still call me after all of this time that woman from Austin [Texas].  You know, that just messed up everything.  But what was interesting, talking about paths crossing, word got out as I started putting out my campaign literature, and what have you.  Of course, you know, I, I had our Houston [Texas] consultants that we had used for, you know, Chet's [Senator Chet Brooks] campaign, you know, do mine.  You're not seeing anything like that in a little, you know, city council race.  We did the slick thing and did professional pictures and all that.  It started getting out that I was from Pledger, Texas, right?  Well, a lot of the people who had come from Pledger a long time ago to work at the refineries, 'cause that's where the money was--well, my father [Lewis B. Jackson, Sr.] had taught them.  So, here were a lot of his former students in this same town where I am now who would be my constituency, and they said, "That's Professor Jackson's daughter."  And I went, "You know my dad?"  Say, "Yeah, your daddy taught me."  He said, "And you're Professor Jackson's daughter, we're going to vote for you, and I'm going to tell everybody else to vote for you."  Well, and it just started this thing.  All of a sudden, people were talking about me in barbershops and beauty shops, and all this kind of stuff, 'cause they were saying, "Well, who's this woman who thinks she can come in, you know, and take one of our seats?"  Now, mind you, a guy had been sitting there for fourteen years doing absolutely nothing for them.  And when they came to council, he would just berate them, right?  I mean, he really had forgotten, he really had forgotten.  And so, you know, this momentum, you know, gets going, and these old church ladies--they had to be the average age of seventy.  All they had to do all day was get on the phone.  Wayne Johnson, once again--this is the major political that he was--had a phone bank built into his house, right, he had like twenty lines.  I'm telling, there is nobody else like this guy.  You, you got to do something on him--had a phone bank and so, these church ladies came to his house, and we activated all the phones.  And they called all day doing polls about Connie Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Constance Jackson] and if, you know, and after a while, of course, we did the spiel, "Would you vote for Connie Jackson?"  But, at first, you know, it's it, where I was from, of course, the Barbara Jordan thing rang with everybody because, oh, yeah, they know Barbara Jordan, of course, as we, you know, start going around, you know, whether I sounded like her.  And, "Oh, yeah, she sounds like her, too," you know, so, you know, gaw, you know, our culture is, it's, it's just wonderful.  So, you know, momentum started and, all of a sudden, you know, people downtown were getting a little nervous 'cause their boy was looking like he was going to lose, right?  Oh, God, it was, it was crazy.  I walked every street in the district.  I did it the old-fashioned way.  I literally walked every street, and it was a pretty big district.  There were--the town is about fifty thousand people.  I had fifteen thousand people in the district that I would occupy.  I knocked on every house, and I walked every street, and I shook hands with both, that I knew did not like me and did not like my skin.  In fact, this one man just came out, and called me a nigger.  He says, "Well, ma'am, I ain't got nothin' against you, you know, and all, but I just think we like the nigger we had in there already."  And I went, "I like you, I think you're honest, I appreciate you, but I said, I'll be back"--labor guy.  I visited him a month later, said, "Mr. Steve, I need you to work on my campaign.  I know you're an influential man on your street in this particular neighborhood." And I said, "But I need you to stop using one word."  He said, "What is that?"  I went, "Y'all."  He went, "Okay, I know the word you're talking about--it ain't y'all, is it?"  I went, "No, it's not, but you can stop using that word, too."  This man became the biggest supporter of--I mean, you could not--he was out there in the rain holding up my sign on election day because God had done something with his heart.  It was not any campaign literature he had read, but when I came back that second time, and just so, I need you to stop using a word for me, but I didn't name the word--named something else--it was as if something just caught him.  And this man, to this day, will say, I'm his commissioner.  And that's what they call us down in Texas.  They call us commissioners 'cause we have the commission form of government.
Story_ID: 284336
Speaker 1: It's stories like that, you know, that make me believe that, you know, people are still basically good.  You know, I hear Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] say that all the time, that he believes people are basically good.  I didn't think that until I saw that man's face that day.  Well, long story shorter, longer story, maybe shorter, we won May 2, 1992, by 66 percent of the vote--beat out a fourteen-year incumbent.  And I represented hope for people, I, I know that first election was more about getting this person out than putting me in.  But I think I represented and that hope for them, this was a district that was, that was in trouble.  They had a--and it was interesting.  I had an affluent white area.  I had an affluent black area, and then I sort of had a, this hodge-podge of some of everything, you know, poverty, and all of that.  And, and it wasn't a majority black district, interestingly enough, it was literally half and half, so you would think, you know. (Sigh) People want, people want their needs represented.  And, and I think that transcends black and white and Hispanic, and all of that.  And I think I represented for people as I campaigned.  They said, "You're the first person that's ever come to my house to ask for my vote."  I think I got a lot of votes just because I did that, because people really don't mind answering their door to say you matter to me.  And I want to see, who it is I'm going to be representing.  I think I got more votes from that than anything 'cause they figured, heck, I work for [Senator] Chet Brooks.  You know, they figure maybe, you know, I'd use his name and I didn't.  I really wanted to win on my own accord.  And that was just the beginning of, of some fun times and great things that we would do there in Texas City [Texas].  There was a park, Carver Park, named after George Washington Carver--grass, they would, it's a city park, mind you, in the middle of a black neighborhood.  Park Avenue was what the street was on, if you can believe that.  In the middle, surrounded by an entirely black neighborhood, donated by blacks, for blacks, twenty acres with a pond in the middle.  There was a young man out there by the name of Donald Singleton [ph.] who had about six hundred kids and a softball program.  No support, once again, people sold drugs on the corner--I mean, and wide open.  You know, because they were all neighborhood folks, they were selling the drugs--grandsons of people, you know, who live, you know, in that, in that block.  (Sigh) He was a school teacher, and he just said something has to be done.  And he had all of these kids who couldn't afford uniforms, who couldn't even afford bats and balls.  They would always say, this is RBI [Recycled Baseball Items Foundation].  And I, and I think it was, like used baseball equipment that this company in Houston [Texas] would sort of refurbish, and send it down to, you know, places like Texas City that were trying to do something in the, in the neighborhood.   He said, "Ms. Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Constance Jackson], I need somebody to help me."  And I went, "Well, I'm not sure what I can do.  I don't know anything about baseball," thought maybe he wanted me to come out and coach or something. He said, "But that was much bigger than, than baseball."  He said, "This whole community has lost hope."  There were old junk cars, there were old junk cars piled up--sofas, commodes, just piled along the street, but they, you know, what people would put out, you know.  And it had been there for years.  City wouldn't pick it up, wouldn't service it, wouldn't do anything.  The first thing I said, "I need to be able to see what I represent.  And I can't see it with all of these," and I won't tell you the expletive that I used--"junk cars, toilets, and couches that line the street."  People couldn't even park on the side of the street.  People couldn't even drive into their yards for the junk.  I went down to the city and yelled, in Wayne Johnson fashion, I raised some hell.  And I said, "I need about five trucks, five of our major trash trucks.  And these are the streets, and we're going to pick up this expletive trash for free, not going to charge anybody."  Well, you know, I was from Austin [Texas], so I had on my ostrich skin boots, you know, and my pressed, you know, jeans, and my, you know, buttoned-down polo, you know, long-sleeved shirt, and I'm walking the streets, right?  Well, I thought people would be happy.  But, instead, I think these people actually wanted to recall me.  "That's my junk car--if I want to keep it in my yard, I will."  "Well, I'm sorry, sir, sorry, ma'am, we're picking up these cars, or we can fine you," I said, "but we're going to fine you, and we're going to pick up these junk cars."  I got the record service to pick up junk cars for free to haul them away to the dump.  It took me a year just to get the trash.  This is not my entire district, mind you, this is just a portion of my district--took me about a year just to do cleanup, couldn't do anything else, just the cleanup.  And all of a sudden, though, people began to see a neighborhood that used to be there--minus the junk.  I said, if you guys can just help me just keep the trash down, I said, maybe I can pave your streets.  There were potholes all over the place.  There had been streets that hadn't been paved over in, like thirty, thirty-five years.  And, mind you, they had a black representative, right, but he was no longer a part of them.  Probably in my second year, we paved ten streets that hadn't been paved in some thirty to thirty-five years.
Story_ID: 284337
Speaker 1: It was slow going.  I was used to, you know, picking up the phone in the name of Senator Chet Brooks, and getting things, you know, getting things done.  It didn't happen that way for me on council [in Texas City, Texas] because it was about educating the people that they should expect more from their city government, but hope had left the community.  These people felt as if we don't care anything about ourselves, and nobody else cares anything about us.  And our kids, once again, they remind me of, of Pledger [Texas].  Our, our kids are going to fall into the same cycle when--not on my watch, it ain't happening.  And so, we began with the cleanup of neighborhoods, and then we went back to Carver Park [Texas City, Texas].  And I saw these kids trying to raise money for just gloves and bats and balls.  And they had this eight-foot table, and they were selling pickles out of a jar and, and candy, you know, and little homemade cookies, and what have you.  I said, this won't do, and I went and looked at the other city parks on the other side of town, had wonderful concession facilities, and restroom facilities and lights out there, and what have you.  Grass was neatly mowed, had the wonderful mound, the red mound dirt, and all of this, right?   (Sigh) I went--this is a city park?  Carver Park is a city park?  And it doesn't look like the other parks on the other side of town?  I went, help me, so I took a group of folks, loaded them up on a bus, and just gave them a tour of the other side of town.  And I went, "You pay taxes, right?"  I said, "Well, guess where your tax dollars are going."  I said, "You have a wonderful park, you know, a baseball field, you know, fenced in, you know, like these other parks.  Why doesn't yours look this way?"  Well, and then I had Wayne Johnson 'cause he was, you know, a big friend of the media, had him call his buddies down at the newspaper.  This pond I was telling you about, the algae had grown over so bad.  It really looked like a sewer, you know, if, you know, what sewage looks like, you know, in a ditch--well, that's what it looked like.  And can you imagine like, an acre pond covered with all of that?  The city told me, 'cause once again, they said, "Okay, she's won, but now we're just going to render her ineffective, right?"  They said they didn't have anything to clean the pond out with.  Well, I went to Walmart, and I got some pool cleaning equipment.  And I called the newspapers--said, Wayne, have them bring a camera and a reporter down here and have them ask the question, "Why is our commissioner cleaning out a city pond with pool cleaning equipment from Walmart?"  The very next day, they had boats and cleaners and drenchers, and all this other kind of stuff.  And, and that was really the beginning of it.  It really was, it really was a radical move because it was like what do we do?  It's not about talking nicely.  It's not about saying, please and thank you.  These folks really don't understand that I ain't got nothing to lose in this town--no friends, no family, no house, no car, you know.  I'm not mortgaged up to my ears with this man [ mayor of Texas City, Texas].  And I was the only female on council.  And the other part was, I had a black guy on council who, phew, who had just sold out.  I, I'm just going to say it--who had just sold out, so there were two at the time.
Speaker 2: Out of, out of how many council members?
Speaker 1: Seven, seven--
Speaker 2: Seven--
Speaker 1: --including the mayor.  So, we had six, six, commissioners, and a mayor.  But we all had the same vote.  So, yeah, yeah, it, it was tough.  They were, they were going to show this little woman, you know, that she was not going to get anything done, that she was not going to keep any of these promises that she had made.  And it was just really a move of God that things started happening because everybody hates bad press.
Story_ID: 284385
Speaker 1: Now, so you're making some progress here?
Speaker 2: Making some progress, making some people mad (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where are we now in terms of years and--
Speaker 2: We're at about '95 [1995]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we're at about '95 [1995].  Then I decided--I said, well, it's something, it's time to do something to bring the community together.  When I was growing up in Pledger [Texas], there was this family, the Plummer family.  In fact, the first black businessman, that I ever knew, he was, he was a barber called--we called him Mr. Toupee, but his name was I.P. Plummer.  And I don't know where the Toupee came from.  Anyway, he was a great barber, a bald man, mind you, but there, you know, cut everybody's hair in town.  They had this big Juneteenth celebration when all of their family came in town. And, gaw, that was just the best time for the entire town 'cause all the blacks would come to the Plummers, and enjoy barbecue and watermelon, and all that.  And so, you know, I asked them because that was a part of, you know, of my growing up.  I said, "What do you guys do around here for Juneteenth?"  And they said, "We don't do anything for Juneteenth."  Well, by that time, we had gotten the city to start cutting, you know, the grass on a regular basis, and what have you, and it gained some other friends, you know, on council.  And I said, "I'm going to have a Juneteenth celebration."  And they went, "You're going to have a what?"  You know, because it was almost as if, if you were of any stature or what have you, you did as little black things as you could.  You know, you try to do mainstream stuff and not--I said, "Well, you guys, as quiet as it's kept, I am Negroid (laughter)."  And they would just say, "Aw, well, you can't."  I went, you guys--well, Juneteenth was a part of my growing up.  And I said, and I'm going to bring it to Texas City [Texas].  Well, our very first year, you know, gosh, it was just small potatoes, maybe three hundred people came 'cause they really didn't, you know, understand.  Galveston [Texas] always had a big Juneteenth.  Of course, you know, Juneteenth was where, Galveston was where Juneteenth started, of course, with General Gordon Granger, and what have you.  So, Galveston always had it, but I couldn't figure why the mainland never had anything.  And so, I invited some of my musical friends down from Austin [Texas], and what have you, and we just had a great time.  My brother [Lewis B. Jackson, Jr.] came and played, and we formed a little choir from some of the community churches, and what have you.  The third year, got some folks to donate some money, and we had a little bigger celebration.  By the third year, you know, I'm kicking in, you know, I'm, I'm thinking Austin again, I'm thinking [Texas State] Senate [Austin, Texas], you know, again, we're not thinking small potatoes.  So, I approach Anheuser-Busch for funding.  Well, Anheuser-Busch says, "Well, yeah, we'll give you quite a bit of money, but we want to be able to, you know, sell beer, or at least give it away out in the park."  I said, "It's a family day, and we're not serving beer."  I said, "I know how people get in the summertime," and I said, and, "we are an alcohol-free celebration."  It's a family celebration.  A big gospel fest was planned with Dorothy Norwood coming in, and what have you, and we just, you know, it was just great.  We had booths, you know, because our whole thing was entrepreneurship, empowerment, and all of this, right?  So, I left Anheuser-Busch.  And Elvin Bethea, you know, we talked about him earlier.  Elvin Bethea was sort of the community events person and so, he was the person in charge.  He said, you know, "Ms. Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Constance Jackson], they aren't going to give you any money unless, you know, we can put our, you know, inflated, you know, beer can, you know, out there, and what have you, and, you know, have a booth for beer and all that."  I said, "Mr. Bethea," I said, "I respect you, and you play great ball, but I said, I ain't serving beer at my Juneteenth celebration."  We were expecting, at that time, you know--once again, we had gone up from like two hundred, you know, to about fifteen hundred.  But this year, bringing in a major, you know, national gospel recording artist, you know, we expected at least ten thousand people, right?  They had offered us like, thirty thousand dollars--Anheuser-Busch did.  And Elvin Bethea says, "Well, Connie, you know, if you'll just come back in, you know, let's talk again, and maybe we can compromise."  Of course, you know, they had the check waiting for me.  And [Senator] Chet Brooks had, you know, just taught me so well about handing stuff across the table, right?  And so, anyway, the chairman of the committee, and Elvin Bethea was in there.  And so, they slide this check, you know, across the table, and there's thirty thousand dollars made out to the Carver Park Juneteenth Committee.  And, you know, I was just supposed to be out of my mind, you know, on that.  I take the check, and I rip it in half.  I said, "I ain't selling beer at my family celebration.  It just ain't that kind of party."  Elvin just looked as if he was just so devastated.  He's like, "Do you realize what you just did--says, you just, you know, thumbed your nose at Anheuser-Busch."  I went, "I didn't have anything to lose.  I didn't expect you guys to give me money anyway."  And I said, "But I'm sorry, I'm just not like these other bright out of Polk [County, Texas]who compromise, you know, their principles, and especially their community by having--." I say, "They can buy beer anywhere else, but they won't be able to buy it at my celebration."  Elvin calls me two days later.  He says, "You're not going to believe this."  He says, "But my chairman says, anybody who has the nerve to come in here, and tear up my blankety-blank check, I'm gonna give them fifty thousand dollars, and we don't have to sell beer."

Speaker 1: Well, we were in business.  We put on the biggest Juneteenth celebration.  And, of course, we had, you know, Juneteenth car park, Juneteenth celebration, proud sponsor, Anheuser-Busch, right?  And everybody's wondering, where's the beer, where's the beer?  I had hired my newly elected first black constable and his team to put anybody in jail if they even crack open a can of beer, right?  It was an incredible time.  People figured out that thousands of black people could come together.  Nobody got shot.  Nobody got stabbed.  We had an incredible day.  In fact, the Carnival organization heard about us and, and volunteered to come, of course, you know, they're going to make loads of money.  And that's really what put us on the map.  Of course, you probably heard of Al Edwards [HistoryMaker Albert Edwards] and his Juneteenth celebration.  He's the guy who sponsored the Juneteenth bill in the Texas State Legislature that made Juneteenth an official holiday in Texas.  And so, all of a sudden, all of these politicians are wanting to come through there 'cause, you know, after all, there's an election in November.  And that particular year, Carver Park Juneteenth Festival was the place to be 'cause you had these thousands of people in one place.  Well, you know, we, you know, we, we had to turn down some money after a while.  It's like, folks, it just didn't cost as much to put on.  And so, we start funneling the money to the Carver Park softball association, and that's when I, you know, devised a plan that I wanted scoreboards out there.  And I wanted press boxes, and I wanted a concession, restroom facility.  And that's where that idea was born because people--kids had to come from the ball field, and walk all the way to the pavilion just to use the restroom.  And when people saw the plans, they were so elaborate in their minds, right, but it was just what was on the other side of town [Texas City, Texas].  Well, now, I won't say that.  It was probably a little bit more elaborate than what was on the other side of town.
Story_ID: 284387
Speaker 1: But when they saw the plans, most folks' homes didn't cost that much in that area.  And they could not see us building anything like that, that we were just going to give to the city.  I went, "Folks, the city doesn't care about this park [Carver Park, Texas City, Texas].  I said it's as beautiful as it is now--it's because, you know, you put your sweat and tears in it."  And I said, "And we've made it great, and I said, and we've held people accountable here in this city."  I said, "Your tax dollars--," I said, now, I said, "The fair thing is each softball association, you know, pretty much has to pay for their own concession facilities, and all of that."  But most of them, you know, had bank sponsorship or, you know, business sponsorship.  Well, there aren't any black businesses, you know, or any businesses on that side of town that's going to donate that kind of money.  But then, there is a refinery that was trying to get a tax rebate, ad valorem tax, a discount.  They came to me and said, "We'd like to help your organization.  We, we know what you're trying to do out there, and you have a lot of kids and, you know, somebody has told us about the pretty elaborate plans you have."  I said, "Not for my vote, though."  I said, "So if you're still willing to give this money after I cast my vote against you"--I said, "because I, I think what, what's happening now is that our tax base is eroding."  And I said, "If we can give you abatement for the new, you know, things that you're bringing online at your plan, I said it just takes more money out of their coffers."  So, I said, "I really don't support tax abatement."  So, this guy calls me back, and this is the night before the vote.  I said, "Sir, my vote's not for sale."  I said, "Either you're doing this for the kids, or you're not."  I said, "And that's as clear as I can be," and I knew I was a swing vote.  I knew I was because, you know, we had half a council, you know, for it.  And the other half, you know, the half that was for it, of course, that, taken whatever, you know, and the other half which was against it, like I was.  And I knew I was the swing vote.  I said, "I'll tell you what.  There may be a compromise that we can strike."  He's like, "What's that?"  And I wanted--, "Well, in three years, according to your plan, you're gonna wanna add on, you know, another piece of the plant."  I said, "Maybe by then, I can see my way clear."  I said, "If you do your pollution controls, and all of that as the state, you know, has mandated instead of trying to get out of that, too," 'cause I said, "I understand you're trying to get out of that, too."  I said, "Maybe if you do that," I said, "Maybe I can see my way clear in three years."  I said, "But by then, you would have given us the money to build, you know, our concession facility, our press boxes, and all of this."  He said, he said, "That's fair."  I voted against him.  He brought me a check the next day.  And we started building, and it was amazing--the attitude of the kids, because they had never had anybody do anything on their behalf.  You know, people said, oh, it'd be graffiti by the gangs, and all that.  The gangs protected that park and protected that property.  And we put up something really, really incredible, but the community bought into it.  And I told the gangs, I said, "You guys, you got to move from this corner."  I said, "I know I can't shut you down, but you got to move away from this park--," I said, "We got too many kids."  I said, "And they can grow up and join you," but I said, "While they're at this point," I said, "I'm going to pour whatever in them I can."  I said, "But I need you to move from this corner 'cause I will have you arrested."  He said, "We can just go shoot up your buildings."  I said, "And you'll be dead the next day.  I got people who will do it."  Of course, they had no clue that I was not serious but, yeah, I learned how to bluff a lot, I learned how to bluff a lot.
Story_ID: 284388
Speaker 1: But they knew I cared about the community.  And it took people years to see--they kept waiting for the other shoe to drop.  No, but I told them.  I said, "You guys, everybody knew me in Austin [Texas].  Why the heck would I come down to this little no name town, you know, and try to make a name for myself?  I could have run for city council in Austin, and got paid for it."  I didn't get paid anything in Texas City [Texas].  It was really truly for free, but it took people years to see the sincerity.  This woman says, "After all these years, woman, you're still hugging people."  I said, "That's who I am, sweetheart, you know."  But they were so distrustful of people because so many people had come in before, you know, and just used them, got no votes, and used the office, you know, to further, you know, whatever they wanted--their business or, or what have you.  Yeah, and I know the Lord put me there.  I know that, I know that for a fact.  It was a, it was ministry, it was ministry.  I helped people, and, and I tell people all the time, I helped people when I was in politics, I think, in greater numbers.  And, and, maybe, that's me fooling myself in greater numbers than I think I do in ministry now, as far as impacting the lives of people, impacting generations of people.  You know, some of those kids that came through that softball program are now in college, and I know they weren't headed there before.  And Donald Singleton, the guy who started the program, was the guy when I retired from office, took my seat, so the Lord continues and--
Speaker 2: Now, now tell us about retirement from the job.  I mean, you were, you won five times, five terms.
Speaker 1: And could have been elected five more--
Speaker 2: It's ten years.  Okay, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --how did you decide to retire from--
Speaker 1: Well, you know, it really, it really wasn't a decision of mine.  I, I always said when I no longer, no longer have the energy, or the zeal and the zest for the people, and the job that I'd quit.  And that was just, you know, once again, that was a [Barbara] Jordan throwback that, you know, when you get tired of it, you know, 'cause folks didn't understand, you know.  Gosh, why did she come out of [U.S.] Congress, and what have you--you're riding away.  If you're at the, you're at the crest of your career, why get out now?  But I certainly, I certainly understood but, but the one thing was is that in '96 [1996], I had acknowledged a call to ministry.  I was quite serious about it.  I had been speaking all the time, but I'd, you know, I, I had this sort of miniature fight with God that why do I have to announce anything in, in the true symbol that a person is called to do a thing, is that they can do a thing.  So, why don't you just let me keep doing this, let me keep speaking or preaching, let people call it what they want, you know, and we not announce anything?  And, you know, I think, clearly, I heard the Spirit of the Lord saying to me--, "It's not about you announcing what you're doing.  It's about announcing what I'm doing."  And so, I, I announced my calling--preached my first sermon in 1996.  And, for me, city council was ministry, so I didn't, I didn't see the difference.  But there really was--I became more and more serious about doing those things that's considered ministry church-wise than council.  And there just came a point, 'cause I was running a business also, J. Trinity Communications [Inc., Texas City, Texas].  I was on council, and then I was doing ministry things and Lord said give it up.  People thought I was crazy.  "Connie [HistoryMaker Reverend Constance Jackson], you can be elected for the next ten years if you want."  I said I know that, but it's, it's time to go.  And there was, it at that time, when I knew, I'd, I did know that I'd be leaving to come and study, to take off a period of time for seminary study, but that's what was happening at the time.  And so, I announced the year before--what, I'd just won reelection that night when I was giving my speech.  I said, this was my last term.  I hadn't told anybody--whether you'd know I was going to say it that night, but it just came out.  And that's when I began sort of letting go of the reins.
Speaker 2: Now, this is in 2002, I guess, or--
Speaker 1: This is in 2001--
Speaker 2: Oh, 2000--
Speaker 1: --yeah, this is in 2000 when I, when I won and said I wouldn't.
Speaker 2: Won your last term?
Speaker 1: Right, my last term.  And--
Speaker 2: And you served until 2002 and--
Speaker 1: --served until 2002.  In fact, and, and, you know, people thought I was crazy when I--the Spirit of Lord told me that it was time for me to go to seminary, time for me to give it up.  I was here in seminary [at Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia].  My entire first year of seminary was spent going back and forth every week for city council meetings.  I believe on Tuesday night, we had city council meetings on Wednesday evenings at five o'clock.  I'd fly in, and Thursday morning, I'd fly back to Atlanta [Georgia], and be here in time for class.  I did that for an entire year.
Speaker 2: The year of 2002?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, year of 2001, 2002, yeah--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --until my term ended May of 2002.
Story_ID: 284389
Speaker 1: Tell us about--it's the seminary, I guess.  And could you--you said earlier that you felt that you were called when you were baptized and ever since and you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah, sometime after then.  But preaching, preaching wasn't in my vocabulary at that time as a child.  And I think even though I believed my mom [Sweetie Crawford Jackson] knew, she never labelled it anything, never called it, but just nurtured it, whether it was an Easter speech, or whether it was doing something for a youth program, or what have you.  So, yeah, I believe the calling was always there, but there was so much opportunity to express that calling that I never really had to label it anything.
Speaker 1: Now, what is a calling--just, I mean, I don't want to belabor it, but people say it, and I've heard different--but a lot of people they're called.  What is it, what does it mean?  I mean, as far you're concerned, what is a calling?
Speaker 2: The calling for me is, is a nod from God.  It's a, it's a tugging from God.  My process theology teacher, Dr. Edward Smith, at the Interdenominational Theological Center [Atlanta, Georgia], would say that it's prehension.  And prehension is defined by process theologians as God sending God's best proposition for your life to you.  And it's a feeling that you get.  It's nothing that's written on the wall, but it's this feeling.  And when it's something that you're supposed to absolutely do, God intensifies the feeling, so that you can't help, but give into it.  And most people think--well, I don't know anything about prehension, but we really know more about prehension than we think and, and it has to do with calling.  Prehension, in its pure form, is when you follow it, and it turns out just as God would have it turn out for you, turns out for your best good, as we would say.  But gosh, you still don't know anything about prehension.  Well, prehension, when you try to figure it out, when you try to find an answer for it, make it logical, it's called comprehension.  Well, we know about prehension.  And then, when it's something that you're, that you're fearful of, that you're trying to run away from, of course, it's called apprehension.  So, this prehension is this tugging, this feeling.  Some say this calling--people have call stories of what they were doing and where they were when they heard the voice of God.  Well, very clearly, it was on a Saturday in November when, you know, it just says, you have to announce your calling in the morning, you know, at church.  Well, I know that's not anything I wanted to do, so I know it wasn't my voice and my mind saying anything.  And I was with friends, and I know none of them said anything.  So, it's just knowing in, inside of you.  That's the only way I can describe it.  It's just knowing and, and I don't know whether you have to have a relationship with God or not because I've heard people who say they had no relationship with God, and they heard the voice of God.  But I think that's because if you believe in your theology, supports were made in the image of God.  And we breathe by the breath of God, then there has to be some kind of God-connectedness.  And I think we're able to hear the voice of God talking to us, but it's a knowing and I knew, but there's not anything.  I didn't know what to call it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I credit, I credit my parents with not making me call it anything prematurely.
Story_ID: 284390
Speaker 1: Now you've achieved a master's [degree] in theology from International Theological Center [sic. Interdenominational Theological Center (ITC)] here in Atlanta [Georgia].  What did you--can you tell us something about theological school?  And I guess in terms of what you learned there that you didn't know, or would you--was it--would it be possible for you to hear the call, and just find a church and start preaching?  I mean why, I mean what's--rather than--is it--well, was it a calling to go to school to get in position to do it, or what was it?
Speaker 2: Well, I was already in ministry.  I could have hung out a shingle, so to speak.  I don't want to pastor, but I was already an associate pastor of the church before I left to come to seminary.  But for me, I take it seriously the call to attend seminary as you would your dentist.  You wouldn't go to a dentist who hadn't gone to a school of dentistry, and a reputable one at that.  I mean, you just wouldn't have somebody say, well, hey, let me look in your mouth.  I think I can do this, I think I received the call for dentistry.  Or, a heart surgeon says, well, gosh, you know, I have this, you know, knack for knives, so let me cut you open, and see what's wrong with your heart.  Well, I think when you talk about the operation of a person's soul, I certainly want somebody who's qualified, who's been taught to think critically, who's been taught to handle the document, so to speak, that they use in their trade for them to be fully aware of that, ought to be conscious of, of the pastoral care issues that occur in everyday life.  So, as I would a heart surgeon, as I would my dentist, as I would my optometrist, or what have you, I think ministers need to be trained also because after all, nobody goes to hell if you mess up their teeth.  Right?  But we trust the dentist, you know, nobody goes to hell, you know, if the pilot makes a wrong turn or what have you, but you land safely.  But I think when it comes to the church, and that's just how strongly I feel about it, I think we have a lot of people out there who are talking about a lot of things they don't know anything about.  They're manipulating the Bible because they really don't know anything about interpretation.  They don't know anything about exegesis, as we call it--interpretation of Scripture.  And I think they're sending a lot of people astray.  And there's a lot of bad theology out there.  Now, it's not the seminary gives you good theology because it doesn't, but it gives you critical thinking tools, whereby you're able to interpret, you're able to translate, you're able to sort of wade through the minutiae of your own thoughts, and other thoughts that you hear out there, and get to the true meaning of what the Bible says.  And then at ITC, in Afrocentric or an African American institution, it also helps you apply Scripture to the black experience, or something we call black theology.  James Cone [HistoryMaker James H. Cone] is considered the father of black theology where he says that God is on the side of the oppressed, and that you have the permission to interpret the Bible from your own context.  Rita--[Dr.] Renita [J.] Weems would say, your interpretive community because black people read the Bible differently than whites, or than Asians, or what have you.  Everybody has the right to bring their own interpretation to the Bible.  Well, we hadn't been given that permission before.  And I think, if we're going to reach a generation of hip-hoppers, a generation of people who have been un-churched, who never, you know, had God in their lives before, and we have about two or three generations now, who've never been in the church at all, who've never had this relationship at all.  I think we're going to have to be armed with something more than thus sayeth the Lord.  We're going to have to be able to know more about culture, more about how people think, the psychology of how people, of what bring, the psychology of what the people bring to what we call the written Word.  Yeah, seminary, seminary is not a bible college, where you just concentrate on the Scriptures, you know.  It's theology, it's philosophy, it's history, how the church got started, and, you know, why we have some of the things now we have in the church.  It's, it's urban ministry of where I'm headed to tonight, you know, if I can get of here.
Story_ID: 284391
Speaker 1: You know, when we talk about public theologians, your responsibility.  When Jesus says the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because, you know, He's called me to, you know, set the captives free, and bring good news to the poor, and what have you.  Well, where is that in our society now?  What captives are we setting free when we have millions of black men incarcerated?  And a lot of them innocent, but because they couldn't afford legal care, they got sent up anyway.  Where is, you know, at, at some point, at some point when we talk about, you know, in our colloquialisms, that God is a doctor in a sick room?  And you have 45 million people without health care.  Well, where is this God that's supposed to be a doctor in a sick room or, you know, God being this lawyer in a courtroom?  Well, but every time you turn around, people can't afford legal care, so where is this lawyer?  At some point, at some point, we're going to have to explain to the homeless when we say that God is a shelter in the time of storm.  A homeless person, why would he believe anything about God because this God never shows up with shelter?  And so, at some point, we have to learn, we have to learn how to make manifest God in the earth.  We are the ones who provide shelter in a time of storm.  We are the ones who are the lawyers in the courtroom.  We bring God into the courtroom.  We are the doctors.  We, we, we ensure on some level that people have affordable healthcare.  Or we lobby [U.S.] Congress whereby everybody, you know, has a chance at decent healthcare, and not just those with health insurance, or those with a job, or those with above a living wage job.  So, at some point, we have to make God real.  And I think that's what seminary pushes us to do is to think about God in a not-so-traditional way, and to realize that not everybody comes to this Bible, like mainstream America does.  Right now, being a Christian means that you're pro-life.  You know, when we talk about right wing, and all of that, so they've redefined Christianity.  In order to be Christian, Christian now, you have to be against same-sex marriage, you have to be against stem cell research, and you have to be pro-life.  Well, there are a lot of Christians out there that don't support, you know, any of that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, now, as we sit here in Atlanta [Georgia], this is in Georgia, and in the South is, and in the West, there are certain--and this is the home of that kind of, you know, that's the backbone of that kind of thought basically today in America.  That's also--I guess that one of the places where to say you're not a Christian is probably the greatest offense, you know.  Now, how do you--but in the black community, you know, there's, of course, is an activist tradition in the Christian church.  [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and so many others (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sure.
Speaker 2: --Gardner Taylor [HistoryMaker Reverend Gardner Taylor]--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --and other people--
Speaker 1: Sure, sure.
Speaker 2: --but there's also activist traditions and other faiths and--
Speaker 1: Absolutely--
Speaker 2: --and there are Muslims were active.
Speaker 1: --absolutely.
Speaker 2: And Buddhists and the (unclear) now.  There is even and--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --and the people that want you know (unclear).
Speaker 1: --absolutely.
Speaker 2: I mean, is, where is the--I mean, how do you, do you find--what's the place for all these other religious ideas, even agnostics and atheists in the black community who have an ethical, you know, base?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  We have to find a way to express that God is a whole lot bigger than we've been making God out to be.  We've confined God to Christianity.  And I believe God, as we listen to the Nation of Islam, God is there.  As we listen to Buddhists, God is there.  And the separation is, is that some don't believe in Jesus, some believe in Jesus.  I think what we have to do is to open up our minds to see what things we have in common, what the God we do believe in, rather than trying to make you believe what I believe, and what you believe, I have to believe.  I think we have to expand our view of God.

Story_ID: 284346
Speaker 1: I think when we left off, you were going to theological school at the Interdenominational Theological Center [ITC] here in Atlanta [Georgia].  You started in Texas City [Texas], you know, going full time and traveling back and forth.  And then, when did you decide to move to Atlanta and go to school, you know, from Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Well, it really started with a conversation with Dr. Joe [Samuel] Ratliff, pastor of the Brentwood Baptist Church in Houston, Texas.  I visited him one--I guess, July day, or probably June in 2001.  And we were talking about what my next step in ministry would be.  And I began to talk to him about seminary.  He says, "Well, you're still on city council in Texas City.  How are you going to do that?"  I said, "I really don't know, but I'm being led to just take out time for study."  Of course, I told him at that time that I believe I'd heard from the Lord to, you know, not run again for my council seat, to shut my lucrative business [J. Trinity Communications Inc., Texas City, Texas] down, and to leave my staff position at a church.  And he made a call and he says, "We have a young lady here who's been recently ordained, and a good friend of mine.  And I know her very well, and let's make sure she gets in, in the fall."  Of course, you know, I sent in all of my information, and what have you.  And so, I started fall of 2001, and literally commuted back and forth every week, had a hotel room here in Atlanta, and commuted back and forth every week for council meetings.  I'd usually leave on Tuesday nights, have council meetings on Wednesday evenings, and fly back Thursday morning, and be in class.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that, that's how I spent my entire first year in seminary.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, did you feel that your city council role could be, you know, carried out, you know, in a--I guess, I mean, that you could actually fulfill your role in city council being out of town so much?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  We had a well-oiled machine, had a--lined up district representatives who were volunteer, of course, who assisted me with the work.  Of course, council meetings, you know, that's, that's the official business, that's the administrative part.  But being responsible to your constituency, and what have you, there was never a time that I couldn't be reached for any particular thing.  And, of course, you know, emergencies, council members aren't handling anyway.  That's for city personnel, but we had a well-oiled machine of folks who were very, very conscientious about assisting me during that year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you went to school for a--did you finish in that year, or did you, or did you have to move to--I mean, at a certain point, you moved to Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Sure.  After I completed my last year on my term, and that was May 2002, I made the decision to go ahead and get an apartment here in Atlanta and then, made the move.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how much more time did you have to spend in school after you moved here?
Speaker 2: Two and a half more years.  And I went, I went full time the entire time.
Story_ID: 284347
Speaker 1: How was theological school in terms of--did it--is it what you expected it to be or--
Speaker 2: I really came there [Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia] open-eyed.  I'm, I'm a large proponent that people should be prepared in whatever vocation that they go into because a lot of people told me that, "Connie [HistoryMaker Reverend Constance Jackson], you're already ordained, you're already ministering, you're already on staff at a church, you're preaching everywhere.  Why attend seminary?"  And I just remember telling them that I would not go to a doctor whose degree I did not see it on the wall, which meant to me, that he had been prepared for the work that he had been called to do.  Wouldn't go to a dentist, or a chiropractor, or anyone else who had not been trained.  And I think we take ministry a little bit too lightly when we think that there's this calling from God, and there is no other preparation that needs to be done.  So, for me, it was as serious as my initial bachelor's degree.  If I wanted to impact government and what have you, I needed to attend school, and major in government for that.  And so, it is with ministry.  I believe that we should be just as intentional about our seminary degree as we are with anything else.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The only difference, I guess, would be that if you were, if you felt called to be a doctor, you wouldn't be able to practice (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, that's exactly right.
Speaker 1: --until you entered medical school, you know, but--
Speaker 2: That's, that's one of the things that's different about ministry.  You really can say you've received the call from God and, and hang out a shingle, so to speak.
Speaker 1: So, that's why people think that the call trumps the education and--
Speaker 2: There, there, there is a large contingent of people who believe that all you need is the burning, without the learning.  But I think if you look at those ministries that are very successful, they certainly believe that they've received the call from God, but are also very intentional about being prepared for ministry.
Speaker 1: Now, would you believe that, would you think that a person who--say, a person went to theological school, but never claimed to be called, would they be a suitable pastor for the church?
Speaker 2: Well you know there are a lot of people who attend seminary--I had quite a few classmates who came, just as some people go to law school, because they want the legal training.  They want the experience.  I think that's a good thing, but I think if you don't have a call to do that kind of work, I certainly wouldn't go.  I don't know anyone who will volunteer (laughter), or voluntarily, go into a pastorate, or into a ministry just on a whim to say, "Hey, let's see how this works out," you know, like opening up a business.  So, I would, I would hope that people feel and acknowledge a call from God before they begin to minister to other people and, and become intimately involved in the lives of people.
Story_ID: 284348
Speaker 1: What did you learn in the seminary that changed the way you approached the ministry, or was there anything that you learned that really changed it or--
Speaker 2: You know what's interesting about seminary.  I think a lot of people believe it's more on the order of a bible college that you set, and you keep your Bible open all day, and you're going through scriptures.  Of course, seminary is so much more than that, and probably a lot less of the whole going through the Bible piece than people think.  I believe seminary, and especially the ITC [Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia], the Afrocentric experience--I don't think a seminary is a seminary is a seminary.  I intentionally attended ITC because it was African American-operated and owned.  And I think there, I was taught how to think critically about the biblical text, to not apologize for bringing my own experience to the biblical text as Dr. Renita [J.] Weems would say--being able to listen to my interpretative communities, and also be able to critically think about the historical perspective of the Bible, how it was written, why it was written, by whom it was written, how it was compiled, and then to see was what, what does that mean for the folks that I would minister to, which is by and large African Americans.  So, I think that was the greatest thing, just to think critically, to be able to challenge the text, than not just accept it for how it is.  And I think that's, that's very, very healthy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In what ways, I guess, looking at from an African American perspective what, in what ways have black theologians challenged traditional Christianity, or I mean in so many different forms of Christianity, it's hard to even say that many on some level, but how have we influenced Christianity or religion in this country?
Speaker 2: Well, you take a look at Dr. James Cone [HistoryMaker James H. Cone], who is considered the father of black theology, whose tenet is God is on the side of the oppressed, and to say that there is this God that is on the side of the disenfranchised and the marginalized.  And so, we should have hope in this God, but I think a lot of people view black theology as they hear that.  This God is on the side of the oppressed that seems as if there are more oppressed, more and more, as we, as we continue on living our lives.  And so, I think that's interesting when we make, when we make the claim that this God is on the side of the oppressed, as we compare ourselves to the children of Israel, that that's our story also--being enslaved, coming out of slavery, and then, of course, being successful, in later generations that were able to prosper.  I, I think that's giving people a little bit more hope as you look at Gutierrez [Gustavo Gutierrez] from the Latino community.  I, I think also that same liberation, liberationist theology that gives people hope that this God in the Bible does know me, is on my side.  I'm not out here just hopeless and hanging out by myself.  A womanist theology, as we had Jacquelyn Grant, [HistoryMaker Reverend] Dr. Jacquelyn Grant, there at the ITC, who's the author of 'White Women's Christ, Black Women's Jesus,' gives another viewpoint that God is a woman, or has a female side that women can relate to.  So, I think all of those things help us to contextualize a little bit better our experience, rather than just taking what we've seen, or heard from a Eurocentric point of view.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this way of thinking goes on, goes back to Howard Thurman's 'Jesus and the Disinherited' and--
Speaker 2: Sure, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --even the identification with God as a, as someone who's on our side.  I think even in the 19th century, Bishop [Henry McNeal] Turner took it even further--said God is a black man, so God is me was the message.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Story_ID: 284349
Speaker 1: So, who were some of your favorite teachers and what did they teach you?
Speaker 2: Well, we can take Randall Bailey, Dr. Randall Bailey, who was our professor of Hebrew Bible there, who takes another spin because he does a lot of things with sexuality in the Bible.  [Dr.] Margaret Aymer, who is professor of New Testament there, who's a younger professor, but comes to the classroom with an incredible vigor, and a new way of challenging us to view the text, to read it, but to also be able to contemporize to for today's society.  Now, we say all the time that's what we should be able to do, but actually, she takes specific issues.  In fact, my last semester there, we had Healing Miracles in the Bible.  And, of course, we took the Gospels and the miracles there in the Gospels, and compared it to the HIV/AIDS [human immunodeficiency virus, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] crisis, and how, even in biblical times, if you had a disease, that you were pretty much ostracized from society, viewed as unclean, such as leprosy.  And so, she compared that with the AIDS condition now, and it just really put a different light on it, and then to challenge us to preach differently from the text of, of how could we now preach this text?  How would a person with AIDS view the leper text?  How would a person, a woman now, in today's society, view the woman with the issue of blood text?  How do we preach that to someone?  And I just think it's been very, very healthy for those who have experienced those two.  Of course, Melba Consten [ph.] with Christian Worship.  Gosh, Marsha, Dr. Marsha Snulligan-Haney, with her urban ministry, institute of missiology.  I'd never heard of missiology before I came to the ITC [Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia].  And she is probably one of few--
Speaker 1: What is it?  I'm sorry--let me just ask what is it (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, missiology really is, is the study of how to do missions to the disenfranchised, to the marginalized.  She will take you through the Aboriginal issue.  She'll--I, I think she was really the first person that I came across there that allowed us to have a global, as she would call a glo-cal--that's what she calls it--a combination of global and local, that we really have to understand, that what's happening globally is connected to the local condition.  So, when we take a look at Africa, and if we just take Lesotho, for instance--well, could we really place Lesotho in Atlanta [Georgia] at this point?  Could we bridge the gap and say the folks that are going through the HIV/AIDS crisis in Lesotho really are not much different from the folks who are suffering with HIV/AIDS in Atlanta, Georgia?  And she does an excellent job of having you take it to the street.  She gets you out of the classroom.  You're going to go down to Five Points [Atlanta, Georgia].  You're going to go down to Vine City [Atlanta, Georgia], and interact with the people there because she talks all the time about contested preaching--Dr. Haney does.  She says, your preaching really has not been tested until it's been contested by someone on the street.  She says, church people are very, very polite, you know, you'll preach a sermon.  They'll say, "Oh, you bless me," and all these other wonderful churchisms that we say.  And, of course, maybe they weren't even listening.  She says, but when you have to prove your, the existence of God, or defend your belief in God, to a person on the street, she says, that's when you really learn how to preach.  And then, of course, each year, she takes a contingent of students to a foreign country, and they do ministry there.
Story_ID: 284350
Speaker 1: Tell the truth now.  We're, we're in Atlanta [Georgia], which is a--kind of a Bible Belt place, and it's not that it's that much different from Chicago [Illinois].  In the black community, and probably in the white community, you don't find many people contesting.  Did you find many people that contest basic tenets of Christianity?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had classmates [at Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia] who contested the tenets of Christianity (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, okay, now, I would say that's where you'd be more likely to find--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --somebody contested in, especially in a theological seminary, or in a history class, or may, or something, but--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --or in a university, but on a street?
Speaker 2: Well, let me give you, let me give you an instance.  We had to go to Vine City [Atlanta, Georgia].  And of course, you know, we had these wonderful cliches about God, that God is a lawyer in a courtroom, God is this doctor in a sickroom, God, you know, a shelter in the time of storm.  Well, this gentleman comes up who's, who's homeless, and he says, "Well, if God is shelter in a time of storm, where was God the last storm we had in Atlanta?  I had no shelter."  And he says, and very intelligent brother, and he says, "And if God is this doctor in the sick room," he says, "why are there forty-four million people without healthcare?"  He says, "So when I need a doctor, where is this God?"  And so, that challenged me to say, we really need to be careful about what we preach, 'cause folks are listening.  If God is this lawyer in a courtroom, why is that every time, you know, a young innocent brother goes to court, he doesn't have legal representation?  Why--because he can't afford it.  Where is God then?  People are asking those questions.  And so, if we're going to spout that, then we have to be God's presence in the earth.  We need to make sure that there is affordable healthcare and affordable legal care.  And there are transitional homes for people for, who are in between habitations.  But people on the street are questioning--they're listening very carefully to what we, as ministers, are saying this God is able to do, but this God never comes through for them.  And so, one sister on the street said, "Well, maybe God is a God of the rich because it seems as if that if you're rich, you have all the necessities of life.  You have healthcare.  You have a home.  You have two and three cars.  Your kids are able to go to school wherever they'd like to go.  But for poor people, where is this God?"  And so, [HistoryMaker] James [H.] Cone's God, on the side of the oppressed, would not work for this woman.  Absolutely, people on the street are questioning the existence of God, or questioning the power of God.  If God exists, God must not be that powerful because after all, why would all these things occur?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard people say that, you know, people pray for what they can't do themselves, you know.  If I can't make myself well, I pray for God to do it.  And if I can't, you know, if I don't have a place to live, I pray for God to give me one.  Rich people with means don't do as much praying for those kinds of things.  They might pray for health or something, but they don't pray for a new car.  They just go buy one.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: So, when preachers say, God is your lawyer, and God is--I mean what are we really, I mean, what are we, what is a minister really saying to people?
Speaker 2: Well, it's empty rhetoric if you don't have any programs in place that provides legal care, or that provides health care, or that provides shelter.  It's, it's really empty rhetoric, and I think for too long, too many of us have spouted the rhetoric, but we've not implemented the programming that backs up our preaching.  At some point, we have to manifest that which we preach.  And that's what people are looking for, especially as times get tougher.
Story_ID: 284351
Speaker 1: Talking about God making a way out of no way, a lawyer for those who need him that way.  And I think I almost suggested that a lot of cities wouldn't get a lot of argument from everyday people about the existence of God.  I mean, in the Christian context, everybody, most of the--I think 90 percent of black people claim to be a Christian, and whether they are functional Christian or not, you know, or not, or go to church even, they all claim, you know, a lot of people claim to be.
Speaker 2: I think the claim is that they believe in God.  I'm not sure if the claim is that they're Christian.  We have two to three generations now--I believe, of unchurched black people.
Speaker 1: And, but when they really say they're not a--they say, they all believe in Jesus.  I mean, they all--I think most people would say they believe that.
Speaker 2: Oh, to believe that there is a God, and to say you've been saved by that God are two different things--
Speaker 1: Yeah, not on about--
Speaker 2: --two different things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: From, from the people that I've come in contact with, and I'm talking about being on the street.  We're talking right here in Atlanta [Georgia].  We're talking in Houston [Texas] where I've gone.  We have people who are even sitting in churches who are questioning--what is all this you guys are doing?  What does this have to do with my life because they really can't bridge the gap between what happens on Sunday mornings, and what they experience Monday through Saturday.  And so, they're trying to make sense of it.  And the more we don't give them a connection between what we say on Sunday morning versus what we do Monday thru Saturday, folks are beginning to not take the church as seriously.  And once before, I was absolutely shocked when I attended one church there in Houston of people who had never been gone to Sunday school, people who hadn't been taken to church.  That was my context.  I had never met anyone who hadn't grown up in church, but here I was now meeting for the very first time in my life, folks my age, whose parents never had a relationship with the church.  Maybe their grandmother may have taken them once upon a time, but their folks weren't churchgoers.
Speaker 1: It is a recent sort of a--it's a recent phenomenon.
Speaker 2: Sure, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah, black people who, you know, have no relationship to a church.
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.  I heard one older gentleman say--he says, "Well, you know, now, we're able to work wherever we want to work.  And we're able to drive wherever we want to drive.  And we're able to live in whatever neighborhood we want to live in.  Who needs God now?  Black people don't need God now.  We have money."  I just thought that was very, very interesting that he compared to our religiosity during the Civil Rights Movement versus now that we have this--I guess, this semblance of prosperity, the semblance of success that we're in positions that we've never been in before.  And his observation was but, yeah, when we didn't have all of that, we sure needed God, and we sure talked to God a lot more.
Speaker 1: But isn't there a lot of confusion amongst people in terms of that because of the rhetoric they hear from different, you know, different denominations, different styles of preaching?  There's a success school of preaching now with the megachurches.  They talk about praying for actual material wealth.  And God wants you to be wealthy, you know, and that sort of thing.  And then, I mean, so people hear that, you know, on television.  They hear, you know, who can blame people on some level for not being able to sort through some of this, you know, and (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, I just take a look at some folks that I know that, that are my age who are very, very brilliant people, very successful at their jobs, and really view being able to work, being able to think, as the most important thing, and really don't push their children to come to church, or to go to church, or what have you.  They push, you know, having the right connections.  They push getting a good education.  They push being able to go to all the right parties, and connect with all the right people.  And so, I'm saying there has been a shift in how we view our need for God now that, forget prosperity gospel.  I'm just talking about the success that we've enjoyed over the last fifty years.  There are people now who say, "Gosh, I need to work on Sundays.  It's, it's an optional.  I'm golfing on Sundays now, or I'm boating on Sundays."  When there was a time, we would never be out there doing anything other than being there at church.  So, what we, we've flipped the scripts on ourselves, I believe (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is that--
Story_ID: 284352
Speaker 1: So is it like one of the dangers of viewing a God of the dispossessed and a Jesus of the disinherited that view that when people finally get things that they are no longer disinherited, they don't need God any more, or they think they don't need God.
Speaker 2: There's, there's certainly quite a bit of that out there.  But I think it's not just in the African American community that may be across the board, but it's interesting, though, how the megachurch phenomenon--it makes us think that everybody's in church on Sunday morning when actually the truth is there's more people, you know, that are not in church than are in church, but because we play that whole phenomenon up now, it's as if people are going to church.  And I've, I've heard some younger folks say this--they're going to church now because I want to be present and accounted for.  It's the new networking community.  And I, and I find it interesting that we've now turned the Sunday morning moment where Christians are supposed to meet, to be rejuvenated to go out and do the work, to be taught to do the work, or that now, it's just another business networking opportunity.  And that's interesting that people view church that way now.
Speaker 1: And we were interviewing a man yesterday who was in his eighties, who was saying that he's been in church all his life.  And he was saying that, he thinks the church is a new way for young people to meet each other, you know.
Speaker 2: Sure
Speaker 1: It's a dating service in a sense, that was--
Speaker 2: Tell me that.
Speaker 1: --talking about the splits in the choral robes, and other things that are going on in church seeing that, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Church is very different.  We've, we've done the big appeal, you know, with all the visual, with all of the videography and choreography that we do to attract younger sets of people.  But at the end of the day, my question is all that we have gone through to get them in, what have we given them once we have them?  And I think a lot of them go out with an emotional experience, but it seems as if they aren't translating that into thinking that they have to be responsible for changing the world, or making their world better.  It's as if I'm coming to get something for me, and if I hear something that will improve my life, great, but I don't think they translate that into--I'm responsible for my neighbor.  I think that's the difference.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the black community seems, to me, there's an economic war going on two levels.  We have, like people who are in the underclass, who there should be a message to organize, or get themselves together, and then, there's also the black middle class that actually lives apart from the underclass.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And the message--I think I hear what you're saying is that you're trying to inspire people to organize to help that underclass on some level.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: But, and is it there a different message for both groups?  And how do you all, how would you, as a theologian, approach--say, in your church, how do you reach out to the underclass, and how do you reach out to the middle class whether--are there two different messages, or the same message where you bring the underclass into the middle class church, or how do you do this?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the message, I think the message has to be the same.  When, you know, Jesus talks about, you know, that we're our brother's keeper, when we talk about take care of the widows and orphans, that message has not changed.  And what's interesting is, as while I was growing up in my community in rural Texas, it didn't matter whether you were a school teacher, or whether you were a doctor, or what have you--all of those folks existed together.  And there really was not this schism between this lower class and this middle class because everybody was still fighting to survive.  The school teacher was discriminated against as much as the janitor, or the person who worked out in the fields.  And so, I think we've missed the point.  We've separated ourselves.  We were never supposed to have this middle class and this lower class mentality, according to how, you know, I believe Jesus brings it to us, that those who have more are supposed to share more.  To much is given, much is required.  And then, of course, as other people are, are pulled in to the success of their lives, you're also supposed to reach back.  So, it's a law of reciprocity.  Do unto others as you'd have them to do unto you.  You're blessed to be a blessing.  I don't think we, we carry that out.  The, the message has to be the same--whether you're poor, you're blessed to be a blessing, regardless of what gifts and graces you have.  And whether that translates into a great economic wealth or not, you're still blessed to be a blessing.  If you have the ability to create wealth and, you know, attend school, start a business, you're blessed to be a blessing.  You know, if you're a CEO of a corporation, you're blessed to be a blessing.  It has to be the same.
Story_ID: 284353
Speaker 1: Tell us, back in the, in the--I guess from the 19th century, black people in church and in community action around the country had, you know, used the Bible, and Greek, and Roman, the Greek and Roman classics and Masonry [Freemasons] trying--well, they're looking through these texts of these, you know, from these sources to find themselves and stuff.  And we started looking for the black presence in the Bible.  That's one of the things that, you know, Hosea Easton and Martin Delany, other people started doing back in the 19th century on through Henry Turner, Bishop [Henry McNeal] Turner, and others.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: They were looking for a black presence in the Bible.  And a lot of black history since the Bible was the text that every black person had in their home.  And that was supposed to be the text that links us to the origin of the world and, you know, the whole world, an existence to look for themselves at it.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And, you know, what role is that--how important is that, do you think, to African American religion and what, you know, where is that research today in term--I know it was Cain Hope Felder, has written some books on it, but how do you feel about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think it's important that any document that you hold as, you know, your guidebook, or what have you, that you have some relationship to it.  You can take Howard Thurman's grandmother, who rejected parts of the Bible, that didn't affirm her, to talk about slaves--obey your master.  She says, "That's, that's not a part of it.  That's, that may be Bible, but it's not Scripture for me, or maybe Scripture, but it's not Bible for me."  And I think that we're able to critically think, enabled to critically reject those parts that don't affirm us.  And so, if we could find something, or if we could delve into, or talk more across the pulpit, and in bible studies about the black presence of the Bible, there would be people who could probably gravitate more toward it.  At this point, you have a group of young folks, especially this hip-hop generation that's trying to interpret God, or see God in their way.  And I think it would be important for them in their understanding of the Bible that this is not something the white man brought to us that God, for us, and Africa, our ancestors was already existent.  Nobody brought God to us.  Nobody introduced God to us.  We had a very keen sense of who God was.  We had the, the different names of God.  And so now, people may view the Bible as an oppressive document, as something that slave masters used to make the slaves more docile and more obedient to them.  And I think it would be interesting for, especially a younger set now, to know about the Solomon and, and Queen of Sheba, that they really don't get.  And I guess that really is the issue of any minister, any pastor, that we are concentrating on doctrine that people may gravitate to, and they may not.  But I think if we were more intentional about talking about the black presence of the Bible, we'd have more people, probably more interested at study.  It would probably be more encouraged by the plight of how, even when we were enslaved then, or how we were in power then, and how we can translate that to contemporary times.  But it's missing, it, it's missing from what we have now.  I'm not sure if there's a new effort to begin talking about it.  Of course, there are individual churches that are doing it, but I certainly don't see our national religious organizations, the National Baptist Convention, making a statement that we should take it out.  Even with the African Methodist Episcopal church [A.M.E.], there's not a statement that we should concentrate on this, but there are certainly pastors and ministers within those denominations that are talking about it.  But and, and, you know, I could be wrong, but I just hadn't heard, but this is something we should focus in on.
Story_ID: 284354
Speaker 1: As you said, it varies from church to church, and from across the board denominations.  There's something called the Black Heritage Bible that for instance contains illustrations--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --of all the biblical figures as black.  But is this--it seems fine to ask a question if it is a religious document based on any evidence?  I mean, you know, any verifiable evidence, as were all the people in the Bible black?  I mean, are--do we or do we believe that some of them are?  Or I mean, what is the, I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, I think the integrity of the document has to be backed up by historical data.  You know, we can say anything, and we can write any book that we would like, but to be able to espouse this particular thought, there has to be some research.  People really aren't just taking our word for it anymore.  They really would like to be able to go back, research for themselves, and see if this is true.  And, of course, then if there is truth--wow, then maybe I can incorporate that into my everyday life, and have some pride about where I've come from.  But right now, you have a more educated populous sitting out there in the pew.  And many times, we have theologians sitting out in the pew.  We have historians sitting out in the pew, and you just can't say this person was black, or this is what was happening back then.  They'll challenge you on it, so I, I think it's important that we have our facts straight.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's still, yeah, I guess the epitome of the black Christian--I mean the identification of the characters of the Bible as being black has been through the BCN, the Black Christian Nationalist Church, that Albert Cleage founded in Detroit [Michigan].  His church is in Houston [Texas], Atlanta [Georgia], and Detroit, and there may be some others, but I know he contain--maintained that Jesus was a black revolutionary.  And he's depicted with an Afro, you know, all out in 1960s, and his message was about, you know, a revolution and thinking, you know, to overturn our present system, and that sort of thing.  But I just wonder--well, I mean, how, how black can a Christian church get?
Speaker 2: How black can a Christian church get?
Speaker 1: That's a question--I, I mean, it's a question I've asked before.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I feel--I mean, how black, I mean, do you want to be?  There are groups called this, a union of black Episcopalians.  They're--I mean denominations like the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church there, the National Baptist Convention.  How black do they want to be?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: How black can they get?  I mean, I guess it would depend on the group, but do you have any thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess we could ask for how white can a Christian church get?
Speaker 1: I think we know that.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) When we take a look at now--what, what our tenets are as far as if you use it for the liberation and the uplift of your people, but if you're espousing the same thing that everybody else is espousing, then really, do you exist as a black church, or do you exist as a church?  I think we need the black church.  There are things that are there that affirm me.  I, I guess I look at our religious icons.  There's this picture and, and I can't remember now who, who painted it, but there's this picture of Jesus that everybody had, every black home pretty much had in their homes, along with [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr. (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] and his brother--
Speaker 2: And John F. Kennedy, absolutely--
Speaker 1: --Robert [F.] Kennedy.
Speaker 2: --and of pretty much the trinity for a lot of people (laughter).
Speaker 1: Above the television, above the television.  You knew, we all know--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely--
Speaker 1: --we all know this, yeah.
Speaker 2: --absolutely.  And so, when you have that picture of Jesus as, as a white, blond hair, blue-eyed person--gosh, if the same person who's a person, he looks like that.  Can you look toward another person who looks like that to save you?  And I, and I think that, that just really, and to take it down, to do anything with that picture, to say, put it away, or replace it, you know, with an Afrocentric figure was blasphemous for most black families.  And so, we've been indoctrinated really to reject this black presence, this black God, this black Jesus.  And I think now that we have, I think we have a push to, to go back there, to reclaim that presence, and to find out more about it.  But we've been indoctrinated so much that I'm not sure if people really would now.  You know, our stained glass windows that we have in our churches, even in some of our more modern churches, that were just built in the last ten years, have Eurocentric figures or icons there.  So, what does that, what does that say to us, that are we trying to emulate a Christianity that we believe is (air quotes) correct or, or do we have the nerve to really interpret for ourselves who this God is, and what this God looks like, and what this Jesus looked like?  You, you go to various cultures, the Chinese culture, or the Asian culture, and what have you, and there are icons for Jesus--looks like them.  And I think, I think black people have gone through the sinful assimilation, whereby the more we look like that which we consider to be, to be the majority, the better off we are.  And I think that's been a mistake to not balance the story of who we are.
Story_ID: 284355
Speaker 1: I often wonder--now and this could be--we could talk about this for a long time--
Speaker 2: Sure, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --because it does, it's so many different various routes--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --you can take from this kind of issue.  But I wanted to ask you about alternatives to Christianity, you know.  As I said, most of our people--ninety something percent claim to be Christian, whether they're functionally are or not, and would actually turn on someone else (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --who has an alternative idea.
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: But we do have alternative ideas.  And I think one of the--we have like, the Black Hebrew Israelites that really--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --closely aligned with Christianity.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: In fact, in our efforts to find out the roots of Christianity, the original people of the Bible, of course, some of our ancestors went back to--say, hey, we are the Jews.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Say, 'cause they were slaves, and we're slaves.  And, you know, they tried to make a connection like that.   So, got that group that's been around since the 19th century at least.  And then you've got--now, it's in various forms.  I guess, in Chicago [Illinois] alone, there are twenty-five different kinds of Black Hebrew-lites, and black Jews, and so forth.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: In Atlanta [Georgia], same thing.  And we also have like, a growing black Muslim presence now, you know, which started--I guess, the early part of the century, and has grown now to include maybe different Orthodox Muslim groups, and different combination groups.  That was even a group that, at one time, were a combination of Hebrews and Christians and, you know.  Eldridge Cleaver formed what you call Chrislam, which didn't go very far, but it was, you know.  But you have the Nation of Islam, which is now more Orthodox, you know--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --but still with a black, you know, focus and for purpose.  How do you, or how do we, how did these groups--I guess, what's their place within the context of a black spirituality?
Speaker 2: I'm going to go back to my analogy when we were talking about God being this doctor in a sick room, and lawyer in a courtroom, and shelter in the time of storm.  I think for a lot of people, and I've spoken to a lot of young African American males, as far as their gravitation toward the Nation of Islam versus Christianity.  What attracts them is not so much the Koran [Qur'an] versus the Bible, but it's the services that they receive, the affirmation that they receive.  When we talk about prison ministry from a Christian standpoint versus from a Nation of Islam standpoint, you have so many young men who are converting to the Nation of Islam, or are to, are to, yeah, who are going with the Nation of Islam who were previously Christian.  They were brought up Christian.  It is because they would say, they are there.  They're there in prison for me when I get out there--they're to pick me up.  They're there to give me job training, and give me a new start, affirm my manhood, affirm my blackness.  And I think when we talk about--it's not so much the philosophy.  I think it's really what people get to enhance their lives that is so attractive.  And I, I just see it over and over again as you hear people talk about it.  They are not quoting their religious document, but they're talking about the life help that they received.  And, and I think Christianity, for so long, has banked on folks just believing and hoping for a better day, but not necessarily helping to manifest that better day.  And I think some religions are better at that than others--well, than, than Christianity has been.  There, there are just so many forms of Christianity, you know, that you see.  You have the Pat Robertson-type Christianity that, you know, if you're right-winged and Republican, that, that works for you.  But that's certainly not my Christianity, you know.  And so, when you take a look at the Nation of Islam, yeah, there may be some offshoots, but by and large, you can point to--this is how we do things, this is what we believe.  But Christianity, you have all kinds of things out there that run the gamut, so I think that's the reason why people are looking for other alternatives.  They're giving themselves permission, not necessarily to be Christian, but to be that which affirms their lives.
Story_ID: 284356
Speaker 1: Yeah, two tiny alternatives out here.  They're tiny in the big scope of things.  I think you have a people that are embracing African, traditional African religions.  And these people would say that our ancestors who came here from West Africa weren't Christians.  And neither, a lot of them weren't Muslims either.  They're following the religions of Naomi [ph.] or Yoruba you know, Edo (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --you know, lots of other groups on the West coast of Africa.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, sure.
Speaker 1: And people are, they're Yoruba groups, and starting in New York, and they're spreading all over the U.S. now.  They are groups that practice Santeria out in Cuba, and Contempla from Brazil, and others.  Now, how do they affect the--I mean, the practice of black theology in this country?  Are black theologians and black churches, you know, who are now starting to wear African garb in church, or starting to celebrate Kwanzaa in church even, though Kwanzaa is an African American holiday not directly from the continent.  It has a--where people are trying to connect--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --back to continental Africa, and they're trying to connect to our roots.  How does the black church--is there--what's the thinking on the part of black theologians about, you know, that move towards traditional African religion with its rums [ph.] and a more exuberant kind of expression or spirituality?
Speaker 2: From a viewpoint of the pew, I'll, I'll just keep pushing that.  From a viewpoint of the pew, you have to do more than dress in African garb, and you have to do more than, you know, pass by me some African principles.  I need to see you living by the tradition of how the villages help raise the children.  That, that's, that's what we're pushing toward.  I think we have a whole lot of symbolism that we're getting back to our ancestral roots, and what have you, but I don't think we're going far enough.  I, I think we're, we're doing all of the--I think we're doing the dress, and we're doing that, and we're lighting the candles, and we're pouring out libations, and what have you.  But what does that really translate into, into the transformation of the lives?
Speaker 1: Well, there's a lot of textual, a lot of stuff has been written and about it.  I think [HistoryMaker] Maulana Karenga published a, about seven hundred-page book on Ifa, and the moral content of Yoruba religion.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And I mean, there are groups that would argue that are practicing these religions that they do have a moral content and they do, you know, they inspire them to do things--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --with their lives that are to do, to illustrate some of what you just called from, yeah.
Speaker 2: And I'm talking from the Christian standpoint--those, those of us who consider ourselves Christian, and not the other religions that, that, that are coming up, or that other people are gravitating toward.  I'm talking about Christianity--those of us who say that we are Christians, and now, we go back to the symbolism of our ancestral roots, or what have you.  We have to do more than mere symbolism.  And I think that's what people are calling us, that's what people are calling us to do, wanting us to do, meeting us to do, is to be more than, you know, sort of like a sound bite that, you know--now this Sunday, we're going to have this emphasis, and we're going to bring in, you know, all of the drums and the, and the headdress, and what have you.  What does that mean for me in the morning?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think that's, I think that's the question that, that people are asking.  Great--give me that historical perspective.  But now, also, are you going to become a church that embodies the principles of the people whose regalia he showed me on Sunday?  That, that's the push, that's the rub.
Story_ID: 284357
Speaker 1: I guess I don't understand what you're saying (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: I get--I mean I don't understand like, why we couldn't just say, well, why doesn't, you know, what does any music represent or dress, you know?  I mean, apart from the substance, I mean, the substance, I would agree with is how we treat each other.  But is that--that's not all that Christianity is teaching--we should treat.  I mean, the churches are culture, I guess, and what, what we're looking at when people adopt in the Christian church--these African forms goes back to the question I raised, like how black does the church want to get, you know, how African does the church want to get, and not, I mean, I don't--
Speaker 2: And I think black is not about the dress and the symbols.  When I grew up, black meant that if someone down the road, if their house burn, that entire community came together to help rebuild that house.  If two parents died, and they left three kids, black meant for me--when you talk about how black do you want to be--black meant for me that people in the community took in those children, raised those children, sent them to school.  So, when we talk about black, I'm not talking about, you know, us just having the trappings of what it looks like to be black.  But black for me was a way of life--or Negro was a way of life, and that meant how you, how you guided your everyday life, how you lived out your blackness.  So, that's what black meant to me.  So, when we talk about how black do you want to be, I'm talking about how helpful can we be?  How empowering can we be?  So, I think maybe we have a couple of different definitions for black, but that's, that's what I go to, which is why I always challenge.  We got to be more than symbolic in our blackness.  So that's, that's, that's where I am and maybe--
Speaker 1: I don't disagree necessarily.  I just think that I don't know why, I just think that if you--I mean, you could say about the black Jesus on the wall instead of a white one, you know.  What difference does it make to make Him black?  Why not just have all white Jesuses on the wall, or why not even try to find black people in the black (unclear)?  I mean, why--I mean, all these things, what do they really mean?
Speaker 2: If we connect the symbols with the attributes of what they stand for, that's where empowerment and transformation takes place.  If, in fact, I believe there is a black Jesus, and I see a Jesus who looks like me, maybe I won't feel so helpless and hopeless in my workplace because I have a deity who has power to change my situation.  And if I have a deity who looks like me, then maybe I have the power to change my situation to transform my context.  And so, that's what I'm talking about when we have symbols.  We have to have more than symbols where we have to teach the attributes of what those symbols mean.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But it's more than symbol in terms of Africana, and returning to some, or being influenced by African religion.  It's more than just symbol and drumming, and there's moral content (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It can be.
Speaker 1: There's moral content and other things, too.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Story_ID: 284358
Speaker 1: And there's a smaller group of African Americans who have been studying the moral content of ancient African text and culture, and basically see an African spirituality that has nothing to do necessarily with Christianity.  I mean, it could, but it doesn't necessarily have to so.  So, is there a (laughter)--I mean, I just see the Christian church, and correct me if I'm wrong.  The Christian church seems to be responding to, or being influenced by, another intellectual edge that's pushing, you know, for this closer connection to African originated ideas.
Speaker 2: And I, I think your, your operative word was intellectual edge.  And, and maybe at some point, we're, we're saying the same thing, and maybe not.  But to intellectualize the African presence without bringing to bear what that really means for transformative living, it's empty.  That, that's all I'm saying.
Speaker 1: I don't think you can intellectualize without getting to what something really means.
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, we can.  We do it all the time.  I, I, you--
Speaker 1: But that will the goal of intellectual pursuit of that, rather than, you know.
Speaker 2: If you transfer head knowledge into, into, into heart knowledge, into actual action, yeah, correct.  Like all the wonderful things I learned at seminary [Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia], if I never act on any of that, I've had a wonderful intellectual pursuit.  I may even know what it means, but if I never put it into practice, it's all intellectualism.  That's, that's what I'm saying.  It just can't be something that we go and learn.  So, I've spent three and a half years at an institution that's afrocentric that affirms me, that teaches me critically how to read the Bible from my context to go out and, and preach from that viewpoint that empowers people, whereby they can see the black presence in the Bible, to have hope from that, to be empowered by that.  And I don't do it--I've had a great intellectual experience, but it means nothing--not to the transformation of the world, it means nothing.  And I think we have a whole lot of folks who are doing that.  That, that's all I'm saying.  We, we, black people--let me just, let me just be clear about where I am.  Black people can't afford just to be intellectual.  We just can't, we can't afford just to be able to write books and identify the problem.  There has to be, at some point, some praxis.  There has to be, at some point, some manifestation of that which we've learned to do, to empower other people, and to empower the oppressed, the marginalized, and disenfranchised.  Other than that, we're just smart people.  We can't afford to do that, especially when the people we minister to are disproportionately impacted by every vice, by every social ill there is.  We can't just afford to be intellectual and have symbols.  We really have to go much further than that.
Speaker 1: Well, I'm suggesting on some level that you can be intellectual and make social change.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Most of the members, most of the members--
Speaker 2: That's, that's the perfect combination, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --are Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC].  I would submit a lot of them, at least a leadership.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses] and a lot of the other--
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: --were Christian--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --and were--
Speaker 2: That, that's, and, and that's the thought to bring it all together, and not just have one piece of it.  That's exactly what I'm saying, absolutely.
Story_ID: 284359
Speaker 1: What are your future plans now?  You finished ITC [Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia] in 2005 this past April, I believe, right?
Speaker 2: May, um-hm, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) May, okay, all right.  So, and you're pastor at a church here in Atlanta [Georgia], right?
Speaker 2: No, I am not pastoring a church (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No?  Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --no, no, no.  I'm an associate minister at the Ray of Hope Christian Church [Decatur, Georgia] where my pastor is Reverend Dr. Cynthia L. Hale.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Being an associate minister is not being a pastor then, right?  Okay.
Speaker 2: That's a--well, you can be pastoral in that role, but when we say, pastor, that means that--
Speaker 1: That's the head--
Speaker 2: --you're responsible for a congregation of people.  Sure, absolutely--
Speaker 1: --okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --in my opinion, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, and what are your duties as assistant minister?
Speaker 2: Well, there are, there are preaching duties, there are teaching duties.  We have a counseling ministry so, you know, whereas maybe in a smaller church, you pretty much do it all.  But at, at our church, where we have, we have a delineation of duties that people do various things from outreach ministry, there's a minister for that.  Counseling, there's a minister for that, minister to women, and minister to men.  So, overall, general preaching, teaching duties, worship duties, and what have you.
Story_ID: 284392
Speaker 1: There are more women in ministry now than ever before.  Could you maybe tell us, what are your impressions and why?
Speaker 2: Well, I think there's been an awakening.  I think women have always been an integral part of the establishment of churches.  In fact, which you'll find many in the, in the historical accounts of many churches, they were started by women.  Of course, they were not allowed to pastor those same churches, but you'll find that this church was started in this Lula Mae Wilson's [ph.] home.  And she was responsible for the meeting, of course.  And then because of the cultural--I guess, norms at the time, women were not allowed to pastor.  They could certainly do missionary work, and what have you, or evangelism work, but were not allowed to pastor.  So, women have always been a part, but now, of course, there's not a movement, but an awakening now that women are as eligible, or can be called by God just as a man can, to serve in ministry, and serve as a pastor of a church.  And so, you have women now who have been taught that if you want to get ahead, it's a matter of getting a good education.  You have to go through the whole educational process.  And I think that's across the board.  And so, and women are now saying that they're called into ministry, or they've received a call to ministry--I think they do it as with everything.  They're now going to get the academic training that's required for that profession.  So now, you have over fifty percent female populous in, in most seminaries now, but not all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yes, I know it's a, there was a--in a black community, historically, when I think about it, Maria [W.] Stewart, the first black woman to give a public speech--I think, in the United States and Boston [Massachusetts]--was a minister, became a minister in the 1840s.  Then, but there's been like--and during my life time because I'm fifty-six now--during my lifetime, most black churches, the backbone of the church has been black women.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, and still today.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, and, yeah, he hadn't still--we'd hear the minister reading from the book of Paul, you know, about the women--be quiet and be silent.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Slave obey the masters, and all that other stuff, you know, that--well, I mean, well, womanist theology, you know, is and I guess it's part--it has something to do with the number of women that are now in the ministry.
Speaker 2: I think womanist theology derived out of a way to express--I don't think it's a cause for more women being in, in ministry now--
Speaker 1: No--well, okay.
Speaker 2: --but I think was a way to express or to affirm--
Speaker 1: Womanist theology is a result of more women being in the ministry--I guess, what I was trying to say, if I didn't say it right.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, yeah.  I could, I could, I could probably go along with that, that the expression, womanist theology, because, once again, when you go with feminist theology, as far as Eurocentric female, there's a separation because you have folks talking about, you know, that, that God is on the side of women or, or God is a woman, or what have you.  But the truth of the matter is when you can still uphold slavery, then you really aren't looking at the liberation of all women.  You're making sure that white women are liberated from their particular condition.  And so, womanist theology for black women needed an expression as for how God relates to them.  And so, I think it's, it's been effective, but I'm not sure how, how, how widespread it's going to move as people feel as if they can take things into their own hands.
Story_ID: 284393
Speaker 1: You're on the verge of going to South Africa.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, southern Africa.
Speaker 1: Going to Lesotho and--
Speaker 2: Lesotho, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Lesotho, okay.  And what's going to be your work there at--
Speaker 2: Going to be working with Bishop Sarah [Frances Taylor] Davis, who was a newly elected bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal church [A.M.E.].  And her work there, for her work, Senator Allen [ph.]--quite a bit of training, minister's training, pastors, doing economic and community development for the four countries that she has purview over, and also some healthcare initiatives.  So, I'll be there to really do a reconnaissance initially, and assessing what economic development initiatives would work, and then to see if we could not implement those initiatives, and, of course, train the folks to be self-sufficient for themselves.  Right now, there are quite a few women who have incredible sewing skills.  They, they knit, and what have you, incredible blankets, clothing, and what have you, and just really don't know how to market that--those particular products.  So, to assist them in maybe how we create a business incubator to teach them how to market their products, and thereby be able to support their children and their villages.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your approach to it is to teach them from practical skills and things that they can use to make their life--to improve their lives?
Speaker 2: Yeah, business, business and marketing skills.  As far as the actual skills--I mean, my goodness, those are there already.  But it's very, very difficult when you're in an impoverished area, and you're really just trying to sell to whomever comes along to maybe establish a marketplace for them, whereby you have a concentrated group of consumers who are able to come in, see your goods, you're able to package them in a way, whereby you can make more than you usually would--just bargaining on the street.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, has the approach to missionary work changed over the years?  It sounds like it might have, from what you described that you want to do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure.
Speaker 1: --because back in the, and I think that any of us who read history are sensitive to the idea of white people of various denominations going to Africa in order to civilize the savages, and bring them Christianity.  As they stated they--I mean, this is what they wrote--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --that they were going to do.  Even in the 19th century when Bishop [Henry McNeal] Turner was going over, he had similar ideas that he actually wrote down.  Marcus Garvey's movement is not as black as you can get for that era, talked about bringing enlightenment, you know--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --Christian information to the ignorant, and the savages, and that sort of thing to uplift our African brothers with the idea that we're somehow superior because of this--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --Western civilization and Christianity that we would bring it.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: So, has it changed--I mean, the idea of all that, has that changed?  And are--how do you--did you have any reflections on the history of all that activity?
Speaker 2: I certainly hope it's changed because as I've interacted with the African people, it's not a matter of ignorance at all.  I think what we try to do is put our Western eyes, thinking on to theirs, to change their culture.  Here is one particular instance.  We say in Christianity that there is one man and one woman, and those two people are married together.  Well, in the African culture, you can be Christian, and have four and five wives.  This man says to us, "You mean to tell me that in order to please God, I will have to put out on the street, three of my wives and their children."  He says, "I think that's ungodly because they would have no place to sleep, nothing to eat, no way to be educated."  He said, "God certainly can't want that.  But you're telling me, in your Western thinking, that for me to be a good Christian, I have to have one wife and one set of children."  Well, I think, there, you have a clash of culture versus religion, and so to come over and try to overlay our Western ideals onto their culture that has worked for them for centuries--I think we have to be very careful when we're talking about going over there to educate them.  I think what missionary work needs to be now is a matter of empowerment, helping people to form, by giving them better forming techniques, whereby they can raise food and feed their families, or if they have a product that they manufacture, or make to how to get that out to the marketplace.  So, once again, they can take care of their family, educate their children.  And so, I think missionary work is much more than bringing Jesus to people.  It's bringing economic empowerment to communities.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Some of my concerns are that we have become the new oppressor of our own people, that we've become very individualistic.  And I guess I'm going back, once again, to my upbringing where we were very communal.  And now, it's a matter of if I am able to send my child to school.  That's really my only concern, or if I'm able to live comfortably.  That's really my own concern.  So, I think we've become very indi-, individualistic in that.  And, and, and I'm hoping that we'll be able to move back toward a more communal mindset.  Now, we may say that that's impossible because we're so spread out.  We're not concentrated in one particular area, like we used to be, and so maybe it was easier to have a communal mindset back then.  Now, we're in the burbs where, and a loft in the, in the inner city now.  Even our churches are regional churches.  The church may be in a community, but really has no relationship to that community because people who come into the church are coming from everywhere.  And so, there's a disconnect between church and community now.  My, my hope and my prayer would be that we be able to find a way to locate in areas whereby there is a great need for empowerment, and be able to do whatever we can to stick it out.  So many other churches are moving from the inner city--well, where are usually the poorest people without, you know, opportunities for jobs, transportation, and what have you.  When that church moves out, those people in the inner city can't move with it.  And so, I'm hoping that we'll become either more sensitive that, even if we do move out to the suburbs, that we'll leave a ministry intact that can minister to the needs of the people who are left there and can't get out.

Speaker 1: When you look back over everything that you've done to this point, and you're still real young by our interview standards, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I really don't, but I'm not sure that what has occurred in my life is something that I did.  I believe I've been very sensitive to the voice of God.  Once again, I went to University of Texas [at Austin, Austin, Texas] as a pharmacy major, had no idea that I would meet Barbara Jordan there.  And, of course, after then, I believe I was inspired, interrupted, so to speak, to change my major to government.  I, I did not know at that point where that would take me.  But it certainly led to our working for the Democratic Party for being chief of staff for dean of the [Texas] Senate [Senator Chet Brooks], to eventually running for office myself, and being able to impact communities.  I just don't think I would have made--I, I, prayerfully, I wouldn't go back, and make any different decisions, 'cause everything that's happened to this point has really been a culmination of, of all that's, of all that's occurred with me.  I thought I would regret shutting down my business [J. Trinity Communications Inc., Texas City, Texas].  I thought I would regret leaving public office.  I thought I would regret leaving a staff position to come to seminary.  But all of that has really just been a part of a wonderful journey.  I, I wouldn't change anything at all.
Story_ID: 284396
Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Wow.  I think it's too early yet (laughter) to talk about, to talk about a legacy.  I, I happen to think that I, I really hadn't done a lot.  Of course, you know, you can go back and see some impact that you've made, but I think how I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think Texas City [Texas], you were seen--
Speaker 2: Sure.  But how I judge myself, you know.  I, I just look at, you know, so many things that, that could have been done.  And, and I just have a really high standard, so I really don't think I've done anything at this point.  You know, for folks to tell me now when I go back to Texas City--things aren't the same, you know, things are worse, that, that, you know, that, that isn't good because that means that those who've come behind you either espoused something differently, or believed something differently.  And gosh, if [Reverend Dr.] Martin [Luther] King [Jr.] came back today, would he consider what he did a failure because we still aren't operating in the beloved community mentality?  I just don't think I've done enough yet to say that there's something worth calling a legacy.  So, so I'm hoping that my next forty-four years will produce something that we can say we've left something behind, but I certainly think we've, we've made an impact, but as far as transformation, I'm not sure if we've done that yet.

Speaker 1: We always ask about family now.  Who, who would you consider to be your nuclear family these days and, are your parents still alive are they still?
Speaker 2: My father [Lewis B. Jackson, Sr.] passed in '91 [1991], but my mom [Sweetie Crawford Jackson] is certainly alive, and all of my siblings.  I'm the fourth of five children.  I have very accomplished siblings.  It was really tough being a big deal in our family, especially by the time you get to number four when you have all college-educated siblings, and what have you, who are multiple-degreed.  And it's like, okay, fourth child, getting a second degree, all right, and but they are the folks who inspire me the most.  My, my siblings have always made me seem like such a big deal, even with all of their accomplishments.  And I think that's very, very important.  I think it's tough when people try to accomplish great things without a support system, and I've certainly had a great one.
Story_ID: 284398
Speaker 1: Is there anything we have not asked you that you want to address or say, or we should ask, and cover before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Probably role models in ministry.  As we, you know, talk about the increasing presence of women in pastorates, the increasing presence of women in seminary, or in professorships, theological institutions.
Speaker 1: Do you feel a need to, you know, be the kind of role model--I guess that Barbara Jordan was, and then other teachers of yours, you know?
Speaker 2: I absolutely feel that pressure.  I think my life certainly would have been incredibly different had there not been a Barbara Jordan.  But certainly, my life would have been even more incredibly different had not been a mom [Sweetie Crawford Jackson] who was so affirming, who was so empowering.  But when I look at Barbara Jordan and her impact in my life, and the life of so many others, when I look at a Dr. Cynthia [L.] Hale, who is pastor of what we, what we would consider a megachurch who, who started the church [Ray of Hope Christian Church, Decatur, Georgia] with four people, and who had, had about seventy-five hundred people pass through there, and maybe an active membership of thirty-five hundred now.  The Claudette Copelands of San Antonio [Texas], who's a graduate of ITC [Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia].  I think that when we don't take the time to mentor other people who are coming behind us--I think there are mistakes made that don't have to be made.  I think there are--I think we have a responsibility to pass on the information, and the experiences that we've gone through, just so it makes it easier on the next generation.  So, I really hope that when we talk about leaving a legacy, I, I really hope that what the commentary that'll be said about me is that I spent a lot of my lifetime mentoring other young men, other young women in ministry, in politics, in community, and economic development, whereby they were able to make a general, able to make generational improvements.  And that's really big for me that the impact I make is generational change, and not just change for a week, or change for a month.  I'm really looking to impact generations of people, and that, that's really what I'd like to be able to do.
Story_ID: 284399
Speaker 1: Just to bounce maybe off of what you said about mega- you mentioned megachurch, that one of your mentors was involved in.  How do you feel about megachurches as such, gigantic churches and--
Speaker 2: Well, you, you know, what I think when I look back to the churches of Bronzeville in, in Chicago [Illinois], and what have you--I, I think because we're not looking at the history.  We've, we've always had larger churches, so to speak, because churches back then, you know, were two thousand and twenty-five hundred, which is what we classify now as a mega church if you have two thousand people.  I believe that's the litmus test, but I think now, with the introduction of televangelism because we're able to see it on television and what have you.  Megachurches really don't make up the majority of churches in America.  And pretty much, it could be considered maybe a southern phenomena.  But megachurches, by and large, are not the majority of churches.  Maybe I don't know, I'm not sure what percentage I've heard--three percent, four percent, but most churches that average most, the average church--I think, probably centers around maybe two hundred and fifty people.  So, wow, I'm not sure if people call it--some people call it impersonal.  I've heard some people say it's a place I can come and hide out, and nobody will ask me to participate.  And I really don't have to give because nobody will miss my money.  There's so many people giving--all those kind of misnomers about megachurches.  But I also think the megachurch has brought a different community focus because we're able to do the credit unions.  They're able to do business incubators and what have you, so I think on a positive note, with what we hear negative, I think that some of the megachurches have been able to do probably larger ministry efforts than probably a smaller church could do.

Speaker 1: Our last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as I believe my father [Lewis B. Jackson, Sr.] was remembered.  My father was an educator.  And the last year of his life, many of his former students would come and sit at his bedside.  My father had died of cancer--would sit at his bedside, just to hear last words from Professor Jackson, as they called him back then.  I think that's greatness.  My father hadn't taught since 1966.  He died in '91 [1991], so if you talk about the impact that he must have had on his students for them to be older now--many of them grandparents--to come and sit, and still believe that he had something of value, something of worth to say.  I think that's the definition of greatness.  I remember asking my father, "Why was it such a big deal that they always pushed us to be better, to do more, to be great?" And he said to me in those, in those last days, "The reason why I needed you guys to be great, the reason why I needed you guys to excel so, because you guys will be the only evidence that I was here."  And so, I, I really would like to be remembered as someone whose words are lasting, whose impact on the lives of people was lasting.  I'd like to be remembered as someone who preached and empowering and liberating gospel, whereby people actually used those words to transform their lives for good, and transform the lives of their children and thereby, the lives of their grandchildren.  Really, a compassionate person--I'm not sure if I'd like to be remembered that I built any buildings, or that are buildings with my name on them, there are, not sure if I want to be remembered that, gosh, I pastored a megachurch or what have you, but really, that I impacted the lives of people, and thereby impacted generations of people because I was able to say something, do something, that made someone change their life for good.

Speaker 1: This is my graduation picture from kindergarten and it's May of 1966, and I am headed to the first grade.  I remember we had a wonderful ceremony and probably my first speaking commitment occurred on that evening.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Go ahead, please.
Speaker 1: This is my first brochure when I first ran for office in May of 1992.  My slogan was Connie Jackson, the People's Problem Solver.  And there I am with Senator Chet Brooks of whose staff I was on at the time.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next, please.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me and little brother, Ira Anthony Jackson.  That is a picture of us at our home church in Pledger, Texas at the Grove Hill Missionary Baptist Church.  And that had to be probably around 19-, he was born in '66 [1966], so he looks maybe about one, one and a half, so probably 1967.  And it was a day when the church was taking family pictures, and of course, my little brother and I were in the picture together.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, stand by (unclear).
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my mom, Mrs. Sweetie [Crawford] Jackson.  And at the time this picture was taken, she was pregnant with me.  My mom tells a wonderful story of my being conceived on January 11, 1960 and then, of course, my being born September 9, 1960.  And this is a picture of her, and it looks as if she's in San Antonio, Texas.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: This is a copy of my first--what we would call push card in politics that we handed out to folks at the polls.  And it's saying, "Vote, Saturday, May 2, Elect Connie Jackson, the People's Problem Solver."  And, of course, that was our first run at public office, and we subsequently won by 66 percent of the vote.  Yes, that was in 1992 (laughter).
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next, please.
Speaker 2: Picture of mine in the tenth grade.  Of course, fros and hoop earrings were real big back at that time.  And I certainly had my share of hoop earrings, and was very, very proud of my wonderfully-shaped Afro.  In fact, I was known for probably the neatest Afro there in school, and that was between the years of 7--1976 and 1977.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: This is, this is a school picture of me in second grade [at Newgulf Elementary School, Newgulf, Texas].  I can remember my mom made me a wonderful dress with rickrack on the collar there.  And, of course, you know, every little girl with long hair, needed a bow.  I was no different.  And second grade was a, was a pivotal point.  I was going through this period of where I wanted to look very, very grown-up.  And my mom had very long hair, so I think I was in the process of trying to emulate my mom.  Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: It's 1979, a high school graduation picture.  There I am in my cap and gown, and my National Honor Society collar.  There were about fifty-five persons in my graduating class from Boling High School in Boling, Texas.
