Speaker 1: All right, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is February 9th, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Richmond, Virginia.
Story_ID: 143069
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we ask as sort of a warm up and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Wow.  A favorite food, not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I love fruit and I love ice cream, those two extremes.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color is blue and red are my favorite colors.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring time.
Speaker 1: Okay, a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No, I don't have a favorite cause that's--I've been so many places that I really would like to go again.  Two of them would, I would say would be South Africa and Barbados.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: My favorite saying is defeat is not an option.
Story_ID: 143070
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll start with your mother's side first so we don't get them confused.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name was Arnetha Bertha Hobson, A-R-N-E-T-H-A, middle name Bertha, B-E-R-T-H-A, last name Hobson, H-O-B-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what--
Speaker 2: That was also her maiden name.
Speaker 1: Okay, Hobson is--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --married and maiden name?
Speaker 2: Right.  We always got that question when I would fill out social security cards.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth was November 5th, 1899 in Mohemenko, Virginia, M-O-H-E-N--M-O-H-E-M-E-N-O, Mohemeno [sic Mowhemencho, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what did they do?  What kind of occupations did they have?
Speaker 2: I knew my grandparents.  My grandparents on my mother's side died when I was a teenager.  My grandmother, her name was Hattie Hobson, was a homemaker, she had ten kids.  And then her, one of her daughters died in child birth and she had six kids so she raised those also.  And my grandfather, his name was John Hobson, he was a carpenter.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you go back any further?  I mean do--is there any--are there any stories about slavery or Reconstruction or any of that?
Speaker 2: No I don't have any of that information.  We're in process of trying to go back on our family history.  We have a family reunion every other year and we've started developing some of this.  I know my mother on my grandmother's side of the family, her maiden name was Taylor and she had I think three or four brothers, but I don't know a lot about that.  I, I don't, I can't go back to slavery and whether, what involvement they had in that part of the, of the history.
Story_ID: 143071
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So what did your mother [Arnetha Hobson] say about growing up?  Did she talk about what it was like when she was growing up?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately I didn't ask a lot of questions and my mother didn't talk a lot about her childhood.  We would visit my grandparents [Hattie Hobson and John Hobson] a lot and they lived on the farm way back in the woods and it seemed like a fairly hard life and I guess it was.  They grew up in a farm and I did also, but she never talked a lot about her childhood.  She was the second oldest, a sister older than she was and she was next child.  And one of the things I regret not having asked my mother about is of the ten children my mother is the only one who went to college and I don't know why she went or how she went and that whole story behind her attending college which was probably very unusual in that time.  She graduated from what is now Virginia State [University, Ettrick, Virginia, formerly Virginia State College for Negroes] in 1922.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah that is a--yeah.
Speaker 2: As a child you don't think those things are important but as you get older you realize the significance of that type of accomplishment.
Speaker 1: Now what did your mother focus on in college?
Speaker 2: She was trained as a teacher and she--after she graduated I'm not what she did for a couple of years.  But she ended up moving to Ballsville [Virginia] maybe right after she graduated.  Mowhemencho [Virginia] is probably about twenty miles from Ballsville, the little town that I grew up and she was teaching school there and she met my father [Willie Hobson] and they were married in 1928.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so she didn't really have any stories that she passed down about what life was like when she was growing up--
Speaker 2: She really didn't.
Speaker 1: --and how she felt about--?
Speaker 2: No.  Anyway, I thought about that later and I, you know I have my own assumptions about some of the things that may have--particularly her having a college degree moving to Ballsville which is a really small town and met my father.  My father was an uneducated man and a farmer and she lived on this little farm and she didn't teach school I think after she started having kids and I often wonder if she had some regrets about giving up her career totally and not being able to--at that time there weren't lots of opportunities to go back to work as women do today having kids.  She went back to work but she went back to doing domestic work. So here she was a college graduate and she was taking care of other peoples' kids and cleaning their house.  So I'm sure there must have been some regrets about that but she never talked about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she did a great job of taking care of the kids.  I was the youngest of her children.
Speaker 1: Now I heard in those days that it was against policy for a woman to teach after they were--she was, she was married.
Speaker 2: Maybe that--
Speaker 1: So that might have been part of--
Speaker 2: That could very well have been.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: But in a lot of locales that's a, actually a rule you know and it was common in those days.
Speaker 2: That's interesting.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 143072
Speaker 1: So well any rate let's--let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Willie, W-I-L-L-I-E David, D-A-V-I-D Hobson, H-O-B-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is April 18th, 1892.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: In Ballsville, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you know any more about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: I know nothing about his parents except their name.  They were both deceased before I was born.  He never really talked about them.  His father's name was David and his mother's name was Paige.
Speaker 1: Now were they--
Speaker 2: The only thing I remember him really telling me, I knew his sisters and brothers, I knew all of them.  They were like--the only thing I remember him talking about was they had an older brother, I think the oldest who left home when he was very small and they never heard from him again.  So no one never knew what happened to him.
Speaker 1: So was he grown when he left home?
Speaker 2: I believe he was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did they--
Speaker 2: Well you know grown at that time I think was you know if you're a teenager, late teens, they considered, you left home 'cause my older sister and brother left home at sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did they, did your father's family own their own land?
Speaker 2: I don't--I'm not sure.  I don't believe they did because--well if they did I'm not aware of it.  But my father bought property and matter of fact, just last year I found my--I lost my brother [Henry Hobson] last year, my oldest brother, and he had some papers and I found the deed to the property that he bought in 1928 I believe or some time or other, like, it was like thirty some acres for five hundred dollars.  So he bought a piece of property but I don't believe his parents owned property prior to that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he bought--
Speaker 2: But he may have, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: There's a piece of property that he owned but I don't know whether he got it from--it's a small lot that they had a store on for a while when he was young.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So his parents had a store?
Speaker 2: There was a store that he ran.  I don't know if his parents had that store or not.  But for my--I heard my brother talk about it.  I--he didn't have it when I was born when I grew up.
Speaker 1: So your father operated a store?
Speaker 2: Early, but he wasn't operating it by the time I was born.  He was primarily doing farming then.  So I don't know why he got rid of the store.  It was prior to my birth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he didn't really talk about it.  My brother [Willie Hobson, Jr.] talked some about it.  He remembered having, him having that store.  My oldest brother was ten years older than, than me.
Story_ID: 143073
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did your father [Willie Hobson] discuss growing up at all, what it was like for him?
Speaker 2: No, he never talked about his childhood.
Speaker 1: Now did he--you said he didn't really have a chance to go very far in school.
Speaker 2: No, he only went to third grade, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I guess interesting then, not like now, kids never asked a lot of questions.  You didn't--it was like prying.  You didn't ask your parents about much of anything.  I don't know why, but--and if they shared I guess that's what they chose to share with you.
Speaker 1: Did they--so they didn't talk about their people at all really except the ones that were living at the time?
Speaker 2: The ones that were living or ones that were away.  They didn't really talk a lot about other family members.  Like I never heard my father talk about his parents [David Hobson and Paige Hobson].  He'd talk about his siblings and maybe some other family members that were--because he lived in Ballsville [Virginia] for a while but he also spent a number of years in Riverhead, New York working up there and he'd work up there in the summer and come to Virginia in the winter and work or vice versa, go to Riverhead in the winter and work the farm in the summer, spring and summer.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did he do that when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's something he had done in the past?
Speaker 2: He did it before I was born.
Speaker 1: So Riverhead, New York.
Speaker 2: Riverhead, New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you say Boston [Massachusetts] (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, Riverhead, New York.  He was--my father was--my mother [Arnetha Hobson] was my father's second wife so he had--his first wife died when--of course my--he had two kids by his first wife, my half brother and sister, Henry and Everia [ph.] and they were, they lived in Riverhead, New York then.  So he moved to Virginia after that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he had two, two children in Riverhead--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that--okay.
Story_ID: 143074
Speaker 1: All right, now is there, is there a story that's told about how they [Lambert's parents, Arnetha Hobson and Willie Hobson] met?
Speaker 2: When I was writing my book I didn't know how they really met.  I went to Ballsville [Virginia] and talked to this guy.  He's still alive.  Matter of fact, Porter [ph.] is ninety-two now.  I think if anybody knew the history, he lived there all his life, he knew.  And he said they met when my mother came to teach in Ballsville she was living with a family there and it was customary for the young men to look out for the teachers.  So my father would offer to give my mother a ride home in his buggy from school.  So he, according to Porter, that's how they met.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, okay so he would give her a ride home in his buggy, that's interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is--so was it the fact that they had the same last name, did that play any role in their meeting and--?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  And it's kind of interesting, there were three sets of Hobsons in that Ballsville/Mohemenko [sic Mowhemencho, Virginia] area you know within a twenty mile radius so to speak and they weren't related.  There, cause there's no--they found--at least no one knew of it, that there was any commonality in the families.  There was another guy who lived about ten or fifteen miles from us and he, matter of fact his name was Willie Hobson also.  But I was never told that there was any relationship.  He--we didn't act like he was a part of the family anyway, so I don't know who he was I mean except that his name was the same as my mother's family, last name Hobson.  And I don't know whether that raised some questions--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in the family on whether this is another arm of the family or what.  But that was never dis--they never talked about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was told once that all Hamptons are related to Hampton Rooms [ph.].
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: But I mean you know, we don't know the truth of that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know it's not empirically true but there's probably some truth to it.
Speaker 2: It could be, yeah.
Speaker 1: So there could be a Hobson place where they all--
Speaker 2: Where they all originated and they--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --all went off into different places, who knows.
Speaker 1: But that's speculation of course but you know I guess some research could be done to find out you know.  But, so that's how they met and so they, they got married in 1928.
Speaker 2: January 1928.
Story_ID: 143075
Speaker 1: And he [Lambert's father, Willie Hobson] bought thirty acres of land that same year.
Speaker 2: I think it was that same year or he--it was either right after they got married or right before they got married.  I don't remember the exact dates on the deed but I know it was right in that time frame.  And my grandfather [John Hobson] built the house.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this--
Speaker 2: And the house was--the land he bought was I'd say a mile or so off the main highway and I used to ask my mother [Arnetha Hobson] why she allowed my daddy to put her back in the woods like that?  Because the roads were not paved so when it rained it was a real disaster to try to go anywhere.  You couldn't drive anywhere and her only reply was the land was just much cheaper then, back there.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have to cut through somebody else's property to get back to--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We had to have a right of way.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, but, but he did buy a place with the intent, we, we must assume, of establishing his home?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 143076
Speaker 1: So when you, when you think about your parents' [Arnetha Hobson and Willie Hobson] personalities, their dispositions, their talents, their looks, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My mother.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: I think my personality is very much like my mother.  As far as looks, I don't know.  I may be a combination of what I look--some people tell me I look like my mother and some folks say I look like a mixture of the two of them.  But I think my drive or ambitions is something, my mother, and my mother was a very calm, unassuming person and she could deal with a lot of issues and not get too frustrated with it.  And I have that trait to some extent except when I get really upset and I'm really upset.  Maybe I took that from my father.  But I think I have more of my mother's traits.  I think I and my, a brother [Clyde Hobson] who's next, was next to me, I think both of us are very much like our mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My two older siblings, my oldest sister [Everia Hobson] and my older brother [Henry Hobson] I think are very much like my father.
Story_ID: 143077
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now how many siblings do you have and where do you fall in there (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I'm the youngest.  I had the, the two I guess half- half-brother and half-sister, I have those two and then my mother [Arnetha Hobson] had five children, a sister who was eleven years older than me and I have a brother who was ten years older, one who was six years older and the other one was eighteen months I believe.
Speaker 1: Could you name them and give us their order?
Speaker 2: Which order you want, descending or ascending?
Speaker 1: Descending I guess.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Henry was my half-brother, Henry Hobson and his sister, my half-sister whose name was Everia [ph.].  My sister, my whole sister, Hattie, her name was Hattie Paige and I'm glad I didn't come first cause she was named after both grandparents [sic, grandmothers].  I don't like either name.  And my brother was Willie, then a brother named Weldon [ph.] and my brother next to me was Clyde [ph.].  And there are only two of us alive now.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So that was the household basically that you grew up in, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, but you know it's--I only remember my two brothers next to me.  I only remember them being home because my sister and my older brother left home at the age of sixteen, and I was all what five or I was six, so I don't remember much about them being in the household.  But I remember my brother who was next--my two brothers next to me, I remember them very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did any of your grandparents live with you?  I mean did--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause it was your mother's grandparents [sic, parents, Hattie Hobson and John Hobson] that were still alive and they were--?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were al--they died when I was about fourteen, thirteen.  They died a year, about a year apart.  I think I was around thirteen, fourteen when they passed.
Story_ID: 143078
Speaker 1: Okay.  So do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Earliest?  Yeah it's interesting, I don't remember a lot with, like four and five years old I don't remember much about those years.  I remember going, when I started going to school and my brother [Clyde Hobson] tells us stories which I think it may be a book about how I almost got killed by a tree when my father [Willie Hobson] was out cutting wood, but I don't remember that.  He said I was about five when that happened.
Speaker 1: Well what happened?
Speaker 2: My father used to cut pulp wood and he had my brothers to go out and help him.  So on this particular day my mother [Arnetha Hobson] decided that she would go out and help and she took me along and told my sister [Hattie Paige Hobson] to watch me.  Well my sister decided she was going out to do something else and they cut back--dad was cutting down this tree and the tree came down and it, he said it missed me like that.  Just fell just where I was sitting on the stump and the tree fell right in front or right in back of me.  My sister was roaming off somewhere.  So my mother never went back into the woods again to help with the pulp wood.  But I don't remember that story.  He told me, he used to tell me about it.
Story_ID: 143079
Speaker 1: I remember going to school, elementary school.
Speaker 2: Now where did you start school?
Speaker 1: I went to a four room schoolhouse, Ballsville Elementary School [Ballsville, Virginia].  We, we walked to school.  We had a teacher named Mrs. Green, Mrs. Sadie Green [ph.], who taught first, second and third grade.  And Mrs. Howell, Annie Howell [ph.] taught fourth, fifth and sixth grade.  So you, if you were in Mrs. Green's class you were in first grade.  Of course we, all in one room and one row of students was first grade and then second grade, third grade.  So you heard what was going on in all the other classes.  So about the time you got to third grade you should really know something about what went on because you were involved in those classes and the same thing with fourth, fifth and sixth grade.  So we went to Ballsville Elementary School [Ballsville, Virginia] for the first six years and then we--we walked to school there.  Then we went to Pocahontas School for seventh grade which we had to ride the school bus there.  That was about probably fifteen minute--miles away.  And for high school which was eighth through twelfth grade, we went to Pocahontas High School [Powhatan County, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And my school was, was extreme--very small.  Of course the town was small.  The whole high school was 128 students.
Story_ID: 143080
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how close was your nearest neighbor in Ballsville, Virginia?
Speaker 2: My aunt lived, she lived on the same road that we did, just up the hill maybe quarter of a mile.  And after that it was, the next neighbor was probably--the family that we had a right of way, the family they lived in, on a house just at the beginning of the road that led to our house and the next neighbor was probably about a quarter of a mile down from them.  So they were all I guess a walking distance but we did a lot of walking in those days so the distances didn't seem that long to us.
Story_ID: 143081
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now we always ask this question now, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights, probably basically animals that you'd see, you know birds flying around.  You may see squirrels or rabbits, animals running around, wild animals you'd see.  Sounds, again birds, I particularly remember the sounds of birds, farm animal sounds.  Smell, I guess on the negative side the animal smell, but on the positive side, the smell of my mom [Arnetha Hobson] cooking.  I remember when we'd come home from school.  When my mother went to, when she went back to work if she was not home when I came from school it was an entirely different feel than the days that she was home cause whenever she was home when I came home, she was al--there was always the smell of something that she was making.  She made homemade bread on a regular basis.  My dad [Willie Hobson] wanted hot rolls like every day and I used to get so sick of hot rolls and after I left home I wished for them many, many a day.  And so she did all--everything was--we raised everything we ate pretty much.  We had a garden so she cooked fresh vegetables and we had fruit trees and even grew wheat and we had the wheat ground into flour so we made our own flour.  We had cows, we had--made our own milk, butter, so we had--
Speaker 1: How many cows did you--?
Speaker 2: Usually just two, two or three.  And we had, we raised pigs, chickens.
Speaker 1: Horses I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah we had two, two or three horses, used the horses for farming.  They did you know plowing so it was a, not an easy life.  Of course I didn't like growing up on the farm.  It wasn't--it was hard work.  My father raised tobacco which was his main crop and we had to work the fields.
Speaker 1: So you were the baby of the family?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now did you get any slack because you were the baby of the family in terms of doing--?
Speaker 2: They say I did.  But as far as the farming was concerned, one thing I learned soon that everybody was out there working.  Somebody had to--there had to be meals so I very quickly volunteered to cook instead of going into the farm.  And I learned very early also that my father was very, very strict about his garden and he wanted to be sure that it was--you know I didn't do anything to mess up the garden.  Well if you go out and do something to mess up the garden somehow and he'd make you go, get out or I'd go out in the back of the field and break leaves on the tobacco and he'd get real upset and send me home.  So I found, quickly found ways to not have to work on the farm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now did school--did you have like a radio out there?
Speaker 2: Radio, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: We had a radio.  We didn't get electricity till I was about eight and we finally did get a television, refrigerator.  But we had radio but I guess we didn't have radio until, I don't know what--did they have radios that didn't run on electricity?  I don't remember.
Story_ID: 143082
Speaker 1: Now did you say earlier that, that someone helped build the house?  I mean did they build the house themselves or--?
Speaker 2: My grandfather [John Hobson] built the house.
Speaker 1: Your grandfather built it, okay.  Now that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a carpenter.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That sounds like you know when you say that now it really sounds like a--it really sounds important.  I mean you know somebody actually built a house.
Speaker 2: We, and we had a--our house was kind of unique.  We had a square house.  It had four rooms downstairs, four rooms upstairs.  It sat off the ground about this high and my brother [Clyde Hobson] and I used to play under the house.  That was our playground which was kind of interesting.  But--and when he built the house he--downstairs we had a kitchen, a dining room, a living room and what we used to call a pantry or--my mother [Arnetha Hobson] used to put can foods and little small pantry and then a bigger, little bigger, she called it her sewing room.  And upstairs there were four bedrooms and another room that they had hid, a small room he had built for a bathroom.  We never got the bathroom.  We always called it the bathroom but it--we just stored stuff in there.  And I guess it's like if you're building a house if you don't do it all then you never really get it done.  So we never had a bathroom put in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we had an outhouse.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So let's see, how--so did you get a lot of--did you get a lot of newspapers or magazines or that sort of thing to--?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  I got, I think the only magazines I got--and my mother [Arnetha Hobson] used to subscribe to the Readers Digest.  I remember her getting the Readers Digest and you know I'd read that.  And I had a cousin who lived down there where my grandparents lived and she was a--probably seven or eight years older than me and she used to read magazines.  She'd get magazines and when I'd go to visit them I'd always get her used magazines and I'd read those.
Story_ID: 143083
Speaker 1: Now did you--I, I take it you liked school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And well was it good to have a school teacher for a mother at home to help you with your school work?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She [Lambert's mother, Arnetha Hobson] was a--and she was very encouraging and very supportive of school.  And that, sometimes that was a conflict between she and my dad [Willie Hobson] because he didn't think school was as important as she thought it was.  And my older sibling, my older brother [Henry Hobson] and sister [Everia Hobson, ph.], they didn't graduate from high school.  They left home at sixteen because my brother said they spent most of their time working.  And he had us working on the farm some too.  He'd keep us out of school to work the tobacco until my brother and I one day just decided we wasn't going to do it anymore.  And we got up enough nerve to tell him we wasn't going to stay and he didn't kill us for it.  So--and he--interestingly enough he never tried to keep us out after that.  And I believe I must have been in maybe I was eighth or ninth grade then.  But then it was so funny seeing--I don't know whether--get some feeling.  Almost every time he decided to keep us out of school was a day we were scheduled to have a test so we'd miss tests and the teacher wasn't very happy about that.  So we just decided we--and I think my mother probably interceded on our behalf on--she'd say you really need to stop keeping the kids out of school.  They need to get their education.  Well he finally, I believe he finally realized that maybe that is something important cause my other three siblings, Weldon, Clyde and I, we all did finish high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did any of your siblings go to college?
Speaker 2: No.  I'm the only one who went to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did--
Speaker 2: And my dad was real proud of all of that.  He just thought that was really great.
Story_ID: 143084
Speaker 1: Now, now did your mother [Arnetha Hobson] handle the business in the household or did--?
Speaker 2: You mean the--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, since she was the more literate of the two?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father [Willie Hobson] wasn't going to trust anybody with his money.  He may not have been very educated but he could count very well.  So you could, you never know--you never knew what--how much money he had.  He never shared that and he was always secretive about it.  I remember when he passed away in 1975, my brother very jokingly said let me go look at papa's bank book and see did he have money when I asked him to buy me that car?  And he looked at it and said, no he really didn't have it.  But he managed to take care of the--provide our food.  We didn't have a lot of luxury things or extra things but I can't say we never went hungry or went without food but he was rather frugal.  We called, we--I guess frugal may be the right term.  We called him cheap.  But that's cause we probably couldn't get things we wanted then.  And since my mother wasn't working she relied a lot on him providing the needs of the household.  But she did, my mother made some major sacrifices to go to work at times when I was, maybe I was ten, eleven years old, I broke my front tooth learning to ride a bicycle and my mother took me to the dentist.  He had to pull my tooth.  And my dad was going to just let it stay out but my mother said she could not let me grow up as a teenager with my front tooth missing, so she went to work.  Went, took a job with a family in Richmond [Virginia], went down during the week and came home on weekends so she could pay to get my tooth fixed.  And another time I think she had to go to the hospital and my dad wasn't--didn't seem willing to pay the bill so she went to work to pay her hospital bill after she went in the hospital.  So she made those kinds of sacrifices to--for things that she felt were really important to the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now they established their household right at the beginning of the [Great] Depression, right, 1928.  Yeah, the stock market crashed in '29 [1929] and the next ten years were supposed to be rough until the war.  But, so they were used to being--
Speaker 2: Right, and I guess I didn't--and maybe--some people experience this today.  When you've lived in a situation where you always had to be very frugal and work to make ends meet, when things get tough there's not a major change.  You're doing what you've always done, maybe a little bit more but I think the people who are impacted more by that are people who have had things much better and this has been a real impact on them.  So I'm--they never talked about the Depression being a real hardship for them.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think you're making a good point that for a lot of poor people it was no difference.
Speaker 2: Right, it was just the same.
Story_ID: 143085
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you were in school did you have a particular subject that you liked better than others?
Speaker 2: I liked all of them.  I liked, you know, reading.  I, I, I did, I liked all my subjects.  And I guess we had limited subjects first of all.  We didn't have a lot of resources.  We got very few courses, hand me down books from the white schools.  And in high school for instance, I had never taken you know algebra and trigonometry, those courses, just math and basic chemistry.  And I enjoyed most--I guess math I liked a lot, English, very good at those subjects.  But I was good in all of my subjects.  I was, I made A's and B's in most of my courses, I may have a few C's scattered.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have a favorite teacher or any favorite teachers or mentors in that neighborhood?
Speaker 2: I would probably say that Ms. Hatticris [ph.] was one of my favorite teachers.  She taught seventh grade.
Speaker 1: Now that's a Pocahontas [School, Powhatan County, Virginia], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well I guess yeah it was Pocahontas.  And then I had an eighth grade teacher--eighth grade was a part of high school but it was pretty much we had homeroom teachers.  And I--we actually took all my classes from this eighth grade teacher and it was the ninth grade where we did, began to have different teachers.  We had homeroom teachers but then we had other teachers for some of the other courses but I also was--I played sports in high school [at Pocahontas High School, Powhatan County, Virginia], basketball, softball.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sang in the choir, was in the drama club.  I was in most, any activity that I could find.  I was--usually in it in some way.
Story_ID: 143086
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was, was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We had to go to Sunday school every Sunday.  We had--only had church once a month, country church.  I don't know whether you remember any of that from--parents from Kentucky.  We only had church once a month because at that time pastors would pastor more than one church and they'd have one church this Sunday and another church another Sunday.  So our Sunday was the first Sunday.  So we went to church on first Sunday but church was a social outlet.  You saw all your friends and you'd get together after church and go visit each other.  People did a lot more visiting then, just drop in.  That was, it was fun but yeah just getting together with other young people in the neighborhood.  We usually did that on Sundays.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sunday afternoon after you go to church.
Speaker 1: And what was the--?
Speaker 2: We'd leave church and my cousin (unclear) my best friend, they lived right down the road from the church and I'd leave Sunday school, go to her house and we'd eat whatever.  She lived with her grandparents.  We'd eat whatever they cooked and then she'd go to my house and we'd eat whatever my parents [Arnetha Hobson and Willie Hobson] had cooked.  Then we walked back to her house so back and forth to the houses.  We got lots of exercise just walking, play, played outside all the time.  We got much more I think exercise than kids today.  We didn't have indoor games or you couldn't sit in front of the TV, you had to go outside.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Mt. Pero, P-E-R-O, Baptist Church [Mt. Pero Baptist Church, Powhatan, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: My mother was very active in the church.  My father went.  He wasn't very active.  He went to church but he never went to Sunday school, but my mother went to Sunday school and she worked, she worked with the choir and she was a missionary.
Story_ID: 143087
Speaker 1: Are there any stories from growing up about something that happened in the community that you took note of?  You know that--well did, did you all get information about the Civil Rights Movement you know (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.  My mother [Arnetha Hobson] was very active with NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and she worked at the polls during election.  Both of my parents voted, always.  They had poll tax during those days but they always paid their poll tax and went to vote so she was active with those organizations.  And I don't know that there was a lot of civil rights activity in our little town [Ballsville, Virginia].  The racists got along okay.  They weren't--they just didn't interact that much.  The men did to some extent.  The men would interact.  There was, there were two little country stores and during the evening the men would get together at the store, black and white and they'd just sit out and talk.  But after that they each went their separate ways and everyone knew their place I guess, the way they put it.  So it wasn't a lot of racial tension.  I'm trying to think.  There were a couple of incidents where a--that I remember where a, a, I believe it was a black guy and a white guy got real, got fighting and I forgot which one killed the other one but that was a big issue.  I think the--
Speaker 1: Well someone was killed?
Speaker 2: Somebody was killed, yeah, yes.  Sam Taylor, Clayton [ph.], that was a big issue then and I don't remember the deal.  I was small but I remember them talking about this murder that had occurred.  That was big news in a town that size.
Speaker 1: Now how were you treated when you went into town?
Speaker 2: Town?  What town?
Speaker 1: Was there a town to go to?
Speaker 2: No.  (Laughter).  I told you we had two country stores.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: There were two country stores and a post office.
Speaker 1: So that was Ballsville [Virginia], that was it huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah that was it.  That was it.  We had a post office, two country stores and the church.   That was "the town."  The post office was run by two sisters and the mail man would--we got--we'd walk to the post office.  The big event of the day was going to the post office to pick up the mail.
Speaker 1: Now were these all black people running these uh--?
Speaker 2: No, these were white people that ran all these.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The two stores were run by, owned by whites.  There was a Dan--one family was named Dandridge [ph.] and the other one was Netherland [ph.].  And interesting enough, I wonder how they did any business in that little town.  They were about as far from here, not much further from here to the street from each other.  They were located very close together.  And then the post office was near one of the stores.  Those were, those--that was it in that little town.
Speaker 1: And what, did they sell--?
Speaker 2: Everything.
Speaker 1: They sold everything.  Yeah I was getting to that.
Speaker 2: You know food, I remember going there, we'd buy my shoes.  And I remember they would, they'd find out what size shoe you wear.  You'd just trace your foot on a piece of cardboard.  They'd match your shoe up to fit your foot.  That's, I remember doing that.  They sold some clothe--but most clothes if you had to buy extensive clothes we'd go to, have to go to Richmond [Virginia]. That was a big deal taking the Greyhound bus to Richmond.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Would the store, the bus just stop in town?
Speaker 2: Yes, there was a bus that went into town.  I think it stopped at Netherland's store about six o'clock in the morning and it came back at night about six.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you know everything was segregated then so you had to sit in the back of the bus.  That's the only time we rode the bus.
Speaker 1: No restaurants or anything to--?
Speaker 2: No restaurants.
Speaker 1: And were blacks treated differently in the store than the white people?
Speaker 2: You mean in Ballsville?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  They didn't really hang around in the store and I think they used to go there and buy stuff on credit, I remember that.  I'm not sure how that worked, whether that always turned out to be what you really owed or whether they changed the books on you.  I've heard stories of that but I don't know whether that occurred there or not.  I think overall people were treated reasonably well.
Story_ID: 143088
Speaker 1: In terms of the radio and--did, did you have any heroes you know from the outside world that you idolized or, or people that you admired that--?
Speaker 2: I listened to the radio.  I liked all those singers you know that, on that, during that age.  I remember Etta James, who just died.  I remember [HM] Gloria Lynne, The Drifters, [The] Temptations.  When we finally did get TV, I watched 'American Bandstand.'  I remember those shows when I was probably early teens then.  I remember the--my father [Willie Hobson] loved to watch the fights and we'd go down to one of the neighbor's house to watch the fights on Wednesday night.  And he would--Joe Louis was very prominent during that time so whenever Joe Louis was fighting he wouldn't miss one of those fights.  He would actually sit there as if he was in the ring with him.  He was throwing punches and it was always fun just to watch him watch the fights.  But he would go to the store.  My cousin who lived not--lived near the church and my father would go to the store usually on Wednesday nights, I would always ask him if he would take me to my cousin's house and let me stay there while he got to the store, and frequently he did.  He'd go and sit down and talk with the men and I'd go down and visit with my cousin and he'd pick me up when he got ready to go home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was a major outing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and so they would go to the store to--for the fight to--?
Speaker 2: Just sit around.  On the, just sit on the bench outside and as people say they'd tell lies and swap stories.  See who could tell the biggest tale.  I know there was one guy in the neighborhood, his name was Miles--what was his.   Lemon Miles [ph.] was his name.  They called him Puddler [ph.], I don't know where they got that name from, but he was claimed to be a great fisherman.  He would tell all these tales about the big fish he caught.  And they told a story, I don't know whether it was true or not.  He was there talking about this big, big fish he caught.  He was talking to this guy and he didn't know who this guy was.  And he was talking about this great big fish he caught and the guy finally said, "Do you know who I am?"  And he said, "No."  He said, "I'm the game warden."  And the guy said, "Do you know who I am?"  He said, "No."  He said I'm the biggest liar in Powhatan [County, Virginia] so the guy wouldn't give him a ticket or whatever for fishing when he wasn't supposed to be fishing.  They say that's a true story.  I don't know if it is or not but he would tell all kinds of tales.  You never knew when to believe what he said.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was the center of the--
Speaker 2: He was the town liar.  And it wasn't just limited to fishing.  He just told tall tales.
Story_ID: 143089
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did--do you remember your first opportunity to, to leave Ballsville [Virginia] to go someplace else?
Speaker 2: When I finished high school [Pocahontas High School, Powhatan County, Virginia] it was the first opportunity.  I went away during my--went to Riverhead [New York] during my junior year in high school, stayed with my brother and I worked with dad [Willie Hobson] during the summer.
Speaker 1: This is New York, Riverview [sic Riverhead], New York?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I worked for a family.  I was--a live-in family.  I lived and worked, took care of their kids which is kind of interesting.  I think I was seventeen and the kids were twelve and thirteen.  I don't know why they needed somebody to take care of them but I fixed their lunch and take them to the pool and that kind of stuff or go with them to the pool and monitor them.  I did that for a summer that I was seventeen and then I came back and finished my senior year in high school, then left Ballsville and went to New York City [New York].
Story_ID: 143090
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now Pocahontas High School [Powhatan County, Virginia]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --was, was in--was that in Ballsville [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: That was in Powhatan County [Virginia], Powhatan.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's in Powhatan.  So that--how, how long of a ride was that from home or--?
Speaker 2: About maybe a half an hour ride, rode the school bus.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now when you were in high school did--so students from all over the area I guess went to that school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Students from all--Powhatan County.  At that time they just, they had one high school.  No, they had two high schools, the black high school and white high school.  We had 128 students in our, the black school.  I don't know how many were in the other school.
Speaker 1: You suspect it was about an equal number of white students or--?
Speaker 2: Probably--I think there were more.
Speaker 1: More?
Speaker 2: I think there were more.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did the black students typically finish high school that started?
Speaker 2: They did, most of them did.  In my class I don't remember--there may have been--I think there was one guy dropped out in eighth grade.  There may have been one other, but--and there were twenty-eight of us who graduated.  So, but I believe most of them that started high school with me, maybe one or two did not.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And were you--so you said you were involved in sports, student council?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Were you the president or did you--?
Speaker 2: No.  I was a member of the student council and I played basketball.  I played softball.  Those were the only two sports activities we had.  What else I was involved in?  The Homemakers--I forgot the name of the, FHA, Future Homemakers of America, yeah.  I was involved in that.  I believe that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 143091
Speaker 1: So what were your dreams and aspirations in high school [at Pocahontas High School, Powhatan County, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: My dream in high school was to get off of the farm.  I had no idea what was out there 'cause I had never been any place further than Richmond [Virginia] until I was what, seventeen, the first year I went to New York.  That's the furthest I'd ever been from home.  And Riverhead [New York] was maybe a step above Powhatan [County, Virginia].  I mean that's a, was a small town too.  They did have a downtown area but it wasn't a city.
Speaker 1: Rural New York?
Speaker 2: Yes, I would say that.  Small downtown area and--but--so I didn't really know what I wanted to do.  I just knew I wanted to get off the farm and I knew there had to be something better than living on the farm.  And New--why--people asked me, "Why did you pick New York [City, New York] to go to?"  Well I'd see relatives or other people who'd come back home from New York and they looked really successful.  So I said well that must be where things are, New York.  That must be the place to go.  And I thought I could go up to New York and get a really great job, make a lot of money cause I'd done well in school.  I had typing skills and I just knew the world was waiting for me.
Speaker 1: Now did you have any counseling in high school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or was there a teacher or any--a counselor or someone that said you know you should go to college (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.  My mother [Arnetha Hobson] wanted me to go to college.  My teachers wanted me to go to college but nobody had any money to send me, you know.  And I'm fairly--I am, I'm very independent, I can be a little headstrong.  Once I decide I'm going to do something, it's what I'm going to do.  And I wasn't thinking about going to college at that time because I didn't have any money.  How was I going to go?  I'm sure there were people who could have helped me find the money.  I found the money four years later.  Why couldn't I find it earlier?  Well that wasn't on my agenda.  I just wasn't going to hear it at that time.  My mother definitely wanted me to go to college but she had absolutely no money.  She said, "Well maybe we can find a way to do it."  "No, I'm going to New York."  I'm you know, I'm eighteen and I know what I--you know how eighteen year olds are.  I wasn't any different.
Story_ID: 143092
Speaker 1: Okay. So did you have any money saved up or anything [to move to New York City, New York]?
Speaker 2: No.  I was going to go get this great job.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: But I didn't, there weren't--the job wasn't waiting for me.
Speaker 1: So how did you get to New York and--?
Speaker 2: I went to--that summer after I finished high school [Pocahontas High School, Powhatan County, Virginia], three of my classmates and I--
Speaker 1: This is what '57 [1957]?
Speaker 2: '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: '58 [1958], okay.
Speaker 2: --went to Riverhead [New York] for the summer and we took a summer job working at the resort basically as maids working to clean up.  And we just lived together that summer and just had a nice summer and then we all went in different directions.  I went to New York City and I ended up going to New York City because my sister Hattie [Paige Hobson] was there.  And did I stay with--was she there then?  I didn't live with her I lived with a cousin who had been to New York for a number of years.  And I wanted to go to New York so I--she said I could come live with her.  So I lived with her in this tiny, tiny apartment on 145th [Street] and 7th Avenue.
Speaker 1: Was it Harlem [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: In Harlem.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she had this one bedroom apartment so we had to share the bedroom.  It was so--really, really tiny, not what I expected of New York cause I had this visual idea that this big city must be great.  It was--I couldn't even find a job.  I went and I--the story I have in my book, I couldn't find a job.  I--so I finally had to take a job as a maid working for a family on 5th Avenue and I hated that.  And I said to my cousin--my cousin was working at Macy's then.  I forgot what she was doing but she was working at Macy's and I asked her about going to Macy's to find a job.  And she said well that may be a good idea.  So I went down and applied, filled out the application and the lady asked me did I have any experience and I told her no.  So she said, "We're only hiring people with experience," so I didn't get the job.  So this probably was maybe October, September/October.  And November, around the Christmas season I said, "Well I'm going back.  I'm sure they're hiring people for the Christmas season so I'm going back."  So I went back and I filled out the application again.  The lady asked me if I have any experience and I said no and she said, we're only hiring people with experience.  So this is not working.  I was really upset then cause this lady keep--I said, "Why she keep turning me down?  I can do this job but she won't give me a chance."  So I said, "Well I know what I'm going to do.  I'm going to create some experience."  So I waited a few weeks and I went back and she asked me if I had any experience, I told her yes and she let me fill out the application.  So I filled out the application.  I put down all these fictitious companies names in Richmond [Virginia] with fictitious numbers and everything and I said, "Well you know what do I have to lose?  If I tell her I have no experience she won't even let me fill out the application.  If they check my references and find out these companies don't exist, they just won't hire me."  Well they didn't check the references.  She took the application then she finally gave me the typing test and I did very well on the typing test.  And she said, "You did so well on this test I don't know if we can even afford to hire you."  And I said you know all those lies I put on my application maybe they wouldn't, but I got the job.  So that was my first job in New York at, working in the office.  I worked in the comparison shopper's office and I stayed there for a little over a year.  But I was living from hand to mouth.  I couldn't--I was making $45.00 a week and when she told me how much I was going to make, I just thought that was a lot of money.  But--and maybe it wasn't, but it was 1959, late '58 [1958], '59 [1959].  But by the time I paid car fare, I paid my rent, bought my food and bought clothes, I had one pair of shoes, always wanted a second pair.  But by the time I got enough money to buy the second pair, I had worn out the first pair.  So I promised myself if I ever got enough money I'd buy as many shoes as I wanted and I do that till this day.  So that was--I finally decided I can't live in New York living like this cause I, I'm not saving any money and this is not--doesn't look like there's much future in this job.  So my cousin who I used to live with, who I used to--the one I told you I'd go visit her a lot in Virginia, she was living in Jamaica [Queens, New York City, New York] then and she convinced me to come out, move out with her and she was doing day's work then which it wasn't glamorous but she was making more money than I was.  So I said, "Well that doesn't make sense.  I'm going to do this for a while till I can save some money."  So I did that for about a year and decided that I--New York is just not for me.  I cannot live in New York.  I moved to Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 143093
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you have relatives there?
Speaker 2: No, I knew absolutely nobody in Washington [D.C.].  You know here I go again to a place where I don't have anything.  I do things, like I did it in college too.  I'm not--it doesn't--I'm not deterred at all by going someplace where I don't know anybody.  I figure--
Speaker 1: Well why Washington?
Speaker 2: Well I wasn't going to Washington.  I went home the Christmas of '59 [1959] I think it was.  Yeah, and I just didn't know what I was going to do but I knew I couldn't stay at home and my parents [Arnetha Hobson and Willie Hobson] weren't going to let me stay at home with no job long anyway.  I had to do something.  So my brothers were home, my two brothers next to me in age were living in New Jersey, in East Orange, New Jersey.  So my oldest brother [Henry Hobson] said, "Well why don't you just come back to New Jersey with us?"  So I said okay.  And our mother didn't seem to be really happy about that.  My--they were both single.  She probably thought that wasn't a very good environment for me to be in.  But I didn't have any other options at that time.  So we left home headed for New Jersey and on the way we stopped at my aunt's house just to visit her and she asked me where I was going.  I told her I was going to New Jersey.  And she said, "Why you going to New Jersey?"  I said, "Well I don't have any other place to go.  I need--and I need to go someplace to get a job."  She said, "Well why don't you go to Washington?"  I said, "I don't know anybody in Washington."  She got on the phone and called a friend of hers who grew up in Powhatan [County, Virginia] and she knew from there and she lived in Washington.  Her husband had died a few years ago and she lived--she had a house and she had three kids there and she asked her if I could come up there and stay with them.  So my brother dropped me off in Washington and I stayed with this family and I took a government test, got a government job working at the Veteran's Administration [United States Department of Veterans Affairs] as a clerk typist.
Story_ID: 143094
Speaker 1: You were hired by the Veterans Administration [United States Department of Veterans Affairs] you said?
Speaker 2: Veterans Administration, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now was it difficult to get a job like that in [Washington] D.C.?
Speaker 2: Well I took the government test and you take a test and you pass the test and then they give you--they let you know what grade level you qualify for at that time.
Speaker 1: Civil Service and--
Speaker 2: I qualified for a GS3 [General Schedule] which was I think [GS]2 was the lowest grade and there was a GS3.  So I took this job as a clerk typist working in the veterans appeal's office.  And I remember the first day I went to that, to work, I was all excited about this job and I went in this big room, bigger than this room, with about thirty or forty people sitting at a typewriter with dictaphones over their heads.  You remember a dictaphone machine?  Okay.  And our job was to type appeals from veterans who had been injured in the war and they had gone for disability and their request had been denied and they repeal--had appealed and we had to type the reports.  I did that for a few months and I said I cannot do this the rest of my life.  I was the youngest person there.  I was, I think I was twenty at that time, you know and everybody in there had been there a number of years and everybody in there probably at least ten, fifteen years older than I was.  It was like being, I mean it was just very strict, very restrict--we had to be to work at eight o'clock which was probably--not five minutes after eight or one minute after eight, you get docked.  Everybody went to lunch at 12:30 all together, everybody came back.  No, everybody went to lunch at twelve, came back at 12:30, everybody left at exactly 4:30.  If you--even if you had finished your report that you were typing you couldn't leave.  Or if you took a little longer to do it, everybody stopped at 4:30.  You close up to be sure you're ready to get up and walk out at 4:30.  And it was--the doctors who dictated these reports were not very considerate of the fact that we didn't have medical degrees and some of these words we couldn't spell and we had to figure out how to spell them and look them up in the dictionary.  But some of them were very good, they would spell them, others would just say it and you had to spell it out.  You got graded on the accuracy of your transcription so--and you never knew when a supervisor would pick up your report and decide to see whether it was right or not and whether or not you got raises depending on how your reports were.  So--
Speaker 1: Did they provide you a dictionary to look it up?
Speaker 2: Well you had a, yeah you had a dictionary.  I think it was like in the front of the room.  You didn't have your own dictionary.  You had to go and loop up, go take time to look up these words that the--the dictionary was in the front of the room.  But it was, to me it just was such a, not demeaning but just a--the environment wasn't a great environment, at least I didn't think so.  So I said I cannot spend the rest of my life doing this.
Speaker 1: So this is 1960?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --Okay.
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty [1960].
Story_ID: 143095
Speaker 1: So I started, I was living--the family I was living with, she had a nephew with her who was going to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] at night and I started hanging out with him and his friends and they were all in college.  And I said this college life is kind of interesting.  You're having a lot of fun and going to school.  I said maybe I--that's what I need to be doing.  So that's really when I finally got motivated to go to college cause I couldn't find a decent job and I--it looks like going to school may be the bridge that I need.  So I started D.C. [District of Columbia] Teachers College [later, University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] at night while I was working at the Veterans Administration [United States Department of Veterans Affairs].  I went on--first semester I went Monday and Wednesday and I think I took six hours and then the next semester I went Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and I took nine hours.  So I'd leave work at 4:30, ride the bus up to the school, I'd get out at 9:00, ride the bus across town which took me almost an hour to get home.  Then I'd have to do my homework and get up and go to work at 8 o'clock and I decided that was really kind of hard.  I'd be a long time finishing school at that rate.  So I finally talked to my cousin who probably had been talking--every time he'd see me that he'd tell me I'd be in college and I got tired of him telling me that.  I tried to avoid him whenever I could 'cause I didn't want to hear it anymore.  He'd gone to school right out of high school and he didn't have any more money than I did.  So I said well he--there must be a way that he did this so he helped me apply for scholarships and loans at Howard and I started Howard in 1962, four years after I graduated from high school.  And I went with--I had a scholarship and I had a, at that time they had the National Defense [Student] Loans which were like 3 percent interest and I worked part time the whole time I was there.  So I went there and I finished in, I finished in about four years.  I think I did transfer either nine or twelve of some of my hours from D.C. Teachers, either nine or twelve hours.
Story_ID: 143096
Speaker 1: Now wa- what--had your father [Willie Hobson] been a vet?  Was he a veteran of the war?
Speaker 2: Who, my--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, your father.
Speaker 2: My--who?
Speaker 1: Your father?
Speaker 2: My father?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, cause I remember those days they would give you the defense loan [National Defense Student Loan] if somebody in your family were a veteran or something. But--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: They didn't ask you that?
Speaker 2: Um-um.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: No, they didn't--I don't remember that being associated with any kind of [U.S.] Military cause nobody in my mili--nobody in my family had--my brother was in the Military but I, I'm trying to think if--yeah, if--
Speaker 1: I believe they were pretty strict about it too so that's why I was wondering why, you know--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't remember what all the requirements were but I do remember--and I'm sure it was National Defense [Student] Loan 'cause I remember it had low interest rates.
Speaker 1: Cause now-a-days it doesn't make any difference but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I don't know that kind of, that--probably National Defense Loan doesn't even exist anymore [sic, now known as Federal Perkins Loan], I don't believe.
Speaker 1: Right, okay. All right, so were--you got the National Defense Loan and--
Speaker 2: I got a scholarship from Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and I had a part time job.
Speaker 1: Okay, where did you work?
Speaker 2: I got a job through the placement office at Howard and my first job I was working for a guy who was a research, a scientific researcher and he just needed somebody to type his reports up.  So I worked for him three or four days a week for about three hours.  And then when I first went there, I--when I, I left VA [the Veterans Administration, United States Department of Veterans Affairs] for, before I started Howard.  I went to Peace Corps for a year. And when I first started at Howard, the lady I worked with at Peace Corps arranged to let me work part time at Peace Corps.  But then her superiors decided that after about a semester that I couldn't do that anymore and that's when I got this other job.  And--
Speaker 1: Now are there any stories from Peace Corps that are interesting or--cause it was a brand new, I know initiative or--
Speaker 2: Right, it was a--
Speaker 1: --New Frontier, the [President John F.] Kennedy administration and all that.
Speaker 2: No interesting stories.  It's--people would come back about the places they went and I almost applied to go to Morocco.  And I remember, I'm trying to think of the guy who was the director.  It was a black guy that was over there, can't think of his name now.
Speaker 1: In Morocco?
Speaker 2: He was head of that division.  I can't remember any unique stories about Peace Corps.  It was just starting at that time under the Kennedy administration.  So when that happened I applied for, I went to the employment office on campus and the lady there got me a job.  She was really good to me the whole time I was there.  She always helped me get summer jobs and jobs during the year.  But after my--during my sophomore year, a professor who really became my mentor while I was at Howard, he hired me as his student assistant so I did that until I graduated.  And I did some extra work with him--
Speaker 1: So is this William Taylor Fitzhugh.
Speaker 2: Naylor Fitzhugh [Dr. Howard Naylor Fitzhugh].  Naylor Fitzhugh.
Speaker 1: Naylor Fitzhugh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.
Story_ID: 143097
Speaker 1: Now how did you decide your, your major?  What did--?
Speaker 2: When I went [to Howard University, Washington, D.C.] I had no idea what I was going to major in, I just wanted to go.  And I took this introduction to business course from [H.] Naylor Fitzhugh and he convinced me to major in business.  And he also convinced me to major in marketing but afterwards I wished I had majored in accounting 'cause I really didn't like marketing.  But he taught all the marketing courses.  That was his field and at that time I thought it was a good idea.  I took accounting courses but--I took two or three accounting courses but I majored in business because he sort of encouraged me and inspired me to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay. And tell us a little bit about him 'cause he has a special history.
Speaker 2: He was a kind of unique person I would say.  He--do you know a lot about him, you know something about him?  I mean--
Speaker 1: Something about him.
Speaker 2: Okay, he--
Speaker 1: I know he was a Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] graduate.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he--Harvard Business School in 1933 I believe, so he probably could have done some other--although there wasn't a lot of opportunity available to him when he finished.  But as time went on some opportunities opened up.  But he was very committed to stay at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and help build up business, develop business department there.  He wasn't the head of it but he stayed there thirty years and he had a number of other offers while he was there.  But he was really committed to making sure that the students there got a good training background in business.  He was a great teacher.  I think he made sure you developed your mind and be analytical and he used the case method of studying that they used at Harvard.  He used that at Howard in all of his classes, much simpler cases but you had to analyze cases, not just read a book and go true and false.  He made sure we got a chance to see business in operation.  Every year there was a business field trip that we'd go away.  We'd leave like on Thursday and go for, stay over Friday and over the weekend to visit different companies.  I remember once we went to Detroit [Michigan] and we went to General Motors and all those places.  But he always had connections for us to do that.  And he challenged his students a lot.  And he was a motivator in a very quiet sense of the word.  He didn't really push you.  He always would ask you questions or present things to you as if it really came from you.  You arrived at this conclusion on your own but by the time he got through asking really pointed questions, he made sure you had given it a lot of thought.  So he was a very, I would say he's one of the best teachers I've had and that includes Howard and Harvard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So William Naylor Fitzhugh.
Speaker 2: No, H. Naylor Fitzhugh.
Speaker 1: H. Naylor Fitzhugh, okay.
Speaker 2: What did the H stand for?  Howard.
Speaker 1: Howard Naylor Fitzhugh.  Okay, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Howard.  But he never used Howard much.  It was--he always used that initial.
Speaker 1: H. Naylor Fitzhugh?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right.  I've got it written here and I keep saying William for some reason.  I don't know why--
Speaker 2: You're going to make him William anyway?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm making him William.  But so he's, he's your mentor at, at Howard?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he's the reason I went to Harvard.
Story_ID: 143098
Speaker 1: At Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] when you were there, you were, you were there from '62 [1962] until--?
Speaker 2: '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Til '66 [1966].  Now this is a time when there was a lot of activist activity at Howard.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: I think Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] was on campus and a lot of people.  What was--?
Speaker 2: I think most of that happened after I left 'cause I know things didn't--
Speaker 1: No, that was when you were there?
Speaker 2: It was during the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Early--?
Speaker 1: Right, right, SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and all that in '64, [1964] '65 [1965], that's, yeah--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, I think you're--I don't--well I didn't, wasn't that much involved.  I wasn't on campus a lot because quite frankly, by the time I went to class, as soon as I got out of class, I had to go to work.  And I lived off campus so I wasn't as involved in campus life as I would like to have been or as I wish I had been really.  But that wasn't a choice I had with having to finance my own education and try to get out of there in four years.  So I took a full load and worked part-time.
Speaker 1: Okay, well that's real.  That's what, you know--so you were busy.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Very bu- very bu- very busy--
Story_ID: 143099
Speaker 1: And I did, of course I did some extracurricular activities [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  That was one of the things that [H. Naylor] Fitzhugh encouraged too.  He said that was important to make you a better student.  So by the time I did my, my marketing club, business club, I was president of the business club for a couple of years, the marketing club and by the time I did those activities and went to school and went to work, I didn't have a lot of time left for--to be involved in other campus activities.  And I think it's a lot different too being really involved in what's going on in campus if you don't live on campus because I think a lot of--knowing what's going on happens with kids in the, you know living in the dorm and they're talking about what's going on.  But if you leave class and have to go catch the bus and go home and not hanging around campus a lot, you miss some of that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So when you started, you were a little older--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --had already worked, were working.
Speaker 1: And I had a very clear goal for being there.  I had a real clear idea why I was there from day one.  Not that some other students don't but I think a lot of students come, maybe their first year they're not quite as focused on where they need to go but I knew exactly what I needed to do over the next few years.  So my motivation may have been a bit different.  And it's amazing I think at that point, four years difference in age doesn't seem a lot you know now at our age, but at that eighteen, twenty year old, four years' difference is a quite a big difference in your, your thinking and your, maybe your focus.
Story_ID: 143100
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were there any other students or teachers at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] that stand out when you look back on your experiences at Howard?
Speaker 2: I remember a lot of them.  Some of them stand out positive, some negative.  [Laughter].  In the business department, I had some good teachers.  There was a business law teacher I remember [Joseph] Joe Urciolo, he was a--I enjoyed his class, thought he was a good teacher.  Even the guy that (unclear)--
Speaker 1: How do you spell Urciolo's name?
Speaker 2: U-R-I--Urc--U-R-C-I-L-O.  Urci--U-R-C-I-O-L-O, Urciolo, Joseph Urciolo.  My accounting teacher, I--he had a funny name, I can't remember his name.  He was head of the department.  He taught accounting.  He was an unusual kind of guy.  He was very tall and very straight and had some kind of accent but I can't remember his name.  And I remember my physical science teacher.  Physical science was a required course and I did not like--science was probably the only course I didn't really like a lot, difficult.  We used to call--the area where the sciences courses were taught, I can't--we called Death Valley.  [Laughter].
Speaker 1: Yeah, my daughter just came out of Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and she was--she walked me through Death Valley last spring.
Speaker 2: Oh really?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Death Valley and I was scared to death of taking this course.  And he was known to be a difficult teacher.  And I remember he--we had a classroom, a lecture hall, over a hundred students there.  He's on the board writing all these formulas and I wasn't the only person lost in there but I was so lost in that class I said I have got to do something.  And I went to talk to him because I just didn't understand anything he was saying and he gave me a project to do.  He said well you can do a project in there.  And I got my cousin to help me do--I--we bought this kit and we developed this, a radio, sound and stuff.  And when I went to show it to him I said oh my god, I hope this works.  Please let this work.  I went and hooked it up and turned the knob and you know music came out and he smiled and he says, that's really good and I got a B out of the class.  So I, but I was, I just was lost and I thought he was a very--I was--didn't think he was as approachable as he was when I went to talk to him.  He was very easy to talk to.  So I remember him as being a person who I feared a lot and really found I--was fairly compassionate when it came to helping a student who wanted help.  So I remember those two, those teachers and [H. Naylor] Fitzhugh of course is the one I remember most.
Story_ID: 143101
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you generally find Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] to be a helpful place I mean for a student that--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I, I, I, I, I would say yes although I wasn't around a lot.  I do remember you know teachers were good and I remember this lady in the employment office who I found very helpful.  I always found summer jobs and again I'm always, every summer I'm running off doing something really crazy and she sort of sometimes would try to look out for me.  My first year--after my freshman year I went to Atlantic City [New Jersey] to get a job as a waitress cause my cousin who helped me get the app--he told me you could make a lot of money up there working as a waitress.  Well I'd never been to Atlantic City, I didn't know anybody there.  I didn't have a job, didn't have a place to stay.  But I figured, hey, I get there I can find a place to stay and I can get a job.  So I took the bus up there, put my clothes in a locker and went around looking for a place to stay and I was have--I had difficulty.  It weren't as many places available as I thought.  And I finally--this lady, I finally went and knocked on her door and it was getting dark.  And she said, "I basically rented my room but it's kind of late for you to be out looking for a place."  She let me stay there for a few days and then I found a place.  And then I went out looking for a job and I wanted to be a waitress, but I'd never been a waitress before but I didn't see where that was a problem.  I figured it's a fairly easy job so I applied a couple of places, they turned me down.  I finally went to this one place, Seaside Hotel and I never--the guy that was interviewing me, his name was Harvey [ph.].  And Harvey interviewed me and he asked me had I ever waited tables before and I remember my experience in New York [City, New York] and I said, "I'm not going to do that again."  I told him, "Yes!"  So he gave me a tray and told me to carry this tray across the room and I put the tray in my hand, flat hand, and you don't--that's not the way waitresses carry trays and I walked across and walked back and he gave me the job.  And at the end of the summer he said to me, he said, "You had a really good summer.  You did really well."  He says, "Now tell me the truth, had you ever waited tables before?"  I said, "No."  He said, "Well I knew it."  I said, "How did you know?"  And that's when he told me, a waitress, you carry the tray on the tip of your fingers.  No, you carry--I was carrying it on the tip of my fingers.  Wait a minute, whichever way I was carrying it was wrong and he said an experienced waitress knows not to carry a tray that way.  So I asked him why did he hire me and he said because I seemed so determined and seemed to have such an attitude that he thought I would work out okay.  So I worked all summer, had a good experience and made some money.  But again I took off doing that and I think the second year I went to work for--went to New York to work for J. Walter Thompson advertising agency.  And the next year I went to--
Speaker 1: Now what did you for J. Walter Thompson?
Speaker 2: I was like a summer intern whatever--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --project they wanted to do.  Summer--
Speaker 1: So it's a business-oriented job?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then my third year I saw a posting on the bulletin board in the employment office that they were looking for summer interns at the [Lyndon B. Johnson] Space Center in Houston, Texas.  So that sounds like a--I said that sounds like a good idea so I applied for that and I got the job.  I had never been to Houston.  I didn't know anybody in Houston but I was going to Houston anyway.  Well Ms. Coons [ph.] in the employment office, I guess she said now this is a lady, she really is kind of crazy.  She's going all the way to Houston with not knowing anybody.  So she called a friend of hers down there and asked if I could stay with them that summer and I did.  And I stayed with them that summer and I went back the next summer and stayed the next summer and worked at Exxon which was Humble Oil [and Refining Co., Humble, Texas] at that time.  So I spent two summers in Houston.  So I always had good summer intern jobs while I was in school and I attribute that largely to help from other people who got me in those positions or helped me get them or helped in some way to make it happen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, I was a year between undergraduate and graduate school cause I went to Harvard [Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] in '67 [1967].
Story_ID: 143102
Speaker 1: Now did, it sounds as though--I mean well it seems as though from what I read that, that Professor [H. Naylor] Fitzhugh had to compel you to go to Harvard [Business School, Boston, Massachusetts].  You didn't think that you should go.
Speaker 2: I didn't, no I didn't think Harvard was--you know I thought the very rich and the very, very, very smart went to How- Harvard and I wasn't rich of course.  I may have been able to deal with the intellect part to some extent but I certainly didn't think I could ever afford to go there.
Speaker 1: How were your grades at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: At Howard?   My grades were good.  I graduated cum laude, so 3 point, I think I had a 3.35 or something like that.  So I had good grades at Howard.  And I took the test, the GMAT, the Graduate Management Admissions Test, and I didn't do well on that.  I'm really terrible at taking tests.  So when I first applied to Harvard they turned me down because my scores on the--were not high enough.  But that just gave me inspiration to go after they told me I couldn't go.  At first I didn't think I could do but once they told me I couldn't go, that's a different story.  [Laughter].  But their reason for not, my not going was different than the reason that I thought so I didn't go the year after I graduated, I studied for the test some and I retook it the next year and I did better so I got in the--after I had that year out of undergraduate.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So well what was Harvard like?  I mean did Professor [H. Naylor] Fitzhugh help you at all in terms of getting into Harvard or did he have connections to--?
Speaker 2: No, not from that stand--he wrote a--you know he didn't even, I don't think he even wrote the recommendation cause by the time I went he had gone to Pepsi[-Cola Company].  He left Howard when I finished my junior year and he went to Pepsi.  So the professor who replaced him was Professor Douglas, Thomas Douglas [ph.] and he wrote my recommendation from school.  I forgot who the other--they had certain category recommendations you had to have.  But Fitzhugh's only role really as far as I know was convincing me to go.  I don't--if he had any connections there or talked to anybody there, I'm not aware of it.  He didn't share that with me.  But he also didn't tell me that there were no black students there, no women, no black women, very few black students, very few women.  He didn't tell me that either.  So--and maybe it's good he didn't 'cause I'm not sure I would have gone had I known the environment before I went.  Plus, the business school, I went in '67 [1967].  They had just become co-ed in '63 [1963] and the women could not live on the campus of the business school cause the dorms were not co-ed dorms.  The dorms were designed just for men centered around what they call heads, one bathroom and everything was geared towards male population.  So the women had to live at Radcliffe [College, later, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] which was about a half a mile walk from the school and they didn't make the dorms co-ed till the year after I left.  So there were out of sixteen--approximately 1,600 students, there were thirty-five women and nine blacks.  Six of us in the first year class and three in the second year class and the women were about equally divided between the two classes, I think seventy-five--seventeen in one, eighteen in the other.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were the only black woman?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No blacks on the staff, no professors, no female professors, all old men.
Story_ID: 143103
Speaker 1: I was asked to ask you about the history of blacks at Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] and you've, I think you, you were involved enough in--well we know you got out.  And tell--give us some history.
Speaker 2: There was--[H. Naylor] Fitzhugh was not the first, he was one of the--I think there was a guy and I don't remember his name.  I mean I can probably get that information if they need it; that finished a year or two before Fitzhugh.  I think he finished like in 1931 and Fitzhugh I understand was the only one in his class.  And even though the dorms were for men then, he couldn't live in the dorms either.  He had to live with family in Boston [Massachusetts].  After him, I could find that out.  There were very, very few, I think probably less--from the 1930s to '60s [1960s] when we came there were I'd say less than twenty if that many.  There were as I said three in the first--second year class when I was there.  There may have been two or three in the class before them.  I think there were some years when there were none and there were nine in--six in my class.  So nine there when I was there.
Story_ID: 143104
Speaker 1: So you had one of the largest classes [of black students at Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] I guess of--?
Speaker 2: Up until then.  What we did it, there were, there were five guys, two of them--no, one of them lived in campus.  The other two lived off campus and one of them was married and lived in the graduate apartments, he and his wife and I spent a lot of time at their house.  He and his wife and I became very good friends, we still are today.  His name was Roy Willis and the other guy's name was [Clifford] Cliff Darden.  Well Roy was very, very upset about the shortage of black population.  He had--he was a veteran and he had gone to the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia] and had dealt with this issue at the University of Virginia and he came to Harvard thinking it was a lot different.  So he--Cliff and I were at his apartment one day and we were talking and Roy initiated a conversation about you know, we just need to do something about this.  There are a lot of black students that ought to be coming here and I don't think the school's doing anything to make it happen.  So we need to do something.  And we brought, got in the--two--there were three other guys but only two of them became involved with us and we had a couple of meetings to get some thought of what to do.  And Roy and Cliff apparently had been going to talk to the dean of admissions about this and he felt he had done a great job by doubling enrollment from the class ahead of us.  You know there were three in that class and this year it was six.  So he felt really good that he had done that.  And he--that was good I guess to an extent, but we said there are so many more that ought to be here.  You got eight hundred students coming in every year and this is supposed to be a premier university for training blacks in management, training students in management.  Why aren't there more black students being trained?  So we decided to ask for a meeting with the dean.  Dean George Baker was the dean then.
Story_ID: 143105
Speaker 1: All right.  Yeah, you were just explaining some of the demographics of how Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] is laid out.  Now it's actually physically separated from the main campus of Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], right?
Speaker 2: Right.  The main campus is over in Cambridge Square [sic, Harvard Square], actually address is in Cambridge [Massachusetts].  The business school is across the [Charles] River located in Boston [Massachusetts], about maybe a half a mile, three quarters of a mile away from the rest of the school.  So the business school was sort of isolated from what was going on in the main campus.  And there were lots of demonstrations and sit-ins during the '60s [1960s] on the main campus, but not at the business school.  The business school was looking at like, what are they doing over there, and going about things business as usual.
Speaker 1: So the agitation over at the--in Cambridge was a--you said, you were saying about the war--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the war, the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights Movement.  I think it was a lot of sit-ins related to the Vietnam War cause that was a really hot topic then.  It was during, the 'Nam War was, may have been in what '67 [1967], '68 [1968] when [Lyndon B.] Johnson was president and he decided not to run and--but the Vietnam War I think was a major factor in that decision.  So there were so many demonstrations going on then and there were demonstrations on the main campus.  They were--they took over some buildings and blocked the administration but nothing at the business school.  So, Roy [Willis] was basically the one that took the leadership in making things happen in the business school for the black students.  He's the one that said well we need to get a meeting with the dean [George Baker].  And we asked to have a meeting with the dean.  Of course we didn't know whether he'd meet with us and what he'd say and how he'd react to what we had to say.  But he was receptive to meeting with us and we went to the meeting and asked him why there were so few black students at the business school.  And his response was we don't know where to find them, you know, typical error.  Historical black college [HBCU] is the place you should start I would think, but that was his basic response.  So we said, okay.  We said we'll help you find them.  We offered to recruit for the school at the--our alma maters and other places and he was very receptive to that.  He agreed to send us back to our alma maters and to some other schools to do recruiting and in the meantime he went to corporations to get scholarship money.  None of us had--I didn't have a scholarship.  I think [Clifford] Cliff [Darden] may have had a scholarship.  I don't think Roy had one either so there weren't scholarships readily available.  There were some scholarships but there weren't that many scholarships.  So he went out to get scholarships specifically designated for the black students and we went to recruit at different places.  I went to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and I recruited two students there.  I don't remember all the schools we went to but the next year they admitted twenty-seven students so we felt that was a good increase from where they were and following year it increased I think to like seventy-five and they got as high as 150.  But then it began to drop off.   Right now I believe between the first and second year classes, there may be between 100 and 125 students, black students.  And they--we also during that time started the African American Student Union [AASU] to serve as a support system for those students coming in so they'd have a better understanding of what it's like being there, what's expected of them.  We wanted to make sure they were prepared to deal with the challenge that the business school offered and the last thing we wanted to happen was to get those students there and they not finish.  So we wanted to make sure that they were well prepared.  So that organization is still going on and they have a conference every February.  A few years ago I was happy to say they named the conference the H. Naylor Fitzhugh Conference.  So it's been a very, been a very active group.  And one of the--the school has said it's been one of the most active groups on campus and some of the other groups that have formed since then have modeled after the organization.  So--
Speaker 1: It's certainly being consistent if it's existed all of this time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: The same incarnation.  Now there's a--
Speaker 2: They go into even greater detail. I was saying they all--they have a one or two day retreat where they take incoming students away for a few days and over some of the history of blacks at the school and set up expectations and resources available and ways they could be supportive to the incoming students.  So it's been a successful organization.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you, you were a co-founder along with your--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 143106
Speaker 1: In '68 [1968] when [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated, how did that change the landscape?
Speaker 2: I remember that day very--I remember exactly what I was doing that day, that time.  I also remember what I was doing when [President John F.] Kennedy got assassinated [1963].  I was at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] then.  I had come back from class that day.  For some reason I decided to take a nap which I don't usually do.  I was--I had to study and I remember the--I set the radio to come on.  The radio came on, it was announcing that King had been shot and a couple of minutes later they announced that he had been--he had died.  So that was kind of a--it was difficult because I felt really alone then.  I didn't feel that there was anybody I could go talk to about this.  I was living in the Radcliffe [College, later Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] dorm and I was the only black--it was a women's dorm.  I was the only black woman in the dorm.  I wasn't going out and talking to the white ladies about--I had no idea how they felt about King or if they even knew who he was.  I just didn't feel like getting into that dialogue then so I didn't chance it.  I basically stayed in my room and didn't go to talk to anybody.  But I began to think about what kind of discussion we may have in class the next day and thought about things I could contribute to the discussion.  But I went to class the next day, they didn't even mention it, not in my--we had--it--they were in sections and eight hundred students in each class so one hundred students in each section.  In my section they didn't mention King.  In, I think in Roy's [Roy Willis] section his classmates were much more compassionate.  They talked to him about it and suggested you know this has been--why don't you just take today off?  This wasn't the professor.  I think the students did.  And [Clifford] Cliff [Darden], the other one, he didn't even go to class.  He decided to find a way to get on a plane and go to Atlanta [Georgia] where the King stuff was going on.  So we each dealt with it differently but the school [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] didn't really acknowledge.  They did though on the day of the funeral they did cancel classes that day and I remember going and sit--being in the lounge at the dorm we lived in with the other women.  We watched the funeral on the TV.  But I don't know that had--what changes it caused at the school.  I'm not sure it really had a great impact.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so your demands of the dean [George Baker] were made be--prior to King's assassination?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, that was--right, just a few months prior to matter of fact cause this happened I believe in the--we started in the fall of '67 [1967].  We went to see the dean first of the year, probably in maybe January or February and King was assassinated in April [April 4, 1968].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So all of this occurred prior to King's assassination.
Speaker 1: Right.  Did the school like address your demands prior to King's assassination or afterwards?
Speaker 2: Well prior.  We went to visit the schools, etc., and after the students--I'm not sure when they did the acceptance but they had to deal with some of that before King's assassination.
Speaker 1: So you did the recruiting trips prior to the assassination?
Speaker 2: We did, right.  Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you think the assassination had sped things up any or maybe accelerated the process?
Speaker 2: I--it may have which is a good point.  It may have accelerated some of the, their efforts or their interest in doing something more.  The only thing I don't know is when they actually recruited the--when the students actually had--the applications were in and when they did the acceptances.  I know they have, I believe was it April?  Sometime in April may be the last acceptance date and I don't know whether most of these students got accepted on the last--they have rounds.  I don't know whether it's two or three rounds.  I don't remember whether they got accepted on the first round, the last round or whether the assassination had anything to do with that.
Speaker 1: So--but that next group was how big again?
Speaker 2: Twenty-seven.
Speaker 1: Twenty-seven.  Okay, so they went from six to twenty-seven?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  As a result of the efforts of the African American Student Union and--?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It could have something to do with the, you know (unclear).
Speaker 2: It could have and I--
Speaker 1: There was a great deal of sympathy and focus and pressure actually placed--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: So it may have--but there may have been students who were accepted as late as in the summer and I don't--it could very well have been.
Speaker 1: You don't have a sense of if it really had a direct effect?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  You know I hadn't really thought of that could possibly have any--it may have once those, the applications came in and they saw a qualification, they take the tests--well we certainly did not ask for any lowering of standards.  We didn't expect them to accept students who didn't meet the criteria the other students met.  So they may, they may have accepted fewer had it not been for King.  I'm not, I'm not sure.  I'm not--I don't, I don't know that they would acknowledge that even if that was the case.
Story_ID: 143107
Speaker 1: Now did you have any--were there any special teachers or mentors at Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: There was one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Tony Athos [Anthony George Athos] was his name.
Speaker 1: A-T-H-O-S?
Speaker 2: A-T-H-O-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He came to--did he come to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] at one time recruiting?  At one time they sent--I thought this was interesting.  I remember they sent a recruiter to Howard when I was there.  His name was Wilford Flowers [ph.].  And I--he was a nice guy.  Once I got to know him he was a really nice guy and I think he was sincere but I don't think many students would have seen him as sincere.  He was an older guy with a very strong southern accent from Alabama and I think he would have turned off a lot of students just in talking with him.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just wonder if he was related to Richmond Flowers [Sr.] in Alabama.  He was a famous liberal Alabaman [ph.]--
Speaker 2: May have been.
Speaker 1: --civil rights advocate in Alabama whose son [Richmond Flowers, Jr.] was the--
Speaker 2: May have been.
Speaker 1: --fastest white guy in the United States in running the 100 yard dash at the time.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Richmond Flowers or Richmond Flowers, Jr.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Flowers he was a--when I got to know him, he was a really nice guy.  But Tony Athos, I think he, I believe he came to Howard once too and I got to know him then.  But he's the person I felt if I had an issue I would--he's the person I'd talk to and once I did go to talk to him and I was thinking about dropping out and he challenged me.  I went looking for sympathy and he didn't give me sympathy.  He said okay, you want to drop out then quit.  I said I'm not going to quit.  So he used reverse, I don't know whether it was reverse psychology or what but I stayed after I went to talk to him.  But he was a person I felt comfortable talking to if I needed to.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was probably one of the younger professors there too.  Most of the professors were older guys, you know.  They probably weren't as old as they seemed when you're, when you're twenty.  They were probably fifty and you think they're old.
Story_ID: 143108
Speaker 1: So what aspect of business did you focus on?
Speaker 2: We didn't have to focus there [at Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts].  They have a basic general management curriculum and the first year everybody takes the exact same courses.  The second year you can take--you can choose your course.  There are certain courses you have to take the second year and you can take other courses, basically either concentrate in the finance area or general--most of my courses were in general management.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well what were the revelations of Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts]?  I mean what did you learn that you had never thought of before about business and just said wait a minute?  Is this how you do this?
Speaker 2: Basically I guess the revelation was just learning how so many people, how people think about money and investments and putting all this together, you know.  Everybody was running out of class some time and checking their stock portfolio and everything was centered around return on investment and you know that's nothing I'd ever been exposed to coming from this little town.  It was all a new experience to me.  But I began to see how the wheeling and dealing that goes on.  The classes are very--were very, were not really that diverse.  I mean it was a lot of people came from the [U.S.] Military.  The Military sent a lot of students there and the others were basically people who came from family that'd been there or there was usually lot--frequently there was a lot of connect--a few international students.  And most of the women were right out of undergraduate.
Speaker 1: So they were younger?
Speaker 2: Yeah, most of them were younger than--at least by three, four years.  I'm trying to think, there may have been one or two close to my--but I was probably the oldest woman in my class which is a lot different than the make-up of the class now.  We had to have a--we all had name tags.  We sat in a semi-circle room with these desks and you had a little slot you put your name tag in so the professor knew he was going--who he was calling on.  And I went back a few years ago, two or three years ago and went into one of the classes where they had left the name tags up and the names are so much different you know.  Some of them you can't even pronounce.  It wasn't most of them like when I was there, Smith-John and all, fairly typical American pronounced name, but the student body now is much more diverse.
Story_ID: 143109
Speaker 1: Where were we?
Speaker 2: We were just talking about some of the things, the revelations of business--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that you were discovering [at Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Just that idea how business is done and then in our senior year we had, we were required to do a senior project.  You're assigned to a team and these are real issues that businesses present to the school for their students to work on.  The team that I was assigned to, we a study for American Express on how to penetrate the youth market and we had to do research and study information and then make a presentation to the senior executives of American Express on our findings.  And I don't remember really what we said.  I don't remember exactly.  We came up with some ways that they can tap into the youth market but I frankly don't remember what they were.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So how American Express could tap into the youth market?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And what did they consider a youth?
Speaker 1: They were talking about twenties, mid-twenties and probably more mid-twenties with the youth market, maybe the low-thirties, because I think at that time American Express was probably--their clientele was probably a much older--people well established in business.  And people saw it as a--the American Express card is one you have after you've made it and been well established.  Well they wanted to change that image and appeal more to younger people coming out of school and just starting in business.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So this is basically your thesis project or--?
Speaker 1: I guess you can call it that.  We didn't do theses per se, we did team projects and that was a--each--the different companies presented their projects to the university and the teachers assigned students to certain teams.
Story_ID: 143110
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did you envision yourself doing after you finished your M.B.A.?
Speaker 2: I really didn't have a clear idea of what I was going to do.  I thought about consulting and not--I didn't do much recruiting.  And one of the things I did--well I got married between my first and second year which was probably not a very wise thing to do in hindsight.  Well I have two wonderful daughters from that marriage so I guess that paid off.  But I probably would have done something different had I not gotten married.  My husband was in Washington [D.C.].  I came back to Washington but I initially was thinking I'd go into self-consulting or go to work with some comp- big company.  But ironically even during, when I got out of Harvard [Business School, Boston, Massachusetts], there weren't a lot of--I was not presented with a lot of opportunities with companies.  I wasn't recruited by anyone and I didn't really actively go looking for--there--recruiters came on campus but I don't think I interviewed with anybody.  Maybe they didn't know what to do with somebody like me.  There wasn't one out there.
Speaker 1: So did you anticipate that they would be trying to find you?
Speaker 2: Well I thought I would have some exposure, be able to have some interviews set up.  But maybe some of it was I wasn't sure exactly what I was going to do.  Plus maybe another drawback I think was I was--I had limited myself to the Washington, D.C. area and many of the companies were not in Washington.  I don't remember whether the government agency recruited there or not.  But the other thing that--or reason I probably I did not actively look to see the recruiters, that during my senior year I began working, doing some work with a small consulting firm in Boston [Massachusetts].  We had contracts with the Office of Economic Opportunity, EOE--OEO, OEO.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know if you remember that organization.  But that was established during the, was it during the [Lyndon B.] Johnson years to eliminate poverty, which it never did of course.  They went out of business.  So I worked with them on some of their contracts in Boston and they had an office in Washington so the guy asked me if I wanted to work with them in Washington when I graduated, so I did.
Speaker 1: So this is the Sterling Institute?
Speaker 2: Sterling Institute.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So I worked with them until they closed that Washington office.
Story_ID: 143111
Speaker 1: Now, now let me go back and ask you a question that I, I mean now when, when people watch this interview and they'll say, "This is the first black woman M.B.A. to graduate from Harvard School of Business [sic Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts]."  Now did--were you aware of that at the time?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't until afterwards that I became aware of that.  I knew there was nobody there when I was there but I didn't knew--I did not know that nobody had preceded me.  And I, I'm trying to remember how I first discovered it.  I know when it first came to my attention someone said there was a young lady in the class either ahead of me or the class before, but then they said no she was an Indian student.  So after whoever uncovered this did the research, they found out that I was it.  And quite frankly, unfortunately, I don't remember how it came to my attention.  I didn't know it when I graduated.
Speaker 1: I wondered if you know when you hear these things you know, somebody presented this is--they had historically done this but I was wondering if it was a--if you had known at the time you could have used it to market yourself.  I am the first, you know--
Speaker 2: I don't know that that would have sold.  (Laughter).  I'm not sure the companies were willing to--you know she's the first, I don't know if I want to do--deal with this or not.  There's nobody out here, there's no experience on this.  I don't want to be the first one to do it.  I don't know whether it would have been an asset or a liability.  But I think, I'm not sure that I couldn't have gotten a job in corporate, corporation if I had not limited myself to that extent of having agreed to work with this company and being limited to moving back to Washington [D.C.] as opposed to open to go back to New York [City, New York] for instance, even though I hated it when I was there.  But maybe I could afford to live there in a little better situation than when I lived there right out of high school.  But--and I've often wondered what would I have done had I not limited myself in those areas.  And I have also, although some people have said it's probably good I didn't, said I kind of regret not having worked in a large corporation for a while to have that experience.  Most people say, "No, you did the right thing.  You don't want to work in a big corporation.  It's a real rat race."  But that kind of experience I think I could have benefited from.
Story_ID: 143112
Speaker 1: So Sterling Institute, what was it like working for Sterling Institute?  Were, were you satisfied with that?
Speaker 2: I--yeah, it was a good--I had a great job there and the guy I worked with gave me a lot of response--they--we developed and--training programs to take into the community to train people how to better, to improve their environment and all kinds of things they can do.  And I helped develop some of those programs.  I even did, went away on some of the training work with organizations and local communities.  So I did that until they closed the Washington [D.C.] office.  I guess at that time OEO [the Office of Economic Opportunity] was either being defunded or wasn't funded adequately (unclear) have a lot of contracts.  And then I think after that, I think I went to the American Bankers Association then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, National Bankers Association.
Speaker 2: National Bankers Association.
Speaker 1: Now [HM] Dr. Edward Irons--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --was there.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That's somebody that we've interviewed for this.
Speaker 2: You interviewed him?
Speaker 1: Yeah, did you know--you knew him right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew him.  I worked with him for at least a year or two and he was--that's after my time at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] but he was the dean of the business school at Howard for a while too, yeah.  How long ago did you interview--is he still, do you know if he's still around?
Speaker 1: That was about four, five years ago.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I'm not sure if he's still--
Speaker 2: I know he was in Atlanta [Georgia].  Last time I talked to him he had moved to Atlanta.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Cause he was at Clark [College, later Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] or one of those--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was doing well last time I you know--or when we talked to him he was still strong.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So I worked with him until I think they, I don't know lost some funding.  But anyway, they had to cut back on staffing so I wasn't there any longer.  And my next job was Ferris & Company [Washington, D.C.], I believe that was next.
Story_ID: 143113
Speaker 1: Now you worked as a stockbroker for Ferris [& Company, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Ferris & Company.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I sort of stumbled into that job.  I went to a--you know I--the business school [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] had been talking about all these investments and things so I responded to an ad, this lady was giving a seminar on investments.  So I said well I think I'll go and see this and I went to her seminar.  And afterwards I was talking to her and she asked me had I ever thought about being a stockbroker and I told her no.  And she thought I, this would be a great opportunity, not many women and Ferris & Company is very receptive to women and she was doing very well.  And the other lady there, Julia Walsh was, I think doing even better than she was.  And there were three women at Ferris at that time who were stockbrokers.  So she convinced me to come to work with them.  I did not like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what were--why not?
Speaker 2: Well I didn't like what I call peddling stocks.  You're calling up people to sell them stock and frequently you--which is what made me very leery of folks calling me now, call me after that, frequently you were inclined to sell the stock that was the company's stock of the week or stock of the month 'cause you made more commission.  People were--this was their livelihood.  So you could frequently be tempted to put things in folks' portfolio that may not fit them and I did not want to do that.  And there were a couple of occasions where the particular stock that I--was the stock of the month really didn't fit the clients and you had to wrestle with you know is this the right thing to do?  So I didn't like that and I didn't like cold calling and pick up the phone calling people.  I don't like selling a product or that kind of selling so I didn't enjoy that at all.
Speaker 1: Now is that job relationship oriented in terms of knowing the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's--I think so.  Yes, yes.  If you know people who first of all have money to invest I mean you may know a few folks.  But somebody wanting to buy a share of stock or you know I got $500 to invest, you're not going to make a living like that.  You need people who have portfolios, who have money they really want to invest and expect to make good returns on them that they're going to get dividends or growth in stock over a period of time that they either use or whatever.  So--but not people who are small investors, you just don't--as a stock broker, you don't make money that way and at that time--I guess it's the same, I don't know if it's the same now, you're strictly commission.  It's one hundred percent commission.  There may be--and sometimes I think you get a draw against commission but that's still--you've got to earn it at some point.  So that wasn't--that did not fit me very well.  I didn't enjoy that.  So I decided to leave after about a year and I had my first child then.  Matter of fact, I was pregnant when I was there and decided that I would stay home for the summer.  No, I know what I did.  I applied for a teaching job at Bowie State [University, Prince George's County, Maryland] before I left and I got the teaching job to start in the fall.  So I decided to leave Ferris I think in June and I was going to take the summer off and stay home with my daughter who was born that prior October, prior August.  I stayed home about a month and I was climbing the walls.  I'm not a very good stay-at-home mom.  Some folks, it fits them really well.  I--it didn't fit me well.  So I started looking for something to do and about this time I got a call from a young lady who worked with me at Sterling [Institute] who told me her dad had this company [Unified Services] and he was having all kinds of problems and needed somebody to come in and she told him he should bring me in to help him.  And I went to interview with him to work that summer as a consultant and I did, I worked all summer with him.  He had about a $3 million janitorial company and he had all--any problem you could name for a small business he had it.  Problems with the bank, problems with IRS [Internal Revenue Service], employee problems, management problems, he had them all.  So I went in to work with them and all this time I'm wondering when am, when am I going to use all the stuff I learned in business school.  I finally got to use it.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Story_ID: 143114
Speaker 1: So you're, basically from our notes here, you're, you were operating as executive vice president of Unified Services?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And this is a janitorial service--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --in--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  This guy started his company.  He was a retired lieutenant colonel from--and he didn't have any formal training in business.  I think a high school diploma but he started his company and had grown into about $3 million in sales but had just terrible management.  So I went and worked with him in June and then near the end of the summer he asked, he offered me a full time job but I had already signed a contract to teach [at Bowie State University, Prince George's County, Maryland].  So I told him I couldn't take his full time job.  So then he convinced me to come work for him after I finished my classes.  So I had two full time jobs that year.  I taught all year and I worked for him all year and plus I was pregnant.  So I had a busy year that year.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sounds like you were pretty busy.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So I'd leave Bowie [State University, Prince George's County, Maryland] and go downtown in [Washington] D.C. after class and--
Speaker 1: How late would you have to work?
Speaker 2: I worked til about six or seven o'clock, about, somewhere around six o'clock.  Most of my classes were over maybe like 1:00.  Most of the classes like from 9:00 to 12:00 on certain days and I think some--one--two days I had a class until 1:00.  So I'd leave and go downtown.  I'd get downtown 12:30, 1:00, 1:30 most days and I'd work until about 6:00.  And then my daughter [Tasha Lincoln] was born in January, January 8th [1974] and I tease her now.  I told her that's the only time in her life she'd been so cooperative.  She was born during semester break so I only had to take off like a week from school.  I went back to work I think the second week in February and I worked both of those jobs until May and I had to make a choice at the end of May.  I either had to sign a contract to renew my contract teaching or go to work for Unified Service[s] full time.  So I elected to go work for Unified on a full time basis.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now this is 1972 or--?
Speaker 2: I think it was '72 [1972], '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went to work with him I think '70--daughter [Darnetha Lincoln M'Baye] was born in '72 [1972] so it was '73 [1973].  I worked from '73 [1973] to '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what were you learning as you worked for him?  I mean--
Speaker 2: I learned a lot about financial management, you know dealing with the banks, dealing with the IRS [Internal Revenue Service], employment management, (unclear) managing employees.  I was responsible for everything except the marketing.  He did the marketing.  But I, all the managers basically reported to me, the operations managers, the--I handled finances, I had payroll, I negotiated with the banks, I negotiated with the supply company.  I even had to negotiate with IRS [Internal Revenue Service].  He owed IRS went I went there.  I think he owed the IRS like a hundred and twenty some thousand dollars in withholding taxes and they were threatening to shut him down.  And he had hired a lot of folks to go talk to them and they were not successful.  And I went to talk to the guy and got him to agree to a long term payment agreement and I made sure that we stuck to that agreement and paid them because I knew if we didn't, they'd shut us down.  So I was able to do that and I set up the company to get--be successful by negotiating, renegotiate the bank loans, by negotiating with the supply company cause he owed everybody.  He hadn't paid his bank loans, the supply company was cutting him off so I had to talk to all of those companies to get them to agree to give us some leeway to change things around.  I, maybe, maybe as a new person coming in and maybe with my background they--that was a trust factor.  I did find you know having a Harvard [Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] M.B.A. was frequently a tool or a weapon I'm not sure which I'd call it.  I used it both ways depending on the situation.  So it served me well having that credential.
Story_ID: 143115
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now 1975, you decided to start your own business and how did this e--I mean you moved--we, we, we, we can I mean almost you know get a--know how it starts, but tell us what happened (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well actually in '75 [1975] some other people had been talking to me about it and I thought about it but I was--I liked my job and I was thinking you know do I really want to do this?  And I finally decided you know maybe I do.  I think I'll start it and try to get it up and running while I still work here at Unified [Services] and keep his company going and start something on a part time basis.  And another guy who was working at Unified as a consultant had started a company.  He tried to get me to come with him and I said no I don't want to do that.  So, I actually incorporated in 1975, but I didn't really get my first contracts until '76 [1976].  And my plans to stay there and work with Unified and get my company, the interim didn't materialize because Jerry [ph.] fired me when he--when I told him I was starting my own company.  I got fired.  So that was a blessing in disguise I imagine cause had I stayed there working for him, I don't think I ever would have devoted the time and effort needed to get my company up and running.
Speaker 1: Now did that surprise you when he fired you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It surprised me because I went to talk to him and I told him what I was doing and I told him that--and I guess it's more of a--it surprised me because he didn't really trust what I had told him I guess.  I told him that I was starting this company but I wasn't going to leave him until he got a replacement.  I wasn't going to take--go after any of his contracts or any of his staff or any of that, I was just going--and I think he did believe me but I think his wife didn't.  I always think she's the one that really got me fired.  And he agreed to that.  He agreed we'd work together and work this out and I--we started looking for someone to replace me.  And about four or five days later he called me in and said he had a meeting with his board of directors and they thought that if I was going to leave that I should go ahead and leave by the end of the week.  So I interpreted his board of directors really I think was his wife.  I knew her some--and I knew she--I found out that she was very upset that I was going out to start my own company cause his board of directors I knew they were in--I don't think anybody on that--they never even met. You know board of directors in small companies, they don't really meet.  [Laughter].  So I said okay, I left and he--we maintained a good relationship.  He had some real struggles after I left and I knew he would because there was absolutely nobody there to really take over to do what I was doing.  And he, I think his wife came to work after that on a full time basis.  They had to--but we maintained a--it was--the relationship was a little testy initially but we came around.  Matter of fact, the reason I know he--it survived this is in 1981, he recommended me for the Small Business Person of the Year for the State of Maryland and I, I got it.  So he's the one who did that so I don't think he would have done it if he had some hard feelings towards me.  And after that, we maintained a good relationship and until he died.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now it says here in '76 [1976] you became the president and committee chair of the Building Service Contractors Association [International].  Now is this--?
Speaker 2: This is the industry association.  I was a member involved in that organization during the time that I was working for Jerry [ph., at Unified Services] and when I started my own company I continued to work with them and be involved.  But it was in 1995 when I was elected president of the association.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, all right.  So this is--
Speaker 2: They had not a--I was the first female president of the organization.
Speaker 1: Okay this is--this doesn't happen till '95 [1995].
Speaker 2: It's an international organization, Association of Building Service Contractors [sic].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what about as--when did you serve as board chair of [National] Minority Supplier Development Council?
Speaker 2: I was on the board for a while.  That was probably in the '90s [1990s].  As a member all--the whole time I was in business and I was on the board, gosh, probably the '80s [1980s] and '90s [1990s] I served on the board.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's in the 1990s too?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now, okay we have here that in '78 [1978], correct me if we're wrong, that you won the big Naval Research Center [U.S. Naval Research Laboratory] contract for Centennial One [Inc.].
Speaker 2: Yeah, '78 [1978], my first contract was with the [U.S.] Department of Agriculture.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: That was in, I got that '76 [1976].  I had a hard time getting my business going initially.  I started the business in, let's see I left Unified [Services] in May of '76 [1976] and I decided I wanted to do government contracts cause that's primarily the work that Unified had done.  I was very familiar with the government contract--on the 8(A) [Business Development] Program.  So I applied for approval in the 8(A) Program thinking--this program was set up to give minority owned firms an opportunity to have access to government contracts and I'm thinking you know this--I'll just put this application in.  This is really a no-brainer.  I'm black and I'm female, I'm double minority.  Well they turned me down.  Why?  They said they couldn't guarantee they could find contracts for me and that was a lousy excuse because I'd been working at Unified for three years and they never found contracts for him.  We had to find our own contract.  So why did they think I was expecting them to find contracts for me?  So I had to fight that battle and go to people to have--try to get that reversed and they finally decided that okay, we will reconsider your application if you can give us evidence that you can get contracts.  Well luckily I had been marketing government agencies based on people that I knew from my years at Unified and I was able to provide them with names and phone numbers and addresses of people at agencies who had said that they would be willing to work with me as a contractor and so they finally approved it.  And then I was able to go out and identify a contract.  It was a contract that Jerry [ph.] had had, Unified had had but they were not going to re-award it to him.  So I said okay, I know the contract.  I know the contract officers.  It's a good chance to meet and step in.  Well they wouldn't let me--wouldn't give me that contract and that may have been political.  So I finally said okay, I--next move I, you know you turn me down for approval in the program.  I find my own contract, you won't give it to me.  This was through SBA [Small Business Administration].  So what's the real problem?  If I have to go to my congressman, I'll do that.  Now I expect you guys to find me a contract since I've done what I'm supposed to do and they finally did identify a contract for me with the Department of Agriculture in, well this was in September of '76 [1976] and the contract was going to start in October so I had a month to really get things together to get this contract started.  So that was my first contract.  And then I got this bigger contract with the Naval Research Center in '77 [1977], '78 [1978], must--'78 [1978].
Story_ID: 143117
Speaker 1: Okay.  As a startup business [Centennial One, Inc.]I mean this is, as a--I guess it's more expensive to operate as you're starting up than it is--?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the advantage I had was the experience at Unified [Services], I learned a lot about operating a business, a lot of things to do and a lot of things not to do.  And I knew that the--and the industry that I was going into was labor intensive so I need working, needed working capital to, for at least two to three months because employees, you got to pay them and you don't get paid from your contract, on your contract until after you've paid your employees so you had to have money up front to get started and to buy equipment and supplies.  So what I did was I had working with a supplier at Unified so I talked to the guy that I had worked with, took him to lunch one day and told him to lunch one day and told him what I was doing and I wanted him to work with me and I asked him if he'd give me a ninety day line of credit and he did.  And I also went to a personal banker and I talked to him.  He was just leaving the bank he was with going to serve as president of a start up bank so I convinced him to give me a line of credit.  So that gave me the financing I needed for payroll and operating supplies which is a critical thing.  And I didn't really need the money right away but I had to borrow against it and show them that I was paying it back.  And I stayed with that bank until I got too large for them and they couldn't finance, provide the financing I needed.  So that's how I got those things going.  And then my first contract I took over from another contract, contractor that was at that facility.  So he took of course as use, contractors usually do, they'll take--they lose a contract you're going to take your best people and try to put them someplace else so I had the leftovers.  So I had to interview all these different people who were left and try to decide who gets the job, who I'm going to keep and make those kinds of decisions to start up the job.  But the other thing I did that helped me was during my bid for this job, I wanted to do everything I could do improve my cash flow, to make sure I had money to operate.  I had my line of credit in place with the bank, line of credit with the supply company, but I also wanted to get paid by the government faster than they would normally pay.  The government had a reputation of paying you know sixty to ninety days.  Well I negotiated with them to let me bill them twice a month and that would start my money coming in right away.  People said, oh they'll never do that.  I said well all they can say is no.  But the guy I dealt with was very receptive to that so he allowed me to bill him on the fifteenth of the month and at the end of the month so that started money coming in on a regular.  And fortunately I kept that contract ten or eleven years and I billed them that way the whole time.  So yeah, those kinds of things helped.  And when you're in business or you're starting up a business or operating a business you have to try to think of maybe unorthodox ways or think outside of the box to do things.  There's no set way you have to do things so you have to think of ways things will work for you and give it a try.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you already knew some of the workers too that you could depend on I guess from working with Jerry [ph.], right?
Speaker 2: I knew workers that he had but I didn't go after them.
Speaker 1: You didn't, okay.
Speaker 2: No, I didn't take any of his employees.  And see when I took the new contract they had employees who were already there so I took the best of what he had and then I just built on it from that.  And what I, I--the other thing I did to be sure I didn't have a--my costs weren't, I wasn't just being exorbitant with my costs, I did not rent office space.  I converted my garage into an office and I operated from my home for three years because in the business I was in, my customers didn't come to my office, I went to them.  I did that and I hired a secretary.  And for the first year I didn't really take a salary, I paid her and after that I start--was able to take a salary.  But I was profitable for my, the first year I was in business which was not typical of many companies.  I think I was in business nine years before I lost any money, lost money which was a, kind of a shock.  What do you mean I lost money?  So that was a, I think a lot of that I attributed to the experience I had on how to operate that particular business in that industry and some of the things I did to make sure I had the financial backing that I needed.
Story_ID: 143118
Speaker 1: And what was the biggest contract you were able to land?
Speaker 2: Douglas Airport [Charlotte Douglas International Airport, Charlotte, North Carolina].  I did Douglas Airport for about eleven years.  That was about a six million dollar, six million dollar contract.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had, I had a lot of two, three hundred dollar contract--hundred thousand dollar contracts.  I was in the government program for nine years and again I almost--they almost put me out of business after nine years.  They abruptly removed me from the 8(a) [Business Development] Program and at that time I was doing seven and a half million dollars in sales, about five million of it was 8(a) work so I stood to lose most of my business.  And what I had done knowing that at some point in the future I thought further in the future than it actually was, that I would not be in this program so I had to build up my contracts in the private sector.  Well I had hired a marketing person about a year before this happened and with the stipulation that I wanted him to market strictly to the private sector.  So he was able to bring in some contracts during that time so instead of losing five million dollars in business, I lost about a million, million and a half.  But it took me about three or four years to regroup from that because the private sector contracts had lower profit margins than the government contracts so I had to get many more sales to just stay where I was and it took me about three or--three years to overcome that disaster.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's not until about 1988 that you start (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I was--yeah.  Well they--I got out of the program in '85 [1985].
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah it says--yeah.  So the first loss was in '85 [1985] right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay so--
Speaker 2: '85 [1985], I guess it was '86 [1986]--'85 [1985], '86 [1986], my fiscal year.  My fiscal year was September 30th.
Story_ID: 143119
Speaker 1: As you said before earlier in '81 [1981] you won the Small Business Person of the Year award from the State of Maryland.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  Now were you the first black woman to win that?
Speaker 2: I don't know, may have been.  I think somewhere I read that I was but it's a statewide competition and usually I think mostly men have won it before.  There may have been some women but it's awarded by the SBA [Small Business Administration] but it's not--each state has an awardee and there's a--activities and ceremonies by the Small Business Administration during the year for all of those.  And the state has something for you.  I had a luncheon and then I got to go to the White House.  This was during the year of [President Ronald] Reagan, Reagan was there, yeah at that time.  So we had to go to the White House and the Rose Garden we had you know, ceremony and photos taken so it was a very interesting experience.
Story_ID: 143120
Speaker 1: Did you, I mean when you look back on it, do you think the administration was really encouraging for you know, encouraging for minority business people?
Speaker 2: During the [President Ronald] Reagan years?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I guess it--he was sort of, I think maybe during those years he was sort of, didn't phase him one way or the other.  I think the, the 8(a) [Business Development] program started under [President Richard] Nixon.
Speaker 1: In the seventy--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, cause I got in, in '76 [1976].  It was fairly new then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Nixon was on his way--I guess [President Gerald] Ford would have been--no '76 [1976] would have been [President] Jimmy Carter, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it started before then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it would have started--
Speaker 2: I went into--
Speaker 1: --under Nixon I guess and then--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Nixon, it started under Nixon.  His administration is the one that this program started under so I'm not sure how it all came about.  But I don't know that Reagan was pro or one way or the other.  He was probably fairly neutral on--nothing stands out with me I'll say that.
Story_ID: 143121
Speaker 1: Oh, your mother [Arnetha Hobson] passed, pa- passed away in '87 [1987] but--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother lived--my mother moved with me in '72 [1972] so she lived me with until she passed away.  She, she took care of my youngest daughter [Tasha Lincoln] when she was first born 'cause I was very fortunate to have not to have any childcare issues that many women deal with today.  I never had to take my kids out--you know I worked the whole time but I never had to take them outside of the home.  My mother took care of my youngest when she was born.  Then when my second child was born it was a bit--my mom was in her early seventies and it was a bit much for her to take care of two toddlers.  So my sister [Hattie Paige Hobson] came to live with me for a while but that wasn't a very great experience.  And then my then husband and I decided that we would make the sacrifices necessary to bring someone in, into the house to take care of the kids as opposed to trying to find childcare services outside.  And childcare services then weren't nearly as readily available as they are now.  But those that were available were not nearly expensive either.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, all right.  Okay, now during this time you had divorced one husband, the first one right and married again.
Speaker 2: I divorced in '86 [1986] I think it was.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, cause I remember '85 [1985] is when we basically separated and I got my notification in '85 [1985] that I was getting off the 8(a) [Business Development] program so it looked like everything was falling apart right then.  And '86 [1986] I actually divorced.  My mom passed away in '87 [1987], I remarried in '88 [1988].
Story_ID: 143122
Speaker 1: Now was your first husband involved in, in the business [Centennial One, Inc.] too or, or, or--
Speaker 2: Well.
Speaker 1: --did he have an interest in that?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately he was for a while.  When I first started the business he was sort of devil's advocate and he was on the board but then early in the business before we first started I was--there was some decision, I don't remember what it was, it was a decision I had to make and he was against the decision.  He thought I should have followed his decision and I didn't and he resigned from the board and I accepted his resignation and I didn't put him back.  And then a few years later he--I very jokingly said, I was looking for a finance person and he was an accountant but he didn't--I didn't think he was doing a great job when he was on his job he was on.  And I said something--he--I was looking for someone to come in and I said jokingly, maybe I can get you to come in?  And he jumped at that.  He came to work for me which was a big mistake, did a horrible job.  And I, I mean I had to fire him frankly.  I wasn't getting the information I needed.  He was just not doing the work and people were complaining, everybody was complaining so it was either he go get another job or do something and let the company go on or I just let him float along and make things even worse.  Well of course that wasn't a great--then he started his own company and I gave him some subcontract--some work to do piecework.  That wasn't great but it went on for a while and the marriage was just slowly deteriorating but I guess the straw that broke the camel's back is he had his company and didn't have a lot of clients and I don't think he was doing a great job and then we got a notification one day that he wasn't paying his payroll taxes and the state had put a lien on the house.  So I decided I couldn't deal with that anymore.  You know I was--I'm (unclear) myself by trying to make things work.  I had my mom [Arnetha Hobson] there with me.  I had two small kids and I'm not going to let him make us lose the house.  And he was a, he was a great father with the kids.  He spent a lot of time with the kids, he was good with that but he was just totally irresponsible and I just reached a point where I couldn't be married to someone who was that irresponsible.  And I very, you know I worked hard to build the company, the company was successful and it was a question was I going to allow someone else to really destroy it or am I going to just--he'd make all kind of promises of what he--things would change which it never did.  So it was, to me that was the end.
Story_ID: 143123
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the--so you got married again, was, was it fairly soon after--?
Speaker 2: It was actually about four or five years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Dumbest, dumber--one of the dumber decisions I ever made.
Speaker 1: Okay, now was this, this gentleman involved in business too or--?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, totally uninvolved in business and you know I think as I tell people now as successful as I had been and as accomplished I had become, for some reason I seemed to still have this feeling of inadequacy or something I--something was missing.  And I later learned and unfortunately I learned it after I married the second time instead of before that you're responsible for your own happiness.  Nobody else can make you happy.  Someone can add to your happiness and supplement but you have to be happy with yourself in order to be happy with someone else.  So I learned that after the second (unclear), vowed I'd never get married again, but I did.  This time it's--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's worked well.
Story_ID: 143124
Speaker 1: So you were just saying that your--the, the third time you got married it was the right decision.  So--
Speaker 2: Right after I decided I'd never marry again you know never say never.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well okay, so I'll ask you more about him later on.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But now all, I mean during the '90s [1990s], you were involved with the Harvard Business School African American Alumni Association [Boston, Massachusetts] too.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, and so you and the other founders right of the African American Student Union, you know, were involved in this?
Speaker 2: No, the--basically we--the other guys [Roy Willis and Clifford Darden], both of them moved to California and didn't really have much involvement after they left and still don't and I'm not sure why.  I did interview both of them when I wrote the book and they, I--they just seemed completely disconnected.  They didn't have any desire to want to come back.  I, frankly when I first left I was so glad to leave Harvard [Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] I didn't want to go back again either.  [H. Naylor] Fitzhugh got me back.  He used to come to the African American Student Union conferences and he told me that I had a responsibility to stay back, to still be involved with those students and you know encourage them and be a support to them.  He was still coming and he would--he'd been out much longer than I had so it's because of him that I finally came back and remained involved with the students.  And the African American--the alumni association was started a few years later, I guess after it was enough people to make it an alumni association.  I don't remember exactly who started it, how it was started.  It had a few really great years and then it died a bit after the leadership, new leadership took over and it wasn't doing much.  And then we revived it a few years ago and Ken Powell [Kenneth A. Powell] has been the president for the last few years.  He's done a great job of revitalizing it and making it a, effective organization.  I still serve as a board member.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what are some of your goals for the alumni association?
Speaker 2: The alumni association is basically to keep the alumni involved with the school and to keep them involved with students to a certain point serve as mentors and to make sure that the students are giving back to the school.  And we usually have a conference once a year.  It has been--we didn't have one last year.  It's usually in the fall so it's to keep the--and we serve as liaisons to the school, the president and basically a support to the students.
Story_ID: 143125
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now and what was a, I guess what, what year, about what period of time did, did Centennial One [Inc.] reach its height, I guess?
Speaker 2: Nineteen--probably '96 [1996], '97 [1997].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what contracts did you all have then?
Speaker 2: We were doing about twenty million in sales and had a mixture of government, private sector, state and local government, fed--I don't know if I had any federal government contracts then.  It was mostly private sector or quasi government.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now we have a note here that in '98 [1998] you were really thinking about you know selling it?
Speaker 2: I was thinking about selling it, that's probably when I should have sold if I was going to sell it.  But I probably should--I wish I had, hindsight's 20/20, gotten my daughter more involved in the company earlier and let her take it over but I think I was too late involving her and I did not do a very good job of involving her to the point where she was comfortable.  And there was friction and conflict between her and my executive vice president that was not a very good experience for either--any of us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I have here that Douglas [Charlotte Douglas International Airport, Charlotte, North Carolina] could no longer contract with Centennial because their annual revenues--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --exceeded the Washington [D.C.] airport's authority requirement.
Speaker 2: They had a size standard.  The authority had decided that that contract would go to small business within a hundred mile radius of the airport and that size standard I think was initially twelve million and I had it during that time and then I was able to convince them to increase the size standard because you know I explained that everything else has increased.  You know wages have gone up, supply costs have gone up which means the size of the contracts have gone up based on increased cost.  So the size standard should go up also and--
Speaker 1: It was proportionately the same size you're saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So they did agree to that and they did raise the size standard I think to sixteen million but then when I got to that level, when it came up the next time I wasn't eligible for it.  Well I wasn't going to be eligible for it but I sold the company in the interim but I wasn't going to be eligible to bid on it the next time it came up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did union wages impact what you were doing?
Speaker 2: Union wages, I had some contracts that were unionized and others that weren't.  And I was successful; I had a good working relationship with the unions.  I dealt with two or three different unions.  And quite frankly from my standpoint I liked having the union contract because it allowed me to pay the employees better wages, I could get better employees.  Most employees in that industry are I mean the, they're paid minimum wage or not much above minimum wage.  But, you got a union contract, most of the time the union wages were higher and the client basically had to abide by the union wages.  So that allowed me to I think get better employees who were willing to stay in there and they also had some benefits and that was not the case with non-union contracts.  So there were a lot of people in the industry that fought the union but I really didn't because I saw it as advantageous for the employees.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 143126
Speaker 1: But you didn't sell it [Centennial One, Inc.] at that point and what--so what, what was the, I guess the--?
Speaker 2: Motivation for selling it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well you did sell it in 2001?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But you said you probably should have sold it sooner?
Speaker 2: Oh I think the market was better then and I think I would have been able to have a better, get a better deal in '98 [1998].  And I was at--then in '98 [1998] I was still somewhat interested in working in the company.  When I finally sold it in 2000--I really didn't like going to work anymore.  I didn't enjoy the business anymore and it was beginning to show in my involvement in the business.  I think I turned over too much stuff to subordinates when I shouldn't have and had I either sold it or maybe gotten my daughter involved in '98 [1998], it probably would have been a better situation.
Speaker 1: Okay. So is it a--I mean I'm not--would I be correct in assuming that as something gets bigger it gets more out of your personal control?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) control and--
Speaker 2: I frequently tell people, my people, I grew the business to twenty million thousand sales and about twelve hundred employees.  People say wow, that's great.  But I tell people, I enjoyed the business much more when it was smaller because I could interact with employees closer or customers.  I didn't to meet most of, see most of my customers and then you have someone else in between you and the customer and that person becomes the--the client begins to see that person as the company and not you.  So it does happen that way sometime.  Some people can do this but I enjoyed it more when it was a smaller operation.  So big does not always mean better, it depends.  And even, it doesn't even mean you have, make more money.  Like Douglas [Charlotte Douglas International Airport, Charlotte, North Carolina] was my largest contract.  I didn't make a lot of money on it. The profit margins were a lot thinner than some of the smaller contracts.  So I mean total dollar wise, I may have made more because the size of the contract.  But big is not necessarily better.
Speaker 1: It's--
Speaker 2: It just depends on what your objective is.
Speaker 1: But big is busier on some levels?
Speaker 2: Yeah, big is busier that's true.  You need more layers of people.  there's a lot more stuff going on as you get bigger so you've got to be sure you can manage that growth.  That's the most important thing. You got to tell companies that I talked to--if you're going to grow, make sure you can manage the growth.  There were a couple of times in my existence that I turned down contracts because I couldn't manage it from a financial standpoint or managerial standpoint.  I didn't have the finances to back it nor the management staff.  And to me it was better to turn down the contract than to take one and not be able to be successful on it because in business, bad news travels much faster than good news.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, but when you sold the--who did you sell it to?
Speaker 2: I sold it to a firm out of California who was basically in security business, some janitorial in California.  They were doing a security business on the East Coast and they wanted to build up their operation and janitorial on the East Coast.
Story_ID: 143127
Speaker 1: In 2002 it says you founded LilCo Enterprises, which is a tax preparation business?
Speaker 2: Well I founded LilCo 'cause I was beginning to do some--working with some businesses and I basically formed this company as an umbrella for whatever it is I was going to do. So I did that and then in 2002 or 2003, I think, whenever it--I bought a tax franchise and operated that for three years, I think.
Speaker 1: So that's different from LilCo you're saying?
Speaker 2: No, LilCo was the company.
Speaker 1: All right, was the umbrella.
Speaker 2: Umbrella, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I bought a tax franchise as a--the business that I would do under the LilCo umbrella and I did that for about three years.  It was interesting.  I enjoyed it for a while but I didn't like the seasonal work.  And then at just about that time too, in 2004 I think it was, I decided I wanted to spend more of my winters in Florida.  I had a condo there that I had bought when my daughter was in graduate school in the '90s [1990s] and I wasn't using it.  So I said, I was renting it for a while and then one day it's like, it's almost like a light bulb went on, said why don't you use it?  I says you know I don't want to stay up here in the winter and tax season is January through April.  That's the bulk, you know the main wintertime.  And I said I don't want to stay up here.  Then people said, the people, the guy that was at Liberty franchise they were saying well you can have somebody to run it.  Well I don't, I'm not comfortable being that far away and have somebody run my business because you just never know.  It just creates--some folks do it successfully but I wasn't comfortable doing that so I actually sold it back to the franchise, franchisee or franchisor.  And before, I think it was either--well after, right after that I wasn't--while I was back in Richmond [Virginia] much of the time I did get my real estate license I guess in 2005, 2006 and I enjoyed that and was beginning to build that just before the real estate market went south.  And since I was still spending much of my time in Florida, it wasn't really paying for me to try to operate from Florida.  When the market first started I was--it was okay.  I did some deals while I was in Florida.  I could--as long as I didn't have to show houses I had someone up here I was working with.  That worked okay but then I'm--it was about 2008, 2009 when the real estate market really went south and I said well--I kept my license active for a couple of years and just did referrals.  But I didn't renew it the last year.
Story_ID: 143128
Speaker 1: So then I just started doing some--but then, then in 2000, late 8 [2008]--2009 is when I, I started writing my book ['Road to Someplace Better: From the Segregated South to Harvard Business School and Beyond'], never planned to write a book.  People, a lot of people used to say well you should really write a book and I didn't really want to do it.  I finally found someone who was willing to work with me on writing the book and one of the professors at Harvard [Business School, Boston, Massachusetts], one of the--[HM] David Thomas who became one of the first--well Jim Cash [James Ireland Cash, Jr.] I guess is the first black professor they got in.  David Thomas was the one who had the Naylor Fitzhugh chair [H. Naylor Fitzhugh Professor of Business Administration].  They did name a chair after Fitzhugh.  Oh, that's one thing the African American Student--African American Alumni Associates [Harvard Business School African American Alumni Association, Boston, Massachusetts] took a lead in raising the funds, raised five million dollars.  They didn't raise it all then but they got money from different--but they had a--we had a leadership position in making that happen, raised five million dollars to establish a chair in the name of Fitzhugh.
Speaker 2: At Harvard?
Speaker 1: At Harvard.  And David Thomas was the professor that Fitzhugh Chair and he was the one who connected me to his agent to get my book done.  And somebody had talked to me about writing a book in the '80s [1980s], a young lady who had done a book on dreams of my mother and had me, I quoted in there some of the comments by my mom [Arnetha Hobson] and she told me I should write a book then but I did not.  I didn't have time.  I told her I wasn't interested and she did put me in touch with her agent who I sent a book proposal to and she liked it initially and said she didn't think she could sell it so I just put it on the shelf.  But then in 2003 when I got the alumni achievement award from Harvard, the young lady they sent down to do the write up again brought up the--I should write a book.  And she took my manuscript and finally found this lady who--Rosemary Brutico who wrote it with me who was interested in working with me on the book.  So that's how I ended up doing the book.  I probably would not have done it, I don't think I would have done it.  And initially most people who said--read it says it has a lot of inspiration in it.  But you know for me I didn't see that I was doing anything other than what I had to do.  So it didn't seem to me as something that would be worthy of writing in a book.
Speaker 2: Well it is historic and Publishers Weekly said that, we have a quote:  "This is an old-fashioned rags-to-riches story that traces Lambert's upbringing as the daughter of a god-fearing Virginia subs- subsistence farmer..." and you know, and you know on up.
Story_ID: 143129
Speaker 1: So it's--how did, I mean we have just talking to you, how--you mentioned homes in Florida and other--how has, has life changed from being on a farm to where you are today?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's--I mean I've done things that I never would have thought I would do on a farm.  I've done things I didn't even know existed when I was on the farm.  You know going to Harvard [Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] was nothing something--I didn't even know anything about Harvard growing up.  And when I did learn about Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts] it was not something--it's not a place where I saw myself being.  And I've been able to just start my own business.  Now my brother Weldon, he's the third.  My brother Clyde is next to me, then Weldon.  Weldon has a business too.  He's been a businessman since he left home and probably a business as successful as mine but he didn't have the education and training so he hasn't--didn't develop his business as I did.  And I've often thought if he had my background and training, you know his business would probably be much more than mine.  I think his business has been successful.  That's all he's ever done.  He has a construction company.  He's a brick mason.  So the training I got helped me in a number of ways.  And all--the various awards that I've received, I have, my walls at home is just--walls every--awards everywhere so all that's different.  I've been able to travel places that I never would have traveled being involved with the Building Service Contractors Association [International].  I travel as a business owner but I paid my own expenses.  But I went places I would not have gone.  I traveled to South Africa and that's an interesting--that was a trip that was given to me by a young lady who went to Harvard and she said I had inspired her.  And they presented this award to me at one of the conferences, the African American Student Union Conference and I didn't even know this young lady then.  He has a wine--she imports wine from South Africa and she gave me the trip to go and I went over with her and did some training with her wine clients over there.  And getting the Alumni Achievement Award from Harvard that was a total shock to me.  I didn't even--I didn't know the award existed and I certainly didn't think about getting it, just--and being able to have my business and have the standard of living that I was able to have.  I've never been--I'm not extravagant.  I don't have a five or six thousand square foot house, don't want one.  I guess the only luxury that I did have that may have been a luxury, I bought a 1995 Mercedes [Benz] sports car, I still have it, will have it as long as it runs.  Maybe it will be an antique, but that was a, I--when I bought my first Mercedes I guess in the early 80s [1980s] I had a big one and I had a couple of sports cars so that's the luxury that I've had.  But I've traveled different places.  I've been able to--my kids went to private school.  I was able to keep them in private school all through their school years.  I was able to send them both to college.  It's things like that, that have--and I was able to--I bought a, the condo, you mentioned the condo in Florida and I bought that strictly--I hadn't planned to buy a condo.  My daughter, she went to Wake Forest [University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] and she decided she wanted to go to graduate school and she chose Florida, the film school at Florida State [Florida State University College of Motion Picture Arts, Tallahassee, Florida] which is located in Sarasota [Florida, sic.].  So I went down to help her find an apartment and I have a cousin in St. Petersburg [Florida], he connected me with a real estate agent down there who didn't really handle apartments but she said she could help me find a place.  But in the process she told me she had this condo she wanted me to look at even though I wasn't interested in buying one.  But I fell in love with the condo and I thought this made more sense to buy a condo, let me daughter live in it while she was in school instead of renting a place.  And then I was able to rent it during the--I was still working there so I rented it during the season which is in March to--January to March time of year and then I was able to rent it for about three years, year round.  I had a great tenant.  And after that, I just decided I wanted to use it for myself.  So my thinking is if you accumulate some things you need to take time to enjoy them and while I don't have whole lots of things, I want to enjoy the things that I have accumulated.  And going down there, we go down in October and stay until April, come back for Christmas.  But to me I enjoy doing that and that's not something I ever thought, thought I would do or even thought about doing.  So those kinds of things have changed my life now.
Story_ID: 143130
Speaker 1: But I, I still remember, as I said, from whence I came.  When I go--I still go back to Ballsville [Virginia], I still go back to Mt. Pero [Baptist Church, Powhatan County, Virginia] and I go to church when I--when I'm in Virginia I go to church at Mt. Pero at least once a month and still make contributions to the church.  And you know they're building on a new addition and my brother who lived in Richmond [Virginia], he maintained his membership up and he went back up there to church all the time and they're building an addition on to the building which they are dedicating to him next year.  He passed away last July but he was a--he fought hard to help get that building going.  So I remember those.  And when I go--also when I go back and I think this is something you have to be really careful about and some people have difficulty what I call walking that tight line.  I can't go back to Ballsville as Lillian who went to Harvard [Business School, Boston, Massachusetts].  Those people know me.  Many of those people who may not have gone any further than Pocahontas High School [Powhatan County, Virginia] and may not have--may never have left Powhatan or maybe far as they've gone is to Richmond.  I have to be able to deal with them where they are and not try to make them be where I am.  That's not what they want.  So I have to relate to them in a way that doesn't give them the impression that I think I have surpassed them or I think I'm better than they are as some people may say.  So I'm very conscious of that and I do the same thing with my, you know my--none of my siblings went to college so I can't be per--I don't want to be perceived by them and I never have been.  They, at least that's what they've told me as feeling that I am better than they are so that's the experience.
Story_ID: 143131
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what, what are some of your volunteer activities?  I know I read that you were, you were on the board of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History [ASALH], that's one or--
Speaker 2: I'm not a--I'm a member--
Speaker 1: A member, okay.
Speaker 2: --and I'm not on the board.  I'm a member and I joined in Sarasota [Florida].  They don't have a chapter in Richmond [Virginia].  I work with that organization.  I'm actually a member of my church.  I--
Speaker 1: So you're a local member in Sarasota of the association?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They have a chapter in Sarasota.  They don't have one in Richmond (unclear).
Speaker 1: I think they even met in Richmond last year didn't they?
Speaker 2: They had the convention in Richmond last October but they--their headquarters are in [Washington] D.C., but there's not a chapter in Richmond.
Speaker 1: And that's the site of the last battle of the Civil War, St. Petersburg, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would think there'd be a chapter and was surprised there's one in Sarasota, Florida.  That--Manatee County, the biggest chapter they have is in Manatee County, Florida.  It's a very active chapter and they have couple hundred members, do a lot of different local things, film, historical films.  They have trips.  They do things there so it's a good organization.  And I do some work--I try to talk with school--this year I'm doing some work with the Emma Booker Elementary School in Sarasota which is something I want to do.  But surprisingly it's, I found it difficult to really get in some of the schools.  It's either busy or they don't have a structured way to get you in.  But we met with this principal and we have a--the association has an education committee and we adopted this school and the principal's been very receptive to it.  So on the 17th I'm going to be speaking to their fifth graders.  I think there are four--girls, fifth grade girls.  I'm going to be talking to them.  And then on the 23rd, the association, A Study for Life, I get--(unclear) is what we call it.  I get it all mixed up.  I get those alphabets kind of confused some time.  They--we have thirty volunteers who are going to participate in a read in day where we're going to go in and we're going to read to the kids and hopefully there will be other activities.  What I'd like to do with the school which is, I really enjoy working with the schools and young kids, particularly girls, the principal has a, I think she meets like once a week or a couple of times a month with her fifth grade girls and I would like to be an ongoing part of that involvement with the schools.  I'm there most of the--it's easier for me to do that in Sarasota than in Richmond cause I'm Florida most of the school year.  I go there in October.  I'm there until April.  So if I could get involved with a school there, that's what I'd like to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you've got to do Back To School with The HistoryMakers for us in September too so maybe that will be a good (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I could do that either in, in Florida or in Richmond, depending on where I am.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 143132
Speaker 1: Is your book ['The Road to Someplace Better: From the Segregated South to Harvard Business School and Beyond'] a useful tool in the schools when you--?
Speaker 2: Well the, the schools have said they--it, it has been.  Now this lady, she, she has a book and she wants to use it.  And another book that I have--and I didn't mention.  I didn't bring--I'll give you a copy of that.  I've co-authored with twenty-one other black women, it's entitled 'A Guide for African American Girls.'  And every--each of us wrote one chap--my chapter's on education and self-esteem.  So this principal is using and some other schools have used--I have spoken to a number of schools and I use the book from a standpoint of sharing my experience with--around the theme of, I mention defeat is not an option or another quote that I use a lot in talking to particularly young people.  It's a quote by Michael Caine [sic, Mark Caine] where he says, success begins when you no longer are captive to your environment.  So whatever situation you are in, whether it's, you find yourself in which the way you grew up or some circumstance in your life, you can either decide that you're going to be captive to that and just stay there or you can decide you're going to find a way out.  So I use that around--and I have developed over the years I've developed what I call my guiding principles that I use in talking to groups and some of them are guiding principles.  Defeat is not an option is one of them.  The other one is education is essential and no short cuts, and another one is cancel your pity party 'cause you know you can always feel sorry for yourself.  Another one is moral compass is essential to having a good life.  So I talk to young people around those topics and I bring in experiences and stories from my life to illustrate how I arrived at those and how they impacted my life.
Story_ID: 143133
Speaker 1: Now when--so you're involved in a lot of activities to inspire youth and to mentor--
Speaker 2: Yeah and I have, I have some young women that I mentor, some in business and some--matter of fact I reached a point where I don't take on anymore.  I still get requests where somebody wants me to mentor them.  But--and my feeling is I can't devote time to it.  And a lot of them don't take a lot of time.  Every--each mentoring--each mentee, I call them or whatever you call, requires different kinds of involvement.  Some I may talk to once in a while and some contact me more than others, it just depends.  But I'd like to be--I don't want to have a hundred people I'm mentoring doing nothing with any of them.  So I do, try to--I mention three or four of them in my book that I have a mentoring relationship with.
Speaker 1: So do people send their daughters to you?
Speaker 2: Do what?
Speaker 1: Do people send their daughters to you for--?
Speaker 2: Not really, no.  No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it doesn't happen like that so--?
Speaker 2: No, it doesn't really happen like that.  It's very strange how some of them happen.  One is my niece, she just, I guess we just sort of--she just sort of--she's the most difficult one I have, I'd say.  (laughter).  But she's one of--and one of them is a business--who had, a young lady who has the same kind of business I have and she basically calls me with ideas about business and things that she's doing and she doesn't call me that often.  One is a pediatrician.  It's very interesting how I ended up mentoring her.  I was speaking to a women's conference one day and she was in the audience and afterwards she came up to me and said she enjoyed my presentation and she wanted to spend more time.  Said, in case you don't know it, you're going to be my mentor.  I just sort of looked at her.  So these are the people who asked me about mentoring them.  I put some of the responsibility on them to see how serious they are about wanting to make some commitment to this and so I told her to contact me and so she (unclear) away, invited me to dinner and had a lot of questions for me.  And periodically she'll get together, go out and have lunch and she'll just discuss with me what she's doing.  And I was wondering why does a pediatrician want me to mentor? What--but she was--she's a pediatrician but she wanted her business to--she wanted to run her practice like a business so she would bounce ideas off me about business related things which I thought made a lot of sense cause many doctors don't know a lot about running a business you know.  That's not what they're trained to do.  But for many practices it is a business now with all the paperwork and rules and regulations you have to follow.  So they--it--the mentoring comes about in different ways.  And one young lady I met through my church, she was having some difficulties in her personal--and she just asked me--invited me to lunch one day and wanted to talk to me and we just established that relationship so some of them are not a formal you know mentor/mentee but we know that's what it is.
Story_ID: 143134
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, we always ask this question, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: What are my hopes and concerns?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: My hope is that we will become a more cohesive group and be much more supportive of each other.  I think we're probably one of the most divisive groups around and there's no reason we should be.  And we, I think we frequently misdirect our efforts, organizations.  I was in an organization once it--because not--I don't want to call the name, but they spent a lot of money doing foolish fun things.  And I'm thinking if they took all that money and did something positive with it, look what could happen?  So I don't, I'm not part of the organization anymore cause I didn't see any benefit of being there and I just thought it was, just such a waste of money just to go away and have a good time some time.  And I'm very concerned about the--well two concerns, about the youth education particularly of young men.  Too many young African American men are not in school.  So you have the schools even high school, college, etc., many more women are in college than the men. The other concern of course is what future--who are these young women are going to marry, what pools they have for a spouse?  That--another concern I have about many of the African American boys and girl--men and women, they've grown up in this I say so-called integrated society and they have no understanding or appreciation for what some of the issues they may face later on when they get out into the real world and run up against what is a real discrimination or racial kind of situation.  They haven't experienced--they have no idea how to deal with it 'cause they grow up thinking that they will be treated equal when in many cases they may not be treated equal.  So--see, we grew up in an environment where we knew we weren't going to be treated equal so we prepared to deal with it.  And I, that's a double edged sword.  I don't know whether it's best that they know or whether it's best that they don't know.
Story_ID: 143135
Speaker 1: So do you, do you think that this is a post-racial society we're living in today?
Speaker 2: No.  You serious?  (laughter) You can just look at how they treat our president [HM President Barack Obama].  (laughter) I mean just the office of the president, he doesn't get the respect just by being in that position.  I think a lot of it is racial.  People just cannot accept the fact that he's the president.  So there are lots of, I think a lot of it has changed but I think there's still--I don't think race is an issue that is gone.
Story_ID: 143136
Speaker 1: Now what, I didn't ask you, I failed to ask you this but I don't even know, I don't know how you're going to answer it.  But did, did the--and I don't know how it specifically affected you but did the--how did the, the change in political climates in [Washington] D.C. affect your business?  I mean did, did it at all?  I mean did it matter if the president was [Ronald] Reagan or [William "Bill"] Clinton--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --or if the mayor was [HM] Marion Barry or--?
Speaker 2: I can't say it affected my business.  Now the other thing that I think I caution people on there, as I said I don't think race is something that's in the past but I also think people have to be really careful, everything isn't racial.  And people ask me how I deal with situations like--I say well I just act like it doesn't exist.  I mean if something is happening to me I think is racial, I act like it's not there.  I do what I'm supposed to do and expect to do even in spite of that.  So I'm not one to quickly say well I think this--that happened to me cause I was black or I didn't do this, they didn't give me this because I was black.  That does happen sometime but I think sometimes people might use that as an excuse when it may not be the real issue.  I make sure that if I'm in a situation where basically--I make sure I am well prepared, that I--that cannot be the reason, the real reason so I don't use that but I don't ignore it if it slaps me in the face even.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know whether that makes sense or not but--
Speaker 1: Well it does and I--well it does to me that--because you actually answered the following question.  Have you ever you know seen real racism and did you really deal with it?  I guess you're saying that you have and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm, I deal with it very diplomatic.  I don't--it's not out of anger.  I very distinctly remember where there were two cases where I'm, I feel very sure that this guy did not give me a contract simply because he didn't think I deserved to have the nicer things.  I drove up in a, I think I was driving a Buick, it was a nice new Buick and he was really upset that that was my car.  I mean it wasn't anything fancy but he thought it was more than I should have.  And I had another case where a guy, he was really trying to get me out of the contract and called me in of the meeting and he went up one side of me and down the other ranting and raving and screaming and carrying on and acting really crazy.  And I sat there and looked at him like he was crazy.  I didn't get involved--I didn't let him draw me into his argument and bring me down to his level.  I maintained my dignity.  When he finished I asked him, are you finished?  And I just left.  But I won't get into a debate with them.  But in both cases it was very clear to me that--and sometimes I'm not sure whether it's race or gender.  They may get mixed sometimes but I can't say I've had a lot of it but I've had some of it.  But I don't let that deter me from what I'm trying--I try to find a way around it or decide that this isn't worth me getting--or dealing with and I move on to something else.  If I can do something to rectify the situation I will.  If I find out this is just, this person is just the way that person is and I can't--I can't spend a lot of time trying to change this person.  If anything change the environment.
Story_ID: 143137
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could go back and change it?
Speaker 2: Business, personal or both?
Speaker 1: Both.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I would--well one of the things I regret not having done as a result of having gone to Harvard [Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] is capitalize on my Harvard network.  When I left I was so glad to get away I didn't have any contact with anyone.  I think it would have made a difference in my business life because I could have drawn upon the resources of all of those people who were there and could have helped me, the business.  Maybe some (unclear) people into my business or made my business more successful.  I regret not having done that so I tell people today, use your network or people that you meet in college, business.  Don't walk away from them, use them, you know be involved in that.  Give back to that group and ask--I would do that.  I would not have--I think I would not have married right between my two years in college.  If I had it to do over I would have waited and would have probably explored some other business opportunities or at least explored whether there were opportunities available for me when I finished graduate school.  I would have explored an opportunity or what I think would have been a great opportunity in my business in the, I think it was the early '80s [1980s] when cable first came out.  I had a contract with Metromedia I think was the name of the company in Maryland.  They were laying cables and we had a contract in one of their buildings and the lady I was working with told me, she says you really ought to look at getting into the cable business and I didn't explore it.  I wish I had.  (laughter)  It would have been a whole different story now.  See, I would have--I regret not having done that.  And like I say I regret not having involved my, particularly my youngest daughter [Tasha Lincoln] in the business earlier and more--I put a lot of emphasis on this young man that was with me, I guess maybe it was the son I never had and I developed him and I should have spent more time getting my daughter in earlier and giving her more--getting her more involved in the company to take it over.  I regret having sold it and not have it go on with someone.  So there are a few regrets I guess I have.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Well likewise when you look back over this same period of time, what today do you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I consider my legacy is that you can do whatever it is you want to do if you're willing to put the effort into it.  But whatever you've done in life, you have a responsibility to give back, go back and give to other people to bring other people along with you as opposed to feeling that everything you did is on your own.  There were a lot of people who helped me along the way and I try to see myself now as helping and guiding other people to the extent that I can whether it's a volunteer effort, a paid effort or whatever way that's necessary.  We all have responsibility to give back some of the successes that we have achieved.

Speaker 1: We have not mentioned--now you were, you were here at Old Dominion [University, Norfolk, Virginia] for a board meeting, right?
Speaker 2: Virginia--yeah.
Speaker 1: Virginia (unclear).
Speaker 2: Virginia Commonwealth University [Richmond, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Yeah, how did you get on the board of--?
Speaker 2: That's interesting.  It's interesting, I've been on two university boards, neither one I went to the school of.  So I was on the board of regents for the University System of Maryland for about five years.  I was--all--both of these were appointed, government appointees, appointments.  And I've been on the board here for, I'm in my sixth year and I have two more years here.  I've been--I was always recommended by someone and I don't know whether this is the case or not, but I think in both cases they probably were looking for women, and maybe black women, but I think they wanted to diversify in both cases.  Now they--when I came on the board in Maryland, I think when I went on the board I don't think there were any other women.  And I was on the board of a bank up there too and I know I came in, I was recommended by someone who specifically told me they wanted to bring in some women on the board.  So that's how I got into that.  And here I was recommended by a woman who was a tenured professor here and she asked me if I would consider serving on the board.  I hadn't thought about it and wasn't even looking for--to serve on the board and I was appointed by Governor [Mark] Warner when he was here and then I was reappointed by [Timothy "Tim"] Kaine before he left.  So I'm in my--you can only serve two four year terms.  I'm in my final term here.  So I was on the board of regents at University System of Maryland and here at Virginia Commonwealth University but I didn't go to either one of those schools.  Many of the people on board are alumni, so--

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell us about your family.  Now you, you were married for the final time I guess on, in '99 [1999].
Speaker 2: Yeah, you're right, '99 [1999].
Speaker 1: In 1999, right.
Speaker 2: That is the final right time, '90--I got married in April of '99 [1999] and as I said, I, I, I, I decided I was not going to marry again.  I was--this is it for me.  But I was--my sis--my brother who lived here in Richmond [Virginia] and his wife were visiting me one day in Maryland and we were just talking and I said to her, you know being on the board of University System [of Maryland], being in business there were all kinds of functions I was going to all the time.  I was frequently going by myself or sometimes I'd take a girlfriend of mine.  And I was saying to her one day, I said you know sometime I really do get tired of going to all these social functions without an escort.  Sometimes it would be nice just to have somebody to go with you.  And she said, I know just the guy.  He'd make a great escort.  He lives in Richmond and his wife died a few months ago.  And I don't know if he's dating or not but I think you ought to meet him and she introduced me to my current husband.  And he was a great escort.  I often remind him, he was only supposed to be an escort, not a husband.  (laughter).  But he had, he has three adult children who live here in Richmond.  And I--my--I have two daughters in New York and I have two grand--each of my--each daughter has a child.  One has a little boy and one has a little girl.  They're both five--well one's--one just turned six and the other one will be six in March.  And Johnny [John Lambert] has I think six grandkids and his--all of his family is here in Richmond.  His brothers--well he has a sister in Kansas City [Missouri] and one in north Virginia but he has three brothers here in Richmond, one was a state senator.  And his mom is still alive.  She'll be a hundred years old in July so as long--I know, I tell him as long--we come--we go to Florida in October, come back for Christmas and I know we'll do that as long as she's alive because that's a big family holiday celebration and that's--he was an accountant.  He worked for International Trucks of Richmond, a local dealer and he retired in 2004, 2005.

Speaker 1: Now is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I don't know, we talked about a lot.  And you did--we did talk about the alumni award from Harvard [Business School, Boston, Massachusetts], did we talk about that?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, we talked about that and the--I think we've covered everything.
Speaker 1: Okay, we probably--there's always something we haven't.  But that's the nature of doing this I guess.  But the last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as someone who hopefully made an effort to give back more than she received from whatever it is she was involved in.  To--someone who made a contribution to make the world in general a better place, but particularly the path for young people who are our future and do that through being involved in educational situations and working with young people, giving advice and guidance and support.
