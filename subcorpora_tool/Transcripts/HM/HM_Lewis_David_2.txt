Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that management compels me to ask everyone--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: --and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: They may give me trouble here.
Speaker 1: All right. The first one, is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Favorite food?  You mean, as compared to desserts or entrees or appetizers or is anything (simultaneous)?

Story_ID: 418644
Speaker 1: All right, now I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Walton Adams Lewis] side.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And we'll start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Mother's full name is Dorothy Baker Lewis.  Also her maiden name was Dorothy Florence Baker--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so it's D-O-R-O-T-H-Y, B-A-K-E-R, L-E-W-I-S--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and Florence is the normal way F-L-O-R-E-N-C-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born February the 4th, 1915 in Bay City, Michigan.
Speaker 1: And where approximately is Bay City?
Speaker 2: Bay City is a--if the Michigan is shaped geographically like your--like a right hand mitt and surrounded by the Great Lakes, and this body of water which is part of the Lake Huron is called Saginaw Bay but Bay City is right at the bottom of the thumb and the forefinger there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and it was a town that had a lot of prominence because of the lumber industry in the early years.  It was quite a center for shipping lumber through the Great Lakes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side and how far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: We can--I can trace them back to her grandfather whose name was James Baker.  He came to Bay City, Michigan as I understand it in 1848 from Virginia.
Speaker 1: Do you know where in Virginia?
Speaker 2: I don't know exactly where in Virginia and the family settled in.  He was a--his profession--he was a barber and he established his barber practice there in Bay City, Michigan and his wife's name I believe was Mary [Mary Baker].  She was also from Virginia, I believe, though I'm not certain they were married at the time they arrived in Michigan in 1848.
Speaker 1: Okay, now that's while slavery was still going on in Virginia.  Is there a story as to how they--were they free or were they freed by someone and came up from Virginia or did they escape and, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were free men, free people and I'm not certain how my great-grandfather became free or if he was always free.
Speaker 1: Okay so the great-grandfather was freed, was freed by someone at--
Speaker 2: Yeah, all I know is he was a free man when he came to Michigan.
Story_ID: 418645
Speaker 1: As a matter of fact, his son [Lewis' maternal grandfather], who I'll tell you about in a minute, Oscar W. Baker, who's really sort of the patriarch of the current generation of relatives, was the chairman of Michigan Freedmen's Society [Freedmen's Aid Society] which toward the end of the 18th century, the early 1900s published a freedmen's manual that sought to identify all of the colored, African American residents of the state who were freemen and just--I'm not certain what gave impetus to that project, but actually there is a book that I have in my office which I can share with you that shows some of the printing and publication that was done and the amalgamation of information about a number of different people, businesses in the state at that time sort of the chronicle--I think it was, it was related to sort of chronicling certain number of years after emancipation the progress of freedmen in the State of Michigan.  So in any event, the union of James [James Baker] and Mary Baker gave forth two sons and remember correctly two daughters.  One of the sons' names was Oscar, Oscar Baker and he, at the age of seven, was involved in a railroad accident which resulted in the loss of his right leg.  He eventually graduated from secondary school, got a job in Lansing [Michigan], the state capital, with the lieutenant governor of the state who may have been from Bay City [Michigan] and he read law, which you could do back at the turn of the century, turn of the 1900, where you could read law cases and read statutes and read the constitution and other legal documents and be certified as a lawyer.  So--and he also took some classes at the University of Michigan Law School in Ann Arbor [Michigan].
Speaker 2: Just to point me, that's the way Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln] you know, became a lawyer--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in those days (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right you could do that.  Right.
Speaker 2: --if you read law and passed the bar I think or take a test or something.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So my grandfather did that and in 1902 he was awarded his Bachelor of Laws I think they called it back in those days.
Speaker 2: Now that--in what year was that?
Speaker 1: Nineteen o' two [1902].
Speaker 2: Nineteen o' two [1902], okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Story_ID: 418646
Speaker 1: So Oscar W. Baker began his law practice in Bay City [Michigan] in 1902 and it's a practice that exists today over a hundred years later with one of the partners in the firm who is not a Baker had a son who carries on the tradition of the firm even today under the name of Baker and Selby [Baker, Baker and Selby, Bay City, Michigan], S-E-L-B-Y.  So Oscar was born of course in Michigan.  He's my mother's [Dorothy Baker Lewis] father.  He was also the father of eight of her siblings along with her mother Ida Harrison Baker who was originally from Lima, Ohio, and I'm not certain how Oscar and Ida met but they, they had a large family of, of nine kids.
Speaker 2: Now Lima, and I've done a lot of thinking about this because I'm from Dayton [Ohio]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --Lima is just north of Dayton?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Sixty miles north of I-75 [Interstate 75] is the old Dixie Highway, as they called--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --where it go all the way up to Detroit [Michigan] just like 75 follow the same trail (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: --so I don't know if the railroad followed that route or if you know I mean but the communication along that line is--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --pretty, you know, steady.
Speaker 1: Right.  So they had nine kids, four boys and five girls and my mother was the third oldest child and the oldest girl in that family.  And consequently I have lots of cousins and second cousins, as the family grew and spread out over the country.  And my mother grew up in Bay City, Michigan.  And the minority population--there was a minority population of course in Bay City at the time, but she attended integrated schools.  They did not have the kind of rigid segregation in Bay City that would have been typical for instance in the, in the South during the 1900s.
Speaker 2: Or, or probably in Detroit I would guess it was--the schools are probably segregated here in Detroit.
Speaker 1: Yeah, on a, on a de facto basis.  As a matter of fact well into the 1900s the attendance patterns were gerrymandered so that black and white students were essentially segregated on a de facto basis you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 418647
Speaker 1: I don't know if there are any stories that you know of or not but I know back in the 19th century, Detroit [Michigan]--the Freedmen [Freedmen's Aid Society] in Detroit were really involved in the Underground Railroad--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --so do you have any stories from this side of the family of that kind of involvement because--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --people in Detroit, Douglass [Frederick Douglass] came to Detroit at a certain point, John Brown--
Speaker 2: right.
Speaker 1: --blacks in Detroit, you know Second Baptist Church [Second Baptist Church of Detroit, Detroit, Michigan] has a big tradition so does Bethel A.M.E. [Bethel A.M.E. Church, Detroit, Michigan]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I don't know, is there any other those kinds of stories?
Speaker 2: Not that I'm aware of from my mother's [Dorothy Baker Lewis] side of the family.  She was born in 1915.  She met my dad [Walton Adams Lewis] at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] in the mid to late '30s [1930s] and she didn't really begin to live in Detroit until late '30s [1930s] early '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Well I was thinking maybe your ancestors on her side--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of Bay City [Michigan] since they knew that network of Freedmen (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --had and there were stories and being right at Bay City you think that'd be a great launching point to go to Canada--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --to Ontario [Canada].
Speaker 2: Well yeah, it, it is in one sense that further north you go the probably easier would be to cross the border but the distances across the lake to Canada at that point in Bay City are quite substantial and the, the easiest crossing and the narrowest crossing is right through the what they call the straits of Detroit which is the Detroit River and that's, that's where most of the crossings were done and, and there's a monument there to that fact--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --right now.
Speaker 1: Actually south of Detroit you know is really strange. That part of Ontario is actually south of Detroit (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, there's some, some places down there Grosse Ile [Michigan] and where you can hop from the mainland Michigan to Grosse Ile [ph.] and then over to Canada to there are number of places where you can take the opportunity but I don't recall any stories, family stories about my grandfather's generation being involved with the Underground Railroad, perhaps because of the location of Bay City.  But he and other members of the family were involved in civil rights activities in, in Bay City and they're very active with NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and a number of things there.  Actually two of the sons of Oscar [Oscar W. Baker] and Ida Baker [Ida Harrison Baker] turned out to be lawyers who practiced with their father.  Oscar W. Baker, Jr. and James W. Baker and they both practiced with Baker and Selby [Baker, Baker and Selby, Bay City, Michigan] over the years and they had a personal injury practice, a criminal defense practice, a number of things that brought them into contact with the struggles of African Americans you know in the greater Bay City community to secure their civil, civil and human rights.
Story_ID: 418648
Speaker 1: Your mother, so she finished high school in Bay City [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Finished high school in Bay City then she, she went to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] for her undergraduate activity, undergraduate training and then she attended University of Michigan in the social work school, postgraduate work.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so you said she met your father at Howard?
Speaker 2: At Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right, now what did she major in?
Speaker 2: She majored in sociology.
Speaker 1: Okay sociology, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And did she become a I guess a practitioner of sociology, did she teach or, what did she do?
Speaker 2: She, she worked as a social worker--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when she came to Detroit [Michigan] and was a social worker probably through the '40s [1940s] into the early '50s [1950s] and then she helped my dad in his business [W.A. Lewis Insurance Agency; Lewis and Thompson Agency, Inc., Detroit, Michigan] most of the time in the '50s [1950s] and the early '60s [1960s] she was taking care of me--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --or the one, the one son from the union of Walton [Walton Adams Lewis] and Dorothy Lewis [Dorothy Baker Lewis].
Story_ID: 418649
Speaker 1: Now did she [Lewis' mother, Dorothy Baker Lewis] have any stories of growing up that you remember that you can share with us?
Speaker 2: There were, you know, there were a few stories.  One actually the famous story in the family has to do with my [maternal] grandfather's [Oscar W. Baker] loss of his leg in that train accident that I referred to.  He went to law school [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan] and through his studies determined that the railroad company that had paid a sum of money in settlement of his injury had paid the the money to his parents [James Baker and Mary Baker] instead of to a trust that was set up for his benefit.  So he sued the railroad company again and won a judgment for a significant amount of money that was paid to him and helped to establish a principle in Michigan law that you need a guardian ad litem for a minor when there is a personal injury settlement connected with a minor's injury and so that was a famous story in the family about his tenacity and his insight into, into the law.
Story_ID: 418650
Speaker 1: Then with respect to other stories, there are family stories about the family going to either Ann Arbor [Michigan] for football games, which they did quite a bit to Idlewild [Michigan] which was sort of the black Riviera at the time and--
Speaker 2: Idlewild from what I understand was halfway or part way between Chicago [Illinois] and Detroit [Michigan], right?
Speaker 1: Right.  Although I think it's more rather a direct line between Detroit and Chicago, it's sort of the northern end of a triangle--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that would be drawn (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Grand Rapids [Michigan] more--
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly.  More in the, in the central Chicago would be down here and Detroit would be over here and Idlewild would be you know up in here.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Famous black resort?
Speaker 1: --yep, famous black resort.  Lot of times African American families from across the state and Chicago and other parts of the Midwest would meet you know in Idlewild and we visited there when I was a kid and it was a very lively, very lively place.  You know there were restaurants there.  There were bars where there were performance venues and Cab Calloway, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington would you know that would be one of the stops on the summer tour going to Idlewild and playing there for two, three weeks, you know.  All of the black entertainers would come through that, that venue in the summertime 'cause that was the place to be.
Story_ID: 418651
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name is Walton Adams Lewis, W-A-L-T-O-N, A-D-A-M-S, L-E-W-I-S.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth was November the 28th, 1910.  He was born in Clearwater, Florida.  He was one of four children born to the union of George Adams and Emma [Emma Lewis]--I can't remember my grandmother's maiden name.  It was of course it was it was Emma Adams after she married, I don't recall the--her maiden name.  She was originally from southern Georgia and it may have been Lee [ph.] because her sister's name was Minnie Lee Corbo [ph.], Corbo was her married name so it may have been Lee, Emma Lee was possibly my grandmother's maiden name.  And I'm not certain how she and George Adams met but they lived and began to raise a family in the early 1900s.  My dad was the youngest of four, four kids.  He had one brother, David [David Adams Lewis] after whom I'm named and two sisters Nettie Adams [Nettie Adams Lewis] and Lottie Adams [Lottie Adams Lewis] and when he was seven years old his natural father abandoned the family and my paternal grandmother was a domestic and she would travel with the family winter, summer--Florida in the winter, New Hampshire, Keene, New Hampshire in the summer, in the summertime.  They go north in the, in the summer and--
Speaker 1: So she would work for people in the summertime in New Hampshire?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then come back--
Speaker 2: Come to their place.  Clearwater, Clearwater Beach [Florida] and around there was a very favorite spot for northerners to have a second home in the winter time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she would--it was a--so I suppose she would--so she would work for the same family then in both spots (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, she worked for the same family right, exactly.
Story_ID: 418652
Speaker 1: She was a religious woman [Lewis' paternal grandmother, Emma Lewis] and she met the grandfather that I really know the best according to my dad's story, Peyton M. Lewis in Rockford, Illinois.  They met in Rockford.  I think it may have been simply a matter of the family that my grandmother attended maybe spending a summer in Rockford, Illinois as opposed to Keene, New Hampshire but she met Peyton M. Lewis there and at the time he was a minister in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church and they married and thus my dad became instead of Walton Adams, Walton Adams Lewis so he took his stepfather's name and thereafter my grandparents moved to Iowa where my, my, grand--my grandfather, step-grandfather was a minister at a number of A.M.E. churches different parts of Iowa including Des Moines [Iowa], Cedar Rapids [Iowa], Cedar Falls [Iowa] and Waterloo [Iowa] and so my, my dad actually grew up in Iowa, graduated from Central High School [ph.] in Des Moines, Iowa and at least for his high school years and probably for a good part of his elementary years, so I'm not certainly exactly when they, when they moved because he was seven when his father [George Adams] left the family, sometime between the time he was seven and sixteen or seventeen the family moved to to Iowa, to Iowa.  But in any event he too attended a unified school.  He did not attend segregated schools.  There were no segregated schools.  At least he didn't attend a segregated school in Iowa because I saw the pictures of his graduation class.  Actually he was just--he was one of a couple of African American students in the class.  So he lost each of his siblings to tuberculosis by the time they were twenty-five and that was an almost incurable disease back, back then.  And he turned out to be the surviving child of the four and you know actually he prospered, he lived a full life.  He died at the age of eighty-five.
Story_ID: 418653
Speaker 1: Your father [Walton Adams Lewis], I suppose he was a good student, he got a chance to go to Howard University [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Yeah, he, he was a good student.  I don't think there were any academic honors that I can recall.  I think he was you know he was a good athlete, but he did not play college athletics to my knowledge.  He grew up in actually mostly in Waterloo [Iowa] although his family had been in different places where my grandfather [Lewis' paternal step-grandfather, Peyton M. Lewis] ministered various churches.  He spent most of his time in, in Waterloo and what he actually he made friends with a pharmacist there where he worked during--after school by the name of John Roberts [ph.] and so after school he would go there and do odd jobs and earn some, some money and Roberts was a well-to-do pharmacist in the community, took a liking to my dad and with support from John Roberts, one of his friends, another businessman in town, and the local sheriff, they gathered and pulled together the money to send my dad to Howard 'cause he wanted to pursue a college education and so that's how he actually got to to Howard because he did not have you know the means to attend Howard otherwise.  And he was there for a year or two and his, his father died of a heart attack.  So he had to come back to Iowa to take care of his, of his mom [Emma Lewis].  And so he did not actually finish Howard.  He actually finished at Northern Iowa University [Iowa State Teachers College; University of Northern Iowa, Cedar Falls, Iowa] I think it's called now in 1937 but he did get his degree.
Story_ID: 418654
Speaker 1: But while he was at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], he met your mother [Dorothy Baker Lewis], right?
Speaker 2: Right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is there a story that they tell about how they met?
Speaker 2: Not a story about how they met but a story about their courtship that had my moth- my father [Walton Adams Lewis] pursuing my mother around the the reservoir there at on the Howard campus.  You know she would always say, "He chased me around that reservoir trying to catch up with me to take me out to a date," but you know they were I think were friends since they were both from the Midwest.  They got to know one another.  And actually they sort of parted company after my dad left Howard to go back to Iowa and did not meet again until he came to Detroit [Michigan] in the late '30s [1930s] looking for job opportunities because of a friend of his who is a dentist who had come from Iowa to do well here in Detroit by the name of Walter Willis and he wrote to Walter Willis from, from Iowa said, "I'm looking for an opportunity to be gainfully employed.  There's not much going on out here in Iowa and would you lend me a hand?" So, Walter Willis and his wife Marge [Margaret Willis] opened their home to my dad.  He came in the late '30s [1930s] somewhere between probably '38 [1938] and '39 [1939] and the natural thing to do at that time was to apply to Ford, one of the auto companies, so he, he did apply to Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan] and think initially got a job in the foundry at Ford Motor Company, which is a hot dirty job making steel for cars.  But he had his college degree and through Walter Willis and Walter's friends, my dad became acquainted with a number of other folks who were in a position to give him a helping hand, so although he was hired into the foundry, it wasn't long thereafter that he started to work in the Ford employment office.  There was a separate employment office for whites and blacks back in those days and he, he worked in the employment office for, for black applicants and worked there for a while and then also worked in the sociological department, as I understand it which was a department of the company that was set up with the guidance or at the insistence of Clara Ford [Clara Bryant Ford] to attend to the needs of the Ford working community, and so I guess she was involved in a number of social programs for the workers which partially funded through the company and my dad spent some time in that, that department.  But not too long into that experience at Ford Motor Company sort of looking for some other opportunities he began to sell insurance on the side you know after his day job and was successful in selling some basic insurance, casualty insurance and property insurance and probably some automobile insurance back in those days.  The residential communities in Detroit where as we said before segregated and so was the black community was confined to particular part of town and he was successful in selling insurance and he had a dream of owning his own business.
Story_ID: 418655
Speaker 1: He sold insurance and in the nighttime until his renewal commissions from his clients were about equal to what he was making as an employee of Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan]. Then he stopped working for Ford Motor Company and founded the Walton A. Lewis, W.A. Lewis Insurance Agency [Lewis and Thompson Agency, Inc., Detroit, Michigan] back in 1942 I think it was full time, for him.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And 1940 is when he really started selling insurance--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and the, the business continues today, run by my brother, Robert Lewis, who is a product of a marriage my dad [Walton Adams Lewis] had before he married my mother [Dorothy Baker Lewis].  And Bob, as we call him was one of let's see, one of three children from my dad's first marriage.  But he was one of the three.  The other kids lived in California but he was the one who really sort of stuck close to my dad and after my brother had a career in the [U.S.] Army he came to Detroit [Michigan] to work in the insurance agency and is still, still there.  So I never did have a chance because of the tuberculosis to, to meet my aunts and uncle on my father's side of the family.  They all predeceased my birth.  Then my, my [paternal] grandmother [Emma Lewis] I do remember going out and visiting her in the late '40s [1940s] we took a trip out there to, to Iowa but I was a real youngster at that point in time and not long after we were there, she died as well.  So I really didn't get to know her.  I had more interaction although not a lot with my maternal grandfather [Oscar W. Baker] and a lot more interaction with my maternal grandmother [Ida Harrison Baker].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Story_ID: 418656
Speaker 1: When you look at your parents' [Dorothy Baker Lewis and Walton Adams Lewis] personalities, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Oh boy, that's a hard one.  I--you know I really, I really would have to say it's really sort of a combination of the two, almost in equal proportions.  They're both, you know, were outgoing.  They both were, you know, very grounded in terms of values, both had an appreciation for other people regardless of their position or condition in life.  I think I get my sense of business and entrepreneurial spirit from my, my dad, not necessarily by a lot of things that he said just by watching him do what he did because I spent a good amount of time with him when I was growing up, going out tagging along with him to go collect premiums or deliver policies or just to work in the office, sometimes during the week and sometimes on the weekend.
Story_ID: 418657
Speaker 1: Those are the days when a lot of different people would come to the door, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --there's a milk man, a bakery man--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --a dry cleaner man, and insurance man was one of those--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --people that would come to your house and so your father [Walton Adams Lewis] would have to walk a route where his clients were collect the money, his customer were and collect the money right there.
Speaker 2: Well, I think his business [W.A. Lewis Insurance Agency; Lewis and Thompson Agency, Inc., Detroit, Michigan] progressed in the '40s [1940s].  He probably started out you know walking from door to door.  His business progressed in the '40s [1940s] to the point where he had an office located in the black business district and he had some employees who went out and walked the districts and he would call on his commercial customers and that's where I had more of my experience by going with him to call on Ed Davis [Edward Davis] who was a rarity back in those days in the '40s [1940s].  He was a black auto dealer.  He had a Studebaker [Studebaker Corporation] dealership and then--
Speaker 1: Did he have the only black auto dealership in the--
Speaker 2: I believe so yeah at the time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) country at that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah I think it was written I think it was written up in Ebony.
Speaker 1: Ed Davis, huh?
Speaker 2: Ed Davis.
Speaker 1: Ed Davis, what did he call this place Ed Davis' Studebaker or did he or what did he?
Speaker 2: Something like that.  Ed Davis, Ed Davis Motor Dealership [sic. Davis Motor Sales, Detroit, Michigan] or something like that.  So there was--
Speaker 1: Studebaker is made here in Detroit [Michigan] then right?
Speaker 2: Studebaker was made in, I believe, Indiana.  Some place in Indiana.  And it was not necessarily a hot car but you know there were people who were devoted Studebaker customers.
Speaker 1: As I remember it's kind of a dignified little car.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: People didn't like it for that--
Speaker 2: Right, right.  So you know people like Ed Davis or there was a life insurance company which my dad was involved with Great Lakes Life [Great Lakes Life Insurance Company], go visit them.  There were black cleaners, some black retail market, number of different places where you know Barthwell Drugs which was a chain of black drug--drugstores here in Detroit [Michigan] in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] which was quite, quite successful you know, Sid Barthwell [Sidney Barthwell].  So Richard, Richard Henry Austin who was later secretary of state was a CPA [certified public accountant] who had his office in, in the black business district and eventually moved over, was one of the first African Americans to have a business on Woodward Avenue that was a real accomplishment back in those days.  But it was those folks I met at an early age just tagging along with my dad and you know and enjoyed the experience and got the sense of what it was to be you know your own, your own boss.  So I get that entrepreneurial spirit I'm certain from, from my dad.  You know whatever degree of grace I have I probably get from my mom [Dorothy Baker Lewis].  She's a very gracious person, easy to get to know, very even keel person in temperament.  She gets angry though. She's not so even keel.  So I think I would say I'm really a reflection of both of them.  Plus since I'm a Gemini, I have the capability of certain mirroring the two of them with in temperament at least and my own personality because I'm a product of the sign of the twins.
Story_ID: 418658
Speaker 1: Now, how many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: I have--there're no brothers or sisters from the marriage of my mother [Dorothy Baker Lewis] and father [Walton Adams Lewis].  And Robert Lewis is a stepbrother who, who I knew at an early age when I was preadolescent, the product of a union my dad and his first wife.  But Bob was in military school when I was growing up so we really didn't spend that much time together you know.  It was only after he graduated from military school and went into the [U.S.] Army, had a career in the Army and then at the ripe old age of thirty-eight or thirty-nine, retired from the Army as a master sergeant with tours of duty in Europe and in, in Vietnam then he came back to Detroit [Michigan] and you know we got to know each other a lot better at that point when he was almost forty years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm about ten years his junior so I was probably thirty at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 418659
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think the earliest childhood memory that I can recall must have been I was somewhere between two and four.  We lived in a two family flat on the upper flat and not too far from the railroad tracks and I can remember seeing railroad train for the first time and engine pulling the freight cars along the tracks and somehow another I've been told or knew this was a choo choo so you know I explained to my mom [Dorothy Baker Lewis], choo choo, choo choo, and I can remember that happening several different times because we could see it from one of the windows in the flat the railroad train passing by and that's a very strong, strong memory for me 'cause I really did marvel at the you know the train pulling the freight cars down the track.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's, that's, that's one--
Story_ID: 418660
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I remember we, we moved from a two family flat where there was a wonderful older couple by the name of George Edwards [ph.] and his wife who owned the flat and it was small.  As a matter of fact my mom [Dorothy Baker Lewis] and pop [Walton Adams Lewis] called the flat the upper flat the cracker box because it was, it was so small.  But we moved about a mile, mile and a half away where my dad built a ranch home in the early '50s [1950s] where my mom still lives today, fifty-five years later.  And one of the--couple of memories I have there one was just playing football in the small yard with some of the, some of the kids my age in the neighborhood.  It was quite, quite a neighborhood.  The--across the street from us there was a Barber family.  John Barber [ph.] was employee of the Detroit street railway system [Detroit United Railway].  He was a bus driver and eventually he was one of the people who guided the trolley down the trolley tracks around Detroit [Michigan] and he had two kids, John, Jr. [John Barber, Jr. (ph.)] and Muriel [Muriel Barber (ph.)].  On the other side because we lived on the corner, Al [Al Page (ph.)] and Sarah Page [ph.], Al was a Ford [Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan] UAW [United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America] employee, worked on the line that was to the right of our house.  And off to the other side of the left side of our house were Walter [Walter R. Greene, Jr.] and Frieda Greene [Frieda Bailey Greene].  And Walter worked with the Fair Employment Practices Commission [sic. Fair Employment Practices Committee], eventually was deputy mayor of the City of Detroit and they had two boys, Gregory [Gregory C. Greene], and Gregory and Gregory's brother--Walter, Walter Green, Walter, Jr. [sic. Walter R. Greene III].  And then one house removed from them was the Dade family, Malcolm [Malcolm G. Dade, Sr.] and Jean Dade [Bonnie Jean Denham Dade].  He was a rector at St. Cyprian's Episcopal Church [Detroit, Michigan] on the, on the east--on the west side.  And they had three kids, Malcolm [Malcolm G. Dade, Jr.], Dwayne [ph.]--no four kids, Malcolm, Dwayne, two girls whose name I'm gonna remember here.  Margaret [Margaret Dade] was one and Julie, Margaret and Julie Dade.  So there were a lot of kids in the, in the neighborhood.  Conant Gardens [Detroit, Michigan] which is where this house was built was an area that Henry Ford had specifically purchased for his black employees to build homes during the time that they worked and lived in the City of Detroit so it was community rich with African Americans doing a variety of things that was sort of a magnet not only for people who worked in the automobile industry, but other African Americans who were looking for a good stable community.  And of course as we found out in the late '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] there were a number of subdivisions where there were restrictive covenants--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and whites could not sell their homes to blacks so that of course had the tendency to push blacks into certain parts of the city.
Story_ID: 418661
Speaker 1: Most major cities in those days were going through a housing crises with the influx of blacks from the South, the Great Migration (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --so--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I guess Henry Ford in setting aside his land relieved some of that pressure, I suppose.
Speaker 2: Right I think that was, that was part of the rationale but it was, it was a wonderful childhood in terms of growing up in the city [Detroit, Michigan] 'cause right across 7 Mile Road which was a block away from where we lived houses looked pretty much the same, tree lined streets just happened to be all whites who lived north of 7 Mile and there were whites who lived south of 7 Mile.  But there weren't any blacks who lived north of 7 Mile who just you know that was the line of demarcation at the time.
Speaker 1: Do you know what happen to you if you cross that line?
Speaker 2: Nothing.  There was free movement you know throughout the city.  And of course (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. So if you decided to ride your bike over there or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah it wasn't, it wasn't a problem.  But on the other hand you know there was the fact that you know you didn't see any black faces north the 7 Mile at the time.  And that's changed dramatically now.
Speaker 1: I know some communities it's dangerous to cross those lines (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --they're viaducts--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --streets on the other side.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well you know there was some race, race confrontations in the city over the, the years and I'm certain there were experiences where at the wrong time people at the wrong place and were set upon just by virtue of being black and I wouldn't be surprised if it happened the other way around either.
Story_ID: 418662
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, lots of sights to remember lots of sounds as well.  Lots of smell, one of the, one of the most prominent smells was the--there are a couple of bakeries around town.  One was a silver cup bakery which is on the lower east side over on Vernor [Highway] and Chene [Street] and that wonderful aroma of baking, baking bread and then there was another, there was a Wonder Bread facility over on the west side which is actually the home of the MotorCity Casino [MotorCity Casino Hotel, Detroit, Michigan] now.  And after the expressways were built you know you can, you can drive down the, the freeway in the winter or summer and just catch that wonderful smell of bread baking.  The sights were, were pretty delicious because Detroit [Michigan] was a community of single family homes.  The residential communities were quite remarkable.  The thousands and thousands of trees and you know reflected the middle class lifestyle which the automobile industry brought to the working population at that point in time.  And then there was you know downtown with the skyscrapers and the big Hudson store [J.L. Hudson Company] with the riverfront with the Belle Isle boat.  Belle Isle [Belle Isle Park, Detroit, Michigan] itself is a place to have a picnic, paddle a canoe, ride a horse, do horseshoes, in the swing.  It's the great place to have some fun and then back in those days they were, they were providing tours, giving tours of the automobile manufacturing facilities so just the sight of these massive buildings where cars would be assembled.  Some of them were two stories.  They're not, they were not at that point in time all on one floor but when we--as a school kid you take a tour of the auto manufacturing facility, you could go all the way from the site of a huge container of molten iron was being poured into a--what they call those some sort of a shaping device to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A mold, some sort of a mold?
Speaker 2: Yes, some sort of a mold to the actual assembly line where you hear the rattatatat of the guns and there--were putting on--
Speaker 1: The wrenches and (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) wrenches, bolting on some of the pieces.
Story_ID: 418663
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a little kid?  I mean what were you interested in and are there any stories about you can share with us?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Well first of all I, I was an only child so didn't have brothers or sisters to relate to.  And that led me to you know a number of times having just to entertain myself and figure out you know what to do which you know I, I enjoyed my childhood in, in that regard.  Didn't read all that much.  I liked to work with my hands and various things and word working, model planes and things like that.  And I did enjoy school.  I had went to Courville Elementary School [Detroit, Michigan] where I was you know an okay student.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: C-O-U-R-V-I-L-L-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Before I started Courville, I went to a preschool that was at St. Peter Claver [St. Peter Claver School], C-L-A-V-E-R, in the lower east side of Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Now Saint Peter Claver was a Catholic saint that fought against the slave trade in South America?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Right.  Right.  And you know I can remember that I was infatuated with a little girl there whose name was Tanya [ph.] who I wanted to be my best friend and you know I remember running after her all the time as we were in the same class and one day we were doing an activity with one of the teachers on the piano and we were playing as though we were certain kind of animals and one of the animals was pretend that you were an elephant with you know with big tusk and so I had my head down so much into being an elephant that I walked dead into the side of the piano and everybody just laughed, laughed at me and I had a little cut right in the middle of my head 'cause I actually hit right on the corner and it was a little painful but in any event that's one of my memories of nursery school.  Then Courville was an integrated elementary school 'cause basically serving a working class neighborhood of Detroit which was, which was integrated and I went to Nolan Junior High School [Detroit, Michigan] and--
Speaker 1: How do you spell that one?
Speaker 2: N-O-L-A-N-D no N-O-L-A-N, excuse me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Nolan was north of 7 Mile [7 Mile Road] and whereas graduates of Courville in the seventh grade, I think it was the seventh grade, maybe it was the eighth grade, would normally have gone to Cleveland Junior High School [Elizabeth Cleveland Intermediate School, Detroit, Michigan], which was a junior high school that was predominantly black.  The year that I graduated from Courville, our class was assigned to go to junior high school at Nolan and so I wound up going to Nolan and integrating Nolan High School with several of my classmates who you know went there to begin the junior high school experience and that was fine, it worked out well.
Story_ID: 418664
Speaker 1: I can't remember any examples of racist activity or anything like that.  There certainly was good rapport among the students and no fights or anything like that.  It was, it was a pretty harmonious atmosphere which was sort of illustrative of this northeastern part of town in the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s].  And in, in one sense it was a very unrealistic environment because it was not a true reflection of what was going on throughout the rest of the country.  And it was in one instance very advanced because it was integrated and there were black teachers, there were white teachers, there're black administrators, white administrators, it was sort of you know the equal opportunity of community but there were again these little lines that you know you, you really thought about it you couldn't cross but you could go the same supermarket, same cleaners and we all ultimately wound up at the same high school, going from Nolan Junior High School [Detroit, Michigan] to Pershing High School [John J. Pershing High School, Detroit, Michigan].  And Pershing High School was a, a wonderful experience for me.  We lived three blocks away from Pershing, three blocks away from the part Pershing that was the athletics fields and so every Friday in the fall as a youngster I can imagine--I can remember rather, not imagine, I can remember the older kids with some of them with cars going to the high school football game and you know saying there go the big kids to the high school football game.  One of these years I'm gonna be going to the high school football game myself.  And so the transition from Nolan to Pershing was, was easy.  I was not a great student, just you know barely sort of held my own.  I liked to get out and play baseball and do other things, ride my bike, whatever.
Story_ID: 418665
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you have a favorite subject in school at all?
Speaker 2: I think probably geography and I liked, I liked the, the courses where you did something with your hands and the shop work.  I liked that.  I wasn't particularly good at it.  I didn't particularly like English and literature and things of that nature, just wasn't into that at the time.  Social studies I liked a little bit, government.  Was involved in a number of different activities but as a, as a young boy watching the football games every week, the one thing I wanted to do was play football at Pershing High School [John J. Pershing High School, Detroit, Michigan] so I, I did go out for the team.  I was on the JV [junior varsity] team the first year and then I was varsity.  (Cough) The--I think the last two years I was at Pershing and--
Speaker 1: What did you play?
Speaker 2: I played half back and defensive back and we had a, a good team of athletes and actually won the public school championship in '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: Now what was the mascot of the Pershing High School?
Speaker 2: The Doughboys [Pershing Doughboys]--
Speaker 1: The Doughboys. That's right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) the General John J. Pershing.  So you know that khaki fatigue with that round rim hat with the--looks like you got a little cootie catcher up there on top of the hat.
Speaker 1: That was Smokey the Bear.
Speaker 2: Yeah exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--were you aware that Pershing commanded I think the 25th or the 26th [sic. 25th Infantry Regiment] black infantry at one point and his nickname was Blackjack.
Speaker 2: Yep.  Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well actually we call our football coach whose--who was Middle Eastern, his name was Mike Haddon [ph.], we call him Black Mike.  I think that was derivative from stories about General Pershing and so there was some sense of that clearly but you know it was it was a great time.  It was in that shadow of the, of the Civil Rights Movement, it was after Brown versus Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] in '56 [1956]--in '54 [1954] it was before the Civil Rights Act of '64 [Civil Rights Act of 1964] but you know you could tell there was a change and definitely in our generation the way that we related to one another it was, was changing not really knowing other than by stories were told by older people and our parents and aunts and uncles what it used to be like.  We got along exceedingly well in high school in an integrated environment and--
Speaker 1: What was the racial mix at Pershing?
Speaker 2: I would say and I don't know for certain, but I would say, I was at Pershing from '59 [1959] to '62 [1962] and I would say the racial mix at that point in time was let's say probably a third to 45 percent African American and the balance white.
Story_ID: 418666
Speaker 1: And what probably really didn't understand was is that whole community was in the process of changing 'cause it was towards the late '60s [1960s] particularly after '67 [1967] when there was insurrection in Detroit [Michigan] that it was not difficult for African Americans to buy homes north of 7 Mile [7 Mile Road] 'cause people started--white flight began.  But during the years that we grew up, we socialize in school, out of school, each other's houses and so forth you know without regard to to race.
Speaker 2: Now did your family kind of keep up and discuss the Civil Rights Movement as it unfolded on television or radio?
Speaker 1: We were aware of it but you know was not a constant kind of focus.  And I think perhaps in part because of the backgrounds of my two parents [Dorothy Baker Lewis and Walton Adams Lewis] who maybe saw this more as a norm and and you know did not have the experiences of growing up in segregated communities where you know the changes that were brought by the civil rights community could first were very deeply felt as something that needed to happen and then second of all were you know uncertain when actually for some it actually did take place.  There was a much more deep feeling about importance of what had, had occurred in terms of integration and beating back the barriers.
Speaker 2: Now I don't know when it occurred but I think Detroit got its first black city council in person in form of Erma Henderson sometime, was that before you came out of high school [John J. Pershing High School, Detroit, Michigan] or afterwards?
Speaker 1: Erma I think was after I came out of high school but the first black councilmen I think was a telephone executive by the name of Bill Patrick [William Patrick] and you know he, he did well.  I think this was probably sometimes during, sometime during the '60s [1960s] that he became (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was after you as well?
Speaker 1: --yeah, I came out of high school in '62 [1962] and then went on to college at Oakland University [Michigan State University-Oakland; Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan], '62 [1962].
Speaker 2: Okay.  While you were in high school, city council [Detroit Common Council; Detroit City Council] was all white, the mayor was white.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Pretty, yeah I think pretty much.  Maybe, maybe Patrick was on the council the late '50s [1950s], I'd have to go back and check that (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 418667
Speaker 1: Now was your father [Walton Adams Lewis] involved as a businessmen who knew a lot of the major black businessmen in the communities?
Speaker 2: Right, he did.
Speaker 1: Was he involved in Urban League or NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Every, everything.  Booker T. Washington Business Association [Detroit, Michigan], of which he was president for a couple of years.  NAACP, his--you know the black business community was really quite an inspiration back in those days and they were serving the needs of the community and from my perspective you know it wasn't necessarily because the needs of the black community were not being served by the white business establishments and there was outright segregation.  For instance downtown restaurants wouldn't serve blacks during those years.  This was even after Brown versus Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].
Speaker 1: Now did you know that when you were in high school [John J. Pershing High School, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: I did.  I did know that because often when sometimes I work with my dad in the summertime and he'd say, "Okay let's go to lunch on a Friday," or something for a nice lunch and he would, he would drive over to Windsor [Canada] to the Prince Edward Hotel [Windsor, Canada] where we could go into the main dining room and have a you know a wonderful lunch rather than trying one of the hotels downtown because of the fear of being rejected because they're not serving you know blacks.  So yeah I had the consciousness about that and that was made me very aware.
Story_ID: 418668
Speaker 1: And when I was probably twelve or thirteen somewhere around in there, we went to Florida to visit my dad's [Walton Adams Lewis] only living relative at the time, which was his aunt Minnie [Minnie Lee Corbo (ph.)] who ran an elementary school, segregated elementary school in Clearwater, Florida, and I remember it must--it might have been maybe a little older than twelve or thirteen.  I remember that I saw, I saw the signs white only, restrooms, drinking fountains, and beaches and things of that nature when I took that trip and that made a real impression on me.  I thought--I had sort of a superior view of what was going on in the North as opposed to what was going on in the South because of that without really focusing on the fact that you know the, the signs weren't necessarily up but there was still some lines of demarcation in the North you know as, as well, but didn't have any real experiences other than I went to a Polish barbershop one day to get a haircut 'cause my mom [Dorothy Baker Lewis] I was an adolescent at the time, said you go get a haircut and the quickest, fastest place to go was a Polish barbershop and I'd never been in there for a haircut before but I went there and the guy when I walked in the door I sat down, the guy said, "What do you want?" I said, "A haircut."  He said, "No, no, no."  You know that, that really was my first encounter with racism.
Speaker 2: How did you feel about that?
Speaker 1: I was, I was crestfallen because I wanted to get the damn haircut and get back to riding my bike.  I couldn't quite you know couldn't quite, quite figure it out because you know I didn't automatically think you know he wanted me there--he didn't want me there because I was black, I thought you know maybe as a kid I had some race consciousness but I was just interested in getting that that haircut and getting back to what I was doing before my mom told me to go get it.
Speaker 2: So this is kind of confusing in terms of some things anyway, but most of them really didn't affect you that much you're saying?
Speaker 1: That's right.  You know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But it was confusing in terms of what you could do and couldn't do?
Speaker 1: Right. Yeah, you know I told my parents about it.  They wouldn't necessarily become outraged or anything about it.  You know I can't remember that they'd made a big deal out of it or lead me to expect that I have a lot of experiences like that going forward just, just sort of eluded me the impressions of racism that were very rampant you know around the country at the time, but--.
Story_ID: 418669
Speaker 1: Did you participate in Junior Achievement [Junior Achievement USA] in high school [John J. Pershing High School, Detroit, Michigan] or did you have a job or anything?
Speaker 2: I had a newspaper route.  So I--on a weekly newspaper route the Michigan Chronicle.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's a black paper?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  I may have been in Junior Achievement for six months or a year.  I was in the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America], things of that nature.  You know a lot of the kind of things kids would do at that age; I was involved in a lot of them.
Speaker 1: Now did you or was music or television a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah to some degree.  I remember we got the first television when we lived over with the Edwards [ph.].  It was a little small screen but I remember the day my parents [Dorothy Baker Lewis and Walton Adams Lewis] brought it home, it's a magical device which get this picture on this rectangular box.  The--but I didn't watch a lot of television although I did watch you know whatever, yeah after school primarily as one of my activities, particularly in the wintertime and then often I, I was really into hockey.  Not as a player, but as a sort of a spectator because it was on TV and, and because of the Canadian station, Channel 9 [CKLW-TV; CBET-TV], across in Windsor [Canada], they would broadcast all of the Toronto Argonauts, not Argonauts but Toronto Maple Leafs or Montreal Canadian games on the weekends.  So when there wasn't anything else to do, watching hockey game on TV was a great thing to do particularly if the Red Wings [Detroit Red Wings] were playing.  And, and I don't think the American stations really broadcast that much of the Red Wings' games.  Canadian stations really follow the Toronto Maple Leafs so you know they were always on but the best times were when Toronto and Detroit were playing.
Speaker 1: Detroit had a big star then I can't think (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Gordie Howe.
Speaker 1: Gordie Howe, yep.
Speaker 2: And, and actually Detroit won the Stanley Cup a couple of times in the '50s [1950s] and so I was watching them go through the playoffs and everything right there in front of the TV.
Story_ID: 418670
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: (Cough) Church was a big part 'cause my dad [Walton Adams Lewis] having been raised really in the, in the church with his stepfather [Peyton M. Lewis] being a minister, he and my mother [Dorothy Baker Lewis] were very active in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church in Detroit [Michigan].  And they were wed in Detroit by Reverend William Peck [William H. Peck] at Bethel [Bethel A.M.E. Church, Detroit, Michigan] which second oldest black congregation in the state and it's a thriving church.  And so we went to church every Sunday and I was involved with the youth group at the, at the church.  Didn't necessarily sing in the choir or anything like that but was involved in church activities during the worship hours on Sunday and then on the weekends, during the week when there were activities for young people in the church, often I was involved with those sorts of things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 418671
Speaker 1: Now did you get a chance to participate in very many activities at high school at Pershing [John J. Pershing High School, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I was on their football team for several years and that was my main activity.  I was on the yearbook staff my senior year.  I was involved with student government for a year.  Not too many things, but you know some representation.
Speaker 1: That sounds like I mean yearbook staff, did you write or?
Speaker 2: Yeah actually I was more the, the photo layout and of the yearbook as opposed to the, the written part.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 418672
Speaker 1: So did you have a favorite teacher or mentor in high school [John J. Pershing High School, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: In high school, no.  I, I had a a elementary school teacher with whom I was in love.  Her name was Vera Mufflip [ph.] at Courville [Courville Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan].  And I was in her home room.  And I had a crush on her.  She was great teacher, very patient, very kind, always with a warm smile.  She was a very attractive younger teacher.  Who had a family of her, a family of her own but you know I just really enjoyed being in her class.  And Mrs. Eubanks [ph.] was another teacher, this was in elementary as well, and then for music there was a woman by the name of Mrs. Tobin [ph.] who was German descent I believe but she just got great joy out of bringing students together make music of all sorts.  So that was, that was fun.  I took piano lessons for a while.  I wish I had stayed with it but I, I actually just gave it up.  My parents [Dorothy Baker Lewis and Walton Adams Lewis] bought a piano, tried to make me practice but you know I was more interested in going out and hitting the ball around and playing basketball or riding my bike, all kinds of outdoor activities.
Story_ID: 418673
Speaker 1: Well what happened at prom time, did you--were you able to go to the prom with everybody and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --okay.
Speaker 2: Yep, yep I went to the prom.  I actually invited to the prom a young woman who was a daughter of my mother's [Dorothy Baker Lewis] hairdresser and I had a, had a great prom.  But I, you know I wasn't really that much into the social thing in high school [John J. Pershing High School, Detroit, Michigan] I was more into the athletics and the football team and hanging out with the guys.
Story_ID: 418674
Speaker 1: How did you manage to choose Oakland [Michigan State University-Oakland; Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Well actually I didn't (laughter).  My parents [Dorothy Baker Lewis and Walton Adams Lewis] sort of chose Oakland for me.  I, I really--I had for the same attraction I had with regard to playing football at Pershing [John J. Pershing High School, Detroit, Michigan], I had a sort of a magnetic draw to Michigan football and so I wanted to try out for Michigan football having been on a city championship team in Detroit [Michigan] playing first string on the defense and so my dream was to go to Michigan and play for the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Now did you think you had a pretty good chance then of doing that?
Speaker 2: I felt confident that I, that I could do if I got the chance.  I really was not focused on what going to Michigan meant in terms of academic preparation and I know Pershing was a good high school.  I had not again been a good student particularly in high school not that I had failing grades or anything, but every now and then I get a D in something.  And I graduated probably with a two-five [2.5 GPA] or something like that.  I wasn't burning up the academic track by any means.  But any event my parents took me one night to college night and my dad became quite enthusiastic about this new university that was being created in Rochester, Michigan, called Oakland University and my mother thought that going to the University of Michigan was gonna result in me being lost on the campus, just too big she thought.  So as a result of that you know I actually almost didn't even care where I went to school.  But I knew that I had to go to college and so I went to Oakland and turned out to be probably one of the best things that ever happened to me.

Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, can you give us your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My full name is [HistoryMaker] David Baker Lewis, D-A-V-I-D, B-A-K-E-R, L-E-W-I-S.
Speaker 1: And sir, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: I'm an attorney at law with the firm of Lewis and Munday [Lewis and Munday, PC] in Detroit, Michigan, and I am, I'm graduated to being a senior shareholder in the firm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is the 26th of October, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in the video conference room of the law firm of Lewis and Munday which is located on the twenty-fourth floor of the First National Building, 660 Woodward Avenue, in the City of Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay, now we are finishing an interview we started back in 2007, correct?
Speaker 2: Yeah, what, what month do you recall what month that was?
Speaker 1: Let's see here, yeah March the 9th (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep.
Speaker 1: Two thousand and seven [2007].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 418676
Speaker 1: Okay, so we left off with you going to Oakland University [Michigan State University-Oakland; Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan] which is a place that I recall you had not initially wanted to attend but you were, after you attended you were glad you did.
Speaker 2: Right.  I originally aspired to go to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]. I was involved in athletics in high school [John J. Pershing High School, Detroit, Michigan], football in particular, and had a dream of playing for the Michigan Wolverines.  My mother [Dorothy Baker Lewis] thought that going to Ann Arbor [Michigan] was not gonna work out for me because it was such a big campus and she discouraged me from seeking go to University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and after hearing her views on the subject, I really didn't care that much where I went.  Didn't have a sort of second choice and it just by happenstance my dad [Walton Adams Lewis] learned of a counselor from Oakland University is coming to my high school, sort of like a college night thing and he, he wanted me to consider Oakland University.  So we went to that function at my high school, subsequently visited the campus which was a very small campus at the time.  But I like the the overall idea of Oakland which at the early stages now mind you this is in the early '60s [1960s].  Oakland had been founded the late '50s [1950s] and it just begun as a a branch of Michigan State University [Michigan State University of Agriculture and Applied Science; Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].  But its calling card was faculty that was a very young and well educated.  Ninety percent of them having Ph.D.'s, at a brand new school, a new vision, a new venture and higher education and they were recruiting students who would sort of fit into this new voyage into higher education and so ultimately I became excited about the prospect and applied and was accepted, enrolled and enjoyed what turned out to be a three year college experience at, at Oakland University and I, I grew there as an individual probably in a way that I might not have grown in other environments because it was a small school at the time, maybe under two, three thousand students, small entering class, small residential campus.  It was primarily a commuter college and had some very talented faculty and the administrators and I sort of fit in there you know nicely, got to know folks and did well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay this is nine--I'm sorry, this is 1962?
Speaker 2: Sixty-two [1962], fall of '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: --you started?
Story_ID: 418677
Speaker 1: Who were some of the professors and personalities on campus that influenced you and helped you to grow and develop?
Speaker 2: Well there were several.  So I, I was interested in business and so wound up eventually focusing on economics at the Oakland University [Michigan State University-Oakland; Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan] 'cause they had a business administration program but it was really an economics program so there were several professors there in economics department, Robin Hough was one of those professors who was a good teacher, good professor, learned a lot from, from him.  There was a philosophy professor Alfred Lessing who sort of exposed me to the classics in Western civilization and some of the thought leaders going way, way back Hegel [Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel] and Kant [Immanuel Kant] and a variety of thinkers that we studied in philosophy.  There's a very good friend of mine who at the time before our friendship really ripened by the name of Wally Collins [Walter S. Collins] who was in the music department and developed a great relationship with him.  Eventually babysat his kids and he was just one of the wonderful guys I met there.  Woody Varner [Durward B. Varner] who is the chancellor there was full of personality, had been assigned by John Hannah [John A. Hannah] who was then president of Michigan State University [Michigan State University of Agriculture and Applied Science; Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] to oversee the development of what was then Michigan State University-Oakland and which became Oakland University.  Donald O'Dowd was another professor administrator.  Fred Obear [Frederick W. Obear] who was in chemistry department.  He and his wife Trish [Trisha Obear] were house mom and dad at Fitzgerald House where I lived my first couple of years on campus.  Karl Gregory who was on the faculty a little later I think Karl came a little later, not initially.  But just a good group of folks who was easy to develop relationships with and were not so overburdened with hundreds of students to deal with and at a university with a lot of tradition and a lot of other things to do who could spend time with students.
Story_ID: 418678
Speaker 1: I have a note here that you spent the summer of 1964 in Zurich, Switzerland?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This part of your studies at Oakland [Michigan State University-Oakland; Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Actually no although I did take German in preparation for this trip but the '64 [1964] summer that I spent in Europe was a result of my dad [Walton Adams Lewis] taking a--thought that I had about working myself over on a freighter and spending the summer there sort of as a vagabond around Europe and actually he found a job for me through one of his friends who was an executive at a company in the U.S. that had a parent company in Switzerland and the long and short of it, it was a great, great experience for me.  Put my identity as an American and an African American in a larger context that I had really known and I spent the summer in Zurich, lived with a Swiss family and had a chance to travel around Europe and just enrich my, my understanding of history and I worked for a company there it was called Holderbank [Holcim Ltd].  It was headquarters just outside of Zurich and I worked in helping since I was a business administration student, two Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] M.B.A. students who were there for the summer and I was sort of their assistant and they were presenting certain projects to the management of the Holderbank company whose CEO was a Harvard grad, Harvard Business School grad so any event make a long story short, it was quite an eye opening experience.  To me very well received by the Swiss.  Particularly didn't see people of color and sort of treated as a special guest there because of that and then just sort of the history of Europe in relationship to the history of the U.S. so in terms of my world view just put things better perspective something I could see and feel and touch there so that was a great, a great summer.
Story_ID: 418679
Speaker 1: You were able to graduate from Oakland [Michigan State University-Oakland; Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan] in three years.  Did you just you know do a lot of summer classes or is that?
Speaker 2: Oakland was on the trimester system and so I--that was--and '64 [1964] was the one summer I was not in school but I went through the college curriculum at Oakland University in three years and I started in September of '62 [1962], graduated in June of sixty--'65 [1965].  I probably should just take a moment, Larry [Larry Crowe] and Matthew [Matthew Hickey], and say I really do appreciate all the work that you and your colleagues do and The HistoryMakers because capturing the stories of African Americans who have been involved in one dimension or another in this evolution that we're all a part of, a small part of, is such an important thing to do and create this record that can be available to those who are interested and future generations.  I am really very much honored to be included in the group that you are are doing these interviews about.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  You're very kind to mention it.  But now so we have in 1965 you graduate, but before we graduate you, I just want to ask you about college activities.  Now were you a member of a fraternity or anything in college?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't.  One of the things about Oakland University, it was brand new but also had a policy which I think it's still in place that it would not support or promote fraternities or sororities, nor would it be involved in intercollegiate athletics.  You know so it was supposed to be a really sort of the egghead place and since then intercollegiate athletics have come to Oakland so they're big in swimming and basketball and a lot of the college sports, but not football.  So most of my activities, I was involved in a lot of things since I lived on campus, it was a small on campus group but I was in this basketball sports club.  They had the intermural building and athletic facilities, you could swim, student government, a variety of different things.  My last year there I applied for and was selected to be the head resident during the summer semester for one of the dorms [Fitzgerald House], actually the dorm I was, I was housed in when I started at Oakland University.  So I was pretty involved in the life of the campus.  It was a small campus and actually it's that sort of interaction that really helped me to develop I think a great deal and sort of built my confidence and my own skills and that was one of the aspects that made Oakland you know a good fit for me.
Story_ID: 418680
Speaker 1: So you were a business administration major so when you graduated in '65 [1965] did you already have a you know a plan for what you were gonna do next?
Speaker 2: I had a general plan.  And the general plan was modified one day when a recruiter from the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business [University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois], Mitchell Watkins [Mitchell Sylvester Watkins], came to Oakland [Michigan State University-Oakland; Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan] and he convinced me that since I was interested in business but I also wanted to go to law school, that I should apply to the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business and go there first and then do my law degree thereafter and University of Chicago in 1965 was embarked upon what would traditionally be referred to as affirmative action program to recruit primarily African American students to enroll at the university and the graduate school as part of the social responsibility of the school but you know using still a strong admissions requirements and so I applied to the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.  I also applied to the University of Michigan Law School [Ann Arbor, Michigan] which had been another dream of mine because my [maternal] grandfather [Oscar W. Baker] was a graduate of the University of Michigan Law School and I was accepted at the University of Chicago but I was not accepted at the University of Michigan Law School so I decided to go to the University of Chicago and get, get my M.B.A. which I did then I did my law school thereafter.
Story_ID: 418681
Speaker 1: The date they give here is 1966 but it may have been '65 [1965] I don't know but before you left Oakland [Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan] I guess well Oakland recognized you as what the Alfred G. Wilson Award, right--
Speaker 2: Right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) when you graduated?
Speaker 2: That's right.  I graduated in '65 [1965].  I think the Wilson Award which is a retrospective award took place in 1966--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and there's the Alfred G. Wilson Award and then the Matilda D. Wilson Award [sic. Matilda R. Wilson Award] for the outstanding male and female student in the graduating class and I was selected to be honored with that award I think in large part through the efforts of Wally Collins [Walter S. Collins], a friend from the music department with whom I developed a great friendship.  So I'm very proud to have been so selected but at the time I was in business school at the University of Chicago [University of Chicago Graduate School of Business; University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois] and actually the first, the first year in Chicago [Illinois] I lived in International House, it's a two year program.  The second year I had an apartment with two other business school students in the South Shore area of Chicago but that too turned out to be a good experience for me.
Story_ID: 418682
Speaker 1: Yeah 1966 now you were--in the summer of '66 [1966] you were a trainee in the administrative department of the Northern Trust company [Northern Trust Corporation, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: It's the Gray Lady of LaSalle Street right?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Absolutely.  Still the Gray Lady of LaSalle Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is--someone told me on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] once he had an account with Northern Trust because Negroes normally didn't have an account so when he pulled his checks out the people say Northern Trust?
Speaker 2: Right.  You obviously know a little bit about Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  So this is impressive stuff for those days.  So, so well tell us about that being a summer trainee at Northern Trust.  Were there any other black students involved?
Speaker 2: There were other black students involved (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) As trainees?
Speaker 2: --at the University of Chicago [University of Chicago Graduate School of Business; University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois] but not at Northern Trust--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to my recollection.  But part of the program that the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business which is actually now known as the Booth School, promoted was summer internships.  So not only would there be admission to the school, but they virtually assured that there will be a summer employment opportunity between the first and second year and I was a major in finance or concentration in finance so the banking world really fascinated me.  My interest in finance really grew out of the fact that my dad [Walton Adams Lewis] was a general insurance agent and was a insurance broker for a number of insurance companies who were selling their policies in the Detroit [Michigan] area and my original interest in finance really grew out of knowing about my dad's general insurance agency [W.A. Lewis Insurance Agency; Lewis and Thompson Agency, Inc., Detroit, Michigan] but in any event the Northern Trust also had a senior officer if not the president of the bank at the time was University of Chicago Graduate School of Business alum and so they committed to the program and I was the summer trainee and it was a great experience for me.  Did a number of different projects for the the admin- essentially the administrative side of the bank, had various reports to file with federal regulators, had various information needs, assembling information, presenting it, just to take a measure of the bank's performance in any particular point in time, where there was clerk work to do.  You know that's the kind of work that I did.  But made some good friendships there and enjoyed it and actually had an offer to return to Northern Trust as a management trainee the year I graduated from business school but I was headed in another direction by that point.
Story_ID: 418683
Speaker 1: Now what was that direction after you received your M.B.A. in '66 [1966]--well let me just, I've gotta ask you some questions about that, too.  Who were some of the I guess mentors or were there any teachers like that as you pursued your M.B.A. at University of Chicago [University of Chicago Graduate School of Business; University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah not in the same way as Oakland University [Michigan State University-Oakland; Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan] because the business school faculty were very much involved in research and they had a graduate program, a masters in business but also they had Ph.D. program and you know they were very involved and, and sort of integrated with the economics department at the University of Chicago where George Stigler [George J. Stigler] and Milton Friedman were the leading professors.  But in the, in the business school, I had several professors that I really did enjoy.  One was accounting professor whose name escapes me right at the moment.  I'll think of it.  But the, you know, the relationships were, were different.  The level of competition was much different too because there were a lot of students who were in the Booth School at the time who were graduates of, of the, the finest universities around the country.  Oakland University was just sort of beginning as a seedling if you will without a lot of tradition, a lot of history and actually with a different student body than you'd find at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] or Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] or University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] undergrad, but in any event that was an environment in which I adapted to and I enjoyed, enjoyed my time in Chicago [Illinois] sort of away from Detroit [Michigan] my natural environment and sort of living away from home, although I lived on the campus at Oakland University it was still pretty close to Detroit.  But the--I was president of the business club there my senior year, my second year at the University of Chicago and still had this desire to go to law school after graduating and so I decided that I would never be happy unless I tried law school as a career path and applied a second time to University of Michigan Law School [Ann Arbor, Michigan], was accepted.  Applied also to the University of Chicago Law School [Chicago, Illinois] and was on the waiting list when I, when I got the acceptance from the University of Michigan Law School and that very sort of random set of events wound up bringing me back to Detroit from Chicago which I liked a great deal as a city and urban environment.
Story_ID: 418684
Speaker 1: Now when you were living in Chicago [Illinois] in those days in South Shore. I'm thinking Muhammad Ali lived there at some point, eventually--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --other black celebrities actually lived in South Shore--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in those days.  Those were days before they moved all the celebrities to the North Shore [Chicago, Illinois] you know, a lot of them (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.  Yeah.  It was a very lovely community.  We had a, a flat at 74th [Street] and Chappel [Avenue] and I think it was either two or three family I forget exactly which, but it was very spacious, very easy to get to from there to, to the business school [University of Chicago Graduate School of Business; University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois] and you know an enjoyable living environment.  And so we studied hard during the week, going to class and in the evening and study Saturday morning and go out and enjoy City of Chicago [Illinois] on Saturday night and Sunday and made some great friends including a lady who worked in the cafeteria there Mrs. White [ph.] and my best friend from business school Jim Hill [HistoryMaker James Hill, Jr.] and I got to know Mrs. White and her family very well and we developed a sort of lifelong friendship.  But Jim and I when we were first year students lived at International House, that's where we first met, which is right on the Midway [Midway Plaisance, Chicago, Illinois] there.  The campus of the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and Billings Hospital [Albert Merritt Billings Hospital, Chicago, Illinois] was not far away from International House and we used to go there.  It was close to the business school and the rest of the campus.  We'd go there for, for dinner typically and that's where we met Mrs. White and she became sort of our, our mother away from home and the relationship with Mrs. White and her family developed from there.  So it was a really enjoyable experience.
Story_ID: 418685
Speaker 1: So, yeah, we were just talking about Jim Hill [HistoryMaker James Hill, Jr.] who was a HistoryMaker we interviewed I think back in 2002 [sic. 2003].
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: In Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yep.  Very, very good friend.
Speaker 1: So in '68 [1968] was it '68 [1968] that you enrolled in the University of Michigan Law School [Ann Arbor, Michigan] or before?
Speaker 2: It was year before it was in September of '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: Sixty-seven [1967].
Speaker 2: So I came out of Oakland University [Rochester, Michigan] in June of '65 [1965]. I worked at the Northern Trust [Northern Trust Corporation, Chicago, Illinois] that summer.  September of '65 [1965], I started the University Chicago Graduate School of Business [University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois] and the following summer in '66 [1966] I worked at the Northern Trust.  Then my second year began that fall and I graduated from the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business in June of '67 [1967] and then the events I just described lead me to come back to Michigan for law school in September of 1967.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: All right, September of '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay so who were some of the people that you know you looked to for guidance at University of Michigan Law School, who were some of the professors and some of your fellow students?
Speaker 2: Yeah so they're primarily upperclassmen who were African American.  There were no African American professors or assistant professors at the University of Michigan Law School in September of '67 [1967].  So there's a guy by the name of Squire Padgett who was a senior law student.  There's Jack [ph.], what's Jack's last name; can't recall Jack's last name.  There were a couple of upperclassmen who were African American and then there were several colleagues in my class who were just a handful of us and we sort of pulled ourselves through.  There were a number of excellent professors at the Michigan Law School but none of them were sort of African American and served as sort of mentors and that's, that's what sort of made the early years more challenging for African American students 'cause there was sort of no natural sort of support mechanism; not that there was a degree of outright hostility.  There was really none of that.  The professors and the administration accepted all the students but you know it would not be the kind of environment you'd encounter for instance as an African American if you went to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] or Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] or Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Story_ID: 418686
Speaker 1: Now were you able to make contact with any of the members of the National Bar Association, the black lawyers in Chicago [Illinois] of which there are many? I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  No--
Speaker 1: What they call the Cook County Bar Association?
Speaker 2: --Cook County Bar Association.  There was one black graduate of the GSB [University of Chicago Graduate School of Business; University of Chicago, Booth School of Business] in Chicago [Illinois] who had gone on to law school who I met at the time but there wasn't really no connection.  And I didn't--my focus at the time was really on business and not on law so really didn't seek out any members of the Cook County Bar or any other bar.  Just pretty much focused on, on business school and it's a lot of work, a lot of study involved and you know I was involved in some of the extracurricular activities.  As a matter of fact I was on the flag football team at the University of Chicago business school and one of the opposing schools was the school of divinity [Chicago Theological Seminary, Chicago, Illinois] and their star quarterback was a young North Carolina A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] grad who had enrolled there for divinity school by the name of Jesse Louis Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] and his star--he played quarterback.  His star receiver was a young guy who I'm not certain where he went to college, but he's known around Detroit [Michigan] now as Reverend Jim Holley [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Jim Holley, Jr.] and so if there was a chance meeting on the midway or we're playing intermural football it's helped to sort of enrich the environment because right about that time, Reverend Jackson was beginning Operation Breadbasket [Rainbow PUSH Coalition] in Chicago which served as originally a community service program that shined the light on his leadership at that point.
Story_ID: 418687
Speaker 1: After you got your degree then, you were at University of Michigan Law School [Ann Arbor, Michigan] when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right. A whole series of events during the Civil Rights Movement that sort of followed me, not followed me but viewed from you know Oakland University [Michigan State University-Oakland; Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan] or University of Chicago [University of Chicago Graduate School of Business; University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois] or University of Michigan.
Speaker 1: Now at University of Michigan, I guess when you arrived in '67 [1967].  Now '67 [1967] was the year of the big riot in Detroit [Michigan], I believe right?
Speaker 2: It was that August.  Actually I was in New York [New York] in August of '67 [1967] where I'd gone to take a summer job at Morgan's--JP Morgan, Morgan Guaranty Trust Company [Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York; JPMorgan Chase and Co.] so I followed my '66 [1966] experience with Northern Trust [Northern Trust Corporation, Chicago, Illinois] with summer internship at Morgan Guaranty Trust Company and they had come to the campus to interview and select some summer intern students and potential, and potential management trainee graduates of the business school.  So I was in New York, I made a commitment to go there for the summer and decide whether I wanted to continue on into the management trainee program or whether I'd go to law school and I decided to go to law school and, and not pursue a management trainee program at Northern--at Morgan Guaranty.  I was there in the summer when there was quite a bit of civil disturbance around the country in that hot summer including the insurrection in Detroit.
Speaker 1: Were any of your relatives affected by it?
Speaker 2: Not, not directly but my dad's [Walton Adams Lewis] general insurance agency [W.A. Lewis Insurance Agency; Lewis and Thompson Agency, Inc., Detroit, Michigan] was a block away from the devastation of 12th Street where a lot of businesses were burned to the ground and it was a lot of, a lot of injuries and some deaths in the whole, calling out of the National Guard for that whole hot summer so it was, it was definitely made an impression and sort of a world changing event.
Story_ID: 418688
Speaker 1: At the University of Michigan [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan], I have a note here that in 1965 only two years before you enrolled in the law school, there was only one black law student in the whole University of Michigan law department?
Speaker 2: I think that's right.  Either that is absolutely correct or it's not absolutely correct, it's close to absolute correctness because it would have been just a, just a few.
Speaker 1: So what were there more I mean the black students when you enrolled?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were there substantially more?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I would say ten to twelve African American students enrolled in the fall of '67 [1967], 1967 and, and again I think it was more about an affirmative action consciousness that many of the universities and colleges around the country who rightfully felt that they had not stepped up to their educational responsibilities to be diverse and in light of the Civil Rights Movement you know from various quarters were being encouraged to open their doors to traditionally excluded constituencies.
Story_ID: 418689
Speaker 1: So in '68 [1968] you were a summer employee with Lewis and Thompson Insurance Agency [W.A. Lewis Insurance Agency; Lewis and Thompson Agency, Inc., Detroit, Michigan], right?
Speaker 2: That was my dad's [Walton Adams Lewis] general insurance agency.  Yep so I worked, worked with him and agency which is still in the same place over on Grand Boulevard in the City of Detroit [Michigan] where my brother [Robert Lewis] runs the agency now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is that West Grand or East Grand?
Speaker 2: West Grand.
Speaker 1: West Grand okay.
Story_ID: 418690
Speaker 1: Now in '68 [1968] Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated.  So you were in law school then.  How did University of Michigan [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan] commemorate the assassination or did you learn anything about your fellow students that you didn't know before?
Speaker 2: Well there was a memorial, it was a memorial service.  There, there was a great deal of discussion not only about Dr. King's death but other events in the Civil Rights Movement or events that took place in the context of the Civil Rights Movement because it was constantly in the news and sort of constantly sort of tested this question of what we as law students what other students and other schools and colleges at the university were doing to connect to and serve our communities.  And one of the favorite phrases back then is you may recall, "If you're part of the problem, you're not part of the solution."  Many of us wanted to be part of the solution as opposed to part of the problem.  So there were you know memorial services.  There were some colloquiums and other things organized around civil rights issues so the, the air was very thick with the contractions of racism and free society and particularly for law school students promise civil rights but yet widespread, pervasive civil rights depravations throughout the country and assassinations and things of this nature.  So it was a very tumultuous time and, and for me it was particularly revealing because it was sort of a time where my values and my aspirations were being tested in a way that they have not before where the consequences of racism and what you might call classism were in very stark relief at a very important time in history of the country and so it was about that time that I met my my wife [Kathleen McCree Lewis] and my first wife and we were you now very much engaged in the ethos of the, the, the late '70s [1970s] and the early--the late '60s [1960s] and the early '70s [1970s] when we were in school where H. Rap Brown [Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin], Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture], Huey P. Newton, the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] and all of this, this eruption of, of, of community that then suppressed and denied so many parts of the American dream again spilled over to various civil rights events.
Story_ID: 418691
Speaker 1: Well one of the figures on campus let me say first one of the figures I think who he was on campus then was Harold Cruse.  Do you remember Harold Cruse?
Speaker 2: Very much so yeah.
Speaker 1: Author of 'The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual' ['The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual: A Historical Analysis of the Failure of Black Leadership,' Harold Cruse] and all that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly, exactly.  Now, my wife [Kathleen McCree Lewis] was an undergraduate at Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] so she was on campus and I think took a course from Harold who was teaching there in the school of liberal arts if I'm not mistaken forgot exactly what school.  But she was a light for me on the intellectual aspects of the freedom movement and certainly Harold Cruse was one of the primary sources of thought leadership at, at that point in time.  Although I never took a course from him and never really had engaged--engagement with him in a intellectual context.  I was aware of who he was and respected his work (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah that book, that book was passed around the country and study groups sprang up around it.  The people were trying to hammer out just the kind of issues like, what do I do with my education to benefit black people or am I doing anything (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. Exactly.
Story_ID: 418692
Speaker 1: Meantime in '68 [1968] Carl Stokes was elected mayor of Cleveland [Ohio].  This is the first black mayor of a major U.S. city.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Well what did you think about that?
Speaker 2: You know I had great, great, great hope.  There were so many aspects of progress you know at the same time so many expressions of, of dissatisfaction and outright racism and brutality you know that whole spectrum of of joy and pain in the decade of the '60s [1960s] and into the '70s [1970s].  It can you know be depressed but by events one day and overjoyed by some accomplishments the next day.  But you know I, I was always one to be more optimistic than pessimistic so I viewed Carl Stokes' election as a sign that progress could be made and you know the bastion of racism in America for African Americans and others could be beat back and beat down so I was very enthused about the fact that he was the mayor and it also sort of interlocked with my law school education [at the University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan] in the sense that you know he was mayor, you're powerful decision maker can do things to improve the condition of the citizens wo live in that particular municipality.  So and you know he was pretty articulate and just had some specific ideas, pulled together a big coalition and this was the way I thought the, the country should, should be and I don't remember all the details of his service and certainly there were some controversial aspects but you know I was really very much heartened when he was elected.  I mean and you know some maybe subconscious way it got me thinking about that avenue being an avenue I might participate in, in terms of making my contributions and my career, living my life in the urban environment of Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: You know I think it caused a lot of black people I think to think about power you know in terms of political power, economic power--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and I think a lot of people knew that they were linked, that we never had like a mayor like I mean here's a mayor of this major city now for the first time and then shortly after that Kenneth Gibson [Kenneth A. Gibson] and Hatcher [HistoryMaker Richard Hatcher] and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --you know and then on down to Coleman Young--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and others.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So people were excited--
Story_ID: 418693
Speaker 1: Now did you ever, did you consider like you know what you know 'cause I think somebody who after finishing University of Chicago [University of Chicago Graduate School of Business; University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois] with an M.B.A. and you know working on a law degree [at University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan], you had to be thinking about how all these power issues work in detail and a lot of people don't you know miss.  You having the background that you had with your father being involved as a lawyer and a businessman you know so I think--
Speaker 2: Yep.  So you're asking me a question I think (laughter)?
Speaker 1: I'm setting the stage and I'm trying to think of actually a good question to ask but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but that's I know you were thinking about being relationships seriously--
Speaker 2: Right, right.  So the transformation event for me was while I was in law school, I was involved with the Black Law Students Association [National Black Law Students Association] and it was one of several black student groups among the colleges and universities--colleges and schools of the university and typically at that point in time this is the late '60s [1960s] the African American enrollment in the schools and colleges of the university was comparatively small and typically there were no black faculty, very few if any, black senior management in these schools and colleges.  So, so the, the list of issues that black students would be concerned about in their environment would be very similar and that ultimately led to a coalition of student groups including I think it was a black student union which was the undergraduate organization for black students at University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] focusing on low level of minority students at the university and a coalition emerged out of that which was called the Black Action Movement and the similarity of issues among the black students in the various colleges and schools of the university you know evolved through some great leadership from the black student union and some of the undergraduate students with now the graduate students who were involved in social work or law or med school whatever into a list of demands that were placed before the, the regents of the university.  The central one of which was increasing black student enrollment to 10 percent or more of overall enrollment along with black faculty and you know some other demands.  And that was transformative for me because I had to make a decision about where my head and heart was in relationship to the aspirations of my fellow African Americans and whether I was gonna sit on the sidelines and be a commentator or be actively involved.
Story_ID: 418694
Speaker 1: I should also say my, my wife was an undergraduate and this emerged eventually the fall of '69 [1969] and the spring of 1970 and I'd gotten married to Kathleen McCree [Kathleen McCree Lewis] in the, in the spring of 1969 and we had dated a year before that, maybe a year and half.  And so all of these events were going on while we were falling in love and I was headed toward my senior year in, in law school [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  But in any event it was also sort of a revealing through my law school experience of how the law had been used over the years to suppress African Americans in the overall society from slavery up you know through the '50s [1950s] with the Brown versus Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] and those were the more prominent suppressions of civil rights and education, things of that nature not to really delve into the cultural and social which were just as much a part of it.  So in any event, you know we were very much involved in this, in this effort to convince the university that the moral and right thing to do in light of this pervasive system of deprivation was to significantly enhance the number of minority students and particularly African Americans enrolled at the, the university and so eventually make a longer story short, the Black Action Movement made demands on the regents, engaged the university's administration, the the student body, white students, foreign students, other minorities besides African Americans were involved in creating a sort of groundswell support for some of these objectives and so eventually when the negotiations with the administration of the university broke down, we called a student strike and shut the university down for two days and I was very involved with that effort while I was a senior in law school and--
Speaker 2: Was this 1970 now?
Speaker 1: This was 1970, spring of 1970 that the very first Black Action Movement took place.  And so, so that, that was, that was sort of an awakening for me in a lot of respects intellectually, socially, spiritually and so that really sort of set the stage for what happened later which was I graduated from law school, took a job as a clerk with a federal district court judge [Theodore Levin] who is recommended by my father-in-law [Wade H. McCree] and who had been a federal district court judge.  Or he was.  Actually I guess he was he was on the court of appeals [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit] at the time.  And then I had worked one summer for a large law firm [Miller, Canfield, Paddock and Stone, PLC] in the City of Detroit [Michigan] and was the only African American summer associate and had an offer to return there but while I was clerking and trying to sort all this out, I decided I was not gonna go that route in the early '70s [1970s] and in particular in 1970 there, there was a great deal of fervor around minority business development, community empowerment, just all kinds of great stuff going on, a lot of political activity so I decided to join a small minority firm [Patmon, Young and Kirk, PC] in Detroit rather than go to the large majority firm that had offered me an opportunity.
Story_ID: 418695
Speaker 1: So I was just commenting such as Oakland University [Rochester, Michigan], right state that fervor that was going through the overall society you had on one hand probably some very tough discussions within those institutions about opening the doors for minorities and and reaching for diversity as we know it today at the time which brought up all kinds of red herring issues like lowering standards and all that kind of stuff that you know then there's a small group of minority students who are admitted and they start talking then they say you know y'all ain't done enough you know you need to do some more and and so you got this clash of need for rapid progress against maybe the doctrine in most instances of good intentions coming together and creating a conflict that little stuff for people to deal with.  But I decided to join the firm called Patmon Young and Kirk [Patmon, Young and Kirk, PC, Detroit, Michigan] which had been organized by three graduates of Wayne State University [Wayne State University Law School, Detroit, Michigan], several of whom had been while they're going through law school or before internal revenue agents and knew the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] very well and developed a law firm that was focused on the civil practice in particularly entertainment and corporate law and real estate and I forgot exactly how I came in contact with that firm initially but they expressed an interest in me and so after my clerkship I joined that firm as opposed to the firm of Miller, Canfield [Miller, Canfield, Paddock and Stone, PLC].
Story_ID: 418696
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you a little bit about your clerkship.  Now you clerked for Theodore Levin?
Speaker 2: Levin.
Speaker 1: Levin.  Okay all right.  Sometimes if you say Levin they say no it's Levin.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right, it's Levin (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Theodore Levin who's a U.S. District Court [U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan] judge--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --here in Michigan, in Detroit.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: What was that experience like?
Speaker 2: Well it was, it was great, a foundational experience for me.  My father-in-law Wade McCree [Wade H. McCree] had been appointed by Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] to the U.S. District Court, one of the first African Americans appointed to a U.S. District Court but not the first.  But Judge McCree had been very much mentored by Judge Levin you know who was maybe a decade his senior and they became very good friends.  And I think my father-in-law was friends with most of the judges on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan but I think in particularly close relationship with Judge Levin and I think without the intervention of my father-in-law who suggested to me that being a district court clerk would be a good experience right out of law school [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  I might not have gotten the job but being Judge Levin's law clerk was really a great experience.  He was, he was an extraordinarily intelligent man with a warm heart.  He was a pretty ferocious trial court judge so if you came in his court you had to be prepared and he had very exacting standards and I tried to meet the standards that he set but the thing that really was most enriching for me is that I had a chance to see a wide cross section of the legal community in the City of Detroit who had cases before Judge Levin you know do their thing.  And I had a chance to look their work over and comment on their work to the judge and that experience developed a set of confidences in me that I could as well as some of the best lawyers who were appearing before the judge and so it bolstered my confidence and my self-esteem in terms of what I might be able to do early on in the practice and in addition because being the law clerk to a judge is you know kin to, to being the chief of staff of the president in terms of everybody wants to know the chief of staff so they can get a word to the president.  It was a great opportunity to meet the lawyers who were practicing in the federal district court and whenever they wanted to file a pleading or they wanna move a motion date or things of that nature, I was typically the one to interact with them and so it was especially good for me because it put me on sort of the fast track to meet and to know on a first name basis a lot of the practitioners in the City of Detroit.  So it was, it was just an--it was an excellent experience and to this day when I talk to law students I say one of the best things you can do coming out of law school is to get a clerkship job and work for a federal judge and get to know the community and see the level of practice in that particular community and go from-- and, you know, go from there.
Story_ID: 418697
Speaker 1: So 1971 you joined Patmon Young and Kirk [Patmon, Young and Kirk, PC, Detroit, Michigan] now, is the Young in this Coleman Young?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: It's Hallison Young [Hallison H. Young].
Speaker 1: Hallison, okay.
Speaker 2: No relation as far as I know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how do you spell his name, Hallison?
Speaker 2: H-A-L-L-I-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think it's two Ls.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fred Patmon [Frederick A. Patmon], Hallison Young and Stanley Kirk [Stanley R. Kirk], K-I-R-K and actually they were talking to several other lawyers they had identified in the city about the same time who eventually joined the firm.  But one of their marquee clients was the songwriting team of Holland-Dozier-Holland and although I was not involved in any of the entertainment work the sort of notoriety of that representation plus at that point in time for medical professionals, doctors and dentists and others professional corporations were the form of enterprise of choice if you will.  There was a lot of work in that area and I worked primarily with Stan Kirk because I'd been in business school [University of Chicago Graduate School of Business; University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois] and had had a decent experience there.  Although Fred Patmon was quite a taskmaster and was the ruler of his own domain and within a year and fourteen months of my arrival there I came to the realization that I would not be reaching my full potential had I stayed there so I decided to leave.  But in the process I met two other lawyers there who were about my age who were interested in starting a law firm and so in 1972 we started our own firm [Lewis, White, and Clay, PC; Lewis and Munday, PC].
Speaker 1: Who were the other two?
Speaker 2: Richard White [Richard T. White] and Lewis Lee [ph.] and shortly thereafter Eric Clay [Eric Lee Clay] who had come to Detroit [Michigan] to clerk for Judge Damon Keith [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith] joined the firm and Ray Graves [ph.] who was an acquaintance who'd grown up here in Detroit.  Actually knew my wife [Kathleen McCree Lewis] from high school.  And actually his dad and my dad [Walton Adams Lewis] were golfing buddies and he joined the firm as well.  So we had quite a little talented group there at the time so it was November of '72 [1972] that we got started (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--okay.
Speaker 2: That was forty years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 418698
Speaker 1: So I just wanted to go back a minute to Judge Keith [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith] to see if you have any reflections on the services of Judge Keith since he's such an--he's an important figure in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 2: Right, right.  I can remember while I was clerking for Judge Levin [Theodore Levin], Judge Keith issued one of his famous decisions in the Sinclair [United States v. Sinclair, 1971] case which is a civil rights case that involved a prosecution of radical community organizer.  I can remember walking down to Judge Keith's chambers after I heard about or seen the opinion and I said that's a way to ring that liberty bell Judge Keith and he got a big kick out of that.  But obviously Judge Keith has been a exemplar of the you know the finest of contributions that a jurist can make to the community. I certainly respect his effort to identify and develop some great talent among the law clerks who work for him, Eric Clay [Eric Lee Clay] was one of them, Jimmy Greiner [D. James Greiner] is a professor at Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  There's another, there're, there're numerous lawyers here in the community who clerk for Judge Keith and have gone on to you know make their contributions to our community or others over the years and of course the judge himself has been at the, at the forefront and then the vanguard of civil rights practitioners a--from the you know from the, from the bench and bringing the [U.S.] Constitution to a level where it can be said that there is equal justice under law and he's taken some very courageous steps along the way.  I can think of the Hamtramck housing decision [Garrett v. City of Hamtramck, 1971], I think it was Hamtramck [Michigan] where he found that there'd been a concerted effort to move African Americans out a particular community for desegregated--desegregating housing in the area to just a numerous decisions including the one involving President Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] and so he has been sort of the beacon in our community for aspirations of civil rights enforcement and civil right vindication under the Constitution.
Story_ID: 418699
Speaker 1: Now you and your partners are like basically fresh out of--well you're fresh out of law school.  Were the others, what were they, were they about the same or similar age?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Richard White [Richard T. White] was Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] graduate, Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] undergrad.  He had been in Dykema Gossett [Dykema Gossett PLLC].  He was recruited to the Patmon firm [Patmon, Young and Kirk, PC, Detroit, Michigan] and then Lewis Lee [ph.] who is a classmate of mine at the University of Michigan [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan], he was recruited to Patmon from Miller Canfield [Miller, Canfield, Paddock and Stone, PLC] as well as me.  So there were two, there were two of us.  I think I said before I was the only African American, I guess there were two of us who were there that summer as summer clerks.  Or maybe, maybe it was I was a summer clerk there in '69 [1969] and joined in '70 [1970] or had an offer to join in '70 [1970] and Louie Lee joined in '70 [1970] while I started my clerkship and then eventually found his way to Patmon, Young and Kirk where we reunited.  But so it was Lewis, White and Lee to start with then Eric Clay [Eric Lee Clay] who I think was at University of North Carolina, Durham [sic. University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina], and Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut] and then Ray Graves [ph.] I think was Trinity [ph.] undergrad and can't remember his law school affiliation at the moment.  But yes we were, we were all young.  There were no senior partners in this group although we did have the sage advice and counsel of some senior leaders of the legal community including my father-in-law Otis Smith [Otis M. Smith] who had been a Michigan Supreme Court justice and at the time was at General Motors Corporation [General Motors Company, Detroit, Michigan] as general counsel.  Mysel Sol [ph.] who I think at the time was leading the legal aid or the defenders program in the City of Detroit [Michigan] and we were all involved in the Wolverine Bar Association, which was in Detroit was sort of the equivalent of Cook County Bar [Cook County Bar Association].
Story_ID: 418700
Speaker 1: Now this is 1972 was Richard Nixon's [President Richard Milhous Nixon] the president and one of the features of his administration was an emphasis on black capitalism also I think is Archer Fletcher [sic. HistoryMaker Arthur Fletcher], who worked for him came up with affirmative action.  I think maybe earlier than '72 [1972].
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: But some things are in place that are informed by the black business community to tie the federal government into things going on in the cities in the major cities.  I think now was Colman Young elected in 1972 as well?
Speaker 2: No.  He was elected in the fall of '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: So, okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: So one of the coincidences of my life was the and the life of the others associated with the firm [Lewis, White, and Clay, PC; Lewis and Munday, PC] is that we started the firm in November of '72 [1972] and within a year November of '73 [1973] Colman Young was elected the mayor of the City of Detroit [Michigan] and we were active in his campaign hoping that he would be elected and working for his election and he was in fact elected and took the office I think in January of '74 [1974] and then subsequently served for twenty years as a mayor of the City of Detroit elected five times to the office by the citizens of the city.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he served all the way to 1993?
Speaker 2: (Cough) Correct.
Story_ID: 418701
Speaker 1: Now you were a business law firm basically?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So what cases were you working on and what you know what did you do during this time when you got started?
Speaker 2: Right.  So we made a list of potential clients before we opened our doors.  I talked to my dad [Walton Adams Lewis] and as always he was encouraging.  We did not have a place to open an office so my dad owned a building adjacent to his general insurance agency office [Lewis and Thompson Agency, Inc., Detroit, Michigan] and he paid for that property which was essentially a two family flat to be converted into a law office and so when we opened the doors in November of '72 [1972] we were taking anything that walked in the door, although we did have some some thoughts about where we wanted to go and since I had graduated from law school [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan] in '70 [1970] and taken the clerkship [with Theodore Levin] and was out in practice before we started the firm [Lewis, White, and Clay, PC; Lewis and Munday, PC] formally, I'd taken some assignments from recorders court which is the criminal court of criminal jurisdiction in the city.  So I was doing some representation in the recorders court of people accused of crime doing some probate court work, doing some business formation work for people who were interested in forming businesses.
Story_ID: 418702
Speaker 1: After we opened the doors, one of the things that really gave us a big boost early on was representation of Aetna Life and Casualty [Aetna Life and Casualty Company; Aetna, Inc.], whose general counsel was a Michigan law alum [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan] and at the time he had conceived of an effort to broaden the ranks of representation of Aetna Life and Casualty as a company where they had litigation in the courts in major cities with law firms that included African American attorneys so that was really our very first corporate client but at the same time Richard White [Richard T. White] developed relationship, his father-in-law had been a physician, his dad was a pharma- pharmacist if I remember correctly so he was sort of oriented to know the people in the medical community and just about that point in time there was an effort to put a HMO together, health maintenance organization, so Richard was able to develop that opportunity to be a client of the firm [Lewis, White, and Clay, PC; Lewis and Munday, PC] and it turned out to be a longstanding client of the firm that eventually went public and sold stock over the stock exchange and then Lewis Lee [ph.] who had played football at Michigan developed relationship eventually in the first couple of years with the firm with the American Football League and actually turned out to be president of the local entry into the American Football League and that provided a good source of income to the firm in the early years and then Eric Clay [Eric Lee Clay] being the law clerk of Damon Keith [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith] and being known throughout the community as a top level litigator having clerked for Judge Keith again to get request for representation in litigation matters.  So within that first year or two you know we were off to the races for a number of reasons but the thing that really puts some, some, some real after burners on our initial launch was Colman Young became mayor in January of '74 [1974] and he through Bob Millender [Robert Millender] who was his campaign manager, opened the doors to us to do a lot of work in the municipal sector for the City of Detroit [Michigan] litigation, municipal bond work, real estate and that's sort of been the wind under our wings.  All of those initial things for you know the last forty years.
Story_ID: 418703
Speaker 1: I have like some outlines of some cases here but without specifics so I don't know what you would want to talk about but I'm gonna ask you about some of them here.  Okay now okay so you just kind of recap what you said in some ways, the boiled down version would be that your firm [Lewis, White, and Clay, PC; Lewis and Munday, PC] represents corporations, entrepreneurs, entertainers, athletes and governments in litigation, real estate, corporate law and healthcare as well as public finance, right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So one case involved coordinators of employment related defense for an international fast food chain.  Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Say that reference again?
Speaker 1: Okay, it's about a fast food chain, international fast food chain, some sort of employment-related defense of an international fast food chain, does that ring a bell?
Speaker 2: Employment defense, well in, in the context of employment defense, a couple of things come to mind.  One early victory was a case that Eric Clay [Eric Lee Clay] took on with Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan] as the defendant where there'd been a black engineer who'd been at Ford for many years, thought that he had been discriminated against and Eric took his, his case and prosecuted it effectively to a degree where there was a significant financial settlement.  We did have a number of instances where we were asked to give advice and counsel or maybe even to represent businesses that were concerned about the fairness of their employment practices and things of that nature, including McDonald's, Wendy's, and, and others as to the particulars of this defense of a fast food chain in the employment area.  I'm drawing a blank.  I'm certain Eric would probably know the case upside down but that that doesn't bring up a file that I can open.
Story_ID: 418704
Speaker 1: Might be better for--to have you just kind of recount some of the memorable cases [at Lewis, White, and Clay, PC; Lewis and Munday, PC].  Maybe give me three you know cases that stand out that you all have been involved in that may have set a precedent or.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah so probably the one that I was most directly involved in and I'm not a litigator, although I started litigating in the early part of my career but I quickly turned away from that.  But the the one thing that serves as a victory for the city as opposed to for me or the firm as such was the effort that Mayor Young [Coleman Young] undertook to keep a Cadillac [Cadillac Motor Car Division] motor car assembly facility in the City of Detroit [Michigan].  That facility formerly over on what they call Clark Street in Southwest Detroit [Detroit, Michigan], GM [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company, Detroit, Michigan] decided to close and it was gonna move out of the city but the present CEO of GM at the time I think it was Tom Murphy [Thomas A. Murphy], challenged the mayor to find a alternative where Cadillac Motor Car Division that assembly facility would stay in the city as opposed to move out to the suburbs and Mayor Young put together a team that was eventually able to assemble four hundred and fifty acres of land for the site of this new assembly facility but at great cost and in great controversy because it involved condemning residences, condemning businesses, some instances con- condemning churches in a part of town that was not doing well but nevertheless was home to these residences and institutions and the condemnation was challenged in court and our team successfully litigated that case at the lower level and case was argued before the Michigan Supreme Court and I was asked to take the lead in that argument for our firm and, and I did and the case was decided favorably for the City of Detroit based on the longstanding power of municipal governments within the state to condemn private property for public purposes and the key to this decision was that the development of this assembly facility in the city for General Motors Corporation was found by the city to be a public purpose and the Supreme Court supported that.  That opened the, the opportunity for Colman Young to begin a program of redevelopment in the city by developing large business centers where a lot of jobs and tax base were generated (cough), excuse me, and sort of begin again the cycle which initially led to the City of Detroit being a prosperous city and so that was, that was certainly one case.  There's another case involving Cobo Hall, which is a convention center here.  It's now called Cobo Center [Detroit, Michigan] and because we'd done some in-depth research we not only had been assigned to that project but we had helped to write some legislation that was passed in Lansing [Michigan].
Story_ID: 418705
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So the Cadillac Motor Car Division, General Motors [General Motor Corporation; General Motors Company, Detroit, Michigan] that was the Poletown case and the other matter I was mentioning involved the expansion of Cobo Center [Cobo Hall; Cobo Center, Detroit, Michigan] and we were assigned to the team by Mayor Young [Coleman Young] and we helped to write the legislation that authorized the city to finance part of the expansion through the issuance of bonds and because we done some deep research on the payment of utility relocation cost, we knew that in the statute had to be a declaration that the project constitute a public purpose and if you say the right words in the statute then when it comes time to relocate utilities, it's a cost that's incurred by the utility and not by the municipality and actually that was litigated.  I did not litigate that case personally, but because we had set it up in the statute, made the appropriate findings, declared the public purpose, the city was able to avoid a $15 to $20 million utility location costs that otherwise it would have been required to pay.  So that was a particularly sweet victory.
Speaker 2: That's a case if I may that just requires knowing what the law is.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: If you don't know you were subject to have to pay penalties that you would not have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, exactly.  And it's that sort of in-depth work that we pride ourselves on and because of our work in the real estate area in litigation and public finance, you know there are various ways that you can lose what you're trying to achieve and this is true for lawyers and really all practices but as a young firm [Lewis, White, and Clay, PC; Lewis and Munday, PC], we were able to dig out those sorts of trip wires and keep them from frustrating our clients' objectives and actually help our clients to achieve their objectives more successfully.
Story_ID: 418706
Speaker 1: My next citation would be to some work we did for the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.] in the mid-'90s [1990s] where it didn't involve litigation but involved our D.C. office, which at that time was six or seven attorneys strong and was primarily focused on the public finance practice, closing three major bond transactions for the District of Columbia within, within ninety days which was a very much unheard accomplishment.  We call it three peat and we did three distinct issues with our team and the other members of the team in ninety days accomplished some really important objectives of the District of Columbia including refinancing some old debt that it had and we're particularly proud of that accomplishment.
Speaker 2: Who is the mayor of the District--
Speaker 1: Sharon Pratt Kelly [HistoryMaker Sharon Pratt] was the mayor--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --of the District at the time.  Our team then was led by one of the best lawyers we've had with the firm [Lewis, White, and Clay, PC; Lewis and Munday, PC] Kathleen--Kathy Miles [Kathleen Miles] who's now with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board but it's pretty exhilarating experience and we've had a number of those in our public finance practice as well as in the real estate work, in the real estate side in a very early development during the Young [Coleman Young] administration, Reuben Munday [HistoryMaker Reuben A. Munday] crafted the legal work that allowed the city [Detroit, Michigan] to work with a developer out of Cleveland [Ohio] to build an apartment tower on top of a public parking garage, first time that had ever been done in the State of Michigan and there were many who said it couldn't be done.  But Reuben being the scholar that he is found a way to cobble together an existing authority in the State of Michigan and judicial decisions to support the legality of the project and there were outside financing sources that had to rely on the merit of the legal work that he did in that particular matter.  So there've been accomplishments like that along the way that we can all be proud of.

Speaker 1: You mentioned a Washington, D.C. office, how many offices does your firm have now or when was at its--I guess can you just kind chronicle as I don't know if it's grown bigger and gotten smaller and gotten bigger again?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so yep it's expanded and contracted over the years but basically along these lines started in '72 [1972] between '72 [1972] and '85 [1985] roughly we were a single office firm located in the City of Detroit [Michigan].  In the mid-'80s [1980s] we began to experience opportunities to take our public finance practice outside of the State of Michigan and what we developed was a--an affiliation of law firms where we didn't really establish a branch of Lewis and Munday [Lewis, White, and Clay, PC; Lewis and Munday, PC]  but we would identify another firm like ours in another city and we would agree to work together to take on our clients in the public sector who had public finance needs and there were a number of cities that fell in that category but our first real branch office was established in Washington, D.C. in 1990, '91 [1991] and then later on in that decade we had an office established in Seattle [Washington] which was preceded by one of these affiliations.  That situation involved an African American lawyer in Seattle by the name of Ken Burton [Kenneth C. Burton], who was a partner in the firm of Burton and Burton [Kenneth C. Burton Law Offices, Seattle, Washington].  We were affiliates for a couple of years and then one of our lawyers from Detroit moved with her husband to Seattle and she eventually opened an office of the firm there and Ken joined in that office.  And then we asked in addition to the D.C. office we in the past have had an office in Lansing [Michigan], which is the state capital which is a branch of our firm and we recently established an office in New York City [New York, New York], I should say you know over this twenty year period technology has been our friend and allowed us to compete at the highest levels with very large law firms who do a lot of the kind of work that we do.  But technology has helped to level the playing field and right now we have an office in New York and in Washington, D.C. and Seattle.  At one point in time, I say in the mid-'90s [1990s] the firm was thirty-five, thirty-six lawyers in size.  Now we're half that size and lawyers have gone in all sorts of different directions.  Over the years we have a pretty large extended family with lawyers who at least six or seven or eight ascended the bench are judges in various courts, federal and state, and others have gone on to corporations.  The people who have been here found good opportunities here and then have progressed to other greater opportunities beyond the firm but that's sort of the evolution.  The evolution of our public finance affiliation was really sort of took in the early '90s [1990s] when there may have been ten or twelve different firms from New York to Los Angeles [California] to Minneapolis [Minnesota] to New Orleans [Louisiana] to Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] who are part of, of this affiliation of law firms seeking to do public finance work.
Story_ID: 418708
Speaker 1: How has your kind of dual degree M.B.A. and law degree helped you to become more successful?
Speaker 2: Well, it's, it's, it's exposure to a central part of the American economy that being the business world, in a way that doesn't occur in law school so it has been a real benefit to me in the sense that some of the disciplines within the general business school curriculum which include production management, marketing, accounting, organization behavior, markets, finance really are integrally involved in a lot of the things that lawyers do and it provided me with the opportunity to better understand the mindset of many of the clients I had to deal with in the business world and as well as in the public sector and so a number of the tools that are taught in business school, particularly in the finance area are applied on a daily basis in the public finance arena, present value concepts, numbers, number analysis, statistical analysis, financing techniques, a whole variety of issues and concerns that you may get the legal side of part of that in law school but you don't have the breadth of understanding that you do through a business school exposure.  So that has been particularly helpful to me and again I encourage young people who are thinking about careers and the business law area to consider doing a joint degree and getting that exposure and the knowledge that comes in context of business school education.
Story_ID: 418709
Speaker 1: I notice on your outline you sit on a number of boards and what roles you play on those boards and you know I guess what do you actually do as a board member for those?
Speaker 2: Right so my first board experience was in 1989.  I joined the Conrail board and Conrail was short for Consolidated Rail network [Consolidated Rail Corporation; Conrail].  It was the entity formed by the federal government after the collapse of seven railroads in the northeast quadrum of the country, the Penn Central [Penn Central Transportation Company] being one of those railroads and fortunately someone had written into the statute that the Conrail board whose job it was to reestablish effective and efficient rail network in the freight area in the northeast part of the country would be comprised of a diverse board and the charter board, the first board of Contrail, was comprised of several people none of whom I knew with the exception of Bill Milliken [William G. Milliken] who was former governor of the State of Michigan and Wiley Branton [Wiley A. Branton, Sr.] who at the time was dean of the Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] and I actually did not know Dean Branton but Dean Branton represented the diversity on that initial Conrail board and unfortunately he died shortly after the board was organized and because Governor Milliken had appointed me to be on the board of trustees of my college alma mater Oakland University [Rochester, Michigan].  He recommended that I--my name be submitted as a potential candidate to succeed Dean Branton.  So that was an unexpected opportunity but has been a very big part of my life since 1989 this puts me in the twenty-fourth year, I guess, of being on a corporate board.
Story_ID: 418710
Speaker 1: Because of my business school background and law background there are a lot of dimensions of corporate boards that at least I was aware of going into the board room but to answer your question what do board members do? They take on the responsibility under the law of particular states where the corporations are organized to oversee and manage the affairs of the corporation and it's a very wide and broad set of responsibilities probably the most important of which is to choose the right chief executive, somebody who has the day-to-day job of running that company particularly if it's a public company whose stock is traded on one of the national exchanges but just to give a little more elaboration of the responsibilities of the corporate board member, those responsibilities are often described to some degree in statute and those responsibilities include promoting the interest enhancing the value of shares owned by shareholders looking after the best interest of employees of the company, of suppliers of the company, of the communities in which the companies are located and each state has its own formulation of what interest or set of interest is paramount so the board of directors as a group have to take on and discharge that responsibility so it's a fiduciary responsibility where you have to act in the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders and its constituents and so the the job of the corporate board is to interact with management on a whole variety of issues ranging from business strategy, business finance, personnel issues at the senior level, having the right team, reporting out to shareholders and the public through audited financial statements, by engaging outside auditors, arranging for the compensation of the senior management team and defending the corporation. (Cough) Excuse me. Or overseeing the defense of the corporation through reports from legal counsel where the corporation may be sued for one reason or another.  So it's a very broad ranging set of responsibilities where the board members bring their various experiences together to the board table and with management collaborate and discuss and debate and share insights to try to achieve the best result in each of these specific areas and since my first board assignment at Conrail [Consolidated Rail Corporation; Conrail], I think I'm on my seventh board now and I approach each one pretty much the same way, which each one is a learning experience and that was the reason I was really interested in getting involved because you see the practical aspects of a number of things that you study in theory in school and business school and law school and I think through my experience over the years I bring some, some really meaningful background to assist in this deliberative process all boards go through to address, discuss, debate, resolve issues that the corporation has to deal with in the best interest of the corporation's constituency or constituencies.

Speaker 1: You mentioned advice to young people, people who want to get involved in business law.  You said it was a good idea to get an M.B.A. if you can.  There are joint programs now I think where they regularly offer.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  You can do joint programs in four years and come out with a dual degree, a J.D. and an M.B.A. and there are other disciplines besides law--I mean besides business that you can do a joint degree.  You can do a joint degree in a number of different ways.  You can do an M.B.A. in public policy.  You can do probably M.B.A. in public health.  I mean there--you can do J.D. and public policy.  You know and other combinations that are, that are more honed to a particular career path.
Story_ID: 418712
Speaker 1: Your firm [Lewis, White, and Clay, PC; Lewis and Munday, PC] began basically was almost contemporaneous with the leadership of Coleman Young as mayor of the City of Detroit [Michigan], but did not stop when his ended, do you have a reflection on the Coleman Young?
Speaker 2: I certainly do.  It is a really up close and personal view as I got to know him over the period of time he was mayor and afterwards I was executor of his estate and can't really thank him enough for the opportunities that he gave to our entire firm in so many ways.  My view is that the mayor, as everybody calls him, was a unique individual with extraordinary leadership skills who was formed as a person with political beliefs and leadership beliefs in the crucible of, of a challenging time among blacks and whites, management, labor, activists, pacifists, series of influences and think the books that chronicle his life sort of reflect, reflect that, but these various dimensions of his character sort of represent the very best of the American story from the ascension of this very intelligent young man from a family that relocated from Alabama to Detroit and sort of the heyday of the city sort of grew up here, encountered discrimination in seeking higher, higher education.  Although he was smart as a whip turned to political activism when many other avenues were foreclosed to him simply because he was an African American and found that his leadership skills and his instincts were a source of great strength for people who were similarly situated and was seen as a leader and who always did his homework.
Story_ID: 418713
Speaker 1: And he [Coleman Young] was a member of the constitutional convention that redrafted the Michigan Constitution [Constitution of the State of Michigan] in 1963 or '62 [1962] and he knew the Constitution upside down.  I mean he had been elected to, to public office by then but he, he was not a casual politician, he was purposeful in everything he did and he was focused on empowerment of his people who had been denied so many ways a place at the table.  So he's a great man in my book and working with him you know at a distance initially and closer over the years, it's been a great influence on my life and so its influenced me in a very, very positive way.  He had a style about him in terms of empowerment that is almost lost in, in today's world.  Of course the world has changed and many of the battles that he fought are no longer the primary battles that have to be fought, but he was very collaborative.  He knew how to move on key issues.  He wasn't afraid to hear the voice, voices of a number of different people and other leaders and take that cacophonous noise and weave a symphony of of action, positive action to improve the destiny of the city and I think he's certainly to be regarded as a great mayor of the City of Detroit [Michigan] who moved Detroit in the right direction for African Americans although at the same time it created controversy with the greater white community who see him in a very different light.  But my, my book he's a great man, a great American.
Story_ID: 414373
Speaker 1: Let me just ask you who are some of the unsung heroes and maybe some of the dramas that have helped I guess the people in Detroit [Michigan] try to maintain their position as one the places where one of the centers for black leadership in the country.
Speaker 2: Yeah so I think there's been a continuum of the leadership as far as African Americans are concerned in, in the city that go back before my time, but from my experiences, I would have to say that there are, there are people who are not known in, in the public eye, whose names are sort of on the tips of tongues of people in the African American community have set the stage and then executed on empowerment and that brings us to where we are today.  But just going back the labor movement was you know extraordinary here in Detroit.  So some of the names that come to mind are Nelson "Jack" Edwards, UAW [United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America]; Horace Sheffield [Horace L. Sheffield III], UAW; Marc Stepp, UAW; Marcellus Ivory, UAW. In the corporate community, Gus Calloway [Augustus T. Calloway, Jr.] at Michigan Bell [Michigan Bell Telephone Company], Tobey Washington [ph.], Richard Austin [Richard Henry Austin] who eventually became secretary of state but had his own black CPA [certified public accountant] firm here, R. Louise Grooms who was a black woman--businesswoman here.  Of course you know about the Gordy family and particularly Esther Gordy Edwards who was nationally known here for her contributions in Motown in addition to her brother, Berry [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy], educators like Reginald Wilson, Arthur Johnson who was just tremendously important to the political, social and educational community here, Erma Henderson, better known because she was president for--of the Detroit City Council [Detroit Common Council; Detroit City Council].  There's a very long list of African Americans who continue to strive for true freedom in their era that are not well known, but it was characteristic of the African American leadership in Detroit or Chicago [Illinois] or D.C. [Washington, D.C.] or wherever to organize and address the challenges of, of the, of the moment whether it was school desegregation, whether it was voting rights, whether it was jobs, business opportunities, job discrimination.  So those are some of the names and it's one of those things where you can't give enough names because there are so many people.
Story_ID: 414374
Speaker 1: In the religious community for instance Nick Hood [Nicholas Hood, Sr.] was one of such people.  The Reverend, Reverend Adams [Charles Gilchrist Adams] at Hartford [Hartford Memorial Baptist Church, Detroit, Michigan].  When you get into the clergy, you get into the names of some extraordinary leaders who were grounded in the values of the bible but were also grounded in their realities of concerted action and uplift you know in the, in the community, Maurice Higginbothan [Maurice J. Higginbothan] at Bethel A.M.E. Church [Detroit, Michigan] as well as Norman Osborne [Norman V. Osborne] at Bethel Church.  There are just, you know there's a history when people in any community get together and they start talking about the old days when the religious leaders, the educational leaders, and the business leaders, and the political leaders' names are lifted up in in great reverence because of the fact that they were out fighting for the the community.  So you know those, those are some of the names that come to mind.  And I know I've not done justice because I've left some you know a lot of, a lot of names out that should be mentioned.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Thank you.
Story_ID: 414375
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well my hope is pretty much intact and it's more of a vision of what future generations of African Americans will realize in this place over time and it's akin to having that dream that Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] spoke about where there would be decisions and doors opening based on content of character as opposed to color of skin and that is still an unkempt, unfulfilled dream as far as African Americans are concerned but my hope, my vision for the future which I think is very similar to the hope and vision of other African Americans you know for that day to really arrive in the sense that there will be no suspicion of what underlies decisions or what doors are open or not open based on the invidious factor of, of race; not only for African Americans but for others.  My concern is that we're moving into a new phase of more subtle and less tangible discrimination, the effect of which is to keep African Americans on the bottom rungs of, of the American economic ladder and I think it's more complicated now because many of the legal barriers that had kept our people from making the progress that they should have as a human right to make have, have been broken down but I think many of the attitudes still exist and the notion of the country making a collective and conscious effort to do away with the relics of slavery, Jim Crowism, segregation have instead of being an emergent force to realize that dream, Dr. King had on behalf of all of us have devolved into this notion of racial preferences and struggle over the benefits of being an American and complicated by the fact that there, there really is no true remedy for African American people for the, the discrimination and the atrocities that have been visited upon African American people over the centuries and complicated now with the fact that other racial minorities who did not suffer the same way that African Americans have are now at the table to enjoy some of those benefits in the name of this egalitarian, equal handed society that we have.
Story_ID: 414376
Speaker 1: My concern is over the years it will frustrate the efforts of the country to provide a true remedy to the African American people, the descendants of those that really suffered who have a number of social and other challenges to overcome who were denied education, who need education to succeed and that we will be stuck in this place for you know for many years to come and that's my concern and I certainly hope I'm wrong but it is a heartfelt concern that I have and you know notwithstanding all the efforts it's not a generalization, I'm not saying that there hasn't been progress, I'm not saying that things can't change.  Lots of reason for, for some hope, but when you take a look at the 30 million plus African Americans in the country by every measure, we, we are not equal to other Americans in any meaningful measure, whether it's education or income, jobs, unemployment you know you name it.  So that's, that's my concern and that's why I think the efforts to address these issues are important and they're not absolutely just African American issues, they're issues that affect poor whites and native Americans and Hispanics and others so you know we have to rally to improve the life prospects of all American people who at the same time recognizing that there's a special need among the African American community that has been in this country for such a long time without enjoying the true benefits of being an American citizen.
Story_ID: 414377
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done at this point in life, is there any major thing that you would go back and change and do again if you could?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  I'm really happy with the choices that I've made along the way.  I often tell the young people that I speak with that it's okay to be led by your heart instead of your head and I think in large part because that--the experience that I've had I'm really happy with the choices I've made through life based many times on heart not to say that you can't or you don't need to put your head in the game because you do.  There's a lot of stuff to think about.  But when it comes down to making a, a really important decision, it's important to remember to get your heart in the game and have the head and heart in the, in the, in the process of choosing.  So no, no there's nothing--I think you know probably as I look back on the, and this has yet to be seen, the evolution of the firm [Lewis, White, and Clay, PC; Lewis and Munday, PC], I would think that we as a group would look back might have made some different choices that are at our fortieth year might have put us farther ahead than we are.  On the other hand you know there's the--we never were a, never aspired to be a black law firm.  But initially we were known as a black law firm in a corporate space.  But we we certainly were proud of our heritage and we wanted to accomplish something that really to this day has not been accomplished which is a national law firm that is founded by African Americans.  There's, there's no such entity at the moment.  There are other racial groups that are making progress but still there's none on the national scale with this kind of scoping scale that large firms have.  That was a professional aspiration.  So there might be some things in that area but that would involve really everyone and fortunately I've been able to balance my professional and family life in a very positive way and elated with my marriage to Kathleen McCree Lewis and subsequently after Kathleen's death from lung cancer to Lisa Cynthia Charles [Lisa Charles Lewis].  We are very happily married and the--my two older children who are a product of the marriage to Kathleen are doing extraordinarily well and there's no better feeling as an adult than to have children number one and then have children who are making their way and doing their thing.  And then I have a younger daughter who is now seventeen who will be going off to college soon.  Very proud of her and I'm certain that she will do well in her life.  And so the family life has really been, which has been very important to me over the years, has been really wonderful and there's nothing about it that I would change in any respect.  It's been just very fulfilling and I've gotten much more out of it than I've been able to put into it because I've had to learn a lot of things along the way.
Story_ID: 414378
Speaker 1: We always ask this question too.  When you look back today at everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh man, you know I really don't think a lot about legacy other than to be a set of shoulders for the next generation like the previous generation has been for me.  And so if there's anything I'm proud of its being able to say that--say to those in the previous generation who helped to bring me up and set me on my path, that I, I am honored in my life at least try to who they are and therefore who we are as a people and ideally set an example for future generations and leave some footsteps along the way and The HistoryMakers' projects certainly is a massive contributor to, to that.  And not expect to have any great legacy that people in the future would say this is what he left us.  I'm, I'm leaving whatever, whatever I go on to my reward whatever I've done collectively with many other people who are, are for a variety of racial groups who from different circumstances who've come together and worked on positive things and empowerment, uplift and meeting the challenges of the day and not being tricked into thinking that everybody's place in the world is the result of their, their inherent goodness or badness or intelligence or lack thereof.  There's a lot of the stuff that goes into it and you know sort of from a religious point of view believe in the notion of being my brothers and sisters keeper and that's been engrained in me over the years and I think it's a solid value on, on which to base a legacy of he was a person who tried to do the right thing and try to contribute to making opportunities and making a way out of no way sometimes and I'm, I'm happy with that and satisfied with that and let the future generation see it as they see it.
Story_ID: 414379
Speaker 1: I know you probably are not going this direction right now, but did you ever consider politics?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I did.  The short story on that was or is a couple of things and, and when Jack Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was assassinated, it wasn't a fear of death, it was just something soured in me about political life and I sort of looked at it in a different context.  And I think probably part of that too had to do with the, the battle over civil rights that Kennedy sort of ushered in, he and his brothers.  And the, just the difficulty in making progress in the political realm and then the second part of it is when Kathy [Kathleen McCree Lewis] and I married, she made me promise that I wouldn't run for office because her father [Wade H. McCree] had had to run for judge and I think she did not want anything to do with the political life although indirectly we both were involved in the political life of the city [Detroit, Michigan] but not through running for office, through being more good citizens, being involved in a variety of things and I honored her promise not to run for office and I really never had an urge to run for office because I really never thought that my personality matched up with what was needed to be a good politician and that was probably the factor number three.  So for those three reasons, even though I might have thought about running for office, never took a step to run for office and happy that, that I didn't because I'm perfectly comfortable playing the kind of role that I've been able to play.
Story_ID: 414380
Speaker 1: There anything I haven't asked you about that we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I don't know, let's see.  You know I think actually a good part of who I am is function of the fact that I had a marvelous mother [Dorothy Baker Lewis] and father [Walton Adams Lewis] and they were members of loving families.  My father's family was basically gone by the time I was growing up but my mother's family it was a large family and so I would think about about that and you know I think as far as my own endeavors I can't really say enough about the members of the firm [Lewis, White, and Clay, PC; Lewis and Munday, PC] here over time and every particular function and job description that we as a firm have had, how many good people there have been who help us to accomplish our objectives and help each of us in one way or another accomplish our professional objectives for a short period of time or a longer period of time and often those people are the ones who really make the difference but they don't get kind of recognition that they need.  I'm definitely indebted to to them, past, present and future and I think that's, that's basically it.
Story_ID: 414381
Speaker 1: Well the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered? (Pause) Well I think number one I'd like to be remembered as a good husband, a good father and a good, a good law partner who aspired to excellence in all of those endeavors.  I'd also like to be remembered as someone who believes in collective action for a common goal and you know the power of team work.  I've always been a person oriented to, to team work and I think I'd also like to be remembered as a person who always tried to do the right thing although maybe in some instances I haven't done the right thing, but doing the right thing has constantly been on my, my mind and I like to be remembered as someone who was creative in his own particular space and work with other people to do some things that had not been done before and someone who you can look in the eye and get an honest response from and someone who you can trust and that's how I'd like to be remembered.
Speaker 1: All right.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You're welcome.  Larry [Larry Crowe], thank you.
