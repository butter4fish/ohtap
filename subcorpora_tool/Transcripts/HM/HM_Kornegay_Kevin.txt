Speaker 2: My full name is Kevin Tyrone Kornegay.  That's K-E-V-I-N, T-Y-R-O-N-E, K-O-R-N-E-G-A-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there a story behind the name Kornegay?  I've never heard it before, and I just wanted to know if you know where it comes from?
Speaker 2: Well, I know it's of Scottish derivative, and for the most part my father [Thomas E. Kornegay, Sr.] and his father [Gilbert Kornegay], most of their family originated from North Carolina.  As a matter of fact, there's a small town in North Carolina called Kornegay.  So a fair number of my relatives--father's family comes from North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, it kind of sounds like, now that I think about it, it sounds like Carnegie.
Speaker 2: Yes, it does.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it may be an alternative spelling of Carnegie, you think?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  All I know is that it originated there and there's some--it's of Scottish origins, and that's about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: March 24, 1959.  I was born in Brooklyn Hospital in Brooklyn, New York.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am an endowed professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is April 15, 2011.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are in the basement of the Technology Square Research Building at, on the Georgia Tech campus.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, before we go into depth, there are five light-weight questions that only require a short answer that we use as kind of a warm up.  So the first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, (laughter) yes, I do.  I would say my favorite food is, as a matter of fact, I had it yesterday, curried chicken.  I love Caribbean food.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite, my favorite--yes, I do actually.  My favorite color is red.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of the year?  Ah, that's a good one.  I enjoy, my favorite time of the year is during the seasonal transitions, from winter to spring and the summer to fall transitions.  Those are my favorite times of the year.  I enjoy the colors.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Yes, South America.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I enjoy South America.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite phrase?  I have several of them, but the one that I like the most is "keep it simple, silly" because that translates to, transcends across all facets of my life with work as well as how I relate to my children and so forth.
Story_ID: 30833
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name, you want her maiden name or her--
Speaker 1: Well, both, I guess.
Speaker 2: Both.  Her maiden, my mother's maiden name is Dorothy Lattie, L-A-T-T-I-E, Scott, S-C-O-double T.  Her married name is Dorothy Kornegay.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  Her date of birth is December 10, 1928.  Place of birth Mobile, Alabama.
Speaker 1: All right, okay, now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace three generations on that side?
Speaker 2: I believe I can trace back three generations.  I do know that it was a matriarchal family.  The women were, most of the women were widows and they ran the families.  They also lived very long lives.  My great grandmother, for example, lived to the age of ninety-nine.  My grandmother [Pinley Scott] lived to the age of ninety-five, and I believe my mother's gonna live well into her nineties as well.
Speaker 1: Now, was there a lot of intergenerational transmission of information, you know?
Speaker 2: Not very much that I can recall, not very much that I can recall.
Speaker 1: So are there stories, for instance, that your mother knows that her grandmother told her about growing up about what life was like?
Speaker 2: No, and surprisingly, there wasn't very much of that.  I would hear mostly from my, about stories on my father's [Thomas E. Kornegay, Sr.] side, not so much on my mother's side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have a sense of what these women were doing?  Did they live in town or were they on a farm or what did they--
Speaker 2: I know they relocated to Chicago [Illinois] and migrated to New York very, to Brooklyn, New York.  So they were mostly raised in New York, my mother, that is, and her sisters and brother.  So they were pretty much raised in the city.
Speaker 1: So within your mother's lifetime, the family moved from Mobile [Alabama] to Chicago to New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So, I believe that was either for employment or just seeking greater opportunities.
Speaker 1: So do you have relatives in Chicago now?
Speaker 2: I have, yes, I do have relatives, I believe on my mother's side, in Chicago, a lot of--she has a lot of first cousins in Mobile, Alabama, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how old was your mother when she moved to New York?
Speaker 2: Ooh, that's an excellent question.  I don't, I can't give you an accurate age.  I can only guess.  I know she was very young, so maybe five.  She was in early childhood, maybe five or six.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Now, what year did you say your mother was born in?
Speaker 2: Nineteen twenty eight [1928].
Speaker 1: Oh, 1928, okay.  All right.  So she was a, she grew up during the Depression, I guess, you'd say--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so are there any stories at all that are passed down about life in Mobile or Chicago?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  They're not (laughter), my parents weren't big storytellers.  Dad worked all the time, and mom was always taking care of the kids, you know, my siblings and I.
Speaker 1: Did you get the sense that they were going to Chicago and New York to find better employment rather than, or they just didn't like Mobile or what?
Speaker 2: I think it was, again, to seek better opportunities, yes, the, you know, employment, quality of life, you know, yes, I think that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your mother, now did she finish school in New York?
Speaker 2: High school.
Speaker 1: High school, okay.
Speaker 2: Both my parents went as far as high school, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, did your mother say, ever talk about what she was interested in growing up, I mean in terms of occupation or did she have any hobbies or interests or talents that--
Speaker 2: No, actually, she, my mother worked in this, and she was a para-professional.  She worked in the school district, in the middle schools, the public schools.  Prior to that she was a stay-at-home mom.  So she took care of my siblings and I, but when she did start employment, she was, she worked, she taught in the school, in an elementary school as a matter of fact, in schools where my younger siblings and I attended.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So she was there at the school, and we'd see, we'd see her at the school and at home.  So (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, did she get married right out of high school?
Speaker 2: She got, I believe my mother married, yes, yes, she did.  She, oh, she didn't finish high school.  She got pregnant, married my father.  She was around six- seventeen, I believe.  And she finished, she got a--I think she did manage to go back and finish school.  But she got pregnant with my sister who is the oldest.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay,
Speaker 2: Back then men did the honorable thing, quote, unquote.
Story_ID: 30834
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, let me ask you about your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Father's full name is Thomas Earl Kornegay, Sr.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: October 6, 1925.
Speaker 1: And was he born in New York or--
Speaker 2: He was born in Mount Olive, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about his, the ancestors on that side?
Speaker 2: I can tell you that they come from a large family, that my great grandfather Gilbert Kornegay, had a fair number of children, and then one of whom was my father.  My father was the eldest of, how many siblings?  There were ten of them.  My father was the eldest, seven boys, three girls.  And both--I've never met either of my paternal grandparents.  They, my great grandfather died, paternal grandfather [Gilbert Kornegay] died when he was forty-nine, I believe or fifty-one.  And my grandmother died shortly thereafter.  They died, both died very young.  My father was around fourteen or fifteen at the time, and he had to take care of the family, his siblings.  So he raised his siblings, his younger brothers.  My father never went on to, I don't think he finished high school at that time.  But his brothers, his youngest, two youngest brothers did go on to college and to graduate school and did very well.  One actually, my Uncle Wade, Wade Kornegay, is one of them who is, went to [University of California] Berkley as a physical chemist.  I think he graduated with his Ph.D. in 1972 in that era.  But he went to Berkley, and he went to an HBCU [Historically Black Colleges and Universities].  I think he went to UNC [University of North Carolina]--no not UNC.  He went to North Carolina Central [University, Durham, North Carolina] undergrad so, he and Uncle Bob.  Uncle Bob received his master's degree in computer science.  He was a software engineer, and he's one of the few (chuckle) that I knew of.  But my father I believe played a key role in their success.  And he sacrificed a lot as he was a very bright man.  But, yeah, I think he played a key role in that.
Speaker 1: Okay, financial role or--?
Speaker 2: Financial, emotional support, etc.  I mean he was, he made it possible for his, you know, his brothers didn't have to work.  So he took care of them, yes, and his family.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so did your father make it through high school?
Speaker 2: He did eventually get his GED [general education diploma], and he went on to have a career at the, in New York as a, he had a civil service job.  He was--actually, he rose to the high ranks.  He ran the New York, he worked for the New York City Transit Authority, and it was, I think he ran the Brooklyn Train Yard, and that was a big--and that required a lot of multitasking and scheduling and so forth.  So, he was a, yeah.  But he, too, died in his '50s, late fifties.  He was fifty-nine in 1987.
Story_ID: 30835
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: (Snicker) Not that much of a story, but I mean prior to--my dad [Thomas E. Kornegay, Sr.] used to work odd jobs.  And he'd met my mother [Dorothy Lattie Scott Kornegay] .  And my father was a bartender before he worked for, you know, before he even became a dad or whatever.  So he was a bartender.  And he met my mother around, during that time.  So, so they met, and my mother would say that your father always, always had a, you know, money and he took good care of her and treated her nice, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, when you think about their personalities and their talents and their dispositions and their habits and even how they looked, who do you think you take the most after, your mother or your father?
Speaker 2: Oh, my father, my father.  Yeah, I would say my father, even though he was a quiet man.  He was quiet strength.  As boys, as you know, we tend to watch our fathers, and so he didn't say very much to, except for when it was time to discipline us.  Even then, he was, you know, those two few, but you could sense from his voice when he was serious.  And even though he didn't say "I love you" and those types of things, you always--I knew that he did.  I mean he always provided for the family--(phone ringing).
Speaker 1: Excuse me, one second.  That's me too.  It's somebody at the office calling.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION):
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, so at any rate, well, you were telling us about your father.  And you said he was a quiet person.
Speaker 2: He was a quiet, strong person, and, yeah, I always felt secure just knowing he was, I just knew that I didn't have to worry about anything because dad was always, you know, he would take care of everything.  So.
Story_ID: 30836
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, now, you have brothers and sisters, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have three brothers--I had three brothers and a sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So presently, two brothers now.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, can you list your siblings and tell us where you fall in?
Speaker 2: Okay, my sister, Linda [Marshall], was the eldest.  Then my brother, Thomas, oldest brother, Thomas Earl Kornegay, Jr..  Then there was Marlon Kornegay, then myself and my youngest brother, Zachary Kornegay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the household basically consisted of your mother [Dorothy Lattie Scott Kornegay] and your father [Thomas E. Kornegay, Sr.] and you and your brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So there weren't any grandparents living with you or uncles or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I think, there's quite a gap between I think my sister and brother, like at least twelve to fourteen years older than I.  So they were gone, pretty much gone by the time I reached early adolescence, so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, about ten years between you and your sister from what I can see.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Of?
Speaker 1: Of anything, really.
Speaker 2: I mean I have several, but what's the context (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Well, an earliest, the first thing that you remember ever remembering?
Speaker 2: Oh.  Earliest.  Oh, yeah, I do remember I was in the hospital, my youngest brother and I were in the hospital at the same time.  He had a very bad case of asthma, I believe--well, we both did.  We all did.  So we both were in the hospital at the time.  And it was around, it was close to the holidays, and I believe one of our aunts came to visit and bought us this red fire truck.  And my little brother took the ladder off the truck, and he was underneath an oxygen tent.  And he took the ladder and stuck it down the tube and (laughter) jammed up the oxygen, I mean the machine.  He jammed the machine.  I was like oh, my goodness.  So I knew then he was mischievous.  So I warned him not to do that.  So, that's my earliest childhood memory, one of the earliest.
Speaker 1: Okay, now how old do you think you were at that point?
Speaker 2: Oh, he had to be around--
Speaker 1: No, I mean you?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was maybe, maybe around five or six, five or six.  He was three or four (laughter), so they had us in the room together.  So.
Story_ID: 30837
Speaker 1: Okay, now, can you describe your neighborhood?  What neighborhood in Brooklyn [New York City, New York] did you live in?
Speaker 2: Oh, we lived in a pretty cool neighborhood.  It, of course, during the era where, you know, folks believed that it takes a village to raise a family.  So we were all one big family, all the, the neighbor to the right, neighbor to the left.  We knew, across the street, we all knew each other.  I mean as a matter--I mean sometimes the kids would spend the night over our place, they'd throw us all in the tub together when we were very young.  And the parents would have, be over, you know, socializing and talking and helping one another.  So, it was that type of community.  It was really, it was safe, and this was considered a middle-income neighborhood in Queens, New York.  We, my parents [Thomas E. Kornegay, Sr. and Dorothy Lattie Scott Kornegay] moved to Queens about, when I was a week old and where my mother [Dorothy Lattie Scott Kornegay] presently resides.  So, now, the neighborhood has gone a huge transition.  I wouldn't--it's kind of, I wouldn't hang out on the corners as much.  It's not as safe as it used to be, nowhere near.  But it was, it was a great, secure environment.  And it was predominantly black.
Speaker 1: Now, did the neighborhood have a name or?
Speaker 2: It was just Springfield Gardens, Springfield Gardens.
Speaker 1: Springfield Gardens, okay.  I know in Queens, unlike a lot of places in New York, you have like grass in the front yard and backyard.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I mean, yeah.  We had a, it was a nice, three-bedroom house, decent sized front yard, nice backyard.  We had a, near the summertime, my dad [Thomas E. Kornegay, Sr.] would set up the pool and fill it with, take the hose and fill it with water.  And all the kids in the neighborhood would come over.  We had a basketball hoop set up on the garage, and we'd be out there during the, you know, when we were allowed to (laughter).  So, but yeah, it was, we'd have Easter egg hunts over--you know, our house was more or less--my mother would do all that, the socializing aspect of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Dad worked nights.  So.
Story_ID: 30838
Speaker 1: All right, now, was--and we always ask this question in this way too, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights.  Sounds and smells.  Smells, mom [Dorothy Lattie Scott Kornegay] was a great cook (chuckle).  So I'll start with smells, which is probably why I'm a good cook as well.  I didn't know it at the time.  I was the quality control guy so I would always hang out in the kitchen while she was cooking something, and I would, you know, when she turns her head, I would sneak, (laughter) and grab, sneak a piece of something.  And she knew what I was doing, but I didn't realize it at the time though that I could, you know, that I was actually learning how to cook just by watching my mother cook.  And so, you know, like my mother, I can make gravy from scratch, the way they used to take the drippings from the skillet and so forth.  I can, so it was interesting.  I can cook a full southern meal, and I didn't know that until I, I could do that until I became a father.  That's when I started doing that stuff.  But, you know, so the smells of the, mama's fried chicken, her apple pies, her sweet potato pies, those were pleasant things.  Sights, I guess in terms of sights, just the, just family, my brothers, you know, we were a close family.  And just seeing friends and neighbors and, you know, just, just people.  It was just one huge, happy family.  So it was comforting.  My parents [Thomas E. Kornegay, Sr. and Dorothy Lattie Scott Kornegay] had an open kind of home.  My mother was more so.  She helped, I would see her, whenever there was a death in the family or someone's family or what have you, mom would prepare a meal for the family always.  Oh, yeah, another sight, was an amusing sight, we had this, my grandmother had a friend whose name was Mr. Doc.  And he would always, he'd drive, he had this old, I forget what kind of car it was, but he would come pick us up.  And my grandmother would take us out maybe every year around the same time, she would come pick us up, Mr. Doc, cause my grandmother never drove.  But they would take us out to view her husband's grave, and she would put fresh flowers on his grave, and we would have a picnic out there.  So, and grandma would, my mother would prepare a basket for us.  But that was, you know, the last thing that--my grandmother always did that since like, since I was maybe around eight, seven or eight years old to around, till the time she died, for the most part.  So I guess they had a strong sense--and she would tell us some stories about, actually, about her husband who was in the military.  Now, he died in the Air Force, and he was, you know, received several honors during, you know, of distinction in service when he served in the Army.  So, and she would tear up.  But she did have, you know, display a strong sense of family and love and so forth.  So it was good, that was a good, one of the things I enjoyed a lot, yes.
Story_ID: 30839
Speaker 1: All right, so you were recalling your grandmother did actually tell you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you wanna, yes.
Speaker 1: Yes (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes, they were pleasant stories about grandpa, my mother [Dorothy Lattie Scott Kornegay] and a little bit about my mother, how she ran away from home and that's when she got pregnant.  And that's when she met my father [Thomas E. Kornegay, Sr.], so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, what did you like to do growing up?  I mean what were you drawn to?  Did you have any scientific inclinations?
Speaker 2: It was interesting.  I tinkered all the time.  And, it's a wonderful question cause I, you know, well, I think all I did was tinker.  And I guess at some point, my mother knew something because every Christmas, every Christmas I would get interesting--well, my siblings got toys.  I would get, she would get me a chemis-, you know, a microscope set.  She would get me a chemistry set.  She would get me an erector set.  So they got toys.  I got these things.  But I would sit around for hours and just tinker and experiment.  I would go outside and (laughter) grab samples of bugs and things so that I can--and slice them up so I could see what they look like under my, under the microscope.  And then we had this, oh, I guess everyone had the 'Britannica Encyclopedia,' you know, cause the salesman used to come around (laughter).  And so I would go to this encyclopedia and look them up and look at the genus and species of what I was, so I learned a lot on my own because no one, who was kind of there showing me.  But I was just naturally drawn to that.  I always enjoyed reading a lot too.  While--it's funny, well, my form of punishment was this, you know, my mother made me stay inside while the kids, you know, my siblings were outside playing with the neighborhood kids.  So I had nothing to do.  We didn't have TV or play stations or X Box at the time so I just picked up books and started reading and always enjoyed reading till this day.
Speaker 1: What were your favorite books?
Speaker 2: I'd find these old books, and my mother would bring them home from school and leave them around.  So I would grab them, and some math books, just any--math books, science books mostly (laughter).  So she would just bring them home from school, and I would, the workbooks, I would open them up and look at the math and just start doing work.  Yeah, and that's--
Speaker 1: So you volunteered to do math homework and science homework at home?
Speaker 2: I, there was nothing else to do (laughter).  There was nothing else to do.
Speaker 1: You didn't have a TV at home?
Speaker 2: We had one TV, but I was, I couldn't watch TV.
Speaker 1: Okay, when you were on punishment.
Speaker 2: On punishment, I couldn't watch TV.  I had to do, you know, so in order--it became habit forming after a while.  I just naturally did that.  I said, oh, this is not bad.  Rather than go outside and play, then I just stayed inside and read because stuff was, it became interesting to me.  The more I read, the more interesting it became.
Story_ID: 30840
Speaker 1: So, I think it happened around, I got sick, I was maybe around twelve, eleven twelve.  Yeah, I missed all of sixth grade.  And I had--
Speaker 2: What was wrong?
Speaker 1: I had rheumatic fever, so I couldn't--I mean they didn't know, I don't think they knew what the hell was wrong with me.  I was, I know I spent a lot of time in the hospital.  And I missed the entire sixth grade of school, that year of school rather.  And so the following year, that summer, my mother, they had a tutor come to the house, a teacher, help me come up to speed.  So I had to, I guess, they thought they had to teach me, you know, help me come up to speed.  So when I went back in the, they tested me at the end of the summer.  When they tested me, I was, I tested at the ninth or tenth grade level.  So that's what they did.
Speaker 2: And you were in the sixth grade?
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, well,all I did was, I was doing all this stuff, all this math and the reading.  So, it's the stuff that my mother was bringing home.  But I tested, and so they put me, when I--I went right into seventh grade, and then after that, they moved me to ninth grade.  And so I started high school early.  So when I went to high school, this kind of continued.  I was, always had this natural, I guess I gravitated more toward the math and sciences naturally.  So, when I was in high school, I would always--I studied music too ever since elementary school.  I played woodwind instruments, played the flute, the clarinet.  I played the piano, as well as the piano.  So in high school I studied music theory, and I did math and took math and science classes.  I was, I felt I needed to become a little bit more social (laughter), so I joined--I continued with the music.  So I was on the, and then in the band and then I joined the jazz band, and then I, while also on the math teams.  I was very active, so I was in school--I loved school.  I spent, I was at school at six in the morning [6:00 a.m.], and I didn't leave school 'til six at night [6:00 p.m.], seven at night [7:00 p.m.] because I was always involved with some activity, math team.
Story_ID: 30841
Speaker 1: Let me take you back to grade school.  Now, what was the name of your grade school?
Speaker 2: What was the name of my grade school?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, grade school was, oh, it was called PS-80 [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Public School 80.  I'm not sure if it's still there, exists.  I think it's still there.  It may be, they may call it something different today cause--
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you, were there any particular teachers or things that happened there that, you know, I guess, helped you to become the person you are today?
Speaker 2: No, and I was a regular kid and elementary school, I was just played and didn't do any, you know, I was, I was a bright kid, I guess.  I did get hit in the head once with a toy broom so maybe that had something to do with it (laughter), but it was nothing that I, that really stands out.  And no teachers in elementary school.  Now, the next level there with this, when they put me in these classes, I'm not sure-they were called SP classes for the bright kids.  So all of the advanced kids were in these classes, and I was tracked with those kids.
Speaker 1: Now, is this--did you start off, was PS-80 a predominantly black school?
Speaker 2: They were--excellent question.  It was a mixed school.  But the public school system was in a, was in the vicinity of one of the largest apartment development complexes in the city, okay.  And at that time, folks were moving out.  It was a fairly Jewish, it was a mixed neighborhood, mostly Jewish and African American.  But by the time--and the school population was representative of that, the elementary school.  So PS-80 was more reflective, but by the time I reached middle school, the demographics began to change, and it became more predominantly African American.  So by the time I reached the high school--I went to Andrew Jackson High School [New York, New York], it was all black.
Story_ID: 30842
Speaker 1: Okay, so where did you go to middle school?
Speaker 2: I went to middle school, just a few blocks away from the public school.  It was Junior High School 72 [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And what was the name of it?
Speaker 2: Junior High School 72.
Speaker 1: Okay, oh--
Speaker 2: They use numbers to, and I don't know why.  In New York City [New York], a lot of the early schools, they used numbers to name the school.
Speaker 1: All right.  So you started school basically, what, 1966, I guess or so, about six years old then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, 1966.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you start, I guess Andrew Jackson [High School, New York, New York] by 1973, I guess, that should be about right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's about right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, so it got more integrated the further up you got?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you think that you were on a, you were tracked as one of the top, brighter students?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your class, your entire classroom would have been brighter than or scored higher than--
Speaker 2: Well, that group of kids that came out, not the entire graduating class, but this was a small class of maybe around ten, twelve students.  And, yeah, but they were, yeah, yeah.  I don't know where they went on to high school. I went on to Andrew Jackson.  I was the only one to go to Andrew Jackson because I wanted to study, I was interested in music theory.  But then when I discovered, when I got there, there were several, you know, teachers--and by the way, my mother [Dorothy Lattie Scott Kornegay] (laughter), my mother started working at the public school, at PS-80.  And when I moved on to the junior high, a year later, she showed up at the junior high school.  So, and I recall--and everyone knew my mother in the school.  So I could do nothing.  She would come up to the classroom, and I never gave the teacher any problems, any trouble, but she would come up and tell the teacher in front of the entire class that if her son ever gave her any trouble, she would beat my behind in front of the entire class.  So, I never (laughter), I never did anything.  That embarrassed me, that alone, it was embarrassing alone to have your mother at the school.  But to have her--so I wasn't a trouble kid at all.  I was always the kid who was always on time, never late to anything, always had perfect test scores, you know (laughter).  I walked around school with a briefcase.  That was the kind of, I was the only kid walking around with a briefcase (laughter).  Well, like my dad [Thomas E. Kornegay, Sr.].  I started, see, my dad would go to work.  I would watch my dad.  I watched what he would do.  So he would go to work, shoes, tied up shoes, slacks, you know, a jacket and a briefcase and a hat.  And that's how, so I kind of adopted that kind of conservative, that professional--I wouldn't say conservative, but a professional kind of persona from my dad.
Speaker 1: Now, did you, now, this is '73 [1973].  Were you wearing bell bottoms and those things then?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't wearing what the other kids were wearing (laughter).  I wouldn't be caught dead in that stuff.  I had, I had enough things to worry about with my mother working at the schools, and I was concerned she was gonna follow me on to high school.
Speaker 1: Do you think, when you look back on it, do you think it was coincidence that she ended up in your middle school?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think it was coincidence.
Speaker 1: Okay, she consciously was tracking?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think she constantly wanted to make certain that I was given, I was challenged.  She told the teachers to challenge me.  Yeah, yeah, I think it was more of a conscious effort.  But she didn't do that with, and it was interesting, she didn't do that with my siblings.  So she must have seen, picked up something early.
Story_ID: 30843
Speaker 1: Okay, now, were you, as a youth, were you influenced by a church?  Was the family religious?
Speaker 2: Yes, we attended church every Sunday.  My mother [Dorothy Lattie Scott Kornegay] would have us at the service.  We weren't altar boys or anything like that, but we did attend service.
Speaker 1: Was it a Catholic church?
Speaker 2: Methodist, Methodist church.
Speaker 1: Methodist, okay.
Speaker 2: United Methodist, yeah, it was a United Methodist church.  It wasn't like they are today.  Some of the churches are nondenominational.  So it was a formal United Methodist church.  It was all black.
Speaker 1: Okay, you were active, but you weren't like an usher or in a choir or any of that?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I mean, no.  And on the weekends, I mean other than church, we did chores around the house (laughter), cutting grass.  I was always out earning, making money on the weekends, cutting grass, shoveling snow.  I mean if I wanted something, I'd go out--I had to go out and, you know, get it myself.  That's when I was older so I always learned that I could always get what I wanted to get.
Story_ID: 30844
Speaker 1: Now, did you have friends that had interests in science too?
Speaker 2: No, my friends were mostly athletes.  You know, they were, you know--no, I didn't have, I'm trying to recall.  Now, when I was in high school, the friends I hung out with in high school, yes.  But since the Andrew Jackson High School [New York, New York] was in the, you know, I had to travel maybe forty minutes, forty-five minutes to an hour on the bus to get to school.
Speaker 1: Was it still in Brooklyn [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: It was still in Queens [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: In Queens.
Speaker 2: It was still in Queens, but I had to travel about forty-five minutes to an hour, commute to school, and on the public transportation.  So most of my friends from the neighborhood, I'd see on the weekends, but all my friends from school, from the high school, were like, you know, were different, you know.  I hung out with the, you know, all the kids I hung out with at the high school were primarily, you know, the smart kids, the kids that went on to the Brown Universities [Providence, Rhode Island] and the Cornell's [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], the Ivy League schools.  I mean we were all the top kids in the school.  My buddy and I finished one and two in our class in the graduating, entire graduating class.  So, and as a matter of fact, he played football.  I played, I also joined the football team because I wanted to become more cool, so to speak (laughter), more mainstream.  But other than that, we took all of the same classes.  There weren't AP [advanced placement] classes at that time, but I took pre-calc and calculus classes in high school at the, it was my math teacher, oh, what is her name?  Mrs. Laird is her name.  So she was, she was one who challenged me with math, and she, and then Mr. Blum, he was in charge of the sciences.  And we would stay after school, and he encouraged each--there were four of us--we had worked on a project, to enter the Westinghouse Science Talent Program.  That still exists today.  But this was back then, when I was in high school, it was one of the first, when they initiated it, I think initially started the program.  And for two years I worked on this project, and I submitted a project in my senior year, and I was a semi-finalists, state-wide semi-finalist.  I worked on, this is, my project--and it's funny.  And I didn't think that there was any relation to the time I was dissecting bugs when I was much younger, but I did it, my project was the, I studied the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning on the reproduction of fruit flies, drosophila melangala [sic, melanogaster]  That is the genus species name, but I knew all this stuff from (laughter) when I was dissecting, you know, insects, way back when my mother [Dorothy Lattie Scott Kornegay] bought me that microscope.  So I didn't think in high school I would be doing this stuff.  So, but anyways, I always had that strong math, strong science thing that, and I was always very active, and I always did things to kind of reinforce that.  I was on the math team where we would compete against other schools in these math competitions.  They would give us problems, and, you know, so that was cool.  I enjoyed that.  And so I was kind of well rounded.  Once I joined the football team, I became a little bit more popular, (laughter) and I had more friends.  So I was kind of, it was interesting, I would help some of the guys on the team.  I would tutor them, and they would protect me in exchange.  They would protect me at the school, so I, you know, so it was, it was cool.
Speaker 1: Now, did they, in your school, were they calling people geeks and nerds and sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No, but I tell you one thing, I'll tell you what happened one day.  I was one of, probably the only kid at school, and you're talking about six, seven hundred kids, I'm walking around with my briefcase (laughter).  And I guess, this was after school, yeah, it was after school had just let out.  And I was headed upstairs to the lab, and I was in the stairwell, and some guy confronted me.  He was bigger than I was, and he pulled out a knife, and he wanted to take--yeah, he attempted to rob me.  He wanted to take my bus pass, and yeah.  So one of my buddies from the football team was coming down the stairs, big dude.  So anyways, he said, what's, you know, what's going on here?  And the guy recognized who he was.  He said, what are you doing?  And he got scared and he just ran off.  But had it not been for my buddy, I don't know what could have happened that day.  I might not be sitting before you today.  But, yeah, it was--I'm thankful for, you know, at least having a wide variety of friends.  And my buddy saved my life that day.
Story_ID: 30845
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, how were your grades?  Were you like, were you an honor student in those days?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I was a straight "A" student since elementary school (laughter).  So, I mean I've always had--I think I probably had one "C" in my entire life.  Don't ask me what class.  It wasn't math class, of course.  It was not in math, not in science.  It was in--I made a fatal, not a fatal, I made just a silly, a tactical mistake.  My last semester of college, I saved all my kind of humanities to meet those requirements--
Speaker 1: You're talking about college?  Yeah, now, wait a minute, we don't--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --wanna jump you that far ahead.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: We're trying to get you out of high school, so I'm just asking, as a senior, did you graduate in honors?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was number two in my class.
Speaker 1: Number two, okay, all right.  I was trying--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, I had this competition with the valedictorian.  I don't even know how he edged me out, but, yeah, we were very close.  We both had 4.0 GPA's [grade point average], above 4.0.  So his was maybe 4.12 and mine was 4.08, something ridiculous.  So.
Speaker 1: It was real close.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what did he go on to do?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: He, surprisingly enough, I mean this is the same guy.  We were all in the, the math team.  We were on the, in the science club with Mr. Blum.  We both participated each year in this Westinghouse [Science Talent Program].  Now, he went on to Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York].  He's a professor.  It turns out he's an engineering professor as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so you said you were a little bit more popular after you played football and--
Speaker 2: He was the quarterback and I was his rece-, (laughter), I was the, okay, (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, he sounds he's pretty successful.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: I was the receiver.  He was the quarterback.  We were best, we were close, very close friends.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: Michael McFarland.
Speaker 1: Michael McFarland, okay, all right.  So, now did you run for class office or anything like that or?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have time.  I didn't have the time nor did I have the interest.  I enjoyed what I was doing with the math team, the science club.  I stayed after school, earned money.  I got paid for, we called it "homework helpers".  So I worked there, and we'd get--that's when I would do my homework.
Story_ID: 30846
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were just talking off camera about some of the other things you did in high school [Andrew Jackson High School, New York, New York] we didn't talk about and you said you were the wide receiver on the football team.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Played tennis?
Speaker 2: Yes, I played tennis as well.  So I was busy.  I kept myself very busy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Good balance.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright so, on the verge of graduation, did you know you were gonna be an engineer?  I mean had you any, were your sights on it?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, no, I didn't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, at that time, I did not know.
Speaker 1: Now, you were gonna major in the sciences or math?
Speaker 2: I was majoring in math.
Speaker 1: Math, okay.
Speaker 2: Actually, I wanted to become, at the time, I did wanna become a medical doctor.  I thought I was gonna be a medical doctor.
Speaker 1: Now, this is 1977.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: So '77 [1977], whatever, '78 [1978], somewhere around there.
Speaker 1: High school graduation, that's '77 [1977], should be.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Unless you know, it should be '78 [1978] cause you were held back a year, right?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't held back.
Speaker 1: Oh,--
Speaker 2: I was advanced.
Speaker 1: You were sick.  Remember you were saying you were sick for a year?
Speaker 2: I was sick, but I was advanced a year.
Speaker 1: Oh, you were advanced a year so you came out at the same year that you would normally come out.
Speaker 2: Yeah, skipped a year.
Speaker 1: So it is '77 [1977], I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: So, I was skipped two grades.  I went from seventh to ninth grade.  So--
Speaker 1: So you might, well--okay.
Speaker 2: So I, so I left high school and went to major at pre-med in mathematics.  I had a couple of buddies of mine.  There were three of us.  I, two of us were math, pre-med and we were all pre-med.  And it's funny, we all, we called ourselves the three amigos.  So one, only one of us turned out to be a medical doctor (laughter).  So how I got into engineering is a kind of interesting story.  My math professor--this was after the first semester, she, and you know I was studying the actuary exams.  I was taking these actuary exams.  I was studying to become an actuary so, as a back-up, wasn't gonna do the--if the medical thing wasn't gonna work out--
Speaker 1: Actuary is an insurance--
Speaker 2: Well, the mathematicians who determine the, for example, the rates for these various policies.  Those are the guys who have to come up with the actual numbers.  So, there's a--
Speaker 1: Now, this is at Pratt Institute [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So my math professor told me to--what did she say to me?  She asked me if I were, well, she gave me an option for the summer.  She said, well, I have two programs, summer programs here.  And she said, one is at Bell Laboratories [Murray Hill, New Jersey] and the other is at Prudential [Newark, New Jersey], go to work for Prudential and to begin preparing for the actuary exams.  I'd already taken the first part of the exam.  And so I knew what actuaries did.  So I said, well, let me go to Bell Laboratories and see what that's all about.  After I went, I went there that summer.  I got introduced to the cir--electronic circuit design and the rest was history.  I was hooked.  By the end of that summer, I said, I'm gonna be an engineer, electrical engineer.  I mean I already had the math.  At least I had the science.  All I had to do was take some engineering courses.  So I took a heavy dose of engineering courses, and that was that.
Story_ID: 30847
Speaker 1: I went back, I, when I left there [Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, New Jersey] that summer, they told me about the scholarship program they had, and--at Bell Laboratories.  So I came back [to Pratt Institute, New York, New York] at the end of the summer with a scholarship from AT&T Bell Laboratories.  And it was retroactive, so it was cool.  I already had a scholarship from Pratt [Institute], but they gave me a scholarship.  So, and I went back every summer.  So, and I, each summer I had--well, that particular summer, I had a mentor.  His name was Jim West, James West.  And he was one of the key inventors of the foil electric microphone, okay.  That's a device, actual device that's in every handset, and every--the old telephones, the little microphone.  He was the inventor of the microphone, the, that goes into every headset of a regular telephone.  So I worked for him for two summers I believe, and all the while they were talking to me about graduate school.  And I wasn't thinking about, had not been thinking about medical school at all.  And I met other, well, during the summer there [Bell Laboratories], I met other engineers and scientists.  I met Shirley Jackson [president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute], Jim Mitchell, I mean the list goes on and on.  There's a famous mathematician, he's a Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] now.  He's a professor at Princeton now.  He was also instrumental.  But there were so many.  I've seen all these folks, and I figure well, shoot, I can--they have all this freedom and flexibility to do whatever it is that they want to.  They're having fun doing science and engineering, and they're getting paid for it, paid very well (laughter), I might add.  So I said, hum.  So the, and they started to talk to me about graduate school.  So by the time I was ready to apply for graduate school, I had interviewed for--I was getting a lot of pressure from my dad [Thomas E. Kornegay, Sr.] because my dad was always very big on having a good civil service job.  And they were good in New York City [New York], firemen, police, transit authority so my-- I took it.
Story_ID: 30848
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wanted to, first of all I didn't ask this question, but I should have asked this question, and it got past me.  But how did you end up going to Pratt Institute [New York, New York] in the first place?  I mean why did you choose Pratt Institute and did they offer a big scholarship or?
Speaker 2: They offered a scholarship.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was just, it was close by and at the time (laughter), it just fit nicely 'cause I could--I was DJing at the time.  I was making lots of money on the side.  And it gave me the, and I was always very efficient with my time.  So school work was always easy for me, so I'd get my work done very quickly.  Then I can go and I was making money.  I worked three days a week.  I was making 1,500 to 2,000 dollars a week cash.
Speaker 1: As a DJ.
Speaker 2: After tax, as a DJ.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So this is what I did.  I made, I had my own car, had my own apartment.  So I was living good, and I was going to school.
Speaker 1: Now, you were interested in music too--
Speaker 2: Yes, I--
Speaker 1: --music theory.  So did you take any music theory courses at Pratt?
Speaker 2: No, I did not.  I just did engineering.
Speaker 1: All right, cause you were playing woodwinds and--
Speaker 2: I was playing woodwinds and piano, yeah, yeah.  And so I loved the music so that kept, you know, I stayed with that for a while.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the genre of music that was out.  This is pre-hip-hop, right?
Speaker 2: Actually, it was just about to kick off because the guys, I remember, Russell Simmons used to bring his demos-- Run-DMC, they were the first.  He used to bring the demos to my club and beg me to play the demos.  And I didn't know these guys, but I played them.  But I was more into disco--
Speaker 1: Were they doing rap basically then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was rap, right at the start of rap, yeah.  That's right at the start of the rap.  And I could have gone--it's interesting.  It was a decision point.  I could have stayed in that, I was very good.  I was one of the tops in the city, very well known throughout the city.  But I didn't like that lifestyle.  It was short-lived.  And it wasn't, it wasn't stimulating, it wasn't stimulating to me.  It wasn't intellectually stimulating.  It was just something I knew that I could, you know, I enjoyed doing.  And, of course, it gave me an opportunity to meet a lot of girls, so (laughter).
Speaker 1: And have some money in your pocket too, right?
Speaker 2: And had some nice piece of change in my pocket, a nice piece of change.
Speaker 1: I wondered when, before we started this interview, when I was reading over materials if you were involved in some kind of an audio related, you know, thing with the speakers and amps and all that, you know, and the turntables.  And here it is.  So I, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I was always enamored with that.
Speaker 1: So you were one of the brothers who could hook up a sound system and make sure--
Speaker 2: Oh, I can design it from scratch, and not only, (laughter), I mean not only can I hook it up, I can build it from scratch.  I can design it from scratch, the circuits, the electronics, from the ground up, from the--and understand it from its very physical level.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did, was your understanding like that then?  I mean was it beginning to take shape?
Speaker 2: No, it didn't take shape until, no, til graduate school (laughter).  But it all came together in grad school.  But, yeah--
Story_ID: 30849
Speaker 1: Now, there's also the question, another question I have too is, now you came out of high school in '77 [1977].  So you don't graduate from college until '85 [1985].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So was there a lot of work and stopping and starting?
Speaker 2: There was some stopping and starting.  Yeah, I was making, I was DJing (laughter).  I was making money, taking classes, I was taking classes here and there.  I wasn't, wasn't in that much of a rush 'cause I was still trying to figure out what it was, is that I was trying to, I wanted to do, you know, still trying to kind of find myself.  But I was just enjoying myself.  You know, I had a very interesting high school, I mean I wasn't out doing anything in high school.  So I kind of made up for a little bit of that (laughter).  But I was, I was still taking classes.  It was interesting.  My roommates would be like, how do you do that?  I'd be, you know, I just do it, just do it.
Speaker 1: What's the--
Speaker 2: But I have a couple of degrees.  I have math, a couple of bachelor's degrees.  So one in math and one in electric engineering.  So I have two, wound up with two degrees.  So.
Speaker 1: Now, on the DJ scene in those days, if I'm not wrong, was that Curtis Blow, cause he was one of the pioneers back then.
Speaker 2: He was one of the--Russell Simmons had Run DMC and Curtis Blow.  Curtis Blow also was one of his clients and he, too, would come down to the club and I would play a lot of their demos, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and this is the very beginning of--
Speaker 2: Yes, the very beginning of that, but there was still, House music was big, very big and disco, you know, still in the disco era.  But house music was pretty big.  But at the start of the rap era.
Speaker 1: Okay, and disco was fading out as you were--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --leaving high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 30850
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so you said but when you got turned on to how to design circuits, that's (unclear)--
Speaker 2: That was at Bell Laboratories [Murray Hill, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Bell Laboratories.
Speaker 2: The summers at Bell Laboratories, 'cause at the time, they had their own semi-conductor processes, and they were housed at the facility, the laboratory in New Jersey and where I interned that summer, that particular summer.  As a matter of fact, the transistor was invented at Bell Laboratories.  And then the guys at Intel [Corporation, Santa Clara, California] took it and further developed it, and, you know, you had Intel, well, it was Fairchild's [Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation] prior to Intel.  But it was, the guys who, it was the first device, functional device was developed at Bell Laboratories.  And that's what kind of intrigued me.  That's where I began to look at the physics of the electronics.  I've always, as a DJ, I'm at the other, higher end of the food chain, at the high end of the food chain cause you're at the application and user base.  Even today, they're using laptops, but as far as--I always wanted to know, how does the sound gets generated (laughter), you know.  What is that process?  And I know it's over an electrical signal, but this, you know, what transpires, what is the scientific process that takes place to convert an electrical signal into an audio signal, cause you think of it in terms of the, at the physical level.  I always knew that, the fundamental level that, energy is never, neither created nor destroyed, the first laws of physics.  It's always transformed from one form to another.  So even, and everything that we do today and the devices, a lot of the wireless devices, these iPads, I mean it's made possible because if you think about it, we're just moving--what is information?  Information is really energy that is transformed.  Just think about it.  It goes from the laptop to the server or from the server, when you're doing a search, from the server to the laptop.  So at the server, on the processor, when it goes, retrieves from the file system, the information from the file system, it's ones and zeros.  So at one level, it's ones and zeros.  It's not even energy.  It's just stored, actually, it's stored.  It reads a memory location and whether it's stored, uses magnetism to store that memory location to represent a one or a zero or it uses capacitants which is a means of storage, where the presence or absence of charge represents a one or a zero.  But then to pull that information off, and to get it to the iPad, it has to, what has to transpire?  You have to first interpret that information, the charge, and determine whether it's a one or a zero.  Then you have to send it across a wire, from the server, it goes through a wire to the base station.  Like I said, it reaches the base, so it's electrical or it could be optical.  So there's another transformation, okay.  It's either electrical or optical when it's transferred across a wire.  Then it gets to the tower.  It has to go from, actually, by the time it reaches the tower, it's electrical.  Now, when it leaves the tower, it's electro-magnetic.  It's an RF [radio frequency] signal, and when it gets, reaches your iPad, it gets converted back from the electro-magnetic signal to an electrical signal to, and then translated back to a charge where it gets displayed on, where that charge is represented as a bit on your display.  So the way those bits are displayed, how, which bits are on, which bits are on, which pixels, really are on and which pixels are on, on your display, you'll see the work.  So that's the process.  It's a continual process, a transforming process.  And that is what I always wanted to understand, is how to, you know, how to do that, and there's a, you know, it's just physics, man, and it's just beautiful though cause once you see and know how to pull that all together.  So, and that was my motivation, the pursuit of, and that's always been my drive, even to this day.  That hasn't waned.  So I just know how to, I just have a much clearer picture of how to, I know how to do that.
Story_ID: 30851
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were one of the few DJ's that were concerned about, I guess, at that time (laughter), how the signal goes from the--you know, I think a lot of times people think about it, but they don't pursue it.  So you probably--
Speaker 2: No, I've always thought about this, even as a little boy.  That's never stopped.  I've always thought, and I used to think I was crazy, but I've always thought--I used to see things, ones and zero--I see ones and zeros.  So, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what do you mean you see ones and zeros?
Speaker 2: I process information, and this is one thing I've always, I've known as a fact.  I process information at such an incredible rate, I can take in and interpret, so just like a computer does and interpret and make it plain.  That's what I can do, that's what I do very well, very well.  And I don't know if it's--I think it's a gift.  It's a gift.  It's a blessing, but I can process, which is why I can work on different levels.  If, see within engineering, there's several layers.  You know, there's the highest, you know, in this food chain.  So there are some folks who are at the high end, who are at the application end.  These are folks who develop apps [applications] for the iPad, you know, nice fancy apps, if you press a button on your iPad, it's gonna, you know, perform some sort of transaction and come back with something for you.  And then where they're not concerned with the processes or infrastructure that's required, that have to take place to, for that to happen, to implement it.  So this, whereas, at the lowest possible level is the physical level, at the electron level and it's a physics level.  So in, we have a field is broken down, it's comprised of many gradations of these layers that exist between this high level and the physics level.  There's some, so we have some folks who were only, they--there's an entry point for everyone.  So you have some folks who can, who are just, operate at the physics level, and they can't see the tree from the forest and visa versa.  There are very few people who can see the continuum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's where my background at [University of California] Berkley comes into play.

Speaker 1: Okay, now tell us about how you ended up at U-C Berkley [University of California, Berkeley], the work you were doing at Pratt Institute [New York, New York].  You must have made good grades, I would assume?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I had excellent grades.  I went to Berkley.  I had a fellowship from AT&T [AT&T Bell Laboratories], had a scholarship from AT&T.  They covered my undergrad.  And my mentors told me to go to Berkley and work with one particular--I as in a group at, I think it was the year before.  I actually finished and was working, I worked a semester while I pledged a fraternity because I didn't wanna pledge while I was in school because I didn't want it to impact, affect my grades.  So I went to work right after graduating, I finished undergrad and I pledged and worked for, I worked at Bell Laboratories.  They told me to go to Berkley--but I already knew I was, where I was going to grad school.  But they told me to apply to go to Berkley to work for [Robert] "Bob" [W.] Brodersen 'cause the group I was working with at the time was a speech, speech processing, (unclear) group.  They dealt with speech encoders and decoders that were critical parts of these.  When you call into these call centers, you have these automated, you know, you had the speech to text processors, speech recognition kinds of chips.  So for ATM's [automated teller machines] and different types of transactions.  So they developed a lot of the speech recognition chips.  And the person at Berkley, whom they told me to work, go there to work with, was the tops in this field.  So I applied to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Berkley [University of California, Berkeley] and Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California] for graduate school.  I went down to visit the school before I made a decision.  I knew at Berkley, I mean when I went to visit MIT first, and the person at MIT was Alan V. Oppenheim who's a signal processing guy.  He's more of a, he's more of--he's not a theorist.  I mean he's a theorist.  He's a pure theorist.  So [cough], excuse me, he does not build systems and things.  I like to touch things.  I like to close the gap between the theory and the practical.
Story_ID: 30853
Speaker 1: Now, at Pratt [Institute, New York, New York] other than--was there a mentor at Pratt that helped you or just did it all mostly come from Bell Laboratories [Murray Hill, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Bell Laboratories.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Bell Laboratories, where I saw systems being built, where I saw actual applications of bridging the gaps between the theory and the practical, okay.  I saw numerous, I've observed first hand, numerous examples of how this is done, by the physicists, by the Jim West, by the, all these mentors, Jim West, by the Jim Mitchells and so forth, the predecessor, my predecessor, HistoryMaker predecessors.  I've seen them do this.  The Shirley Jacksons, I've seen them do this.  So--
Speaker 1: Now, what, I mean at this point, and before you go out to U-C Berkley [University of California, Berkeley], had you received any encouragement from your uncles?
Speaker 2: That's an excellent question.  My uncle at the time, two uncles, yeah, my uncles were very supportive throughout.  My dad [Thomas E. Kornegay, Sr.] had passed away, and they were more, became more supportive of me.
Speaker 1: So your dad has passed--
Speaker 2: My dad passed, yeah.
Speaker 1: --while you were at Pratt?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  That's why I was working cause I had to help out at home.  So, and I did, you know, I recall having a conversation with my dad just prior to his death.  I had told him I had offers from--I hadn't told him I was going to grad school yet.  But I had offers.  I interviewed, in industry, I had a couple of offers from industry as an engineer for thirty-two thousand [dollars].  I was gonna go to work for IBM [International Business Machines] Federal Assistance Division.  I had an offer from the police department, New York City PD [Police Department], New York City Fire Department, New York City Transit.  I told all the tests (unclear).  And I had all of these job, I had five offers.  I said, "dad, I'm going to graduate school.  I'm going to California Berkley for graduate school." "He said, why?  Why are you gonna do that boy (laughter)? " I said, "this is something I wanna do."  He said, "well, how you gonna pay for it?"  "I said, dad, don't worry about it.  I've got it covered.  I've got a, AT&T [AT&T Bell Laboratories] is gonna.  I'll get a free ride."  He said," oh." And I said, "I'll be fine."  So, he passed on a couple of days later, yeah.  But anyways, my uncles, at that time, my uncles became more, you know, active and supportive.  As a matter of fact, I stayed with my Uncle Bob who was a software engineer.  He worked for Bell Laboratories.  He was the first black software engineer.  So he was one of the few.  So he worked at one of the sites, and as a matter of fact, during one of the summers, I stayed with him while I was working (sneeze), excuse me, at AT&T.  And Uncle Wade who was the Berkley graduate, he would always come visit me while I was at Berkley, and just, he knew just to check in on me, to see how I'm doing.  And it was just, it meant so much to me just seeing his face because I knew he had been to Berkley.  If he did it, I said, it's a breeze.  That all.  That played a, it also played a big role in my decision for going to Berkley.
Story_ID: 30854
Speaker 1: All right, okay, U-C Berkley [University of California, Berkeley].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Here we are.  We finally there, 1985.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, so I went there to work or how did I wind up at U-C Berkley.  Well, when I was visiting the three schools trying to decide between who--well, trying to decide where to go, I visited MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], met with--I made appointments to meet with certain faculty at the three schools.  And I get to, when I reached MIT first, I went to visit them first, I don't know, something at, there was some mix up but Professor [Alan V.] Oppenheim, I didn't get to meet with him.  So I met with one of his graduate students or--anyway, so I didn't get to meet with him.  So, I then went to Berkley, it was my second visit.  And not only did I get to meet with my eventual advisor, I met, I wanted to, I met with everyone whom I wanted to meet with that particular, on that particular trip.  And each one of them, the professors--and these were all big name professors, they all took the time out to meet with me.  And that meant a lot to me.  I just got a warm, fuzzy feeling.  So I didn't even bother to go--I cancelled the Stanford [University, Palo Alto, Califonia] visit.  And I just decided to go to, you know, Berkley.
Speaker 1: So, was the Oppenheimer at Stanford?
Speaker 2: No, Oppenheimer was at MIT.
Speaker 1: MIT, okay.  Was he related the great J. Robert Oppenheimer--
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know if he's related to, I know he's Alan V. Oppenheim who's the, who's very big in signal processing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But anyway, so I was happy to go to Berkley and work with my eventual advisor [Robert] "Bob" Broderson, and I spent six years there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 30855
Speaker 1: And married, I was still engaged, I guess, still dating my girlfriend from Pratt [Institute, New York, New York] at the time.  We were still dating, got engaged somewhere around, after the first year of graduate school.  And we eventually married, at some point, in 1990.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you had an AT&T Bell Laboratories Cooperative Research Fellowship, is that--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right--
Speaker 1: And I was still going back to Bell Laboratories [Murray Hill, New Jersey] every summer.  I worked with the same group, and it was great because each year I went back, I was, you know, the--I had more educational experience as well as working experience.  You know, they would pay me accordingly.  You know, (laughter) so it was pretty nice to see my pay scale increase, and, you know, and I learned very quickly.  I said, oh, gee, your pay scale, there's a strong correlation between education, experience and compensation.  So I said, oh, I'm gonna stay on this Ph.D. track.  So.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, so, yeah, unlike other programs, you went on and earned an M.S. degree, a master's of science there [University of California, Berkeley] in 1990?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Now, did, now, okay, so that's--so you were working too as you were going to school at the same time?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I just went back during the summers.  It was a requirement as part of the fellowship program to go back--it's not a requirement.  It's an option to go back to work there during the summers.  I did that the first two or three summers, but after that, I stayed, the remaining summers I decided to stay at Berkley to finish up my dissertation research.
Story_ID: 30856
Speaker 1: Okay, I know it says here that you participated in the Black Engineering and Science Students Association [BESSA].
Speaker 2: Yes, I was part, as a matter of fact, we were founders as graduate students.  There were several of us there at the time at [University of California] Berkley, and we formed a group with the purpose of--we just wanted to, we realized that, you know, there, a number of us, and this was a pressing issue that there should be more of us.  And we tried to figure out well, how can we get more graduate students to come to Berkley.  So we figured that if we, if we form an organization and approach the administration, the engineering administration as a group, we would get more accomplished, but more importantly we need to have a plan, and we knew that the engineering administration, at least the other, all of the schools within the college did want to, they seemed to be amenable to and open to recruiting or improving the diversity of the student body, although they didn't do that at the faculty level.  But in order to do so at the faculty level, you need a source of African American Ph.D. students.  We knew that.  So we said, well, we--first, let's address, tackle this problem by increasing the pool of Africans.  So we went to the, we formed this Black Engineering and Science Students Association at the University where we would set up, we would bring in--I mean the sole purpose was to provide infrastructure support for, support for the students, existing students but also to assist in the recruitment and retention of African American students.  So we were involved in the recruiting of students.  We would go out with faculty and we'd go to certain conferences to represent the University, to, you know, assist them in their recruiting efforts.  And that had a profound effect in recruiting at, and in improving the diversity of grad--within the graduate ranks at Berkley.  I mean it's, we went from like half a dozen students to like, maybe twenty-five within, within, you know, a period of three to four years.
Story_ID: 30857
Speaker 1: Now, was Dr. [Gibor] Basri there or Dr. Hayes, Tyrone Hayes or (unclear)--
Speaker 2: In--There were none in the engineering department.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know I have a note here that Dr. Bragg, you know, Robert Bragg, was here in (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Bragg was in, yeah--
Speaker 1: And he was a material physicist.
Speaker 2: He was in material science.  Dr. Bragg was there, but he was, at the time, he was at, he was emeritus.  Okay, he was retired.  So,--
Speaker 1: Was, did you have an advisor amongst the black scientists?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: We, no, we didn't interact much with the other departments.  Engineering, we were off into one corner of a little corner of the campus.  Chemistry and physics were down--so we didn't interact much with the sciences.  This was within the engineering.  So this wasn't a campus-wide effort.  This was mostly within the College of Engineering.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.  So we are--
Speaker 2: There were none.  Now, there was, up at the Chemistry, there was, who is it?  Oh?
Speaker 1: Dr. [William] Lester?
Speaker 2: West--yes, Lester, Dr. Will Lester in chemistry who we knew and he advised, but he wasn't a formal advisor.  I mean I would go and talk to Dr. Lester cause he was a close friend of my uncle, Uncle Wade, Dr. Wade Kornegay.  So they know each other.  They go way back.  But, but, no, we tried to, you know, the goal of the organization [Black Engineering and Science Students Association] was to increase the number of students, to try to increase the diversity at the, through the diversity at the faculty level as well.  And at that time, Berkley was not open to that (laughter) until a little later.  But, but there were a fair number of us who've gone on to become, who eventually became faculty members.  There's Gary May, Dr. May here, myself, there's Dr. Valerie Taylor.  She's at, Valerie's at Texas A&M [Texas Agricultural and Mechanical University, College Station, Texas].  She's a department chair there.  I'm just saying from those of us who were from the, I mean there were many others, but I'm just referencing the ones who chose academia.  There're many others who've gone into industry like there's Colin Paris.  He's probably by now senior VP [vice president], executive VP at IBM [International Business Machines].  We all started the same year.  But, yeah, that was a great time, and we had tremendous support from the administration.  So we were the pilot program.  So the other departments followed electrical engineering and computer science.
Story_ID: 30858
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, who was your advisor there at U-C Berkley [University of California, Berkeley]?
Speaker 2: Dr. Robert Brodersen.
Speaker 1: Dr. Robert Brodersen?
Speaker 2: He's retired now.  Yeah, Dr. Robert Brodersen.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have a good relationship with him, as your advisor?
Speaker 2: I didn't even know what he thought of me until graduation (laughter).  We had an interesting--I was his first black student.  So, I don't know what he thought of me.  I just did my work, and so we have a, my wife at the time throws me a graduation party, and my advisor gets up and makes a speech, and he says all these great things about me.  And I'm sitting there with my chin on the ground like, gee, it would have been nice to hear that stuff, you know, during (laughter), not (laughter)--I was scratching my head trying to figure out what does this dude think about me, you know.  So, anyways, we didn't have that--but now he's, I mean even then I didn't rely on my advisor for anything even as I was going through the academic ranks.  I didn't depend on him for anything.  I didn't ask him for anything because that whole experience taught me that, I mean when I left Berkley, I knew there wasn't anything I couldn't do.  (Laughter) I said I did this.  There wasn't anything I could not accomplish.  I had, I could do anything that I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Was it because you had no help doing it at Berkley or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That probably had a lot do with it.  And that's how I am with my own students.  I don't, cause no one's gonna spoon feed you.  No--because when you get there at Berkley, you, I mean the stigmas and things still existed then as you're always doubted, questioned, looked at, stared at, you know, comments about, oh, the snide remarks and racists remarks about, you know, not belonging or where is your, you know, where are your gang signs, and, you know, you're from the ghetto.  I mean people-- all these assumptions.  They don't know anything about your background and character, but they make all these assumptions like you don't belong.  And so, you know, you have to be twice as, three or four times better than the person.  And that's how I knew, all of my--my advisor had twenty-five, thirty graduate students.  He's probably the most successful, one of the most successful faculty if you use that as a measure.  I mean he brought in millions of dollars per year in research.  He ran a huge research program.  And, but yet, there were certain students that received, you know, who were put on the pet projects and all that.  I came up with my own project.  I guided my own progress and, and I thanked him a lot.  I said, well, had it not been for you (laughter), and, but I didn't realize at the time, it was preparing me for a career in academia for that, and knowing that I had to do it.  I was on my own.  And that I could do it on my own.  I didn't need his [Dr. Robert Brodersen] help for anything.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went on to earn your Ph.D. in '92 [1992], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 30859
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was your dissertation?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You're asking me?  That was years ago.  Geez, I think I have a copy of it.
Speaker 1: If you could break it down into, in layman's terms for us, what were you really working on then?
Speaker 2: Actually, it's similar to what I did.  I built a system.  And it's similar to that theme I talked about.  It was a, I was interested in, with digital systems, one of the problems was that you wanted, you had to verify the functionality of the systems, of the design.  And there are certain techniques, we call testing, to verify the functionality.  Now, there're two ways.  You can do perform testing at several levels.  You can perform testing on the actual physical circuit, you can add with a minimal expense or cost in performance, you can add circuits or devices to the circuits that enhance the testability of the circuit so that you can verify its functionality.  And I developed techniques and procedures for automating that process for making our systems that we build, our digital systems within the group that we build, more testable, easily testable.  So, testing is just a matter of you wanna have some observation points where you can observe the value at a particular--of a digital node.  You just wanna have the ability to see a one or a zero.  Well, you know you expect a value at that node.  So let's say you have a digital circuit and at certain points you know, certain outputs of the circuit, you know, if it's designed correctly, you expect that output, the value at that node to be a one. So testing, you wanna, performs two--and I'm trying to, with testing, you have two things you wanna do with testing.  You wanna observe and you wanna control.  And to be able to have the ability to control that node so you can force a known value onto it so you can then observe that value.  So if you can force it to a known value, you can--and when you force it to a known value and you observe it to be a different value, you know that there's something wrong with that part of the circuit.  So, and that's what testing is.  So I've automated that process.  So I've taken a regular digital circuit, divvied it up and look at where the best places to, and optimize it to determine where's the best place to observe, best point of, vantage point to observe to determine if that portion of the circuit is functional.  So you wanna be able to do this when you power.  Before you power on a system, the first thing you wanna do is run it through a self test.  So, I automated the whole process.  I wrote CAD [computer aided design] software that automatically determines where these, where to place these control of observation points.  Where to, what's the best place to, you know, control?  What's the easiest place to control, and what is the best place to observe that will give us the most kind of, tell us most about the health status of the circuit.  So I've actually integrated all that on my own, and they could use that down the road.  It's part of our, it's imbedded in our CAD system so that any future digital chips that we build, it's automatically inserted and incorporated into the chip where the designer doesn't have to worry about it.  So I've automated that process so that all of our chips--and also, automatically generated the test code.  So not only does it automatically insert, makes the chips more testable, it also generates the test codes that you can use for testing it during the, in parallel, during the design process.  So I did, that was part of my thesis.  That was my thesis.  So I did that, and as a matter of fact, the, my committee, my defense committee had four members of my defense committee including my advisor.  Each, the other three committee members all became dean of the College of Engineering.  So these were, they eventually became dean.  At the time I chose them, I did not know.  They all were, became members of the National Academy of Engineering, all four of them, so, eventual members.  I, but at the time, I didn't, when I chose them, I did not know.  I just chose the best possible folks (laughter), and, but I didn't know that they would become that.  My advisor [Dr. Robert Brodersen] was more entrepreneurial, so he didn't wanna do the administrative things.  But the other three were more administrative, you know.  So the last one being, became the provost at [University of California] Berkeley.  So I had a pretty good sense for picking folks who were good advisors and mentors, from--and that came from my AT&T [Bell Laboratories] experience.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the device you built for testing, is that in use now or is--was it in use for a while?
Speaker 2: It was in use for a while, yeah, it was in use for a while cause it was used by the, by other mem--future members of the, you know, future students, they used it for a while until, you know, it became a little obsolete.  But it was in use for a while.
Story_ID: 30860
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so after you earned your Ph.D., now you went to work for IBM [International Business Machines]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean right away?
Speaker 2: Yes, let me tell you what happened (laughter).  I'll tell you what happened.  It's a great story.  The plan was, my wife, at the time, we were supposed to, after graduation, we were supposed to take a year or two, travel and what have you.  But I think six months, let's see, prior to--well, we were married.  She told me she was pregnant with our first son.  So within six months, I was out of graduate school.  So I went and told my advisor [Dr. Robert Brodersen], I said, it's time for me to graduate.  I've done enough work, and I knew I did enough work.  Otherwise, I would have stayed, I could have easily stayed in graduate school another year or two cause I was just enjoying it.  But I was in no rush, and so within six months, I--well, I started, well, I immediately started to interview but I graduate, I finish within six months of her telling me she was pregnant.  That was my motivation (laughter).  So, and I went to IBM.  There were two places I was gonna go to work.  I had, actually, I interviewed at--I had several, about five or six university offers at the time, Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] being one of them, U-C, San Diego [University of California, San Diego], Purdue [Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana], Purdue, Columbia [University, New York, New York], and it was one other.  I forget.  But I had these university offers, and I had IBM and Bell Laboratories [Murray Hill, New Jersey].  I didn't wanna see myself as an assistant professor with a new family, just a lot of pressure in a different state.  So I said I had to be close to home with a son coming on board.  The difference was then the benefits, difference between IBM and AT&T [Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, New Jersey] were in the benefits.  AT&T [Bell Laboratories] benefits kick in six months after I start working.  IBM benefits kick in (laughter), day one.  The salaries were identical.  They went back and forth competing for me.  The salaries and everything were identical but the difference was in the benefits.  And so that's how I chose IBM.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you're gonna be working at the Yorktown Heights Center.
Speaker 2: The Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown [Yorktown Heights, New York].
Speaker 1: Now, Thomas J. Watson, the recent--the computer that challenged the 'Jeopardy' people--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --built by IBM was named Watson.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Was it named for Thomas J. Watson?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, (unclear)
Speaker 2: So. T. J. Watson probably was the largest research, second to--actually, it was the largest at the time because that was two years prior--two years later, AT&T divested, and they broke up the labs and all that stuff.  So, but, yeah, I went to IBM.
Speaker 1: Now, did you know Louis [V.] Gerstner [Jr.].  I know he's a (unclear) and the whole thing--
Speaker 2: Oh, Lou, I didn't know Gerstner.  I knew [Nicholas] "Nick" [M.] Donofrio, his, who was his number two guy, senior executive VP [vice president].  I had a very good relationship with him.  As a matter of fact, I was one of--at the time I joined IBM, they had three thousand research staff members at their Ford Laboratories, across the world in Zurich [Switzerland], between Zurich, Japan, Yorktown Heights [New York] and Almaden, California.  Four of the three thousand were African American.  Only four, and this was in 1992.  Only four.  And actually, when I graduated from [University of Califoria] Berkley, I was one of two national, nation-wide to graduate with a Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer science.  One of two, okay.  And this was in 1992.  And at Berkley, at Berkley, I was the second African American in 1992.  So.
Speaker 1: Now, well, yeah, we would have thought there'd been more progress by then.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so at IBM--what did you work on at IBM?
Speaker 2: At IBM, I was more of a corporate troubleshooter for their, for their various system platforms.  So it's kind of related to my thesis work where I would go in and figure out where they were having problems with some of their failures, and I would come in troubleshoot to help them identify why they were having, their yields were down.  And then I would offer solutions on how to improve the yields.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And this had a lot to do with their chips.  So I was more of a corporate troubleshooter.  And the other thing too is, I knew about the communications industry with all the years I've interned at AT&T [Bell Laboratories].  I learned a lot about the communications industry.  I wanted to learn about the computer industry, and that's another reason why I went to IBM.  So as a corporate trouble shooter, I would gain, I gained a lot of exposure, immediate exposure and deep exposure to the vast part of their, cause I dealt with a lot of their computer manufacturing lines.
Story_ID: 30861
Speaker 1: Alright.  It says here in '95 [1995], you published a conference paper called 'Integrated Test Solutions and Test Economics for Multichip Modules.'
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 1995.
Speaker 1: Okay, is that a continuation of your--
Speaker 2: That's a continuation of my thesis work, along the lines of, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, also in '95 [1995], you received a grant funded from the National Science Foundation [NSF] to look at temperature dependent parameters for digital circuit design considerations using SiC [silicon carbide] MOSFET technology.
Speaker 2: Oh, by that time I was, '94 [1994], from '92 [1992] to '94 [1994] I worked at IBM [International Business Machines, Armonk, New York].  IBM was about to go through the divested, there was a lot of discussion.  They were thinking about divesting.  So there was this mass exodus from the laboratory.  So I thought it was a good time to, I've always wanted to go into academe so I thought it was a good time to leave.  So I left there, looked at several schools, was courted by several, and I wound up at Purdue University [West Lafayette, Indiana].  So--
Speaker 1: Now, wait a minute, now.  You're at Purdue--now, were you at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in '97 [1997]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so but--
Speaker 2: So, but this is '95 [1995].
Speaker 1: '95 [1995] you went to Purdue?
Speaker 2: I was at Purdue from ninety, yeah, ninety--I was at Purdue from '94 [1994] to '97 [1997].
Speaker 1: Okay.  I missed Purdue.  Okay, oh, yeah, yeah, okay, I'm sorry.  Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Okay, so I was at Purdue, and while I was there, I wanted to use that opportunity because just to backtrack a little bit, what I studied at [University of California] Berkley, in terms of courses, I studied--there are three main areas that I focused on, device physics, circuits and systems.  So that allowed me to deal with this whole spectrum of going from devices to applications.  So that's what I studied at Berkley, I gained that background.  And everything I've done and in all the work that I've done, I've always done--I wanted to learn while I was at IBM, I focused on system size, IBM and even at Bell Laboratories [Murray Hill, New Jersey], I learned a lot.  But I wanted to go deeper and shallower, down to the physical levels.  But I didn't have that background until I went to Berkley, so I took a lot of courses from some of the great solid-state physicists.  So and that kind of gave me the foundation for my--and for a successful professional career.  So when I went to, so when I was at, while at--
Speaker 1: Purdue?
Speaker 2: --Purdue, I--and it makes it seem like I was, I'm like a chameleon.  I could move around in different areas.  That's because I have a funda--because of my foundation in physics and, in physics and circuits and systems, I can move around like that.  I can work in just about any area because I can make that connection.  And by the way, at Berkley, I minored in statistics.  So I have a minor in Statistics.  I stayed with the Math, and that's how I was able to--
Story_ID: 30862
Speaker 1: so when I went to Purdue [University, West Lafayette, Indiana], I worked on the, most of the work I did initially in the project that you referenced there with the National Science Foundation [NSF], I kind of--that was a physics problem.  They had a new semi-conductor material, okay.  I always knew how to design circuits, but this was a new semi-conductor material, had same characteristics as a base semi-conductor as silicon, which is the most pervasive semi-conductor technology or platform.  So silicon carbide is similar, has some different properties, but it's not as widely used, wide spread or as well know, but it's a new semi-conductor material, has some properties like.  So I said, well, gee, it has similar properties.  You can probably build some useful circuits, and if you can build circuits using this material system and it's very much like--if you can apply some of the same semi-conductor processes, fabrication techniques to build circuits using this, you can then exploit some of the salient features that this silicon carbide has to bear which is high temperature, high pressure.  It can withstand high temperatures and high pressures, for example, and it's much stronger than silicon.  So you can build, you can exploit that for certain types of applications, such as, let's say, where it's very hot--situations or applications where it's very hot, like well logging.  As you dig deep down in the well, it gets pretty hot.  You need electronics to sort of give you a sense as to where you are, what the pressure is, what the temperature is.  And these electronics are sitting on a drill bit, but if you do that using conventional silicon electronics, it can't withstand the heat.  It's can't, the environment's too harsh for it.  But with silicon carbide, if you can imbed this into the drill bit, you can relax--you also have to cool the silicon whereas silicon carbide, you don't have to cool it, and it can withstand it.  So you can, if you can build useful circuits using this, then you can support these kinds of applications or let's say, for example, you have electronics embedded on the piston head.  It gets pretty hot, the piston head.  You wanna be able to get more accurate readings on the pressure, stress of the piston heads, the pressure reading so you can make a more fuel, you know, make your engine more fuel efficient.  Now, you can't put silicon electronics anywhere near the engine cause it's just too hot.  But you may be able to take the silicon carbide circuit and put it right there on the piston head, and then you could telemeter the information to a black box.  Most of the electronics that's for the engine sits in a black box that sits under your car seat.  You have cabling that adds to the weight of the car and so forth, let's say this co-locate the electronics into, in this natural environment.  So silicon carbide would enable these kinds of applications because it can, but you have to build, you have to know how to build these circuits to realize these functions that you want, that you envision for this application.  That hasn't been done.  So I was, a lot of the work, that was able to--the funding for that work enabled me to do some of that, to do some of that work.
Speaker 2: With the National Science Foundation grant?
Speaker 1: Yes, oh, yeah.
Story_ID: 30863
Speaker 1: All right, so in, now, in '96 [1996], you win the National Science Foundation Career Award.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you seem kind of young to win a career award (laughter), cause you're thirty-seven years old.  And it says, it's the National Science Foundation's [NSF] highest honor for new faculty and fosters integration of research and education.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So that's quite an honor.  Were you the first black recipient of that award or?
Speaker 2: Oh, not the first black, no.  There've been others.  No, I was the first one at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York].  I won that when I was at Cornell.
Speaker 1: Did you, okay?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was probably the, actually, the first one at Cornell to win it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is not--
Speaker 2: I was the first, you know what--
Speaker 1: Do I have the date wrong?
Speaker 2: I moved from, yeah, that was later on.  That was in 1996.  I left Purdue [University, West Lafayette, Indiana] and mind you, it started with some of the work I initiated at Purdue.  And, but I continued on at, at Cornell.  And with a stop in between at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] (laughter).  So most of the work has been, I've been continuing that work.  So I was at Purdue for three years, left there.  I didn't like the Midwest.  I had some very unpleasant experiences there.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was one?
Speaker 2: Okay, I'll tell you.  First day we moved in, there was a Klan [Ku Klux Klan] rally downtown.  And I'm from New York, and no one told me about this stuff when I, of course, I didn't have no one like, no other faculty like me and like to talk about what's it like living in, you know.  The first day, there's a Klan rally.  Now, that--I was in shock.  I said, you know, you used to see it, you know, on TV or whatever, but I never realized.  But that was the environment we were in.  And we were the first that, it was just amazing.  We were the first to build a home in a quote, unquote "developed", you know, this developed area on the side of town where we're not supposed to be, but we were the first to build a house in that area.  It was crazy.  We went through the whole mortgage thing.  It was ridiculous.  So we decided.  I just left the house and everything.  It just got so unbearable, we left.  And this was in nineteen ninety--and not so much for me because I wasn't out in the community.  My wife, at the time, was out in the community.  And she experienced a lot of this nonsense.  So I said, enough.  At that time our second son [Justin Kornegay] was born, and so I said, you know, we just upped and left.  There was one, there was a series of things, events that just occurred that I said, this is enough.
Speaker 1: I was watching 'Sports Center' the other night and Spike Lee is telling Reggie Miller, he says, you ought to let New York win cause Indiana is the home of the Ku Klux Klan (laughter).  That's exactly what he said.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  It's true.  I'm like, I didn't realize that.  But anyway, it was an experience.
Speaker 1: West Lafayette [Indiana], there are some black--I know Ralph Crowder is in black studies there, and there for many, many years.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but there's Lafayette [Indiana] and there's West Lafayette and there's West--West Lafayette is a smaller portion of Lafayette.  There's only, Lafayette maybe has a population of a hundred thousand at max--
Speaker 1: Maybe.
Speaker 2: --and sixty thousand of that population is Purdue.  The other forty thousand is due to Caterpillar [Inc.].  There's a Caterpillar plant and there're a couple other plants down there.  But this is the kind of mentality of the populous that reside there.  So it's kind of interesting.
Story_ID: 30864
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went on to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: I went on to MIT.  I thought about, you know, I was checking it out for a year.  I thought about that, and then I decided, because my mother-in-law lived there, I said, no, I'm not going to MIT (laughter), no, not my mother-in-law.  It, I just didn't like the environment there.  It was just too, it was not one that was conducive to family, you know, support and so forth--
Speaker 1: I know somebody described it as sort of a dry environment, very dry environment.  But I don't know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's dry, it's--hey, they don't care about you (laughter).  They don't care about you.  They just care about the numbers.  You bring in money, you bring in, you know, you publish.  That's it.
Speaker 1: MIT was the home of Norbert Wiener that came up with the--
Speaker 2: Oh, it was a great school, great, a lot of great, I mean smart people.  It's a great environment, I mean great people, but it's not a family-friendly environment, at least at the time I was there I didn't perceive that to be.
Speaker 1: So how long did you stay at MIT?
Speaker 2: One year.
Speaker 1: Just one year.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) One year.  Then I wound up at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York]--
Speaker 1: This is in Ithaca, New York.
Speaker 2: Ithaca, New York.
Speaker 1: It's supposed to be one of the better towns in the United States.
Speaker 2: It's a great town, interesting town.  Maybe we'll have a discussion offline, but it's an interesting town (laughter).  It is cold.  I mean the sun shines a third of the year up there, so that was one of the other things that I had to get used to that I don't miss.  The snow and the fact that it's only sunny a third of the year.  Cornell, itself, great institution.  Culturally, again, I was there, when I went there, I was virtually the, you know, a trailblazer, like the first to do this.  You know, it was just me.  First one, I was the first African American to receive tenure the College of Engineering, the first.  This was back in 1999.  Now, but again, I did this, had to do it all on my own without support.  There was no sense of collegiality, none.  It felt like it was, but my experience, my graduate school experience helped to prepare me for that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it would be nice to have--it would have been nice to have some collegial support.  And that's always been the case.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this, you started Cornell in '97 [1997]--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --right.  And now, so what was--so you were there for how long?
Speaker 2: Eight years.
Speaker 1: Eight years, okay.  That's good.
Speaker 2: I did a lot of work in that eight, those eight years.
Story_ID: 30865
Speaker 1: Well, 2002, you were honored with a Black Engineer of the Year Award by the 'U.S. Black Engineering Magazine.'
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Did you continue your involvement with the black engineering group that you started out in, that you all started at U-C Berkley [University of California, Berkeley]?
Speaker 2: No, no, I was, no, 'cause I was always affiliated, we were always affiliated with the National Society of Black Engineers, and everywhere I went, they had a, you know, a student chapter.  So I was a faculty advisor at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York].  Everywhere I went I was the faculty advisor.  I was the faculty advisor at Purdue [Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana] when I was there.  I was the faculty advisor at Cornell when I was there, for the chapter.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: So that's the other thing of being a black professor at a majority university.  You have so many draws on your, and this is what I mean you have to be so much better than your white counterparts because you have the draw on you, so many different draws.  They don't have these draws.  So they can only focus on, they can only focus on their research.  And so, but we have the draw, have the draw of the, you know, the black students, to serve, you know, the different university committees.  We're drawn in so many different directions.  And these are things in the meantime, if you're on your tenure clock, you're expected to just focus on that.  And my other colleagues don't have those distractions.  But this is not factored into the quote, unquote "tenure decision".  So I was doing all this stuff and some, not only just faculty advisor for the National Society of Black Engineering Students, I also did a student competition.  You know, I had to supervise that group.  I was--
Story_ID: 30866
Speaker 1: And was that the competition, the World Champion--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --where they won the World Championship for the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And that was 2003.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we did that, and I get--the administration didn't get--and that started, that program started.  How did we start it?  I had no resources.  I had started that program with four, four undergraduate students approached me.  But these were not your typical undergraduate students.  (Unclear) We have undergraduate advisees, we're assigned--that's part of the, you know, of one of our responsibilities at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York], so we're assigned undergraduate advisees.  I had four of them who happened to be the Cornell presidential research fellows, Cornell presidential scholars.  These happened to be the very best, the top undergraduate students who had come to Cornell.  I had four of them.  They were all in engineering.  They approached me because I was their advisor and said, could you help us.  Like, meanwhile, I have, I'm running a successful, my research group, the largest research group in the department if not the college.  I had seventeen Ph.D. students I'm supervising.  So, I'm trying to run into, trying to, you know, you know, they approached, and I'm saying, oh, my God.  What am I gonna do?  We need, these guys need resources.  They need funding, they need a lab.  They need lab space.  And how are we gonna do it?  I don't know anything about submarines.  I knew I was a good engineer.  Submarines is a system so what I did was, I took one of my graduate students.  I said, yeah, I told 'em, yeah, I'd help them.  And I took one of my top graduate students who wasn't undergrad at Cornell.  He was just a fresh, he was a first-year grad student, undergrad, yeah, he did his undergrad--
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Sean Welsh. Sean, I assigned him, I put him on the team.  So I had a couple of grad students from each of the representative departments so we had students from mechanical.  We had students from electrical, students from computer science.  So by the time we finished, we had about twenty-five to thirty students, and on the team.  We needed a space and we needed money.  So the first person I went to--see, this is where my New York comes in and my experience from the teaching and stuff.  I had this pyramid scheme, devised this pyramid scheme to get funding from, you know, this was my thinking.  I said, you know what, let me go to the--I went to provost first, knowing that if the provost was on board, it would be easy to get each of the representative departments on board and the dean.  So I get the provost on board.  So I already had a promise from the provost of thirty thousand dollars every year.  So with that in mind, I went to each of the representative departments, mechanical, electrical and computer science.  I said, well, all I'm asking for is just 5K [five thousand dollars] from each of you.  I said if you guys give me 5K, the dean has promised to (laughter), to match your, each, the total of your contributions.  So I had 5K from each of the departments, 15K [fifteen thousand dollars] from the dean and 30K [thirty thousand dollars] from the provost, and that's how I got funded.  So I went to my department head and I said, well, we need space.  And it just so happened it was perfect timing.  They were clearing out some, some space became available.  So we got a little, he said, well, all I can give is a little space.  That's fine.  So we had to figure out where we were gonna test the submarine, do the testing.  We would do the testing, and the kids would--one of the kids worked at the, we had an Olympic-sized swimming pool.  So one of the kids worked at the pool at night.  So they had access to the pool (laughter).  So anyways, so this went on for about two years.  The first year of the competition was a learning experience.  It was in Florida.  We competed against every, now, Cornell--Ithaca [New York] is land-locked.  We competed against a school who had traditional oceanography engineering programs, MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. They got Woods Hole [Oceanographic Institution, Woods Hole, Massachusetts]. U, Rhode, University of Rhode Island [Kingston, Rhode Island], University of Miami [Miami, Florida], okay.  You had UC San Diego [University of California, San Diego].  Okay, they have, everyone has their own ocean, a full-fledged.  All we had at Cornell is just good engineers.  So the first year we went.  It was a little embarrassing.  They lost their submarine, you know, so--
Speaker 1: They lost it.
Story_ID: 30867
Speaker 1: Yeah, MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], let me tell you, the competition is, was founded by the Office of Naval Research.  Now, each branch of the military had these and this is why they had the drones over in, right now.  So the Air Force had their ones with autonomous air vehicles.  So, and MIT always won it.  And their team was primarily graduate students, all graduate students from the Oceanography from Woods Hole [Oceanographic Institute, Woods Hole, Massachusetts].  This is what they did for a living.  So anyways, the third year, the third year.  This was the third year, year in the program.  So we did good.  The second year, we came in second and the third year--it was the third or fourth year--by the fourth year, by the time these kids were seniors the fourth year, it was in San Diego [California] at one of the Navy test centers.  There's a big test center in La Jolla [California].  And I had arranged to--I was gonna be out there anyways, and this was a great weekend because I had just ran into, about a week or so prior, Irwin Jacobs, CEO, Dr. Irwin Jacobs, CEO of Qualcomm was visiting on campus, and he came to see my--they asked me to meet with him.  I met him on campus, and he came and spent some time with me and my students.  And he left me a card, you know, gave me a card and said if I'm ever in San Diego, just give him a call.  So it just so happens that during that period, I think I had, yeah, I had seventeen grad students and I had some funding issue.  I think it was during the, one of the crises in Iraq, and I had some DOD [Department of Defense] funding.  So the first thing they do is pull the DOD funding from (laughter), government research, so to support the war campaign.  I think it was the Iraq campaign back then.  So I lost funding, and I had these students.  So I went to my department head and asked him, and told him the situation.  I said, well, can the, and asked him, if the department can float me a loan until I get some funding.  You know what happened?  He told me to disband my research group.  That's what he told me.  This is one of the guys--and that's the worst thing you can have is the very insecure, white male as a boss.  So I, he wanted me to disband my group and tell my students to go, and basically start over.  And I told him, I said, thanks, but I don't need that, I don't need your--that kind of help.  So I gave Irwin Jacobs a call, remembered he gave me his card.  I said, I told him I'd like to come see him.  And I prepared a pitch to him.  And that weekend, and I had my two sons with me.  I was gonna take them to Lego Land [Carlsbad, California] down in, you know, so it's vacation.  And they would always come to, attend or accompany me to the competitions.  And they enjoyed it cause they would stay (unclear) the submarine and so forth.  But we had the competition that weekend as well, so it was a good trip.  So that, I arrived that Thursday evening and had an appointment, scheduled to meet with Irwin Jacobs that Friday morning.  It was before he, himself, and his executive staff, the CEO and the executive staff.  I gave my pitch.  So meanwhile, the competition started that Friday morning, and we, the kids did well the first day.  They did well the following day, and so I was going back and forth, bouncing back and forth, take my suit off, I come from a meeting with Jacobs that morning, and I rushed back to the hotel cause I had a sitter at the hotel with the boys.  And I'd take them to Lego Land.  We leave Lego Land or we'd go to the San Diego Zoo, come back, and we'd go to, we'd go to the competition.  And so all this, I was going back and forth the whole weekend.  That day, I get a call from, later that Friday, I get a call from Irwin's secretary.  She said, Dr. Jacobs has an envelope here for you.  Okay, it was a check for four hundred thousand dollars to support my research group.  That same day, this was the same week, that same weekend, we won, my students won the competition.  And by the way, we got a check from the, for winning that competition.  Now, this competition, these submarines have, you have to complete some kind of mission, which is a series of tasks to retrieve something or to identify something or to hit a target.  And it has to do so unassisted so without any human invention.  It has to do so autonomously.
Speaker 2: With no remote control or any of that?
Speaker 1: No, no, no. It's got--
Speaker 2: It's got a pre-program--
Speaker 1: No, no, no, artificial intelligence.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's has to sense its environment and figure it out on its own.
Speaker 2: Okay, so it's essentially programmed to program itself to do--
Speaker 1: Well, it has to learn.  So what you do, it has to identify.  There's, let's say it has some markers to tell it, okay, where it's supposed to go and then it has some, it has a trail it's supposed to follow, and then it has some markers to identify certain things.  Is this a target or is this a, is this a friend or is it a foe?  It has to figure it out, okay.  And then it has to figure out, okay, it has to go on a search thing to find the next target.  Now, it has to do so, depending on whatever strategy you use, but it's not pre-programmed.  It is, it has to learn--in a sense it is pre-programmed.  It has to learn as it goes along, but it has to learn very fast.  So it's an artificial intelligence.  So it has to adapt its knowledge base in real time.  So if it, so, for example, during its search, while it's searching for a target, it starts in a certain area, and if it doesn't see anything, it has to back, you know, you have to remember that you've been there, but you have to go to the next best guess of a location.  So you--or you can do it just randomly, do a random search or you can do it, you know, it depends on how you program it to do it now.
Story_ID: 30868
Speaker 1: At any rate, well, it--okay, so the competition, we're on the last, final--
Speaker 2: The final day, that Sunday, we win the competition.  It was exciting.
Speaker 1: Now, what did your sub do?  What did your sub do?
Speaker 2: Well, this particular competition, if I recall, this was 2003, I believe.  Yeah, we had to identify certain targets, and then it had to place a marker on one of the targets.  It had to drop it exactly on, and you get points for, you get points for completing certain portions of the competition.  But the submarine had, in its final run, it had a flawless run.  I mean it was just phenomenal.  I mean it just, it was almost as if--and we had several times, we practiced, you know, because you can build a duplicate of the actual site.  And that's what we did.  You can build a duplicate, and we were testing it in the pool at night (laughter), it was funny, at the hotel.  The kids were out there.  But we built an exact duplicate of the competition's site.  But you really can't get it exactly because the actual site was in this sphere-like structure.  So the dynamics of the environment were very different.  So we use a visual inspection system in a, so the perception is different than in a very rectangular flat kind of, so the--that affected the accuracy of the vision inspection system software.
Speaker 1: And did the little sub use some sort of sonar or something to--
Speaker 2: It used, it had a sonar, yes.  It had a sonar system, yes.  And the sonar system, worked in tandem with the AI [artificial intelligence] system to navigate the sub through this course.  We had to identify these three or four different items, and then it had to drop.  And after it identified, it had to drop, you know, some of those items were targets--some of them were not, had to drop certain items, drop a marker on a target, a specific target.  So there were several targets it had to identify, but only one of them it had to drop the marker on.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: So we completed that task.  You had to do so within, you're given a certain allotment of time to complete the mission, and you get points for various stages.  And they had a flawless run, and they did it, they kicked MIT's butt.  MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] was having some problems.  The other thing too is, that was adopted, I noticed, I think we were the first to introduce a double-hull design because it had more, the particular submarine, this particular design had very stable, had very--was a very stable design cause you need to be stable to, you know, when you're conducting your, you're surveying your, the environment to capture information.  So in the very, I think in the years that followed for a couple of years, MIT--it was very flattering when MIT adopted the, a dual-hull or a double-hull design like ours the year after we won the competition.  As a matter of fact, several of the schools, so (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, was there a cash prize or something for--
Speaker 2: It was about a ten thousand dollar cash prize for that.  So when I went back to my boss, I threw the checks (laughter) on his desk.  I said, this should handle my accounts.  So, and I've always been that way throughout my career when I've done things, when I created, formed my research lab, folks said I couldn't do it or what have you.  I, I--when folks say you can't do, that just inspires me to prove 'em wrong.
Story_ID: 30869
Speaker 1: Now, that same year, it's amazing to me that you, you're featured in a Chicago [Illinois] Museum of Science and Industry exhibit showcasing contributions by an African American in the field of information technology.  So you didn't have to organize that.  You just appeared as one of the featured people?
Speaker 2: Right, yes, sir.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So, 2004 you were named one of the 50 Most Important Blacks in Research Science by 'Spectrum Magazine' and you also received the National Society of Black Engineers Janice Lumpkin Educator of the Year Award.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Two thousand five [2005], you published another important paper, I guess.  I mean it's noted here.  It's--do you remember what the paper was about?
Speaker 2: (Unclear) several papers I published, no, sir, I don't.  There's quite a few papers that I published.  Is there a key word in it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like a code.  It's an IV, coma 10 MW, it says, optical receiver front end.
Speaker 2: Oh, 10 gigabit per second, optical 10 gbs--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --optical front end, optical receiver front end.  Is that for the one where we--was that the student design competition or was that--
Speaker 1: No, this is for, it was presented at a--
Speaker 2: Which conference?  The RBC?
Speaker 1: The I-triple E (IEEE)[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers] Symposium.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'm trying to remember.  Well, if it was optical receiver, front end, that was--we began to move in some different directions and--
Speaker 1: Here's another one on, in 2005, called the 'Jitter Considerations of the Design of a 10 Gigabits--'
Speaker 2: Gigabits per second, yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah, per second, automatic gain control amplifier.
Story_ID: 30870
Speaker 1: Um-hum, yeah, that was--we began to work in the data transport area.  Again, data transport--and that's what I was alluding to earlier where we transform information from one form to another, take, move it from point A to point B.  So this is the beginning of that work.  So this, those--even the paper you referenced prior to that had to deal with sending information across an optical link.  Okay, so, when you're sending a piece of fiber optic cable, the mode of the information, the mode of, the transport mode is light which is the mode that you use to transfer the information is light, across fiber optic cables.  Now, on the other ends, so whether it's at the server--sender or the receiver end, you always transmit over the receiver end, you always have to convert that light back to a, to an electrical signal.  And you have a detector on the receiver side that converts that light into a current.  Now, that, it's a small current.  The challenge is how do you extract ones and zeros from that, make ones and zeros from that small current.  That current, where the current is proportioned to the light intensity.  So you're gonna have this tiny little current, and as the light traverses a long distance, that fiber optic cable could be across the Atlantic Ocean.  And every so often, you have light repeaters, okay, but what happens to the light, it loses, maybe because of misalignment, maybe because, you know, it loses some intensity, that information gets, some of the information may get lost.  So you have to know what to do with that current to extract the full fidelity of that information, the content of that information.  And it's challenging how to do that, but that's what we do.  So in order to do so, you have to understand things at the very physical level before you can bring it, you know, from the photons to the electrons at that level, and that's what happens at the modulator, where those light, the photons of light get converted to electrons.  And now, which those electrons are flowing, representing a current, but still embedded in that current are some ones and zeros, and you still have to extract ones and zeroes from this current.  And that's what we do.  We also do the same thing--we do everything, we do all of the circuits that perform that function, that extract that information, exactly as it should be, as it was intended when you sent it.  Now, when you send information from point A to point B, however, that channel, whether it's a fiber optic link or air interface in a case of wireless devices, that info-- the channel changes the information, alters the information.  So between the transmitter and receiver.  So the receiver's job is to figure out what the channel did with some knowledge of what the transmitter does to, and figure out how to extract the actual information, the correct information.  It either has to figure out by repairing, compensating for whatever losses or corruption or what, cause there's a lot of corruption that takes place.  The signal gets corrupted, but it's how you treat that.  So, and that's what we do.  We're in, right now, we're in data transport, where we're process--we're transforming energy.  Really, data processing is really, at the very fundamental level, is energy transformation, and that's what we do.  That's precisely what we do.  And we do a very good job of it, and a lot of it again falls back on my background, my foundational background in device physics, the circuits that enable it and now, as well as the understanding of the applications that drive the systems.

Speaker 1: So that was when, so what you're seeing is a transformation in my work, as I evolve from the silicon carbide work all the way through to now this, the optical work.  As a matter of fact, yeah, there's a huge--this is the very stuff that creates, this is the foundation of our, the internet, okay, the internet backbone.  That's what this stuff does, it's for.  What, President [Barack] Obama said a few days ago, he said, in order to increase, in order to improve our commerce and create new jobs, we have to increase the speed of the internet.  That's what he said.  That's what we're doing.  We work in that domain, moving information.  The internet is all about information connection, moving it from Point A to Point B.  But today's problems are even bigger because of, the apps [applications] are growing faster than, and that's why he said it [the President], faster than the capacity of the internet. That we can't--there're, server are, server forums are just, you also have, you know, applications like, Myspace, Facebook, Twitter, all this stuff you can do from your iPad.  So, and all that has to go through--it's all about getting information from Point A to Point B.  And the persons who do it most, the quickest and most reliable, at least to the end user, the end user doesn't want his screen to lock up.  The person with an iPad just wants to see, get that information when they do.  They don't want any--without delay.  The person who delivers that.  So that's why you see all of this stuff that's going on today.  But it was interesting that President Obama said a few years, a few weeks ago, a few days ago as a matter of fact, that we must increase the speed of the internet.  And that's kind of where a large part of our work is today.

Speaker 1: Okay, you're still engaged in that kind of research here at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Well, yes, yes, I mean a lot of that work, as a matter of fact, some of that stuff was already done, we did in anticipation of these kinds of issues.  But now, I mean we already have technology that we developed that can solve a lot of today's problems.
Speaker 1: So basically, are you trying to perfect the use of light as the energy source for--
Speaker 2: No, not so much the use of light.  I mean the internet backbone primarily either, a lot of it is light, but they wanna push it, for example, Google had an announcement about that Google City in Kansas City that has, where they're gonna have data links at speeds of a hundred--well, they're gonna have a network backbones at the speed of a hundred gigabits per second, a hundred times faster than the current internet.  That's all fiber optics.  That's all--so you still have, what we focus on is, a couple of different ways.  We don't do the light.  We deal with the end piece at the server.  We take the light and convert it back to, and extract information from the light.  That's what we do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we do, we can do it.  We know how to do it very efficiently, very efficiently and to meet the performance demands of today's applications.
Speaker 1: What's the future of information technology?  Or do you see another horizon where it has to go?
Speaker 2: Well, we're seeing it now.  It'll be challenging--well, it'll be challenging, you're gonna see some new technologies, but right now everyone's thinking about--and we'll probably see a lot more of this today where to save on power, now, these wireless devices are gonna continue to get faster and faster, so which means in order to do that, the--in order to go fast, you had to burn power.  So, but the power has to come from somewhere.  But you have to give up something else.  So these devices aren't gonna be as smarter so that they can run faster.  So some of the processing, they're not gonna have as much advance processing because we notice, the tablet's light weight.  In order for it to be lightweight and how efficient--it cannot be--and run very fast, it can't have, devote a lot of its time to processing.  So where is the processing gonna be done?  The processing is gonna be done back at the other end.  So a lot of the intelligence is gonna be pushed back into the networks, into the internet.  So what you will see are tons of these different devices. They're lightweight that you could run virtually forever, accessing tons of information.  But, you know, so your notebook is gonna change.  You won't need it.  There won't be a need for a note.  Why do you need a notebook?  The reason why a notebook's heavy is because of the battery.  Why is the battery heavy?  You need to cool the doggone dual processor core in there.  You don't need--an iPad doesn't have a dual processing core.  It's a very simple device.  So that paradigm will continue to exists.  Because, why?  Because where's the intelligence, back in the network, right.  So, and in doing so, they can reduce the weight.  They don't need, and most of the weight is the battery.  You don't have to cool the device.  You don't need to, you know, you don't have to get rid of watts of power.  But now, so that power, that's the new paradigm shift in information technology.  So the internet is gonna become more interesting, I mean more intelligent.  And then there's, but that poses a security problem (laughter).  So, yeah.
Story_ID: 30873
Speaker 1: Well, one other thing, just shifting years off of here is that you shepherded through like twenty-four Ph.D. candidates since you've been here [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Not since I've been here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The total.  No, I've only supervised three Ph.D. students since I've been here.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: No, twenty-four, I mean that's a fair number.  Some people don't even have that many in a lifetime.  So twenty-four, and I've been in this business--when did I start?  Nineteen ninety--when did I start, '94 [1994].  So that's sixteen years.  That's more than one a year.  I'd say that's a good clip, very good clip.  Some people will be thirty years and thirty-five years and forty years and they won't have that many Ph.D. students.  They may have a dozen.  So, yeah, yeah, I've produced three since I've been here.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: And I'm happy to say, of those, just to give you a breakdown, of those, four are African American, one woman, one African American--one of the African Americans, he's at, he's a professor at University of Rochester [Rochester, New York], Paul Ampadu.  He just received tenure last year.  The other three, there's Javier Alvarado (ph.), Franklin--oh, and Carl Maurice.  He's at Intel [Corporation, Santa Clara, California].  Franklin--oh, I'm sorry, Eskinder Hailu.  Eskinder's at, where's Eskinder?  He's at a start-up in the Bay area [True Circuits, Inc., 2006-2010; in 2011, he became a senior analog/mixed-signal design engineer at Apple Inc.].  So it's Eskinder, Kyle, Javier and Paul.  And in, one woman, one Latin American, Franklin Bien.  He's at IBM [International Business Machines].  So those are, and the rest--see, I had a rainbow coalition of, of Ph.D. students and definitely had that group of seventeen Ph.D. students.  They're students from a broad cross section of America and by intent, I had a couple of guys, they were brothers, Kyle and Sean Welsh.  They were from Albany, New York.  Then you had a very Republican, very, you have your quintessential white kids (laughter), oh, boy.  They had some interesting views.  Then you had Javier Alvarado (ph.).  Javier started out, he was a kid.  I had him as a, known him since he was undergrad, but I knew he had talent, knew he was brilliant.  I knew he was special.  He just needed some directions.  But when I picked him up, I picked him up as an undergrad, and I had him in my research group with the guys so he'll get engrossed in the culture of the research group and everything.  Javier, when I picked him up, he had overalls, braids, you know, the butt hanging out the pants and stuff.  I'm like, you should see him now.  He makes about 140K, thousand dollars a year, suited down, this top design engineer.  He's a quintessential professional, under thirty.  So, you know, I'm very proud of him, but he was in the group with Sean, Kyle and the rest of the guys and Asian, Indian, you name it.  They would these discussions, deep discussions about everything, but the one thing I can say that was imparted to each of them is that when they encounter another person that looks like me and you in their group, they won't look at them initially by the color of their skin.  They will examine them by what they bring to the table, their character and that's the most important thing that I can, in fact, I believe I conveyed into them the fact that--and that's my contribution, and that, is, in part, is my legacy in addition to this.  That is my legacy.
Story_ID: 30874
Speaker 1: Okay, well, we always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Hum, my (laughter)--
Speaker 1: And concerns.  It's hopes and concerns.
Speaker 2: Hopes, oh, man, hopes and concerns.  (sigh) I'm gravely concerned about, let me start with the concerns, especially about, I'm mostly concerned about black males.  They represent 70 percent of the, although we're a small percentage of the population, we represent 70 percent of the jail population.  Most of these males are raised as single parents, mostly women.  I don't see that trend changing.  If you look at the recent, also recent census, we're today, unmarried households outnumber married households.  So my concern is that we've gotten away from, it takes a village to raise a family.  I think the church has gotten away from some of those old values I think that were so crucial and essential it helped me to become the person that I am today.  I think it's gone.  Divorce has played a huge, huge role, part in this, and I think it's contributed to, again, dramatically to the breakup of the family by getting to the--, and then I think it's intent to get the black male, targeted against the black male.  And it's just, it doesn't look too promising (laughter).  I look on TV at the role models that we have today, the Little Wayne's, these guys are the very thing that society, I mean you think about it, you have tattoos, you wear braids.  I'm not saying you don't have a right to, but all those things, you don't look any different than the jail population.  So when the cops, the police, that's the first thing they're gonna do.  They perform a visual inspection.  You can go to school at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], be a student in Harvard, and they don't see you any differently than, when you have braids and earrings and your pants, wearing your pants hanging off your butt, they're not gonna see you any differently.  And that, that's my concern, is these negative images, and the athletes, but this is what the kids are seeing on TV.  The media plays a role in that, all of the negative, perpetuating all of the negative images.  But I'm, they need to hear more about HistoryMakers, the folks, the males who are making positive contributions.  What I would like to see are, you know, students who, 3.5, 4.0 [grade point averages] students who make it to the NBA [National Basketball Association].  Yeah, I wanna see those kinds of stories, a guy who majored, had a 4.0 as an undergrad in engineering, and he's a star in the NBA.  That would change things a little bit, and guys do have that--there are folks who do have that mental capacity.  I mean true student athletes.  And you probably will see more of that because of the parody that now exists within the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association].  Now, they're talking about changing this "one and done" rule and so forth.  So I think, and you see an interesting, and I think this is good, in sports, they added--they're talking about this character rating they're gonna have to rate the NFL [National Football League] and NBA drafts, where you get negative points for earring, tattoos, for having an arrest record, prior arrest record, all, you know, all the negative connotations.  That's gonna, that's gonna hurt you.  And it's gonna impact you, and, you know, impact your future compensation.
Story_ID: 30875
Speaker 1: Well, we always ask this question too.  When you look back over everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently now if you could?
Speaker 2: That I would do differently than--I probably would have, I don't know and I think about my sons [Kevin and Justin Kornegay] in reference to what we discussed just a few moments ago, if I should have pushed them into engineering.  They're both bright kids and I wanted to allow them to naturally fall into their, you know, fall into it kind of like I, the way I did.  And I used to sit down with my youngest son with the Lego, Lego mind games or whatever, and I mean he still loves math, he's very good in math.  He'll probably major in math, and he may actually--but I didn't force him into it.  You know how some kids [sic, parents] force their kids into--like I know some of the, some guys, former ballplayers who forced their kids to come into the sport, you know.  So I probably should have been a little bit more forceful with my boys in terms of forcing them into, you know, look, you're gonna be an engineer, you know.  And I've seen some folks do that.  They do that in other cultures (laughter).  So.
Speaker 1: Now, how old are your boys?
Speaker 2: My oldest is eighteen now and my youngest is fourteen.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what are they most interested in?  I mean--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --academically anyway (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, academically, they both love math, both love math.  Justin [Kornegay] likes more of the sciences.  Kevin [Kornegay] likes math.  He just, he doesn't--for some reason, he doesn't like the sciences that much.  Justin loves both the math and the sciences.  Kevin loves the math, he loves the math, so he might be--he may be your accounting type.  Yeah, I can--or he may be computer science.  He may be computer science.  I can see him being in computer science because he likes more applications type, and he's a deep thinker.  So I can see him doing more of that.  Justin, I could see more of the EE [electrical engineering] type.  I could see Justin be more like a double E [EE, electrical engineering] or mechanical.  He's certainly--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Justin's more of a tinkerer like myself.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your father [Thomas E. Kornegay, Sr.], did he pass away before you got your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, he, right prior to me going to [University of Califonia] Berkley in eighty--actually, he passed in '87 [1987].
Speaker 1: Okay, but your mother's [Dorothy Lattie Scott Kornegay] still alive?
Speaker 2: No, I'm sorry, in '85 [1985].  My mother's still alive, yes.
Speaker 1: You said she's in her 80s?
Speaker 2: She's eighty-three [83], yes.
Speaker 1: Eighty-three [83], okay.  All right, and your uncles were they kind of thrilled that you were able to become an engineer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, well, they were, yeah, Uncle Bob, he's a software engineer.  He was proud to see me over at Bell Laboratories [Murray Hill, New Jersey].  And everyone knew him, all of the folks, they knew him cause he was a big proponent of the program.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you're not married now, right, or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, if a nice young lady happens see this (laughter)--video, send me an email.  No (laughter) or just Google me.
Speaker 1: Atlanta [Georgia] is a good place to be if you're single, I would think.
Speaker 2: Oh, man, these--that's an offline discussion.  Yeah, it's great, but you gotta be careful what you ask for.  These, yeah (laughter).  I didn't say I wanted to get married (laughter).  I didn't say, they want, these women wanna get married.
Story_ID: 30876
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, do you have, is there anything I have not asked you that need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I can't think of anything right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is similar to legacy and you discussed what your legacy is, but the last question is how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Hum, I would like to be remembered, I was watching Joel Osteen sermon a couple of weeks ago.  And it was entitled 'Helping Others to Win.'  And really that legacy, and I'd like to be remembered as someone who helped others to win.  I have in my house two portraits of, done by Gregory Young, as a--one of which is a picture of a black man lying across the sand, just washed ashore. So it kind of, and I bought these photos right around the time I graduated, when I finished my Ph.D.  That was sort of, one, just to let me know that, the one that washed ashore, what it represents to me is that my job is, you know, yes, I--the journey's not over, you know.  And it constantly reminds me that my journey's not over.  The other photo is a photo of a brother reaching down over, across a wall and his other hand reaching toward another hand.  That, too, let's me, is a reminder too, that, hey, my job is incomplete.  I'm here to, I've got to lift and help as I climb and it's kind of travels back to what Joel Osteen's sermon was about, helping others to win.  So my legacy today is to--and I'd like to be remembered, not my legacy, but I'd like to be remembered as the person, as the man who helped others to win, not just my brothers but my sisters too, humanity.  Just a person who--and that's generally how I'd like to be remembered.  And perhaps my technology, for example, I have certain, I believe I have certain technology that can help the U.S. win, gain some competitive advantage over this gap, this growing gap that we have between us and the Chinese, a huge gap.  A lot of technology and knowledge is leaving the country and nothing is coming in, nothing is staying here.  Yeah, so I hope that some technologies and things that I do can help convince folks to, you know, to inspire them to create companies that would create jobs that would help get our, you know, help to jump start our economy.  But this, the growing gap between--is just unbelievable.  But anyways, I don't wanna go off on a tangent, but I wanna be remembered as a person who loved to help people win.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Oh, thank you, sir.
