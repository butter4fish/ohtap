Speaker 1: And before we get in, in depth, there are five "People" magazine-ish type of questions that I'm always compelled to ask people, and they just require a short answer.  The first such question is what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: I don't have any favorite food.  All of it's mine if I like it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?

Story_ID: 74097
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay, so let's talk about your family history.  Do you know the history of your family on either side and how far back can you go?
Speaker 2: No further back than when I recognized the fact that I was in the world and could see and do things for myself.  I must have been somewhere getting close to ten or eleven years old at that time.
Speaker 1: Now did your, did you know your grandparents?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: And did they ever talk about where, where they came from or where the other people in the family came from?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Occupations they had or?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't.  My grandparents didn't.  My father [James Butler] did.
Speaker 1: All right.  What did he say?
Speaker 2: That he was originally born in Arkansas, and when he got old enough he left, I think he called it Foreman, Arkansas, somewhere, Foreman.  Ashdown, Ashdown, Arkansas and moved to Texarkana [Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Texas.
Speaker 1: Was your mother [Sallie Sumerall] born in Texarkana?
Speaker 2: I think so, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your grandparents didn't pass along any stories about what was going on in the nineteenth century or any stories any stories about Reconstruction or, or pre-Civil War days or any of that--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --type of thing?  Okay.  Well, well could you give us the names of your parents and spell them for us please?
Speaker 2: My father was named James Butler, J-A-M-E-S, B-U-T-L-E-R, Sr.  My mother--you want her maiden name or married name?
Speaker 1: Her maiden name.
Speaker 2: My mother was Sallie, S-A-L-L-I-E, Sumerall, S-U-M-E-R-A-L-L.
Speaker 1: Okay, and could you give us your father's birth day and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't really know how old my father was.  I know he was in his nineties, but his, his birth day was March the 9th.  Now whatever year I've forgotten if I ever knew.
Speaker 1: Okay, it was in the probably the 1800s or 18--
Speaker 2: I image so, because he died in '70--back in the '70's [1970s] and he was 90 something years old when he died.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: I can't tell you an exact date 'cause I don't know.
Speaker 1: It 18--
Speaker 2: I know his birth date was March the 9th.
Speaker 1: Okay, sometime in 1880s (unclear) I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah somewhere back then.
Speaker 1: And your mother?
Speaker 2: February 17, and I don't know her year.  I don't know the year, but it was February 17th was her birth date.  You know, you don't keep up with all that stuff all the time.  It gets away from you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your mother and father have a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: If they did, we didn't know it.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Do you think they probably met in Texarkana?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had no other place to meet (laughter).  Yes they met in Texarkana.  I know that much.  I've heard her say.
Story_ID: 74098
Speaker 1: All right.  Well tell us something about your father [James Butler]?  What kind of a person was he?  What kind of occupation did he have you know?
Speaker 2: My father grew up on a farm and that is what, that is the kind of life that he continued until he retired.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He left Ashdown, Arkansas and moved to Texarkana [Texas] when he got old enough, he said.  That's all I know and then he started doing for himself and that's where he met my mother [Sallie Sumerall] in Texarkana, Texas.
Speaker 1: Did he have his own farm or did he rent or did he sharecrop or how did he do it?
Speaker 2: Well he did, I guess you call it days work or farm work until he saved up enough money to pay down on some acreage of his own.  And from that he increased it from one amount of, well I should say number, one number of acres on up until he got a pretty good size farm where he had tenants of his own.
Speaker 1: Okay, and could you tell us anything about his, his, his attitude of his character, what kind of a person he was?
Speaker 2: Very strict and he was always very honest about everything.  He didn't like for anybody to lie to him or try to fool him.
Speaker 1: Okay, what did he look like?  Was he tall or short or?
Speaker 2: No he was I guess you would call it average size, maybe about 5'9" or 5'10", but huge.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Big and--(unclear)--.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  Tell us about your mother?
Speaker 2: My mom was kind of short, plump, long hair, brown skin, very devoted mother.  And when she said no that's what she meant.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were to obey all their rules and regulations or we were punished.
Story_ID: 74099
Speaker 1: Did you always obey all their rules and regulations?
Speaker 2: No.  You asked a question, I told you the truth.  No, we would tell lies and hide and then we would get punished.  So, after a while we realized the fact that we were gonna get--we called it in those days a licking.  She [Sallie Sumerall, mother] usually would get a switch and she'd get those legs and that hurt.  So, you had sense enough then to realize if you--and if you lied to her you'd get one worse.  If you had committed something and she would want--you knew it was against the rules of the home and then you said oh I didn't do that and you know you did it and she knew you did it, then you was gonna get a good one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 74100
Speaker 1: Now what kind of education did your parents have?  Did they, did they go to school or--(unclear)--?
Speaker 2: They did, but neither of them finished high school except my mother [Sallie Sumerall].  I take that back because she was grown up when she finished high school, but she married before she finished high school.  But, he [James Butler, father] did help her to go back to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In high school, they, they told us high school back in those days was ninth grade and tenth grade.
Speaker 1: Now how many brothers and sisters did you have and where did you fall in the order, birth order?
Speaker 2: I had, I had four brothers, one sister.  One brother, no, two brothers and one sister that are older than I, and then there was I guess you would call it a gap in the days of our birth, the third child.  I'm the fourth child.  He was born 1915, I think, they said, and my birth date was '21' [1921].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then the other two brothers, we were ten and eleven months apart, close together.
Story_ID: 74101
Speaker 1: Okay, well I want you to think back and reflect and give me some idea of some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in, in rural Texarkana, Texas?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess it's just like any other place, I don't know, I didn't know any difference.
Speaker 1: Well it wasn't like any other place--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: I mean in the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because there were fruit trees and wild flowers and my mother [Sallie Sumerall] was a flower lover, and she had--(unclear)-- flowers in the yard and that was our duty on weekends when we weren't doing anything else you keep that yard clean and help her work those flower beds, the gardens, and all that stuff.
Speaker 1: So she had pretty gardens, you think?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you had to eat.
Speaker 1: Well, the flowers and all that, you know, too--
Speaker 2: But in the garden, I mean, the vegetable gardens and that they a lot of fruit, fruit trees.  My dad [James Butler] was a, he was really a person who, who believed in doing as well as possible and then he would have all of us out there doing little things that we needed to do, and we had many a fowl, many fowls.  We had chickens, turkeys, guineas, ducks, anything that paddle the ground he had it out there, and that was our job to take care of the stuff on the yards, fowls.
Story_ID: 74102
Speaker 1: Did he have cows and horses and stuff?
Speaker 2: Right, he had like a dairy farm and he sold the milk to Babbling Brook dairy.  They came about twice a day, one, once in the morning, once in the evening, but people who were living on his place at that time were the ones who milked the cows.  They didn't have any mechanized milkers at that time until later on, but they would come by and pick up the milk.  But with us, we had to do what we called churn.  You ever heard of that?  Well--
Speaker 1: Describe it though, because people that listen to this tape are not gonna know what it is.
Speaker 2: Oh really?
Speaker 1: They may not 'cause they never see it.  They just go to the store and buy butter.  They don't (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, you would milk your cows--(unclear)--.  Finally my father [James Butler] bought, bought a milker and that would help the people who lived on the farm, that would help them to get the milk out a little more quickly than they would just milking with your hands, and then you put it in a big keg, I guess they call it, a keg, and you cool it.  And then Babbling Brooks would come by (that was the dairy, one of those large dairies in town), would come by and pick up the milk and you saved some for yourself until the cream, they call it, rose on that milk and we had what we called a churn and you would put it in that churn and with a dasher you would just keep dashing it up and down like that, then--
Speaker 1: Was the dasher like a stick or something?
Speaker 2: Whatever that little thing on the bottom of it; little end.  I don't know what you call it, but I know I--we had to do it a many day to get us some butter.  And you would churn your milk and then take the, the butter would come to the top and then you would skim all the butter off of that and that was the butter milk that was left at the bottom and then the butter while you took it and put it in your refrigerator.  We didn't have freezers at that time.  We had ice refrigerators and every morning--
Speaker 1: Like an ice box?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Every morning the ice man would come by and deliver you twenty-five or fifty pounds of ice, whatever you wanted.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you all were close to town.  You were, you were closer to town?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You had--(unclear)--so you could take advantage of--
Speaker 2: The city limits was right across the road--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --there was a road that came down in front of our house (they didn't call those streets then), came in front of our house it was called Sowell Lane and the man from Babbling Books Dairy would come and pick up the milk down that road in front your house.  And all your other working stuff was in the rear, so you'd have a decent frontage, all the people that lived on that road.
Story_ID: 74103
Speaker 1: Now, what, what kind of things would you do for fun?  What activities would you engage in for fun you and your brothers and sisters and other playmates?
Speaker 2: Oh, we'd all meet--we had a large what they call a lot, you know, a great big open space and we had baseball diamond out here.  My dad [James Butler] made a basketball court out there, and all our stuff was there in that lot, and we'd go out there and we'd play.  Then, there come a time that you didn't, you didn't play all the time you had to work some.  And there come a time for you--(unclear)--everybody would be dismissed because some of the people on the farm had children as well and we didn't have to worry about going to find somebody to play with because people in the neighborhood had children and they would all come and you reserved at that, that one particular lot that was our play area.  And then on weekends when there were games at the school, usually on Friday nights, sometimes we would go to the football games, basketball games, but not too often because you had to pay and lot of times you didn't have had to pay, so you couldn't go.  You know what I mean when I say you didn't have had to play; when you did have the money, and so my dad would say no you can't go this time you have to wait, have something else more important to do.  But, then at school we had access to whatever sports were being played.  And then on the weekends I don't care what you did on weekends, what, what came up, Sunday--or Saturday night you didn't go any place, when we were growing up now.  After you got older, you were allowed to go out, but after we got older then we would go maybe to a football game, a basketball game, or whatever was being held.  But, before that time, on Saturday nights while we got ourselves already for Sunday school and church the next day because you were gonna go there I don't care what happened.  You went there every weekend.
Speaker 1: Now, what denomination--
Speaker 2: Baptist
Speaker 1: --church did you--Baptist.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right and did you like church?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 74104
Speaker 1: You like what you were exposed to.  Now, my sister she was older than I am, much older than I am, about ten years, and she and this oldest brother they were--let's see now I think he was three years old, older than she and then she came and then she was three years older than the brother, middle brother, and then the other space between my brother and me was six, about a little over six years, and she had to go to piano lessons all the time.  She learned to play, she learned to play quite well, and because I didn't (laughter) learn as much as she did she would peck me on the fingers with a pencil.  Then when I would go to the piano teacher with her on Saturdays I--that's when I studied and tried to learn to play.  Oh, I play a little bit, but not like she did.  I didn't like that.
Story_ID: 74105
Speaker 1: I liked to sew, and I learned to sew and make the things that I wanted because I liked clothing and I didn't want to wear the same dress every week, every day, every Sunday.  So, my mother [Sallie Sumerall] would go to a place called O'Dwyer Ahern, which was a grocery store.  Everything, all kinds of things were sold there.  And she would buy yardage and my grandmother lived in the city part of Texarkana [Texas] on North Street.  Across the street from her was the home economics teacher at the high school.  Well, I wanted to learn how to sew before I was in high school and my mother would let me go over to my grandmother's house and from my grandmother's house I'd go over to the teacher's house and wash dishes, and then she would show me how to sew and that was how I learned to sew even before I got in high school because she was the high school economics teacher in Texarkana where I grew up.  And that is how I learned to sew.  So, I would just get some material; it was very cheap at that time, and I would make up stuff.  Well, not just for me, for all of us because that was what I wanted to do and that's what I did.
Story_ID: 74106
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now tell me about school.  What, what school did you attend and, you know, how, how did you like school?
Speaker 2: I did I loved school.  There was one school that I went to when I was in first grade (they didn't have a kindergarten back there then), and it was called Red Springs School, elementary school, and my mother [Sallie Sumerall] and dad [James Butler] decided that they didn't want us to go there anymore, and we had to pay tuition to go to school in the city.  So, he had a car and my brother, Robert, would drive the car to school every morning and we would go to school in the, in the city.
Speaker 1: Now, why did your, your father want to take you out of Red Springs School?  Was there a reason?
Speaker 2: Yes, he said he didn't think that we were getting the instructions that we need and they only had two teachers there for, oh God I don't know how many kids I couldn't tell you that, because I was small at that time, and so the tuition that he paid he said that he thought it would be worth what we would learn going into Dunbar Elementary [currently Dunbar Intermediate Center, Texarkana, Texas].  Now, Dunbar Elementary was a, I guess you would call it three section school because they had the elementary over here, they had the junior, primary over here, and the elementary over here, and the junior and senior back over this way, and that was where we went to school from then on until we graduated from Dunbar.  I mean the high school part.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they had a grade school and high school in the same school, right?
Speaker 2: Had the elementary on the east--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --junior high in the middle, middle school, and then high school over here on the west.  It was a large area, and that's where all the black people went because it was a segregated school.
Story_ID: 74107
Speaker 1: Now, now was there a lot of discussion about Paul Laurence Dunbar, you know since it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it was named after him see.
Speaker 1: Yes, I wondered if it was, if people really, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well we had one teacher by the name of Willie Mae--let me see what was her name, Smith, Bordenham (ph.) 'cause she had two husbands.  She was Moore when she was teaching at Dunbar, and she established library, the library.  She and some more teachers went in together and they raised money to establish a decent library at that school.  Oh, we got a few books, but back in those days white people didn't care whether you had books or whether you didn't have 'em, you know, because from what we understood that those books were used and they were handed down to us from Texas High School [Texarkana, Texas], the white school over on Texas Avenue, and so a lot of the teachers would have like little get togethers, little teas, and little stuff that they had in those days and raise money and they established a library where we could get those booklets from.  And we knew that Dunbar was named after Paul Laurence Dunbar and they got everything imaginable that could be found concerning Paul Laurence Dunbar.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interesting.
Story_ID: 74108
Speaker 1: Now, did--you said that Dunbar [High School, Texarkana, Texas] had a, had, had a football team and other--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were called Dunbar Buffalos.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were some good players too.  And there was a rival team across--now let's see this is State Line Avenue right here, we're over on Texas side, with everything east of State Line Avenue was Arkansas side and it went a long ways, a long ways, but, they were rival schools.  Big game of the year was who was gonna have that Thanksgiving game and whose gonna beat that team, which team was it gonna be, and we would all get to go to the Thanksgiving game on Thanksgiving.  Either this year it'd be Dunbar's field, next year it would be Washington High's [Booker T. Washington High School, Texarkana, Arkansas] field, and that was a big celebration on Thanksgiving.  Everybody went.
Speaker 1: Washington High, was it named after Booker T. Wa, Wa, Washington or?
Speaker 2: I really don't know.  I can't say truthfully whether that's true or not--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but Dunbar was named after Paul Laurence Dunbar.  I do know that much.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, who usually won the game?
Speaker 2: Well it depended 'cause some of the guys, you know, they would graduate and, and go and that would leave the next team coming forward and it was less players that's all I can tell you.  I don't really know.
Speaker 1: Well you were out there.  Do you remember, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, Dunbar won quite a few of 'em.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then they'd have a big fight (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh really.
Speaker 2: Yeah, after the game, but our dad [James Butler] tell, he would tell us 'cause he had bought us a car and he would say now after the game is over I give you guys thirty minutes to be home.  Don't be over there fighting and we'd have to be home.  And at that time, I don't know about how people try to rear their children now because it's not my business I'm just glad God blessed me to be able to rear mine, but if your parents told you that you might could stay until the first half and then it's time for you to come home, that's what you did and you didn't go on off and say well I don't care what they said, you wouldn't do that because you were reared differently.  And so it didn't really bother us one who didn't, just since we got to go to the game that was the important thing for us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 74109
Speaker 1: Now tell me in grade school and high, and in high school, who were some of the teachers or some of the adults that, that were either mentor to you or, or recognized some potential in you that helped you out, I mean, that you, that you really remember were good teachers and good role models?
Speaker 2: There were two.  It was Ms. Beulah (ph.) Davis-Dodd.  She was Beulah Davis before she married Rev. Dodd, and then there was another lady named Willie Mae Smith.  Now the lady who lived across the street from my grandmother was Ethel Dee Jackson, who was a home economics teacher at Dunbar [High School, Texarkana, Texas], and she is the one that would teach me and help me with my sewing 'cause many times my mother [Sallie Sumerall] would let me go over to her house on Saturdays and help her a little bit, and she always taught me something about sewing.  We would sit down, but if you made the wrong, what shall I call it stitch, you would have to take a pin and pick every one of those stitches out, literally, from a sewing machine.  You have to pick 'em out.  You didn't pull 'em out, you picked 'em out one by one.  And she was the one that taught me to be able to sew and make things for myself, for my family, my mother and everything too.  And so, I kinda idolized that lady, I really did.  And the other two, Ms. Dodd was an English teacher, and she taught Latin.  I didn't take Latin, but she taught Latin.  She taught English and literature, and she was quite a wonderful woman; she really was.  So, I admired those three ladies; I really did.
Story_ID: 74110
Speaker 1: Okay, now what, what were your favorite subjects in school?  What did you really like to do?
Speaker 2: In high school [Dunbar High School, Texarkana, Texas]?
Speaker 1: Well, grade school and high school.
Speaker 2: Well, I told you I like to, I liked to sew at that time, and I could keep myself looking the way I like to look at that time.  If you look at me know, that don't mean nothing (laughing), but I really did like to have different things.  I don't care whether they were--most of them were cotton, but the material that we bought was not very experience, but if you made well and did well on it you will always look nice, and I was always kinda ticky about the way I looked.  And I like to sew, and I like to make things, help my mother [Sallie Sumerall] make things for the rest of the kids.  She sewed some, but not like the home economics teachers did.  And I just, just like to do that, but my father [James Butler] he was determined that I was going to be like my sister.  See my sister did real well in music.  In fact, she was the first black music teacher down in Texarkana [Texas] at a primary school when they started, you know, hiring.  But, that wasn't my thing.  I didn't want that.  I wanted me some pretty clothes (laughing) and stuff, and that was what I learned.  I learned that, I guess, more so than anything else.
Speaker 1: Did you have a reputation for being fashionable in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, we won't go into that, but I guess I did.
Speaker 1: Modesty prevents you from (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: But my father used to say don't you ever step out that door looking raggedy, and my mother would say come here and look you over, go take that off.  And you didn't argue with them either.  If they said no you don't wear that, you don't wear it, but you always tried to make yourself look as, well I like to call it fashionable at those, in those days.  I don't know what they call it now.  But I always liked to have, have nice things, and I always did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I'd make 'em, yeah, I would make 'em.  And then in the winter time, I shouldn't say winter time, in the fall of the year my father and my mother would go to town and they would buy a half a boat of material.  It's, it's a long board about that long and the yardage is wrapped around it just like you would wrap a string around a container, and we all had underwear made off that boat, like pajamas and stuff like that, slips, stuff like that.  And we had a sewing machine.  My mother had a sewing machine, and we learned to do those things.  I--and then as I said my home ec. [economics] teacher she was, she was good to me 'cause she lived right across from my grandmother and I would go over there, and then my, my father--my mother and father would let me go over there on Saturday and I could wash dishes and clean up and do little stuff, and she would show me stuff and give me stuff, you know, so you'd always look nice.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're going to change tape right here, so hold on.
Story_ID: 74812
Speaker 1: So you were just saying that your mother [Sallie Sumerall] was very specific about what she wanted done--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and y'all had it--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My dad [James Butler] was too.
Speaker 1: Now, now tell me when you were nearing the close of high school [Dunbar High School, Texarkana, Texas] what did you--what were your plans?  Did you plan to go to college or did you think you would get married?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).  No, I wasn't thinking about no getting married.
Speaker 1: You didn't have a boyfriend in high school?
Speaker 2: They were silly to me.  Oh, I had friends, but I was looking for that.  It just wasn't my life.  I didn't want to be bothered with no boyfriends because at that time boys begin to get bossy, you know, tell you, you can't talk to that one or you can't talk to that one.  Nobody can tell me who I can't talk to and I've got a mouth.  I, no, I didn't care that much.  There was one fellow that we claimed each other as boyfriend and girlfriend one thing or another.  He was living with his grandmother, a very quiet sort of person, not a boisterous kind.  But about that time some of 'em were beginning to get crazy and act crazy, and I didn't like foolishness, and so I just didn't have any, any regular boyfriend because I was fifteen and my mother said well no you are not to be getting serious about these guys because there were so many other girls who came up, you know, having to get married or didn't get married and started raising families without marriage, and my mom said no I don't want none of that in my house.  You're not gonna bring that stuff in here, and you, you mind your parents.  You, you did what they told you to do.  Whatever may mom said, that's what she meant, that's what she meant.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah so, I didn't have any just regular boyfriends and all that kind of stuff.  That didn't bother me at all.
Story_ID: 74813
Speaker 1: So, so what did you do right after high school [Dunbar High School, Texarkana, Texas]?  What did you--what, what, were you, I mean, what did you plan to do and did you--what, what did you actually do after high school?
Speaker 2: Well, my dad [James Butler] told me this right after high school he said you something, I said no, he says I'm going to enlarge the farm.  I said what you talking about.  You can't see it, but I, I can see in my mind.  There was a large section behind us.  He said all those trees along there, he said, I'm gonna clear that off.  He said I'm gonna have to have day laborers, and I'm gonna have to have somebody to keep the books for me.  He says you think you could do that?  I said well I can count.  He said well, he said if you help me do that he said then I'll help you when you get ready to go to school.  He said, but in the meantime he said you can go to the extension school, which is from Bishop [Texas] and they had brought an extension school from Bishop to Texarkana [Texas] and so that's where I went and I stayed home with my parents and helped them take care of this extra, I guess you cal it acreage, yeah acreage that they were going to clear out because they were enlarging, see, and so I stayed there and they paid me some money and I went to school, I bought me some clothes, and my dad bought me a car, but man I was so rich I couldn't, they couldn't tell me nothing.  You couldn't tell me I wasn't a millionaire.  I was just that silly because I, because I had a car and I had a little money and going to school a little bit and a few clothes, well I just thought I was rich.
Story_ID: 74814
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: I was just that stupid.
Speaker 1: You all were doing pretty well though--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did pretty good.
Speaker 1: --in those days, you know--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --actually that's pretty good.
Speaker 2: There was another man in Texarkana [Texas] by the name of Bill Smith.  He was a black man, and of course now I'm gonna be honest with you there were quite a few black farmers because many of 'em, you know, were like from my father's time and they didn't know anything else to do or they learned some of the things because there was a man by the name of Ben Hudson who was a county agent, they called him, and they went around to all the black farmers, you know, and showed them things that they needed to do about terraces and all that to keep the rain from washing away, a lot of that kind of stuff, you know, and so it was a lot of them there.  But, Bill Smith and my father [James Butler] at that time were noted as the two prominent black farmers in Texarkana, Texas.  If you find somebody else who grew up back there about that time anywhere back in the late '30's [1930s] and early '40's [1940s] before the war, why you could just ask 'em do you know anybody named Jim Butler back there.  His name was James, but everybody called him Jim, and Mr. Smith was William, but everybody called him Bill and they had that reputation of knowing how to manage.  And my dad was a good manager.  He really was.  I have to give him, give him the credit for that.
Speaker 1: 'Cause he started as just a day laborer--
Speaker 2: He did, that's right.
Speaker 1: --and built his--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Built, built himself up.
Story_ID: 74815
Speaker 1: All right now tell me this, what were race relations like in Texarkana, Texas, and did, did white people get jealous of what you all--you, you all were doing pretty good it sound, it seems to me, you know.
Speaker 2: There were some who did and some who didn't.  Now all the white people aren't funny.  Now there are many of 'em who like to see you progress, and there are some that we call crackers like they called us niggers they didn't want to see you with nothing.  They didn't even want to see you with a good drink of water.  So, that was some of the things that you had to confront.
Speaker 1: Did he have to contend with a lot of, I mean, very much of that kind of attitude there?
Speaker 2: To my knowledge not an awful lot, but it existed.  It was there.  And then after awhile, you know, some of 'em get to the point where they'll say well old Jim over there he's doing pretty good.
Speaker 1: Were people surprised to see that you are, here you are a black teenager driving a car, you know?
Speaker 2: No, there was a few other black teenagers had a car because my dad [James Buter] told me--now it wasn't a brand new car, you know, because I graduated from high school in '38' [1938], May of '38' [1938] and the next year he bought me a '34 [1934] Dodge.  You see that was almost five years, you know, old car.  Well, that wasn't nothing.  If you had a brand new one--cause there was a few people who had, you know, brand new ones, I mean kids, you know, but my mom [Sallie Sumerall] and dad [James Butler] they had a car of their own.  It was a Dodge--I don't know what year it was, thirty, I think it was a thirty, is '37 [1937] or '38 [1938] and so anyway all--we have to face even though it was a segregated city and a time at that particular time, but all white people weren't evil and mean.  Some of 'em were and some of them weren't.  Some of 'em would help you if they saw you needed help, you know?
Story_ID: 74816
Speaker 1: And I might as let you know now I done told you everything else about it, but see my father's father was Caucasian.
Speaker 2: You mean he white?
Speaker 1: Yeah, white.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: See and from what our dad [James Butler] told us I, I wasn't there 'cause I wasn't born then, but he said that they lived out in what they called the back house and the momma was the, his mother I'm talking about, she was the cook and the maid and everything else and the mother of the half-black kids; now that's all I know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because he didn't relish the thought of telling you too much about it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 74817
Speaker 1: But, the old man who was real good to my father [James Butler] was a Caucasian, and his name was Levert, last name.   George, that was his name because he named my brother after him, my dad did, and he was always nice to my dad as far as we knew because we used to go over to their house occasionally and we called her, you know, the wife of Mr. George Levert.  Well that's what we called her Ms. Levert and she told us one day, she said to you she said my name is not Ms. Levert.  Well we didn't know what to say.  We didn't know what to call her.  And so she said "You call me mama Laura and you call George, papa George and that's what you do," and that's what we did 'til they died.
Speaker 2: That's good, that's unusual.
Speaker 1: But, then he was always helping my father with some things.  I remember one time it was really funny though we had gone over to her house on a Saturday.  They had some fruit trees in the yard, and we were to clean this yard.  So, when we got finished with the yard, papa George said, now this is the man I've just told you about, I want you to go up there on the hill to Will Atkins' store and give him this note and he would put the stuff in a bag and bring it back to you.  Well we did.  We went up there and in this store was a great big old iron stove, you know, for heat and several of them were sitting all around the stove talking and smoking and spitting tobacco and everything else, I guess.  So, one of the guys said to the other one he says oh he says you better go over there, he says and go tend to them little niggers he said.  There's George's niggers over there looking for something.  Now this was the man sitting over there by the heater.  So, we went on back, we got the stuff and I told my two brothers.  I said George, George was named after this man we called papa George, I said you and Louis [ph.], I said you go right on I said I'll come on back behind you guys with the stuff.  So, we got our bags and we went on down there.  Well when we got almost to his house he had come out looking for us because we had stayed so long, and so he said, well how come you guys didn't come sooner, and I said well they didn't give it to us any sooner.  And he said well what do you mean?  I said well they were sitting around the heating smoking and going on and I said so we had to wait I said until we could get the stuff.  He said to George and Lee, and that was my brother, said you go on and take that to Laura.  He said you come on and go back with me. We went back up to that store and that was the first time that I had ever seen that kind of behavior before that he cursed that old man out at the store who owned the store and he says those are my kids.  That's the way he pu- put it.  He said if they come up here after anything else, he says, and you don't protect them and get what, give them what they need and come back down there, he says I'm gonna come up here, he said, and I'm gonna blow this D store up.  That was the words that he used.  He said now, he pulled it--the first time in my life I had ever seen a gun and he pulled that gun out the back of his pocket and he said now you apologize to 'em.  The guy said well George I didn't mean--(unclear)--he said I said apologize to 'em, and he did and he went on back out there and we got in his old car and went on back to his house.  And I had never seen or heard of that before.  So, we told our father about it, and my dad [James Butler] said to him he said well he said, you know, he said I don't believe you ought to send them up there anymore.  He said whatever you need, he said, I'll just come and get it for you.  He said no they going back and they gonna treat 'em just like they're human beings, and we never had no more trouble out of 'em.
Speaker 2: Well that's an interesting story.
Speaker 1: Well, it's no lie.  It is no lie.
Speaker 2: Yes ma'am.
Story_ID: 74818
Speaker 1: Well, what happened next?  Now you went to Bishop College [Extension School, Texarkana, Texas] part-time on the weekends, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And what was that like?
Speaker 2: It was nice because it was all black teachers and we went all day long on Saturdays and we had to get our work and everything done so we would be able to, you know, meet the teachers on Saturday because we had lessons just like we had to get when we were in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay now how long did you do that, did you go to Bishop?
Speaker 2: A year, one year.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And then 1942--
Speaker 1: Don't do your nose like that.
Speaker 2: What, look funny huh?
Speaker 1: You go ahead, go head. Correct.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 74819
Speaker 1: '42 [1942], that was the year I got married and my husband [Ovid Wesley] came home.  Well, he wasn't my husband then.  He came home on a furlough in May of '42 [1942].
Speaker 2: Was he from Texarkana [Texas]?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Okay, and you knew him already?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, I had known him some, but I wasn't really crazy about him at that time, wasn't crazy about nobody.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: You just, you was kinda of--
Speaker 1: Ornery and independent.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: See my dad [James butler] had bought me a little old car and I thought I was rich (laughter).  I thought I was the biggest shot in the town.  I'm lying, I didn't think that, but I had my own little old car, you know, and I didn't have to bother nobody for nothing.  I never was the kind that dated a lot of guys, you know, I really didn't and never liked a lot.  And so he came home from the service in May of '42' [1942] and we went to our school graduating class that evening and then we went to a movie and one thing or another and so he said to me he says well I'm gonna have to be leaving Sunday.  It wasn't too many days.  I don't know how many days it was, but he had to leave soon.  I said well fine.  He said I hope you'll still be here when I get back.  I said where am I going?  He said I don't know where do people go and he said well he said you might do like some of the rest of 'em he said, but don't.  I said what you mean don't.  He said I don't want you to.  I said why not.  He said, he told me said, he said you just acting crazy because you wanna act crazy.  I laughed about it.  I thought it was funny and 'cause I didn't think he was coming back that soon.  That November, the fourth Sunday in November, I'll never forget those days he came home and we went to church.  So when he went to church he says listen would you do me a favor.  I said yes.  He said drop me off at my dad's house he said because I just got in this morning he said and I'll see you later on.  I said fine.  So he did.  Later on he came and he said I was lucky.  I said how.  He said you know he said when I went back last year he said my company commander told me that if I would chauffer him to Nogales [Arizona] on weekends that he would give me another--what do you call it when--
Speaker 2: Furlough... leave?
Speaker 1: Furlough, another furlough when I got ready for it.  I said is that what he told you.  He said yeah.  And I said will he let you come back quick though didn't he.  Yeah, he said, but do you know why I came back.  I said no.  He said I'm gonna get married this time.  I said oh you found somebody you gonna get married to, huh, now.  And I said well when is the date?  He said just whenever you say.  He said I don't have but two weeks.  I said whenever I say.  He said that's what I mean.  He said and I'm not going back, he said, until we get married.  I said then they'll give you a AWOL [absent without official leave] or whatever you call that thing.  He said they'll have to give it to me because I'm not going back.  And I said oh.  I said let me think about it.  So, I thought about it all that night, I guess, all night long and he said I'll be back tomorrow, I said okay.  So sure enough tomorrow he came back and he said well what did you think?  I said well I asked my mom [Sallie Sumerall] and dad [James Butler] and they said it's all right with them if it was all right with me.  He said when do you want to marry?  I said oh I said sometime this week and I said but you know we have to get license and stuff, and he reached on the inside of his coat pocket, I'll never forget that as long as I live, he reached inside and pulled out this piece of paper and handed it to me.  I took the thing and I looked it over and I said where did you get this?  He said doesn't it say Miller County Courthouse on there.  I said yeah, but what are you doing down there.  He said you know what you looking at don't you?  I said but I didn't tell you today.  He said no, he said I'll give you a couple of days.  I said well I got to go to the beauty parlor.  He said you can go to the beauty parlor.  He said, but I'm telling you now he said we're getting married this week, and we got married Wednesday before Thanksgiving and stayed married for fifty-four years, ten months, and eleven days.
Story_ID: 74820
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So, so you think it was the right decision?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes it was.  My mom [Sallie Sumerall] said to me, she said, well I have no objection and he [Ovid Wesley] said well, he said there's no place for me to take her to Arizona.  That's where he was stationed at Fort Huachuca, no place for me to take her there.  He said so I would like to leave her at home, and my mom said well sure.  My dad [James Butler] said well this is her home she can stay here as long as there's a roof on the house 'cause it was nobody there but just those two.  I was the last one to leave, and my two brothers they were in service and my sister was already married and my other brother was married and my middle brother he passed away with pneumonia long time ago.  And so I stayed there with them 'til he came home from service.  And when he came home from service, then we found us a place in--'cause we had to come here because he was, was stationed, you know, Fort MacArthur or somewhere up there.  He had to go up there until the war was over, and so we just stayed there.
Speaker 2: Okay, now he was in the Army, right?
Speaker 1: In the Army.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's right for fifty-four years, ten months, and eleven days we were married.  We never separated.  Didn't have nothing to separate for.
Speaker 2: Well that's wonderful.  So what did you think about--had, had you ever been out of Texarkana [Texas] before when you moved here?
Speaker 1: No, not long at a time, little towns not too far from around there, Oklahoma.  Mom and dad had some people in Oklahoma, some brothers and sisters and things up there.  Some in Arkansas, Foreman, Arkansas, Ashdown, Arkansas, and had some relatives down in Pittsburg, Texas, and we had gone over to Dallas [Texas] to the World's Fair one time and that was as far as I had been out of Texarkana.  I hadn't been any place.
Speaker 2: So, was California an exciting place for you?  Had you really--
Speaker 1: No, I was disappointed in California when I got here, because I thought it was just gonna be like glory, and when I come here it was no place to stay.  Let me pull my shades 'cause I don't sit up in here with the, with the lights on.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: All right, now go on, continue.
Speaker 2: Well, that's it.  We've been here ever since.  Well, we've gone back to Texas and place, and other places.  We've haven't just stayed in this house for--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Move your chair to your right a little bit.
Speaker 2: Me?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Yes, please, okay, much better.
Speaker 2: Fifty-four years is that right?
Speaker 1: Fifty-four years, 10 months, and 11 days.
Speaker 2: Okay, and you, you were saying before that you were kind of disappointed in California 'cause you expected glory and you--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: Well, I thought it was heaven on earth before I came here.  You had heard so many things about California and how many advantages you had.  You have 'em if you have something to offer.  You can't come out here and think you're gonna get rich doing nothing.
Story_ID: 74821
Speaker 1: You have to prepare yourself when you get here to do some things.  So, when my husband [Ovid Wesley] got out of the Army, he said to me, Lillie, you know, he said I think I'd better get back in school.  Fine.  He said you know what I think we'll do?  I said what.  He said I'm gonna go right out here and see what I can get a hold of.  Well, what you looking for?  He said I'll see how much credit I got.  Well, when he got the information he had to go back to high school for a year.  He said oh God he said this is gonna be--(unclear)--, excuse me, and I said well what do you mean?  He said well he said I tell you what he said I'm gonna go to Poly, he said, until I get my high school diploma he said because eleventh grade was as much--he went to Macedonia School [Macedonia High School, Texarkana, Texas].  He didn't go to the same school I went to back in [Texarkana] Texas.  He said so I need that.  I said okay.  So, I said well you need me to help you, maybe.  Some nights I would go to school with him and I would sit right there.  I was not registered.  I just went to see what they were teaching and to see if I could be of any help.  So when he finished Poly, I'm talking about Polytechnic [Long Beach Polytechnic High School, Long Beach, California] up there.  He said well, he said now, he said I've got to go, I think I want to go to city.  I said okay fine.  So, he did.  He enrolled in City College [Long Beach City College, Long Beach, California] and when he got his certificate from city college (they only give you a two-year degree) he said I now, he said I've got to get to really getting some work because we about to be doing some things.  So, he went to work and he said now you say you wanna finish.  He said you going?  I said yeah.  So, I went back out to City College got through there, and we had another school over here on Pacific Coast Highway close to Cal State and I went there to get some extra credits that I could use until I got a chance to (I was working too) go to Cal State [California State University, Long Beach, Long Beach, California], but in the meantime I had started work for the city and they called me in one day and they said to me listen you going to school, yeah.  If you want to go to school, you go.  Since you got all your helpers that you are working with, get them started on their jobs and you take, make sure you take care of what needs to be done and you go.  And I would leave work and go to school until I finished state college.  But with me and with him going part-time and some of the times that maybe I should have been working that they would let me go, took me twelve years.  But, that didn't bother me because I knew further down the road it would be something better for me, so that's what we did.  And he would take care of the baby after I started to Cal State take care of the baby in the evening and at night and then I would go on to school 'til I got through.
Story_ID: 74822
Speaker 1: Then when I got through, I worked and worked and worked and then you step one step, maybe a year or so you step another step and before I left--let's see I retired in '80' [1980], or '71' [1971], yeah in '71' [1971] I was as high in recreation with the city as I could go except if I took some of the supervisor's job downtown and I know I wasn't about to do that 'cause that was not my plan.  And '82' [1982], no '80' [1980], my husband [Ovid Wesley] retired in '79' [1979] and he told me, he said it's time for you to come home.  I said I'm not ready and he said what do you mean you're not ready?  I said I just wanna work a little longer.  No, he says I'm coming home.  He says I've completed my years, about thirty years he says and you're coming home now.  I said, oh I said Tracy's, Neita [ph.], that's my daughter, Tracy is the granddaughter.  I said Neita is married.  I said it's nobody but just you and I.  I said can't I work a little longer.  No, you coming home, I want you home.  I said okay.  So, we had to go down to Texas.  One of his sisters was stricken with cancer, and he went down to help out the other sister as much as he possibly could and he came back and he was back one week and she passed away.  So, we went back there and helped the other sister do some things that had to be done.  On our way back, he said Monday he says you know what I want you to do?  I said no.  He said I want you to go down and tell superintendent you're gonna retire for good.  I said it's nobody just you and I.  I said we'd just be sitting up there at that house by ourselves.  He said now you gonna retire.  So I thought the man was joking and I had all that stuff you couldn't see the top of that table.  So, he got up that morning he said I'll make the breakfast.  Okay you'll make the breakfast.  So, I went on messing around, got through.  He said okay come on breakfast is ready.  Yeah, I'm coming.  I came in and I sat down.  He never said a word.  He went in there, he got my briefcase and some other packages, you know like you go to the grocery store and get shopping bags, and all that stuff I had on the table he just put in there carefully.  I said what are you doing?  He said I'm taking you down to sign your retirement papers.  I said oh my God.  I said you really mean I coming home, huh.  He said that's what I said and he wasn't, you know, not the kind of a person who just made a fuss out of nothing, he just told you what he meant and when you got to the point where you understood what he told you, you knew that's what he meant 'cause that what you was gonna do. So, I said okay.  So, we went on down to the city and I saw the superintendent and I said well, I said I came in today I said to--see 'cause I had done another project for them and he said what are you gonna do?  He said how are you Mr. [Ovid] Wesley?  Fine, I'm doing fine I brought my wife in to retire permanently.  Oh, he said you can't do that.  He said I can't.  He said well we will see about that.  He said I want you to sit down and he said no need of you having a fit, sit down and sign out, sign out her papers.  So, he did.  He said well would you let her do another project for me for two weeks, and he said are you truthful about that?  He said yes.  He said well now I don't wanna have to come back for two weeks.  He said if I come back for two weeks he says you won't like to see me again.  He said, no I'll be honest, he said because I'm going to City Hall now and I'm gonna sign her papers at City Hall, and that's what he did, and that's what we did.  I went and finished out those two weeks and finished out the project that they wanted me to finish, and I came home.  And so he said now, he said it's time for you to stay home with me some.  He said we can live.  He said we can make it, and that's what I did, and that's where I've been.
Story_ID: 74823
Speaker 1: Oh, I fiddled around here after that for a while helping with the sixth district--(unclear)--problems, supervisors and all that one thing and whatever was necessary for me to do and so when I got through with that I said well, I said I guess I'd better quit.  He said that's right.  And I said well I can find work to do in my yard, I'll do it out there then.  I'd go out there and work in my yard, and he would get up and he said I'll make the breakfast and he'd come to the bathroom window and he said okay come on the breakfast is ready.  I, I like, I like pretty yards and flowers and stuff.  Maybe if I would stay five or seven minutes longer he would come to the door that comes out to the, the yard in the back room back there, he said Lillie, yeah, I said breakfast is ready and I said meant get out of that yard and get in here and get your breakfast and I did that until the Lord called him away and that was about sixteen years.  We would just do whatever we felt like doing, try to keep up things, and try to help in the community.  --(Unclear)--somebody may can tell you what we did and worked with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], chaired some of the committees there, helped raise money to fight discrimination where the NAACP was concerned, stuff like that.
Speaker 2: I hope you'd be able to tell us, tell us some details about that after we change tape.
Story_ID: 74123
Speaker 1: --Raised money for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and what, what were some of the local issues the NAACP was dealing with and those things?
Speaker 2: Well, they had a lot of problems.  First we had the problems with the police discrimination, being mean and evil to black people when they arrested 'em.  Maybe they weren't guilty, maybe they were, that's left for the courts to decide not for the police to decide and slap up on 'em and that sort of thing, worked on stuff like that.  And my husband [Ovid Wesley] worked with one group--I don't really know what all of 'em did I tell you the truth.  My problem was not a problem, but my aim was to raise money because you know you cannot hire lawyers without some money.  I don't care what you belong to.  You got to have some money to defend yourself and, so McBride could tell you--McBride and (unclear) Lipscomb, and that bunch.  What was that other man name, he died?
Speaker 1: Watkins--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Watkins and wait a minute there's another one.  Oh God he was a preacher.  Anderson, Percy Anderson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, those people they can tell you more about the discriminatory cases that we were fighting, you know.  And they fought diligently in the early part of my membership at--for the NAACP to get a dishwasher hired at Kress's, a dishwasher.  I remember her name was Inez Finney [ph.], and Inez was such a good person until--they kept her until she died.  She passed away, you know, of old age.  She worked there many years.  She retired from Kress's, but there were a lot of things.  We weren't so concerned, the group that I was working with, about what this--are you gonna take this nickel and buy some cheese or are you gonna take this penny and buy some chewing gum, as long as we knew we were gonna fight discrimination with it and that's what we were working hard for is to get this money together to give to the branch.  It all went to the branch, and we made accurate accounts as to how many ticket we sold, to whom we sold, and our books were always in order because I don't know maybe it's ignorance or whatever you wanna call it, I don't care what you call it, but I'm ticky about pennies.  If I--if you give me a penny for this, I'm not gonna spend it for nothing but that.  And if you want it spent for anything else I'll give it back to you and say here you go spend it yourself I'm not gonna do that.  I'm ticky about certain things, but we did raise money and, you know, it went to the NAACP because we made accurate account of the tickets that we sold and how much to the tickets were and how much money we cleared, you know, and it went to the treasury for the NAACP and of course they had to be monies raised so that the officers those that were gonna go to the National Convention and stuff like that they had go to regular meetings and I guess whatever they did with it we didn't care since it was used for that purpose, for the purpose of fighting discrimination and trying to get a little bit of freedom.  We didn't worry about that.  I think it was eight years I held that position.
Speaker 1: You were the chair of the Women's Auxiliary or something of the NAACP?  What was the official name of it?
Speaker 2: It was the Women's Auxiliary.
Speaker 1: Of the NAACP?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A bunch old hens like me.  You remember that don't miss?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  When I first came here.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we worked like convicts.
Speaker 1: That's pretty hard.
Speaker 2: Well we did.  We worked hard.
Speaker 1: Well in the old days.  Convicts now they don't work as hard.
Speaker 2: I don't know, but they used to, but it was something that I enjoyed and after I retired that gave me something to do see because there were other little things that I was involved in that, you know, gave me some things to do.  And my husband was always very supportive.
Story_ID: 74124
Speaker 1: Okay, what other activities did you volunteer for?  I know you have quite a few awards and everything.
Speaker 2: Well, I couldn't do everything being an old lady (laughter).  You talking about what other, ain't that enough (laughter)?  Don't you think that's enough?  Oh dear me.  Well, first one thing and then another.  I just can't remember everything because somebody would call Lillie we need such and such a thing can you help with this?  I don't know, I don't know.  I'll talk about, I'll think about it, see what my husband [Ovid Wesley] say and if he said yes it's all right go head on.  He said now don't kill yourself; remember you're a lady you're not a work ox.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) A work ox?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's what he say.  And if it's something that he thought that would be too time-consuming, he said no more of that.  He said no, no you gotta rest some sometime.  Because if you devote yourself to a particular project, you will do just like she does with the library every possible chance you get if it's something that's going to benefit 'em you wanna see that they get it, and you'll do your best to see what you get.  So, when he got so tired of me being gone so much, he'd come and help and do a lot of things himself because he worked with the Elks.  That was his thing.  And I said to him I said you know I said I'm just getting kind of tired.  He said yeah I think you are and I think it's time for you to come home, and I said well that's what you think, that's what I'll do, so that's what I did.
Story_ID: 74125
Speaker 1: Well tell me this, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, I hope that one day that other generations will realize the fact that we are all human being and black people are no worse than any other nationality. Had they been God would not have let us live and prosper this long because we haven't come through a creek of roses; it's been rough all these years coming out from slavery up until now and when you were denied privileges that were actually guaranteed you under the Constitution of the United States and then somebody take it into their hands and say well we ain't gonna do this and we ain't gonna do that for them niggers and we ain't gonna do that for 'em.  That, that irks me.  And I hope that one day that they will realize that well we ain't no better than we are.  We are human being made by the Lord and if we don't do something about it, in hell we'll lift up their eyes.  So this if it's like a hell for the blacks it's a hell for them if they don't wanna, but they'll all be down there together, so I don't know what the hell they gonna do when they get down there it ain't be so pretty, you know.  I don't say if you wanna go marry a white person or a Filipino or any other nationality, that's your life here on earth, but that does not mean that you have the discriminate against somebody else because of the way you want to live, you see.  I don't believe in that.  I think God created all people equal.  I really do.
Story_ID: 74126
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you look back at the years that you've worked and the things that you've done, what would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I can't really say.  Everything is important to me that I did.  If it wasn't nothing but go out there and do something for a child that was in need that's important to me.  Whatever it is to done, that's important.  And God knows I did many, many, much, well much, I'm not gonna say many, but much of that.  I was surprised the day--I went to church Sunday--I go to church and I'm not as a regularly attendant as I once was because if I don't feel like doing anything now I just don't do it.  And I think the same God that takes care of me today he will take care of me tomorrow and all I have to do is put my trust in him.  And one girl walked up to me and she said hey Ms. Lillie and I said yeah and we talked for a few minutes and she said--she told me about this young man who had passed away and I said oh I said I didn't know that, I didn't hear that, and she said well I'll tell you, she said there were a lot of us there, she said, and do you know people said well you know one thing, said we were just wondering if that was (well we a say it was Tom Jones, but it wasn't Tom Jones), said we wonder if that Tom Jones or was that Ms. Lillie said because everybody who had something to say, say who what Miss Lillie did and what Miss Lillie did.  I said well honey Miss Lillie is too old to vote now; I said all I can do is creep around and vote.  I just laughed about, you know, and, but you know as a human being you've got to treat everybody right and you got to do whatever the Lord expects you to do.  And you don't tell me that you're so nutty that you don't know what he expects because anybody with common sense know that you supposed to do unto others as you wish to be done by.  And if you don't, you'll be paying for it one of these days; it will come back to you, and you'll know it too.  You do somebody dirty, it will come back to you.  And I don't think--this is my belief, I don't believe that the Lord sits down with a piece of paper and scribble up all the wrong doings you've done and then come up here and say what's your name?
Speaker 1: Larry.
Speaker 2: Larry? Well Larry you did this and you did that and you didn't do this and you didn't do that and I'm gonna give you a sentence for this.  I don't believe he does all that kind of stuff.  You will reap what you sow before you leave away from here and you'll know what you reaping too son.  You believe that, you hear me.  So, it behooves everybody to treat everybody right and what you wish to be done by.  You do unto others as you wish to be done by.  Of course, if you wanna be stupid, why you don't wanna be, be stupid to somebody else you just gonna be stupid by yourself.  But, I mean as far as being, doing the thing that is right.  I think you, you were taught that somewhere down the line and it, it does not go away.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Maybe I'm just old fashioned, but if I'm old fashioned, I'm just old fashioned.
Story_ID: 74127
Speaker 1: Now, did your parents get a chance to see you finish school here in California?  What, what did they think of you moving out here and all that?
Speaker 2: At first my dad [James Butler] didn't want me to come, and he was very particular about his daughters.  He only had two, my sister and I.  And he said you guys just going way off out there, you don't know how them guys gonna treat you and all that kind of stuff, you know.  And I said to him, I said well I have confidence in my own husband [Ovid Wesley] to know that he would not mistreat me I said if I do right.  I said, but a lot of women get mistreated because they do wrong.  I said you sit down and discuss your differences, I said, and come to some kind of agreement.  I said and if you done wrong, I said, don't be so bold that you can't say well if I offended you I'm sorry and I won't do it again, I said and I expect the same thing that's coming from husband.  I said, but I'm not gonna do nothing to him that he's gonna have to be getting on my goat about something.  You know what getting on your goat mean?  Balling you out and treating you wrong and one thing.  Because we would sit down and we would discuss certain things about life and life in general and what to expect from each other, and that's just the way we kind of lived.
Story_ID: 74128
Speaker 1: It sounds like you, you had a great partnership as a married couple?
Speaker 2: Oh, man they didn't make no more like my husband [Ovid Wesley], you hear me.  And we enjoyed living with each other.  Let me tell you something crazy, Saturday was three weeks ago my daughter said to me mama, and I said yeah.  She said do you wanna go to--(unclear)--funeral?  I said you know I don't like driving to funerals I said and so I don't go.  She said I'll take you.  And she said we just go up, what's that street over there, Alameda to Palma Street, I think she said, and it's at the mortuary over there.  And that was a girl who grew up in the same community that we did and her parents and my parents, all the kids was playmates and you know what a hickory nut is?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know what pecans are?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, we used to go hickory nut hunting and pecan hunting picking up nuts; that's nuts that you eat.  So, we all grew up together like that and this girl, this lady now, she passed away.  She had cancer.  She said you wanna go to the funeral.  I said oh, I said I hate to.  She said well you say you guys all lived over there in the sticks together.  I said--she said and you oughta wanna go.  I said well I said if you'll take me I'll go.  I said, but you know I don't drive the freeways anymore.  And she said well she said you get dressed and I'll take you up there.  So, we did.  We went to the funeral and they were not going to bury her until the following week because they were gonna to take her to down her--where is now--where they bury a lot of the military people, wherever that place is down this way.  Do you know where that is?  It's a cemetery down that way, huh?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA FEMALE VOICE):  You not talking about--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Somewhere off down that way.  But anyway that's where she was going to the cemetery down there--it's about down by Riverside or back over in that way somewhere, and she was going to be buried there.  And I said well, I said, long as I don't have to go up there and look at the body I said we'll go.  So, we did.  We went there and where we had to be seated it was right behind the family.  We sat there until the services were over and I went over to speak to the other sister.  It was just girls.  I went over to speak to her, so I kept on waiting for my daughter and kept on waiting for her and she didn't come out after we got through talking.  And so when she finally came out I said to her, I said what took you so long.  I said I'm standing out here waiting on you.  She said I was talking to that crazy brother of that lady's, and I said well what's wrong with him, and she said you know what he told me?  I said no.  She said he told me that my daddy stoled you from him.  I said well he told you a lie.  I said your daddy and stole me from nothing (laughter).
Story_ID: 74129
Speaker 1: It kind of ticked me off, you know, and the guy must be eighty years old.  He looks well for his age, you know, and I told her I said well he told you a lie.  I said your daddy didn't steal me from nobody.  I said he was just somebody that wasn't my kind, I didn't want him, I didn't want to be bothered with him.  And she said he told me that he was gonna get his friend, he doesn't drive to well anymore, and he was gonna get his friend to bring him down to see you.  I said you tell him that he has been psyched out if he come creeping up to my house 'cause I don't wanna be bothered with him.  I said, I said when God took my husband he took everything away from me as far as a husband is concerned.  I said I don't wanna be bothered with him.  And then she said well you know what else he told me?  I said no.  She said he told me that he has terminal cancer.  I said and then talking about coming down there.  I said I would blow him out of that door (laughter).  I laughed about it 'cause it tickled me, you know, and old man that old still walking around looking for somebody, you know.  Ought to be trying to get his soul saved to go to Heaven and he around here talking about looking for a wife.  I said, ha, I said no honey.  I said you tell him that.  And so one day this week she said he called her, and she said he asked, she asked him well how did she get his number?  Well, we have a cousin there in Los Angeles [California], but we just call him uncle Benny, he got the number from uncle Benny and called her and told her that he was gonna come up to her house for Thanksgiving because he heard that she was--her husband told her that she was making Thanksgiving dinner.  I said well you tell him I won't be there.  You know people that old, that kind of stuff.  You know I think when--or maybe I'm a peculiar sort of an individual and maybe my, maybe my thoughts are antique, but I think when God took my husband [Ovid Wesley] away from me that was all for me.  I don't want nobody else.  I don't want to be bothered.  I really don't.
Story_ID: 74130
Speaker 1: Ma'am this is different from legacy, but how, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Just remembered as Lillie Wesley.  What else is there for me to be remembered by?  I had a good family.  They treated me well, I treated them well.  I did the best that I possibly could, the best that I knew how, and if I thought that I needed advice then I would get some religious advice because let me tell you that's what we have to live by.  And you do unto others as you wish to be done by because if you don't you gonna pay for it, not me.
