Speaker 1: This [The] HistoryMakers interview is being conducted with Hubert Jones.  The interviewer is [HistoryMaker] Robert C. Hayden, and the videographer is Scott Stearns.  The date is October 14th, and the interview is 2004.  The interview is being held at the home of [HistoryMaker] Mr. Hubie Jones, Commonwealth Avenue, Newton, Massachusetts.  Mr. HistoryMaker would you give me your full name and spell your name for me?
Speaker 2: Hubert Eugene Jones.  H-U-B-E-R-T, E-U-G-E-N-E, J-O-N-E-S.
Speaker 1: And when were your born?
Speaker 2: I was born December 13, 1933.
Speaker 1: And where?
Speaker 2: In the Bronx, New York [New York] at home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You've held many, many positions during your professional career, I guess you're kind of semi-retired, how would you describe your occupation presently?  What are you doing presently?
Speaker 2: Well, presently I have an office at City Year and Urban Youth [Leadership] Corps in Boston [Massachusetts].  I played a role in the formation of City Year when it was an idea.  It is now the major community service program in the country that President [William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton used to establish the AmeriCorps program, and I still mentor the founder and CEO, and that's one of the reasons I'm there, but it's the base from which I continue to do the things I care about in the city.  I'm spending a great deal of time building a Boston Children's Chorus [Boston, Massachusetts], a diverse group of young people from the suburbs, from the inner city, black, Latino, Asian, et cetera, who come together to learn how to sing at a level of high artistic excellence and in the process get to know each other, get to bridge divides which are hard to bridge in this society.  And about five years ago I realized that music is one way to do it, to bring young people together so that they can really learn from each other, prosper together, and have serious social connections, so that's one of, one of the major things I do.

Speaker 1: Before we go back to the beginning of your life and bring it up to these present activities, we have several like People magazine type questions to add some human interest to the beginning of the interview--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and to get a glimpse of your personality.  What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Probably hominy grits, probably hominy grits, which I don't have very often, okay, but--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --I had a mother [Dorcas Robinson Jones] who from the South and that was a staple in our house.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I would say my favorite time of year is fall, right about now, particularly when the leaves turn to color, and it's sunny and brisk.  I would say probably autumn is my favorite time of year.
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Probably, probably blue, and here I am.  Probably blue.
Speaker 1: Your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Oh well I think Hilton Head, South Carolina is probably it.  It's a place we discovered fifteen, sixteen years ago.  It's an oasis.  It's the place I begin to hunger for around May and June, looking forward to July.  So, I would say it's probably Hilton Head, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase or saying that you use often?
Speaker 2: Yeah I would say, yeah, probably, life is not a sixty-yard dash, it's a marathon, and staying the course is the secret to it all.  So, that--I would say that's one of the things I often use.

Speaker 1: We're gonna start looking by at your family background.  And would you start by telling us about your mother?  Give us her name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Dorcas Robinson Jones, after she got married, but her maiden name was Robinson.
Speaker 1: Would you spell Dorcas for us?
Speaker 2: Dorcas, D-O-R-C-A-S.  My mother grew up, was born and raised initially in Abbeville, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: What year was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in 1900; October 21, 1900.  She was the youngest of, I believe it was, seven siblings.  When she was sixteen years of age, in 1916, a black neighbor who was a business man was lynched and dragged through the streets on the back of a truck, pickup truck, and then ultimately hung.  That night she and her family packed up and fled to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  There had already been a beachhead of family members in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, older brothers, sisters, and aunts.  There was another branch of the family in New York City [New York, New York].  She had two sisters who were in New York City, but what was left of the family packed up and headed to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  So, she was sixteen years of age at that time, attended Schenley High School [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] in Pittsburgh where she was in a secretarial program, not an academic program, so she was trained to be a secretary.  After she graduated from Schenley High School, she was basically sent by her Pittsburgh relatives to live with her two sisters in New York City and that's how I got born in New York City.  And when she got to New York City, one of her first secretarial jobs was working for A. Philip Randolph of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters [BSCP] fame.  It was before--I believe it was before the union.  She was really working with him on a newspaper, a magazine, a socialist magazine that he was publishing at the time.  I don't think it was very successful, but so she had, she did secretarial work.
Speaker 1: Did she tell you any stories about her early growing up years in the South or in Pittsburgh to you as you were a youngster growing up?  Were there special things that she told you about her life?
Speaker 2: Well, the lynching and the flight from South Carolina was something which haunted her for all of her life.  I can remember, at age ninety-three, her still tell me about what happened in Abbeville, and so it was an image; it was an experience; it was a pain that never died, that never died.  She talked, you know, she talked happily about Abbeville and you know the relationship she had with friends and neighbors and so forth and so on, even though it was a segregated--a very segregated society, and in fact went back to Abbeville late in life to see people who she hadn't seen for like fifty years or so, and she always rue the day that I never went to see my, part of native home base, that I never got to Abbeville, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: I was going to ask you if you'd ever been?
Speaker 2: I'd never been, and so my mother would give up country about, "What do you mean you're going to Hilton Head, South Carolina, you're in South Carolina what do you mean, why aren't you going over to Abbeville and see, you know, see your roots?" So there was, there was despite the pain and trauma of having left Abbeville due to this lynching, there was a very strong bond with her, with her community.  As you know, Abbeville, South Carolina is also where Ralph Ellison was born [sic. born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], and Ralph Ellison was a cousin of my uncle by marriage, who I ultimately met at my uncle's funeral in New York City, met Ralph Ellison, so Abbeville has a history of some very interesting people.

Speaker 1: What was her [Jones' mother, Dorcas Robinson Jones] life like in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]?  Did she talk to you about coming to Pittsburgh and her--she was fifteen years old?
Speaker 2: Sixteen.
Speaker 1: Sixteen.  Did she talk about her life there to you at all?
Speaker 2: Not really, I mean, she just had a very strong family, you know, in Pittsburgh.  They lived in the Hill District [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], and she had an aunt who, she and her husband ran a funeral business on Wylie Avenue, which was in the heart of the black community in Pittsburgh.  There were a lot of relatives in the Hill District, so she just had a lot of support in terms of going to Schenley High School [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and, and having family who would support her in terms of getting to know the community and being a part of the community and helping her finish her development as a young woman.  And she used to go back to Pittsburgh almost every summer to see relatives.  You will get to my father [Hilma Jones], my father, you know, was a Pullman porter for over forty-four years, and as a result of being a Pullman porter he got passes, free passes for the family to travel, you know, around the country, but it was basically from New York [New York] to Pittsburgh, and so my mother would take many of us with her every summer to, you know to Pittsburgh and that's how I got--that's how I got introduced to Pittsburgh.  So, Pittsburgh had a very strong pull, because of family and she had a very strong southern family, and one measure of that is that whenever anybody from Pittsburgh or wherever, whenever any family member came to New York and wanted to stay you know in our apartment--here we had, there were six kids in our family, I had five sisters, and they were welcomed in and they could stay for as long as they wanted to.  You know, there weren't that many hotels available to black folks, besides the Theresa hotel [Hotel Theresa, New York, New York], which and that came up, but there were not many hotels available to black folks, and people didn't have money, money to stay in a hotel, so you always took in family.  You always took in family, you know, we all doubled up.  The kids would double up and, you know, I had five sisters, but you know we would get, you know we'd all double up, and you made room for people who wanted to come, and they could stay as long as they wanted to--and for some of us kids, they were staying too long, okay, but the idea that you would tell somebody who was, quote unquote, staying too long that it was time for them to move on was absolutely forbidden.  You didn't do that; you took in family, and then whatever they needed, if they were in trouble, you know, had a cousin who got pregnant, and she was sent to New York to stay with us and have the baby and to you know and to just not--'cause they didn't want people in Pittsburgh to know what was going on and she, and she stayed with us for, I don't know, three years or so.
Story_ID: 237510
Speaker 1: Tell me about your mother [Dorcas Robinson Jones] as a person, her personality.  What was she like as a person?  How do you remember her?
Speaker 2: My mother--there was a fun part of her.  I think that was exhibited when her brothers, who ran on the road, who were also Pullman porters--. She had two brothers who were Pullman porters who lived in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], and so they'd come to New York [New York] and they'd come up to stay, to see her, and some of them would stay overnight.  And it was a real scene.  They would just be going at each other playing the dozens, you know, making fun of each other's issues and kids, and you know, and they would just, and they would be laughing, and they'd be laughing all night, and the neighbor upstairs would say the next morning, "Mrs. Jones, I know your brothers must have been in town, 'cause I heard you all laughing all night."  And her brothers really had an extraordinary sense of humor, and they were funny as they could be and so they would rib her and then make fun, they'd make fun of my father [Hilma Jones], you know, to sort of get her, get her going.  One story, they said, "You know, we were in town, and we went down to the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters [BSCP] and we asked to see H. E. Jones, and you know that guy had the nerve to go to the secretary, and said, 'Well, I don't think I have an appointment with these guys, are they on my calendar?' (laughter)," okay, and, and she told them, "Oh, won't you--won't you stop?"  "Oh yeah, you know, he thinks he's hot shot.  He thinks he's big time, okay," anyway so, I mean that's when, I mean, when you wanted to see the full force of her, you know, her joking and frivolity and just sort of give and take and banter and so forth, it was seen full force when her brothers came to town, and so that was, I mean that was a piece of her personality.  She also was a very quiet determination and steel, also.  To get a measure of this as I indicated earlier she graduated from Schenley High School [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] in Pittsburgh with a secretarial degree.  When my two younger sisters were in high school, Morris High School [New York, New York], up the street from where we lived in the South Bronx [New York, New York], she decided that she wanted to go back to school.  So, she went back to high school at Morris High School at night to get an academic high school degree, and she graduated with my two sisters.  And after she got her bachelor's [degree], I mean, her high school degree, she enrolled in Hunter College [New York, New York] at night and after seven years she got a bachelor's in early education.  Now at the time she was doing all of this, she was working in a day care center in our neighborhood, DeForest House [ph.] day care center in the kitchen, and so she was working in the kitchen and going to school, you know, at night, high school first and then college, and then when she graduated from college seven years later, she was brought out of the kitchen, and she became an elementary aide, an early childhood teacher in this day care program, and then she went back to school at night and got a master's degree.  And when she got her master's degree, they made her a supervising teacher, and she retired when she was seventy years old, and if there wasn't a mandatory retirement age at that time she'd have been working, I don't know she thought it was absolutely outrageous, you know, they were forcing her give--you know, she was ready to continue, she could continue to teach.  So, that's, I think that's a window on the kind of determination, you know and to--you know, to improve, to improve oneself, to elevate oneself, to take advantage of education and so forth--
Story_ID: 237511
Speaker 1: She [Jones' mother, Dorcas Robinson Jones] did all kinds of work, you know, you know in order to--you know, my father [Hilma Jones] was a Pullman porter, they have six kids; not a lot of money coming into this house, right.  So, she worked part-time for a man who owned a crystal business.  He had a showroom downtown New York [New York], and she would go in and polish the crystals and dust the, you know, dust the showroom and take care of the showroom, but she would come home with a suitcase full of his dirty clothes, and she would wash the clothes and iron them, and then she would take them back, 'cause you know that was one of the things that she did in terms of--for many, many years, in order to bring more income into the house.  She also worked at the polls every election day, which gave her, which gave her a little bit of money.  She, yeah, so there was you know--oh, she also worked at night, my father not even knowing it.  She got away with it, the fact, 'cause she was working at night when--for about I would think probably for five years, in an office building I would say probably three or four miles from where we lived, and it was sort of hush, hush, 'cause my father was on the road, railroad and he would come, then I don't what he ever knew or when he knew it, but part of that was, she also had this drive that she wanted us to have a house.  There was this dream I got to have--almost like '[A] Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry], you know, "I'm gonna," you know, "we're gonna have this."  We keep talking about we're gonna have this house; okay, we're gonna get out of South Bronx [New York, New York] and we're gonna move to Williamsbridge [Bronx, New York, New York], which is sort of you know upper East Bronx [sic. north central Bronx, New York, New York], and so she worked very hard to save money to do this, but it didn't happen until I was out of the house.  I was married.  It happened, in fact, the year after I got married; she finally purchased this house up in the Gun Hill Road section up near Co-op City [Cooperative City, Bronx, New York, New York].  In fact, her brothers, one of the things they used to do in terms of teasing her is they used to say, "You're not gonna buy any house; come on, you look at the money--which we know you can't give up--and you look at the house, and then you say, 'No, I want to hold on to my money.'"  Then he would say, he said, "So we don't want to hear about it anymore," you know, "we don't wanna hear about it anymore," and they used to josh her and rib her and say, "you're not gonna buy any house, come on, you know, you can't, you can't give up your money."  And it was true that she was very, very frugal, you know, and saved, you know, very well, I mean, and I just couldn't remember, shortly before she died, she said, "I need to tell you some stuff, you know, I don't know what's gonna happen, I need to tell you some stuff."  And then she revealed how much money she had saved.  You know, my father had been dead not thirty years; she was supporting herself and she'd save up--she saved a bundle of cash, which she, you know, left to her children.  So, you get a sense of somebody who is disciplined, driven.  You know, she was very religious.  You know in a Pentecostal church, you know, salvation and all that.  Very, very strong piece of who she was, you know, trying to convert her kids until she died, you know, "You gotta get right--" you know that was a very, very strong piece.
Story_ID: 237512
Speaker 1: Can you tell me anything about her [Jones' mother, Dorcas Robinson Jones] parents?  Did you know your maternal grandparents?
Speaker 2: I knew--did not know my grandfather, 'cause he was dead long before I came along.  My grandmother, Cynthia Robinson, lived next door in the--I lived in apartment building, 821 East 166 Street in the South Bronx [New York, New York].  At 823 next apartment building I had an aunt, my mother's oldest sister, my Aunt Kate [ph.], who was--who took care of her mother, and my mother would come over and provide some help as well, but it was my aunt who really took care of her.  She was a very depressed woman, very depressed.  I would say homebound.  I don't think she ever went out.  And so she was--as a child, it was kind of somewhat disturbing, because you were dealing with someone who just didn't have much affect, you know, in terms of engaging or anything like this, and she was just--she was a woman who had, at one point, you know, I think, a serious mental health breakdown, postpartum, okay.  I think some of that had to do with, you know, her husband who then was messing around with some other woman, and she was having a baby, and so she went into a serious postpartum depression, and I don't know whether she really ever got out of that depressive state, but I just knew her as a very kind of solitary, withdrawn depressed person.
Story_ID: 237513
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father.  Give me his name, when he was born, and where your father was born.
Speaker 2: My father's name was Hilma Eugene Jones, H-I-L-M-A, Eugene Jones.  He was born in Springfield, Missouri, on a small farm.  He was born in 1980, excuse me 1998.
Speaker 1: Eighteen ninety-eight [1898].
Speaker 2: Eighteen ninety-eight [1898].  Did I say--1898, excuse me, 1898.  He was born 1898.  He was the oldest of eight children, and he went to Lincoln University in [Jefferson City] Missouri; excellent student, was a valedictorian of his class, wanted to be a doctor and should have been; wanted to be a doctor.  I would say my father is probably the smartest person I've ever known, in terms of raw intelligence.  He had an amazing mind.  When he was at Lincoln University, in order to support himself and his tuition, during the summers he worked as a Pullman porter substituting for men who were on vacation, and that's how he got into The Pullman Company, and so after college instead of going on to medical school or whatever, he got hooked up with my mother [Dorcas Robinson Jones] in New York [New York] through a mutual friend; they got married, and his ambition to go on in terms of academic and professional stuff got short circuited.  And as you know at that time, we're talking about the late 1990s [sic.], you know 1919, 1917, you know, at that time, you know the best job for black men were either as Pullman porters or in the post office or in the dining car service, and so he had a good job okay, a very good job compared to what was available to black men.  And so he got stuck being a Pullman porter for forty-four years, but he found a way to use his brains.  He found a way to use his brains by volunteering to work for the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters [BSCP], and so he would--one of the major things he did was he was basically a legal advocate for men, for porters, who were charged with misdeeds while they were working on the railroad.  They were charged with stealing.  They were charged with messing with a passenger; they were--all, all kinds of things.
Story_ID: 237514
Speaker 1: How did you know all this?  How did you learn all this?
Speaker 2: Oh, he [Jones' father, Hilma Jones] would tell us.  Oh, he would tell us about it, because there times when he would dramatize some of the interplay that went on when he was representing these men before management.  He had to go before--they would have to go before a hearing, okay, and he'd put their case together, and he would go like a lawyer, you know with a brief and everything, and he would represent them.  You know ,and I remember one time, he was walking around the living room saying, "Can you imagine, you know, this Pullman Company official sort of tries to threaten me because you know my case, I mean, I'm being very successful in prosecuting my case for this guy, and the guy sort of sniffs and says, 'Remember, Mr. Jones, you work for The Pullman Company,' he said, so I turned around to the stenographer, and I said, 'Is that on the record?  Is that on the record?  That's in violation of the [National] Labor Relations Board [NLRB]--" okay, and the guy turns red.  He says, you know, he was sort of--in the room, telling us about it, he says, "You know, this guy, I took him to the wall; I took him to the wall."  So I, so we learned about it by him telling us about some of these cases, and some of them were very funny, you know.  Some of them were very funny, and some of them not so funny, guys mess with women and--. So he, but basically he was very successful in representing these folks and in most cases getting them off.  And in fact there was one story he told us about--somebody associated with the porters took a brief he had written and showed it to a lawyer from a big company, a big law firm downtown New York [New York], and the guy said, "There is no way a non-lawyer wrote this brief."  (Unclear)--and so he got, he got a lot of satisfaction out of that.  He was always, in terms of using his brain power, and he was always, beside you know the work with the union, he learned really to be an accountant, and he would do income taxes you know during income tax season, and people would be tripping into the house to get their tax--I mean, it would be late into the night, and they'd be coming in and late into the night.  It started by helping men on the road do their income taxes, and that was a lot of what he did, but then people in the community started coming in and asking him to do his income taxes.  And he took these accountant courses, correspondence courses, you know, which he aced.
Speaker 1: How did he find the time to take these courses and work on these income taxes when, the Pullman porter work, you were gone five, six, ten days at a time, you're back, you're gone overnight?
Speaker 2: You have a lot of downtime once you get to a city, okay, and you also have downtime when you're on, you know, when you're on the road, when the passengers are sleeping.  Once you had the passengers tucked in bed, okay, and you've shined their shoes--'cause they always left their shoes out there at their berth for you to shine--once you got that done, you had a lot of time, okay, and he had a very quick mind, voracious mind.  One of the reasons I knew he was smart, I never saw anybody take The New York Times Sunday crossword puzzle and zip it off like he would do.  And one of the things he did was he would--he always came back with magazines he picked up.  He ran on the 20th Century Limited from New York to Chicago [Illinois].  It was where the industrialists were travelling, okay, so he had a contact with all these business people, and they would leave their magazine.  They'd leave The Wall Street Journal.  They'd leave all the business stuff--and he would, he'd just pick all that stuff up, and he would read it, I mean, he, you know, it was another form of education.  He had a graduate education via all of the material he was reading left by these business folks plus the discussions he had with them around all of this, and I remember I think I was, maybe I was a senior in high school [at Morris High School, Bronx, New York, New York], yeah, I think a senior in high school, maybe a freshman in college [The City College of New York, New York, New York], and I remember this one afternoon, one Sunday afternoon and we're in the living room with my father, my oldest sisters' two boyfriends and were having this political discussion, and my father said, "Listen, I want you all to remember that it's all about oil; it's all about oil.  That's what drives the economics and the politics of the world; remember it."  At that time, it went over my head, now a few later years when all this stuff is being revealed, okay.  Okay, so that was another way in which he kept his mind very active--
Story_ID: 237515
Speaker 1: Your father [Hilma Jones] was in a occupation in which the members of that working group had to unionize.  Tell me about your father's relationship with what became the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters [BSCP], the organizing of the [Pullman] porters?
Speaker 2: Well, he was not involved in the organizing of the porters.  He was not there at the beginning in terms of being a part of the, you know, the group of [C.L.] Dellums from California, who was the uncle to [HistoryMaker] Ron Dellums, the congressman and [Thomas] Patterson who was running the eastern zone, New York [New York] and [Milton P.] Webster was running Chicago [Illinois], the mid-section of the country, in terms of the Pullman porters' organization.  He was not there to be a part of the all the threats they had from The Pullman Company.  You know, I mean, these folks were threatened with loss of their jobs.  These folks were threatened with all kinds of reprisals, so he did not go through that cruel bath, you know, that baptism of fire, okay.  And as a result of that, he was never in the inner circle, at the top of the Brotherhood of Sleep[ing] Car Porters.  I mean, he worked with these guys, and they respected him, you know, and the work he did on a volunteer basis and a legal advocate and several other things.  So, when a major position came open with the retirement of Tom Patterson to run the eastern, eastern zone, which he, I think, really covered it, it didn't happen.  It was given to somebody else who was not even as qualified, et cetera, et cetera, but it was somebody who had been a part of the initial group that had gone through the fire.  So, I think that, that crushed him.  Never said it, but you had to know it crushed him because here was an opportunity, one, to get off the railroad and being a porter and taking, and having a management position where you not only are using your brains, but you have a status, almost a professional status within the union.  I mean, a measure of the fact that he was highly regarded by his peers and his colleagues.  A. Philip Randolph gave the eulogy at my father's funeral, and it was quite an honor for me.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-one, 1961.  In my house Randolph was referred to as the chief.  "The chief says--," "the chief says--," "the chief says--," "the chief says--," "the chief says--."
Speaker 1: When was the last time you saw A. Philip Randolph?  Do you recall your last times with him?
Speaker 2: The last time I saw A. Philip Randolph was at my father's funeral, and I only met him one time before.  Shortly after I got married, my father invited me and Kathy [HistoryMaker Katherine Jones], my wife, to the headquarters at 125th Street, and he introduced me to A. Philip Randolph.  He introduced us to A. Philip Randolph (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 237516
Speaker 1: Just before we leave your family, tell me a little bit about your father's [Hilma Jones] parents, his--your paternal grandparents?
Speaker 2: I know very little about my paternal, excuse me, my grandfather.  I knew my grandmother [Edna McCollough Jones], his mother, a short, tough sweet woman really unbelievable.  This is a woman who ran a farm, okay, after her husband was dead, and she lived until a ripe old age.  She was, yeah, you just had a feeling, somebody with enormous strength, enormous strength, quiet smarts.  I think my father was alike, a lot like her okay.  I have a daughter who reminds me very much of her, my daughter Renee [Jones], reminds me very much of her grandmother, just kind of quiet, smart, you know, determination.  And she'd come to New York [New York] to visit, so that's how we got to know her.
Story_ID: 237517
Speaker 1: Let's move to your growing up years.  Where did you grow up?  Tell me a little bit about your neighborhood, the street you lived on.  What was it like growing up, as a youngster?
Speaker 2: I grew up in the South Bronx [New York, New York] on 166th Street between Prospect [Avenue] and Union Avenue about three or four blocks from the high school I went to, Morris High School [Bronx, New York, New York].  When I was, when I was very young growing up, it was a mixed neighborhood, black and Jewish.  I would say that was from age one to maybe seven or so.  Then it became a solid black working class neighborhood, and there was a lot of support, 'cause a lot of the people had also living there had moved from the South, so you had the southern way of connecting and looking out for each other, and you know, you on the street doing the wrong thing, somebody is looking out the window saying, "What are you doing?  What's that language I hear?  You want me to tell your mother about that?" you know, so there were people looking out for you as surrogate parents and so forth.  I would say by the time I became a teenager my neighborhood cracked.  There was a--the solid working class neighborhood began to experience gang warfare, drugs a-plenty, literally gangs fighting on the street, okay, so it deteriorated.  Absentee landlords began to take--that phenomenon took over, so that there was a decline in the buildings and the services that one was supposed to get.  I remember my oldest sisters being devastated when The Bronx Home News, the local community newspaper, ran a story with a front page picture of our house on it, and the caption was "The dirtiest house in the Bronx," which showed garbage cans piled up in front of this apartment building.  At that time, the newspaper was crusading against the lack of city services, and so they used this picture as an example of the fact that the city wasn't picking up garbage and collecting--so much so my sister was saying, "Oh my God, what are my boyfriends going to be thinking, man?  My house is the dirtiest house in the Bronx, I'm on the front page in The Bronx Home News, oh my Lord," okay.  So we went through that whole trip of sort of the physical decay and the loss of services in terms of your apartment buildings.
Speaker 1: How did all of this affect you?
Speaker 2: Well, it was tough, I mean I had a longing to get beyond this.  Okay, I had a longing, and that's one of the reasons I left New York [New York] and got out.  You know I just wanted to get out of the South Bronx and get beyond this pathology.  But in the midst of all that, of course, there was still families that were taking care of business.  You know, kids going to college, you know, getting of high school, you know and going to college, you know, getting jobs as teachers, and one guy on the top floor became a major official in the United Nations [UN], you know which we thought was terrific, and someone married a doctor.  So, but for me it was, you know, I got tired of mice and bed bugs and all that stuff that we went through when I was a teenager.  Saturday's being, getting a candle and burning bed bugs out of the springs and all that sort of stuff.  So it had an impact.  I think the impact it had was more like, you know, "I'm gonna get beyond this," you know, "I'm gonna--" you know, "my ticket out of here is The City College of New York [New York, New York] from the day I was born basically, so my parents [Dorcas Robinson Jones and Hilma Jones] made it quite clear that there were free colleges, very good free colleges, City College of New York, Hunter College [New York, New York], et cetera, in New York [New York] and you had a ticket to mobility.  You had a ticket to mobility, so the message was you keep your academic stuff together, you know, you do--you are--you will do well academically in elementary school [at P.S. 023, The New Children's School, Bronx, New York, New York], junior high school [at P.S. 051, Bronx New School, Bronx, New York, New York], and high school.
Story_ID: 237518
Speaker 1: So, before you got to the college level [at The City College of New York, New York, New York] tell me about your elementary school experience and your high school experience.  What schools did you go to, and what was school like for you?
Speaker 2: Ah, this was the good news.  Schools were a safe haven, okay, in the midst of all this stuff I'm talking about, particularly when I got to the high school level.  There were teachers who were committed to teaching and you know believing that one could learn and on the basis of that teaching and expecting you to learn and to prosper.  Parents were engaged with the school.  My mother [Dorcas Robinson Jones] was very, very engaged with the school.  If there were any issues, she was up there.  It was kind of this, you know, litany, caravan of Jones kids, you know, going through the P.S. 023 [The New Children's School, Bronx, New York, New York], which was the elementary school we went to.  So, it was, for me, it was a positive experience, you know, I did well academically.  That was validated through awards that I got.  The biggest thing that happened to me was I got in fifth or sixth grade, sixth grade I guess I was made a school guard with a white thing that I wore, you know, the director, direct kids and so forth.  That was a big deal.  Yeah, so school was, you know, it was a safe place, and it was a nurturing place.  And then I had to--so by the time I was getting ready to go to junior high school and sort of the gang stuff was beginning, you know, and all that kind of anti-social stuff was beginning.  It was the whole stuff about the junior high school not being really good places, maybe, and you were gonna get into conflict, you were gonna get yourself in a whole lot of mess.  So, I went to P.S. 051 [Bronx New School, Bronx, New York, New York] at junior high school, which was a good walk from where lived.  I would say it was at least fifteen blocks away or more, and there were issues.  At that time a Puerto Rican community had come around the junior high school where I lived--that I went to, and there were then some fights between African American youth gangs and Puerto Rican youth gangs, the Puerto Rican Tigers and the Slicksters were sometimes battling right in the school okay.  There were many days where I, in order to avoid all of this, I would flee to the public library, which was about three blocks from the school, and that would be my haven to stay out of this stuff and to you know read and write.  There were librarians who, you know, gave you stuff to read and who you got to know and so that was, the library was like a really important haven when I was in junior high school.  From junior high school, I went to Morris High School [Bronx, New York, New York].  I very much wanted to go to [The] Bronx [High School of] Science [Bronx, New York, New York], which was an exam school.  I missed getting into Bronx Science I think by one or two points, and I thought my life was over.  How was I gonna come home and tell my parents that I didn't get into Bronx High School of Science?  But, the fortunate thing was that at that time the district high schools worked.  Morris High School had a very strong academic program, and if you took care of business, it was no question you'd be prepared to go The City College of New York [New York, New York], you know, and which we know--which happened.  That was the case for I think district high schools in New York at that time across the board.  So if I didn't go to Morris High School, I went to [William Howard] Taft [High School, Bronx, New York, New York] or I went to [Theodore] Roosevelt [High School, Bronx, New York, New York], or Evander Childs [High School, Bronx, New York, New York] or DeWitt Clinton [High School, Bronx, New York, New York].  All of those district high schools had strong academic programs, so you didn't have to get into an exam school like you have to do today in Boston [Massachusetts] in order to have a shot at being equipped, you know, to get into a college and to prosper in college.
Story_ID: 237519
Speaker 1: As you moved through Morris High School [Bronx, New York, New York], did you have any notions or beginning ideas about what you wanted to do after high school in terms of career?  Did you have any aspirations at that point?
Speaker 2: No.  I'll tell you what happened though for me.  One of the things that happened for me at Morris High School, I would say by the time I was in the eleventh grade, I had this idea that I wanted to be a leader, okay, that I wanted to be a leader, and that got nourished by the fact that I ran to be the vice president of the student organization, and my best buddy and I, Alfredo Mathew [ph.] ran to be the president.  We ran together as a team.  I had to make this speech before this crowded auditorium, you know, to support my candidacy, and I just blew everybody away, and I would say from that day on, you know, the response to my speech and the fact that I overwhelmingly won to be the vice president of the school, and I was then acting in very, in a big major leadership way around all kinds of issues.  I feel the notion that I wanted to be a leader.  I had no idea what that meant, where I'd be a leader, but I, you know, I had this concept, you know, I wanted to be a leader.  So I would say that that was the, that was a positive, that was a positive thing about Morris High School for me.
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers at Morris High that were particular influential in your moving through high school or meant something to you personally, even beyond academics?
Speaker 2: There was no one person.  There was no one person.  There was a Mrs. Levinson [ph.] who looked over the student organization, was like the, I had a lot of contact, I had a lot of contact with her.  So, there was no, there was no one person.  When I left Morris High School and went to The City College of New York [New York, New York] in 1951, I thought I was going to be a public school teacher and think that just grew out of the fact that I came out of a family of public school teachers.  You know my two oldest sisters were public school teachers.  They ultimately became principals.  You know, I come out of this public education thing and that was sort of where I was sort of headed, and that got turned around.  There two things that turned it around.  When I was sophomore, I took a sociology course, and one of the requirements in the course was that I had to do a kind of internship, community service in a community service agency.  Everybody had to do that as part of the course and write a paper about it--and I decided to work in the community center in my neighborhood P.S. ninety, [P.S.] 99 [Bronx, New York, New York], had a community center, after school into the night.  And I was assigned to a group to work with in the afternoon, one afternoon a week to work with a group of latency aged kids.
Speaker 1: What?
Speaker 2: Latency aged kids, okay, nine to eleven.  And my supervisor was a professional social worker who had graduated from Case Western Reserve [University, Cleveland, Ohio]--a professional social group worker, and she liked the work that I did, and she began to work with me about social work okay.  Also, about that time, I was a counselor at the Ethical Culture [Fieldston] School [New York, New York] camp [Encampment for Citizenship] in Cooperstown, New York, which is where I met my wife Kathy [HistoryMaker Katherine Jones], and I was a counselor, and I was very good working with kids, young people, and there were a couple of social workers there who said to me, who had graduated from the New York School of Social Work, then New York School, now it's Columbia University School of Social Work [New York, New York], who said to me, "You know, you ought to think about social work.  You ever thought about social work?  You know, it's an interesting profession, you know," talking to me--So, it was a combination of that, plus the combination of experience I had at the community center in my neighborhood.  And in addition to that, I was coaching basketball teams in my neighborhood, in that community center at night, a basketball team that I coached for a number of years through college, and so I was working with kids again now and I really, you know, was really good at, you know, really good at that.
Story_ID: 237520
Speaker 1: --I would guess the other powerful thing that happened to me at [The] City College [of New York, New York, New York], which also pushed me towards this social service, social policy stuff, I had Dr. Kenneth [B.] Clark, the noted African American psychologist, as my teacher in my introduction psychology course, and at that time, Dr. Clark was--he had put together the social science team for Brown v. the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], and he talked with us about it class.  In fact, he came in with the brief one day.  He said, "This is our brief," you know, "that we're taking to the [U.S.] Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court of the United States has never accepted a social science brief, and in fact the lawyers at the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] some of them don't think it's a good idea, but finally Thurgood Marshall says, 'Yeah, let's go with it.'  So, here's the brief, you know, and this brief basically is to document that separation of children by race is damaging to black kids. What do you think?  Is the evidence there?"  You know, was evidence there?  This is a kind of headache you know, whoa, you know, and then he, then Dr. Clark went to the court, you know, went to the Supreme Court to argue, and he'd come back and tell us about it, okay.  So, I saw a black academic who's a terrific scholar, but who was prepared to use his knowledge to push for social change, serious social change for black folks.  And it was a model that I found to be very, very powerful, and so when I got into academia by a fluke, and you'll learn about that later.  When I got into academia by a fluke, my model was Kenneth Clark okay, and I used with my classes something that he said to my class at the end of the semester.  With every class I ever had when I was at School of Social Work at BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] I would say exactly what Clark said to me, said to our class, and that was--last day, this is what he said, "Look, the college requires me to give you a grade; I really don't want to do it, 'cause I think it's irrelevant, but I'm gonna do it; I'm compelled to do it.  But, the grade I really want to give you is when I come meet you five years from now or ten years from now, and I say, like, 'What have you done?  Have you used your knowledge and what you've learned in college to make a difference?'  That's the grade I want to give you.  That's the grade I want to give you.  That's the real grade."  And every once in a while, when I met Ken Clark over the course of my life, he'd say, "Is it time for me to grade you?" and I say, "Oh, Ken Clark, not now, not right--not yet.'"
Speaker 2: I wanna just digress a little bit--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and it's kind of off the track, but when was the last time you saw Dr. Clark?  Have you seen him recently?
Speaker 1: No, I haven't seen him.  I haven't seen him recently.  I saw him at an event in New York.  His daughter [Kate Miriam Clark Harris] ended up working for me when I ran the Roxbury Multi-Service Center [Boston, Massachusetts] for a while, and we became friends.  So, I hear a lot about Dr. Clark.  He's not in very good shape, but it's amazing that's he's living.  He's almost, he just had a ninetieth birthday, and the reason I say it's amazing he's living is he was a chain smoker, and so he'd be in class, one cigarette after the next, okay, and that went on for life, but here he is ninety years of age and so forth.  But no, he's very fragile and all the rest, but he was a powerful model--
Story_ID: 237521
Speaker 1: The combination of all of those things led me to a profession, which I perceived was about social change, societal change.  I mean, once I understood what social work was about, beyond the clinical stuff that you hear a great deal about, that the historic mission of social work is about societal change, okay, I mean that's what got the social work profession started, you know, and that I got hooked into, and so I decided I wanted to be a social worker, and then when I was a senior I applied to Case Western Reserve [University, Cleveland, Ohio] which had the best group work program.  I knew I wanted to be a social group worker and work with young people, and in Boston University School of Social Work [Boston, Massachusetts], 'cause I knew I wanted to get outside, out of New York [New York].  I applied and got into both of those schools.  Thought I was going to Cleveland [Ohio], and then I decided to go to Boston [Massachusetts], because we had some friends who lived in Cambridge [Massachusetts], old friends of the family that had a room on Dana Street in Cambridge that I could have for next to nothing, and then getting back and forth between New York and Boston was easier than getting back from Cleveland to New York and so for financial reasons, but also I got taken by the city when I came up for an interview, and the faculty at BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] was saying we want you to come.
Speaker 2: So you went direct from [The] City College of New York [New York, New York]--
Speaker 1: To the Boston University School of Social Work.
Speaker 2: That following September.
Speaker 1: That following September in 1957.
Speaker 2: Okay, now--
Speaker 1: Fifty-five [1955], excuse me, 1955.
Speaker 2: Fifty-five [1955].
Speaker 1: When did you get married?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-seven [1957], shortly after I got my [master of social work] degree. I got my degree in June, in May of 1957, and in December of 1957 Kathy [HistoryMaker Katherine Jones] and I got married.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your experiences at the BU School of Social Work.  What were those two years like for you?
Speaker 2: They were good years for, you know, I mean, I had a great group work education.  I was placed in two agencies to do my field work that, you know, was--were very important to my development in terms of understanding social work and what I wanted to do.  My first year placement was at the Roxbury Neighborhood House [Boston, Massachusetts] where I worked in a settlement house with young people, and my second year was at the Boston Children's Services Association [sic. Boston Children's Service Association, Boston, Massachusetts] on Beacon Hill [Boston, Massachusetts] where I worked with disturbed and physically handicapped young people in groups, okay.
Speaker 1: In your first position, did you work out in the neighborhoods (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the neighborhood.  I was in the neighborhood with kids, yeah, I had kids.
Speaker 1: On the street, on the corners?
Speaker 2: No, not on the corners.  No, I wasn't a street worker or a gang worker.  I was working with kids in the neighborhood.  I had groups that worked, that, that worked in the neighborhood house, but we took them out for activities and other places and so forth.  But, I would say also what happened is that my leadership stuff got confirmed because I was elected to be the president of the class at BU and so you know I was, you know I was looked up to by my peers as someone who could provide leadership, and, you know, and I did, and when I graduated, I was sort of declared to be man of the year, head of the School of Social Work and all that sort of stuff.  So I would say that the School of Social Work, by the time I got out of School of Social Work I had some clarity about, you know, wanting to make a difference; be a leader.
Story_ID: 237522
Speaker 1: I would say while I was at, my first year in the School of Social Work [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts], you know, I had this powerful experience. It was October 26th, 1958 [sic. October 28th, 1956].  I went to hear [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., speak at the Ford Hall Forum, and he had come, this was eight months after the start of the Montgomery bus boycott, okay, and so we didn't know whether he was going to be able to keep his agreed appointment to speak, because things were turbulent in the South, and you know the boycott was still going on over there.  So, I got to Jordan Hall [Boston, Massachusetts] like I don't know about an hour before, way, or two hours before, you know, it was to start and I was maybe about seventh or eighth in line, so I got myself a good seat in the middle of Jordan Hall, okay, and the place filled up rapidly.  It was electric.  It was electric, I mean, you just could feel the--I can still feel the energy that was perking, waiting to see this new leader who had burst onto the national scene.  Everybody was just, the place was jammed, just electric with anticipation.  Onto the stage walks Martin Luther King with Judge Lurie.  Judge Lurie was the moderator, and the place goes wild.
Speaker 2: How do you spell Lurie?
Speaker 1: Lurie.  I think it's L, L-U-R-I-E, Judge Lurie, Reuben [L.] Lurie, and Judge Lurie introduces Martin Luther King, Jr.; he walks to the podium.  I don't think he had a note, without a note, and out of his mouth comes this amazing oratory, okay.  It was a combination--he turned Jordan Hall into a combination of church and political rally.  But before he did that, he established an intellectual foundation for what he was going to talk about, and he was into [Georg Wilhelm Friedrich] Hegel.  He was into [Mahatma] Gandhi.  He was into [Friedrich] Nietzche.  He--oh, you know, I'm sitting here saying, "Whoa!  Whoa, whoa, whoa," and after it was over, of course, when he finished the whole place rose as one and went wild, and I left Jordan Hall that night, and I had an experience I've never had ever in life.  In fact, I thought I had flipped out.  I was so pumped up by what I had experienced, I was so pumped up, so proud, so, I mean, elevated.  I was walking down Huntington Avenue from Gainsborough Street to Massachusetts Avenue to catch the bus back to Cambridge [Massachusetts] where I was staying, and it felt like my feet weren't touching the ground.  I literally thought I was levitating.  I mean, I was, I mean it was like, I thought I was nuts.  I mean, I thought I was (laughter), "What--what is this?" you know.  But, that was the impact that he had on me.  And I would say that that was probably a personal watershed for me, in terms of my commitment to, when I got out of School of Social Work, to use my--my whatever-I-had to be a part of this movement to change the country, the city and so forth--
Story_ID: 237523
Speaker 1: You came to Boston [Massachusetts] to go to the Boston University School of Social Work [Boston, Massachusetts].  You completed that work in two years, listening to [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] in Boston was a major turning point in your feeling and your thinking.  Tell me about the city of Boston in the mid-'50s [1950s] when you were a social work student.  What was the city like?  What was going on?  How did it feel to you?
Speaker 2: Well, when I first got here, I was aware that Boston was not New York [New York].  There were just things that were--you know, first of all, just a skyline that was not there basically.  I liked the fact that it was a compact city.  I, you know, I liked the urban necklace and the Emerald Necklace and all of that and so forth.  I liked the educational resources that were here, the lectures, the intellectual stimulation that you had access to and so forth.  The more I stay here, for me, I call the '50s [1950s] being up south.  There were no bus drivers or motormen running the subways.  You could not find a salesperson of color in the downtown department stores.  Any folks of color were in the stockrooms or on the receiving docks.  So the invisibility of blacks in the workforce of the city downtown was kind of disturbing.  You know, you had a school system that had, you know, very few black teachers with a growing black population.  No black principals at all.  You had segregation in the housing, in public housing.  Very clear, you know, and very rigid.  So, there were just patterns of racial exclusion everywhere.  So I, you know, so I said, in some senses, it was like Boston, you know, Boston being up south.  But, Boston also had a history of abolition.  It had a history of groups and people who were, you know, trying to forge change; that was attractive.  And all of that came to be revealed when we got into the 1960s, and specifically 1963, when the simmering pressure cooker in the black community--the top finally blew off around the whole business of segregation in the Boston public school--de facto segregation in the Boston Public Schools [BPS].
Story_ID: 237524
Speaker 1: And at that time, of course, I was attracted to the civil rights activities that were going on in the city [Boston, Massachusetts], and in 1963, around April of 1963, I came up with an idea to have a work stoppage [Stop Day] to protest all forms of racial discrimination in Boston [Massachusetts], and I got into an alliance with [HistoryMaker] Mel King, a leader in the South End [Boston, Massachusetts], at that time running a settlement house in the South End, the South End House [Boston, Massachusetts].  And Mel King agreed that this was a good tactic and that we should try to see if we could make it happen, if we had people in the community who thought it was a good thing to do, and the idea took off.
Speaker 2: Who else was involved this initiative besides Mel King?
Speaker 1: Well, we first went to NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and Tom Atkins [Thomas I. Atkins] who was then a new executive secretary of the NAACP, a new kid on the block.  He initially thought it was a good idea, until his board and the established NAACP leader said, "No way; you got to disassociate yourself from this."  They made it quite clear that they did not support it.  A lot of it--I think that basically had to do with here was [HistoryMaker] Hubie Jones living in Newton [Massachusetts], just coming into the community you know with no track record of any kind trying to pull off a major action, a major leadership action.  If I had not been in an alliance with Mel King, I'd have been crucified, literally, I mean--
Speaker 2: Where there other individuals beside Mel King who supported your initiative?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, there were people from, oh yeah, there were folks throughout the South End, Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] and Dorchester [Boston, Massachusetts].  When the idea got abroad in the community about staying off from work, you know, you couldn't get into a taxi without people asking you--
Speaker 2: Who were some of the people who joined this initiative 'cause some of them may be interviewed for The HistoryMakers, and I'm just--
Speaker 1: Oh, oh there was, oh what's his name [Father Nathan Wright] at Saint Cyprian's [Episcopal] Church [Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts].  Oh anyway, I, but there, I mean, there were, you know, there were grassroots leaders, Boston Northern Student Movement [NSM].  That's where I first met Julian Houston, [HistoryMaker] Sarah-Ann Shaw.  You know, there were a whole set of folks doing grassroots stuff that sort of, you know, liked the idea and became a part of organizing it.  And the NAACP basically tried to stop it.  And it was this famous meeting on June 13th, 1963, where Ed Brooke [HistoryMaker Edward Brooke], the then attorney general, called the black community leadership together to talk about all these actions that were being move--that were moving and that were beginning to threaten the status quo in the city, and white leadership was becoming quite concerned.  And basically they called on Ed Brooke to quiet these folks down.  Okay, so there was this famous meeting up at the St. Marks Social Center [Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts] with all the leadership in the black community there, and I got a call from  Jim Breeden [HistoryMaker James Breeden].  Jim Breeden who was leading a possible school stay-out, called a Stay Out for Freedom, which was going to be on the 18th of July [sic. June 18, 1963], I believe of '63 [1963], okay.  I got a call from him saying, "Hey," he'll be there at this meeting, "where are you?  You know Ed Brooke is here; he's going through all the actions.  I've just been through the gauntlet in terms of what is this school boycott, why am I doing it--and Stop is coming up for consideration in about twenty minutes.  Mel King's in the room, but you better get down here okay."  So, I walked into this crowded basement hall with all the leadership, [HistoryMaker] Elma Lewis out in the front, and everybody, going through this thing with Ed Brooke.  He's sitting up there looking movie star smooth and going through this stuff.
Story_ID: 237525
Speaker 1: Finally they, he [HistoryMaker Edward Brooke] says, "What's this Stop [Day] thing?"  So, I get up and say, "This is what it is, this is why we're doing it, you know; this is the kind of support that we have, and we think this is important to send the kind of message, here, that the black community is not going to continue to accommodate to some of the forms of discrimination going, you know, going on and racial exclusion going on in the city."  And he basically was saying, "Well, you know, sometimes if you shoot your ammunition, you know, and after you shoot it, maybe you don't have any more powder," and he was trying to make a case for why this may not be a good thing to do.  But, anyway Tom Atkins [Thomas I. Atkins] and, oh, I mean, Ken Guskett jumps up and says, "Look, let us be clear: the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] does not support this, okay; this is too diffuse an action, okay.  There's no clarity about what concessions are to be gained by this--so we're not gonna support this, okay."  Tom Atkins jumps up and says, "Well look, the people are expecting something to happen on June 26 [1963], okay, so something's got to happen because there's a great anticipation that something is gonna happen here, because this thing has taken off okay.  So, why don't we have a memorial service for Medgar Evers at the Boston Common [Boston, Massachusetts]?"  Okay, so basically would psych--this is the way to kill Stop, okay.  So, he started talking about, how they could get the Boston Common, could they get Charles Evers to come up, all this talk.  So now, I said, "Look, first of all, we couldn't turn this off if we wanted to.  We're not going to, but we couldn't turn this off if we wanted to.  There is so much support and anticipation and embrace of this, even if we told people--it's gonna happen."  I said, "So you can go on with your memorial service, okay, and we'll come to it.  Fabulous--we'll come to it; we'll march the people who stay out of work to the memorial service okay, so fine."  So, that's what we did.  We went on organizing people to stay out, black folks and our white allies, and we held a rally at Carter Playground [Boston, Massachusetts] the morning before the noon memorial service, you know, with speakers and so forth and so.  Wright, that's it, Father [Nathan] Wright, remember him?  okay, Saint Cyprian's [Episcopal Church, Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts] you know, and he was one of the speakers, and  Jim Breeden [HistoryMaker James Breeden]was one of the speakers. He was one--and I was--I ended it up, and as a result--we had about I would say at this rally prior to the, had about five hundred people who showed up.  I was so scared, I didn't think anybody would show up, but five hundred people showed up, and we had this rally okay.  And then, I was the last one to speak and I said, "Okay, now we're lining up, we're going to the memorial service," and we had, you know, a permit from the police and motorcycle escort down Columbus Avenue all the way to the Boston Common.  And so Mel King [HistoryMaker Melvin King] and I and some others led, led this march, and we had marshals.  Julian Houston was one of the marshals.  He was working for the Northern Student Movement [NSM], now a judge, and the first time I ever met him, in fact.  And as we marked, started marching from Carter Playground, people started hanging out of the window screaming, applauding and, "Hey!  Wow!" and so we said, "Come on down, join--" and people flew, people ran off of the sidewalks, ran off of the, out of the apartment buildings.  By the time we got to the Common, we had a thousand people.  People, just off the street, joined the march, okay.  And we walked into mall, we walked into the--there was already an assembled crowed, okay, for the memorial service, and the crowd had been made also possible by the fact that Governor [Endicott] Peabody gave two hours off for people who wanted to attend the memorial service, so state workers and everything; there was a lot of people there.  And here we come in with a thousand people, and when we walked in people jumped on their seats and started applauding and Atkins was really like (unclear)--he was surprised, 'cause he thought we were dead, and then he basically, he brusquely said, "Go, take your people over there to sit down--" okay.  So, that was my first baptism of fire, in terms of sort of political and social action on a major scale in the black community, running into the, you know, the usual dynamics of young Turks and old guard, and you know seeing that up--hence, you know, and seeing that up close.

Speaker 1: At this point, at this adventure, activity, were you at the Boston Children's Services--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Association [sic. Boston Children's Service Association, Boson, Massachusetts]?  You were still employed there?
Speaker 2: I was, I was still employed there.
Speaker 1: And you left there that year, right, in 1963?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I left there that year.
Speaker 1: Did your initiation of this Stop [Day] and the activity around it affect your position there at all?
Speaker 2: No, it didn't, but there were some--I know that the director of Boston Children's Services was approached by some powerful people in the white community about, you know, and he came to talk to me.  And his basic posture was you know to let me know that there some people sort of raising question about this activity I'm into okay, but the--there was nothing he could say, because I was doing my work superbly, okay.  My engagement and involvement in this movement had nothing to do with me not doing my work as a social worker.  I was a highly regarded, respected social group worker okay, so, which is something I always taught my classes who wanted to do advocacy.  When I taught advocacy at schools of a social work and other places, I would always say, "If you're not doing your work, if you don't have credibility in your main job, okay, if you're not coming work, because you got a cold or--if you start to do something that's gonna push the envelope, if you're gonna do something that's gonna shake up the status quo, if you're not credible, people will be able to change the subject, and the subject will be you and whether you're not working or not, as opposed to the issue that you're trying to drive.  So, don't go out here trying to change the world, okay, unless your act is totally together, more than together, in terms of carrying out your primary responsibility, wherever, whatever they are."
Speaker 1: You left the Boston Children's Services Association and you went to the Judge Baker Guidance Clinic is that correct?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Judge Baker Guidance Clinic was called a guidance clinic at the time [sic. Judge Baker Guidance Center, Boston, Massachusetts].  It is now the Judge Baker Children's Center [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: What was your role there?
Speaker 2: Well, it had, there was a--Judge [Harvey Humphrey] Baker had put together a special delinquency project to learn some things about delinquent kids, antisocial character disorder kids, and they had gotten a slug of money from the National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH], and they put a project together with the Newton [Massachusetts] schools okay, and I became the director of group work for this project associated with the Newton Public Schools.  The kids came out--the kids, delinquent kids who came out of the Newton schools, I put together groups as a part of the treatment plan for these kids, working with psychiatrists, social workers, remedial teachers--and so I did that for about, you know, about two years, and as I was there at that time, things in the city were just heating up.  The Civil Rights Movement and all of the activity in which I cared about in the city was just heating up, and it became quite clear to me I had no business investing my time working in Newton when the black community was bubbling.
Speaker 1: Had your Stop action actually brought in change?  Did it change anything or was it just a step towards increasing people's awareness, to make (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: I would say it was, yeah, it was about making people aware of what was going on and getting people committed to thinking about it and maybe doing something about it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 237527
Speaker 1: Now, had you moved to Newton [Massachusetts] at this point?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah I was in Newton.  I came, we [HistoryMaker Hubie Jones and HistoryMaker Katherine Jones] moved to Newton in April 1961.
Speaker 1: Okay, now your first child was born though while you were still in Cambridge [Massachusetts] is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes, 1959.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your children, each of them, the first one?
Speaker 2: Karen [Jones].
Speaker 1: Born in Cambridge?
Speaker 2: Born in Cambridge.
Speaker 1: Tell us--just give us the rest of the children by name and when they were born.
Speaker 2: Sure, Karen was born in November 1959 in Cambridge.  In 1961, we moved to Newton.  So, we moved to Newton, to West Newton in a small cape with one child.  By the time we left in 1969, we left with six children, okay.  We came to Newton primarily because we were interested in educating our kids.  We thought the Boston Public Schools [BPS] or the Cambridge Public School[s] was not gonna be it, and we thought that Newton would provide excellent education for our kids, so that was why we came to Newton.  Then our second child Lauren [Jones] was born two years later in 1961, and then my--our son, our oldest son Harlan [Jones] was born in February 1963, and then our next children Renee [Jones] was born in '65 [1965], and then our next child, Lisa [Jones], was born in '67 [1967], and then our next child, Hamilton [Jones], was born in '69 [1969], August '69 [1969], and then our next child, Cheryl [Jones], was born in 1971, and then our last child, Tanya [Jones], was born in 1974.
Story_ID: 237528
Speaker 1: You then went to the Roxbury Multi-Service Center [Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts].  Was there some experience before that that got you to the Roxbury Multi-Service Center?
Speaker 2: No, I was clear that I wanted to find a position working in the city and, and if possible working in the black community.  And I learned that ABCD, Action for Boston Community Development, was working to establish three neighborhood service centers in Boston [Massachusetts], one in Charlestown [Boston, Massachusetts], which became the John F. Kennedy [Family Service] Center, one in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] to be called the Roxbury Multi-Service Center, and one in the South End [Boston, Massachusetts], which became SNAP, South End [Neighborhood] Action Program [South End Neighborhood Service Center, Boston, Massachusetts].  And so I heard they had a woman at ABCD by the name of Gertrude Cuthbert who they had hired to put together the planning for the--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: So she was hired to put together this agency to do the planning for it and get a board together and so forth and that she was beginning to look around for an assistant director.  She was going to be the executive director and that she was going to be hiring an assistant director.  And so I applied, and she made it clear that she wanted me to be her assistant director.  There were some issues with some of the members on the board about whether or not they should hire me, and some of this went back to my Stop [Day] involvement.  "Is this a guy who's a hot head?  Is this a guy who will go off and do irrational stuff?" et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and there was one man on the board who was associated with the city government who particularly raised these issues and got some--a couple of other people on the board to start raising whether this was a good idea.  And so, it almost didn't happen, and basically Gertrude Cuthbert laid down the gauntlet, laid down the line in the sand and said, "Well, I want [HistoryMaker] Hubie Jones and if--there's no reason why he shouldn't be hired.  He has an impeccable professional record; I think this is what we need to--that I need as an assistant to build this institution, and I may not take the job unless you hire him."  And I think, and that did it.  I mean, so she hired me and so together we started, and we went into the agency.  It was an abandoned tenement at 317 Blue Hill Avenue, and we went in on January 5th, I believe, 1965 to begin building an agency.
Speaker 1: Briefly, what were the critical needs of that particular neighborhood that the center was going to begin to address?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: What were the critical things that you had to tackle like right from the start?
Speaker 2: Well, the first of all, the concept for the institution was a multiservice center, because one of the things that was happening to people in the black community, you know low income people and working class people in the black community who had needs for social services and mental health services and employment services and you name it was, one, they didn't have centers in their neighborhoods.  They had to go downtown Boston to get help, so there was no, there was no institution in their neighborhood that was culturally and accessible to, you know, to the community.  And the other thing that we were very concerned about was that people who had multiple problems had to run all around the social service helping network, quote unquote, helping network, to get help, and they fell between the spaces in the network.  And so we wanted to build an institution where you could get all of the services you needed, okay, in an integrated way, so you would not have to run around and waste time and in many cases not get the integrated, coordinated help that you needed, and that we thought was, you know, was desperately needed in the community and that's why we came to Roxbury.
Story_ID: 237529
Speaker 1: Ultimately you became the executive director of the Roxbury Multi-Service Center [Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts].  What do you consider to have been your major achievements and accomplishments running that agency until 1971?
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, I would say the major thing I did was I made the center relevant to the issues that were going on in the community; that it was not just going to be a case-by-case service institution.  When we went there in 1965, the idea was we were going to provide excellent case-by-case intervention for families in need, you know, in providing a multiplicity of areas, multiplicity of services that were coordinated.  Well, it didn't take long before we understood that case-by-case intervention was, we would say, a band-aid on cancer, because there were a whole set of systemic things going on in the community in terms of housing, unemp--you know, jobs that weren't there, crime that was going on, disinvestment in the community, you name it, the welfare system, the police brutality.  There were a whole set of things going on that had to be addressed, and if we didn't address those, all we were doing was this sort of episodic provision of care, as important was it was, but it wasn't solving the major conditions, addressing the major conditions of the community, which was systemic and quite global.  And so I would say I took the Multi-Service Center into doing some serious organizing in the community.  We hired community organizers.  We set up neighborhood groups.  We got into all kinds of advocacy around major issues that were confronting the community.  The whole Task Force on Children out of School is an example of that.  You know we had parents who were coming to us with their kids who had been bounced out of the Boston Public School[s] system [BPS].  The school system said the kids were too retarded, too disturbed to function in classes, and so they were illegally bounced out of the school.  We would do--we were dealing with that on a case-by-case basis from 1965 'til 1967, okay, when the caseworkers finally said to me, "Hey, this is a systemic problem.  As fast as we get these kids back into school and get them stabilized or raise money to get kids into private school, the school system spews a whole group of other kids out there.  You know this is a systemic problem.  You know, you like to jack up evil, so you do it; we don't like that, but you do it, do something about this issue,"  Okay, and so we called a group of thirty-five agencies from across the city, mental health and social agencies to the Multi-Service Center for a conference on excluded child to see if this was only endemic to the black community, and finally we found out it was a city-wide problem, okay, and so we agreed to set up a Task Force on Children out of School.  Okay, and we did a study which showed that ten thousand kids were illegally out of the Boston [Massachusetts] public school system, across the front pages of The Boston Globe.
Speaker 1: And you published a very significant, cogent report--
Speaker 2: --Called 'The Way We Go To School, The Exclusion of Children in Boston[: A Report by the Task Force on Children out of School]' and that captured the attention of David [M.] Bartley who was speaker of the [Massachusetts] House of Representatives, asked for five hundred copies.  He gave a copy to everybody in the legislature, gave copies to the community groups he was associated with.  Unbeknownst to us, he was getting interested in special education, and he said, "Come down here, now, and help me write a piece of legislation," which became [Massachusetts] Chapter 766, which was the most progressive piece of educational legislation regarding special needs kids in the country.
Speaker 1: And was there later another piece of legislation statewide that came out of this?
Speaker 2: The Bilingual Educational Transitional Act [sic. Transitional Bilingual Education Act of 1971].
Speaker 1: Okay, we're gonna talk about both of those acts in just a minute.
Story_ID: 237530
Speaker 1: Would you describe briefly, [HistoryMaker] Hubie [Jones], the substance of the special education law [Massachusetts Chapter 766] and the substance of the [Transitional] Bilingual Education Act [of 1971] that grew out of the report ['The Way We Go To School, The Exclusion of Children in Boston: A Report by the Task Force on Children out of School'] of the Task Force on Children Out of School?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Chapter 766 was important for a number of reasons.  One, because it required that a school system do a comprehensive evaluation of a child before you determine that it, he or she had special needs, that you had to have, you know, you got to have a psychiatrist involved, a social worker involved, educational specialists involved.  Because what was happening prior to that in Boston [Massachusetts], a child got a seventy-nine, below seventy-nine on a Stanford-Binet Intelligence [Scales] test, they were considered to be special needs or retarded; they were considered to be retarded.  Now, the child could have had--been Spanish and had no English language facility to be successful on a Stanford-Binet.  They could be dyslexic.  They could have had perceptual problems.  It had nothing to do with their intelligence, but they had a whole set of problems.  But that was the only thing that was used to determine whether a child was retarded or not or had a problem, so 766 required a comprehensive core evaluation, and based upon that, then you had to make available all of the services needed that would remedy any problem and respond to any need that a special needs child had.  It was revolutionary.  It became the model for the national law, which was passed two years later.  So, it has been probably the most progressive piece of legislation ever in the Commonwealth [of Massachusetts], maybe the only thing to top it is the 1993 educational reform law [The Massachusetts Education Reform Act of 1993], which was passed, you know, then move the schools in terms of more money coming in and you know state-mandated high stakes testing and all of the rest.  So, at that time in 1970, when it was passed, '72 [1972] when it was placed, implemented in 1974, it was an enormous advance in terms of getting young people who were being consigned to special classes or classes for the retarded or not getting services or not having their problems really recognized for what they were, the kind of help that they needed.  Now the bilingual educational law was important because we had like seven thousand Latino kids in Boston who were not in school, because there were no bilingual educational programs, and so they just left the school system or didn't come to the school system, because they didn't speak English, and there was no way to really help them to get what they needed.  And what that law said is that in any city or town where there were twenty or more non-English speaking children, the school system had to provide bilingual education for that group of non-English speaking children, and there was state money to pay for it, and therefore Boston and many other cities like Springfield [Massachusetts], Holyoke [Massachusetts], and so forth had no excuse but to come on and put in place a bilingual educational program.  So, there were enormous advances and of course we're seeing attempts to erode both these things at the present time.
Story_ID: 237531
Speaker 1: Why did you leave the Roxbury Multi-Service Center [Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts], I believe that was, what, 1971?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I left the Roxbury Multi-Service Center in 1971.  I would honestly say I was somewhat burnt-out.  I had been through, you know, seven tough years; great years.  I would say it was the most important professional job I ever had in terms of my learning, in terms of my growth as a human being, in terms of my development as a leader, as a community leader, potential community leader.  It was an enormous learning and growth curve for me, but I had come through, I had come, taken the agency and, and the community through two major riots, rebellions or whatever you want to call them, one in June of 1967, which grew out of a welfare rights demonstration up at Grove Hall welfare office [Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts], and the community went into four days of war; very tough.  Had to keep the agency open twenty-four hours a day to respond to the needs of people in need and in pain, to be a place where community leadership could gather to begin to figure out strategies to deal with the police, to deal with the mayor, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  Then came 1968, the night that [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated, and the community broke loose again, and there was days of rioting and violence, et cetera, having to do the same thing, you know, during, you know, during that period.  So, I had, you know, I'd been through that.  I'd been through just the challenge of trying to keep financing together for a major social service institution.  You know, in those days some of the funding you got from the federal government was only nine month funding, so you were always in a difficult position, trying to raise the resources to keep the agency financially whole so that you could have the organizational and staffing capacity to do very difficult, tough work.  So, I would say by 1971, I felt that I was running out of gas.  It was time for new leadership, and I also felt that I needed a year to try to think deeply about what I had done, what I had learned, and what that might mean for the next thing that I might do, and so I was looking around to get a foundation to give me some money, so I would have a year to think and write and so forth, and out of the blue comes Mel King [HistoryMaker Melvin King] saying, "Hey, [HistoryMaker] Hubie [Jones], I hear you're gonna retire from--you're leaving the Multi-Service Center; what are you planning to do?"  I said, "Well, I'm planning to try to find a way to have a year off." He said, "Well, I'm starting a new program at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] called the Community Fellows program [Mel King Community Fellows program].  Well, you could have a year to work on a project and to take courses at MIT and Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and you know, do what you want to do, and it's a stipend.  I think it will be, you know, be sufficient to maybe help you with your family and--are you interested?"  I said, "Am I interested?  Yeah I'm interested" and so I applied, and I was accepted to the Community Fellows program, and that how I got into academia.  So, I got into academia by a fluke.
Story_ID: 237532
Speaker 1: Tell me what you did that year when you were in the Community Fellows program [Mel King Community Fellows program; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, that year, I had a project which I had started with, which was going to be looking at federal government funding of agencies as it related to black neighborhoods, communities and so forth, what worked, what didn't work; that was my project.  But, they allowed me to change my project.  They shouldn't have done it, but I convinced them to allow me to make my project running for the United States Congress.
Speaker 1: Who is they?  You convince--who was they?
Speaker 2: I convinced [HistoryMaker] Frank Jones, the director of the program primarily and Mel King [HistoryMaker Melvin King] that I wanted to run for the United States Congress for the 9th Congressional District and that would be my project, and I wanted to take one of my colleagues in the program, [HistoryMaker] Byron Rushing, to be my campaign manager, which is what happened.  I--so I ran for congress--
Speaker 1: So that was launched when?  That initiative was launched when?
Speaker 2: Oh, in 1971.  I went--
Speaker 1: In the fall?
Speaker 2: In the fall of 1971.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went there in September and about by November I was into running for Congress, and when I lost the primary, the day after I lost the primary in September 1972, I got a call from Roy, Lloyd Rodwin, Rodwin, excuse me Lloyd Rodwin who was the director of the urban studies program [Department of Urban Studies and Planning] at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in which the Community Fellows program was housed.  And he called and said, "I'm really sorry that you lost, you know, the congressional race.  You know, you ran a terrific campaign--we'd like you to stay at MIT and teach.  Would you be interested in doing that?"  I said, "I don't--I really don't know what I want to do.  I've got to clear my head.  I don't--I really don't know.  So, come and talk to me."  So to make a long story short, I agreed to stay at MIT for a year, and they said we'll appoint you as an associate professor; you can teach two courses, and we worked out what they would be and that ended up being a five year run at MIT and it was--now, while I was at MIT, I was still trying to figure out how I would get back to working in the community, in a community-based institution, okay.  I was doing a lot of work, civic work in the city--you know my resume; I've done a lot of civic work, you know, I had the academic base, but I've done a lot work in the city, but I was still trying to figure out, how do I get back and run an institution that's community-based over which I have some control and resources, okay?  That's where I was headed.
Story_ID: 237533
Speaker 1: All of a sudden I get a call from Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts], a guy named Saul Levine, who's head of the search committee at Boston University, saying, "The dean at the School of Social Work [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts], your alma mater, is retiring, and I'm head of the search committee and your name has come up, would you be willing to be considered?  Would you apply?"  I said, "I don't think so.  I don't think that's what I want to do.  I want to do something else.  I'm not--." And the word got out.  I told some of my colleagues about it, and a couple of them thought I was making a mistake.  [HistoryMaker] Frank Jones was one.  He said, "I want to take you to lunch and talk with you about this.  I understand that this is an option for you, maybe, you know, like why don't you want to do this?" "I don't want to be cloistered in the academia, you know, I want to, you know, the place has to be transformed over there, you know they got a whole bunch of--." I mean, the things, you know, it's, and so he said, "Well, I think you ought to think about this differently.  You have a mistaken notion that to work in the academy means that you're locked in and disengaged and cut off from community and significant work in community or in the world.  Why don't you just look at what the, you know, what your colleagues here at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] do.  When they want to do something in the community, take a year off, and they do it.  They're doing it without taking a year off, you know, and even when they take a year or two off, you know, they come back to MIT; they don't let this up.  They don't, they don't give this up, and this is why they don't give it up.  So you ought to really rethink this, okay.  You know being dean of a school of social work, you know, and having that position and command of some resources may give you a greater opportunity to do some of the thing you want to do in terms of the city.  It may even give you more prestige.  So, I think you ought to think about this."  And somebody else, another friend of mine, Tom Glynn [Thomas P. Glynn] who happens now to be the COO of (unclear) health care system [sic. Partners Health Care] who had been a friend of mine, worked in my campaign for [U.S.] Congress, called me up and said the same thing.  "Why aren't you thinking about this?  Let me take you to lunch and talk with you about it," okay.  And out of those conversations, I began to think differently about it.  So, I called up the search committee and said, "I think I will throw my hat in the ring."  Once I did that, I then had to begin thinking about what would I say when I got to the search committee?  What would my program be?  What did I have to give?  What did I have to bring?  What, you know what, what, you know--? So, I really had to think deeply about what would I do if I was the dean of a school of social work, and I had to get my act together for them (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What did you tell them?  Do you remember?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I told them that I was interested in seeing how a school of social work could be more related to the developments in the city, how students could have experiences, in terms of training, in, you know, very interesting important service institutions in the city, and that I thought the School of Social Work could have an enormous impact on city life and city development, which was not the case with the Boston University School of Social Work at that time, and that this is one of the things that I would do.  I was a social group worker, so they knew that I had a commitment to social group work.  Boston University School of Social Work was one of the best group work programs in the country, and I wanted to keep that strong and whole, but I made a case for the kind of leadership I could provide that was broader than the narrow social work leadership that you usually get from a dean of a school of social work.
Story_ID: 237534
Speaker 1: I think I was clear with myself and probably with them [Boston University search committee] that I was not going to use my leadership abilities in terms of the profession, you know I had been the president of the National Association of Social Workers for Eastern Massachusetts chapter, so I had done that.  I had been on the board of the National Association of Social Workers.  I had chose that I was not going to invest myself in the politics and the leadership of trying to be the president of the National Association of Social Workers.  Probably could have done that, but that, I wasn't--I was going to primarily use my skills in terms of the city and advocacy for children in the city and the things I wanted to do in the city as it related to the black community all the way, that that's probably where I wanted to use my leadership skills, as opposed to getting deeply involved in the politics and the leadership of the National Association of Social Workers.  So, that's what I told them, and boom they, I got hired.  I got hired by John Silber.  It was--
Speaker 2: Were you the first African American to hold a deanship at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 1: I was the first, no, I was the first African American to hold a deanship of a school.  Howard Thurman was the dean of the chapel, but I was the first African American to hold the deanship of a school at Boston University.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What were some of the first things that you had to tackle as a new dean of this school?
Speaker 1: The first thing I had to tackle was that I had a number of tenured professors who were not good teachers, who were not scholars, who were tenured, but who would not have been tenured under the standards at that time in 1977, and they had a lifetime mortgage here, and how was I going to raise the quality of the teaching program if I couldn't get rid of them?  And so I had to go through a number of strategies to convince them that they would accept a buyout from the administration.  So, John Silber was very, very good about making very lucrative offers that they couldn't refuse.  But, in order to get them to that point, I used their evaluations, their course evaluations, where they were getting lousy course evaluations to bring them in and say, "How do you understand these evaluations?"  You know, there, you know, "Well, why is--why do they look like--this is a problem."  I just kept bringing them back and I said, and after a while I would say, "Well, this is really, you don't have to deal with this.  You know, this is not good for you, you know, you know, there's a way out."  And so I was able to buy out, the university was able to buy out six people in key spots, and then I was very successful, and I would say lucky in being able to find some very young, gifted, hungry young professors to move in and take their place.  And I would say lucky, because I remember advice I got from June [Gary] Hopps who was dean of the Boston College [Graduate] School of Social Work [Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts], because she said to me, the first week I was there, she called me up and said, "[HistoryMaker] Hubie [Jones], now you might think you know the way you're gonna transform something is to get rid of the bad faculty members, but even if you're able to do that, you're gonna make a lot of mistakes in who you bring in," okay, but we were fortunate.  We had a very, very effective process, where the faculty was involved as a team in interviewing candidates for faculty positions, and it just worked very, very well.  So by the time we saw a candidate for two days we knew what we had.  We knew what we wanted, and we, you know I very aggressively went out and got it.  So, in the--I was there sixteen years.  I turned over--80 percent of the faculty turned over.  Some of that turned over by natural, you know, retirements and so forth.  So, I had a shot at building a whole new faculty.  I was very, very clear with myself from day one that my legacy to the School of Social Work [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] was not going to be the new programs that I put in place, was not going to be the new courses I put in place.  It was going to be the faculty that I left that were tenured, because it's the faculty that is the school.
Story_ID: 237535
Speaker 1: It is the faculty that determines continuity.  Okay, it's the faculty that gets committed to the kind of teaching program that you put in place and the programs you put in place, and there were all kinds of new things we did.  We did satellite programs at, at SMU [Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas] and you know up in the North Shore [Massachusetts], weekends, and things that had never been done before in order to get social work education to people who would not go to School of Social Work [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] if they couldn't go on weekends and summers and part-time and so forth.  So, but all that stuff wouldn't have lasted unless you had a faculty who was committed to it and who had the skills to carry it out.  So, I would say that that was the thing that I most did, and my whole approach basically was that if I'm to run this school of social work, I have to lead this school of social work.  If I have to run it, I would have to lead this school of social work and develop this school of social work in such a way that it can keep its standing and its vibrance for at least five years after I've left; that was my goal.  I'm gonna an institution that would at least last for five years even if my successor was mediocre, okay, and that's what happened.  You know I build a certain culture, but you know I was a certain kind of, you know, certain kind of visionary charismatic leader, so the culture changed after I left, you know slowly, because you know that has a great deal to do with leadership.  But, the quality of education has continued.
Speaker 2: So you left in 1993 roughly?
Speaker 1: I left in 1993, and I think I was--I left in nineteen, 1993 after sixteen years from--in 1992 from January 8th, 1992 to around August of 1992 I served as acting president of Roxbury Community College [Roxbury Crossing, Massachusetts].  I was called to do this by the trustees of Roxbury Community College.  The college had just let go a president for malfeasance.  It was drifting and getting into a bad place, and they came to me and asked me if I'd be willing to serve as acting president--
Speaker 2: You were still dean?
Speaker 1: I was still, I was dean.  Yeah, I was dean of the School of Social Work at the time.  So, I went to John Silber and I said, "The trustees have asked me to come and serve as acting president.  This is the situation, doesn't look good," and basically he said to me, "Well, you have no choice, and I have no choice.  This institution is too important to the city, and so I'll go along with it.  I'll let you go over and be the acting president.  I know you're not gonna take a pay cut."  I said, "You're absolutely right I'm not gonna take a pay cut.  With these children now, I'm not taking a pay cut."  He says, "Well, you know, the university [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] will continue to pay your salary, so you won't have to get any money from the state, if that's permissible.  But there's one thing I will not do: I will not appoint an acting dean at the Boston University School of Social Work.  You will still have to be dean.  Now, you tell me that you put together a fabulous management team, so let's how good they are.  So, if you can come in here a half day a week to make sure things are on course or whatever fine, but I'm not appoint, you know, I'm not appointing an acting dean".  I said, "Good deal, fine, you know, we can make it, yeah, yeah," I said, "fine."
Speaker 2: Was that a stressful eight months for you?
Speaker 1: Oh, extraordinarily stressful.
Speaker 2: How'd you handle it?
Speaker 1: Well, let me just say this, it was extraordinarily stressful, but it was also enervating, energizing, okay, kind of crazy and contradictory, but--
Story_ID: 237536
Speaker 1: The first challenge I had was to see if I could get the school [Roxbury Community College, Roxbury Crossing, Massachusetts] reaccredited, okay.  The first thing I got when I arrived on January 8th, 1992, was the self-study that had been submitted to the, reaccreditation committee, I mean the organization, I mean, (unclear), okay.  And I read the document and I said, "Oh my Lord, this institution is in trouble, because this document is not written well.  It is not written well, and we may be in trouble around accreditation."  And so I then went to the trustees, and I said, "I just want you to know that we're in potential trouble here, because this is not a good document," and they basically said to me, "Well, what should we do?"  I said, "We have a couple of options.  We can go to the accreditation organization and plead you know mercy saying, 'Well, we have an acting president, and therefore we should delay you know this for six months until things get stabilized and--.' That's one thing we could do," and I said, "but I recommend against that.  I think there's a lot of good stuff in this document.  I think a lot of good stuff has been done since the last accreditation process, but it just hasn't been presented in the right way.  So, what I suggest is that we go for broke.  That we bring in a person who has written these kinds of documents for many, many years for community colleges, and we know who--such a person who would be willing to do it, and we take the faculty and staff through a re-write job and a re-clarification of what it is we're doing and what it is we're trying to achieve, which also gives me an opportunity to assess this faculty in a way in which I couldn't if I didn't do this."  So, they said, "Okay," and that's what we did.  And so we did some very smart things which comes out of my social work, you know training and so forth.  I basically had the document rewritten and after we submitted it, I called the faculty together, and I said, "Look, you folks have a history of using reaccreditation process or any other process where outside people come in to drop all your complaints and all your dirty laundry, 'cause nobody would listen to you, you know, I understand all of that," I said, "but an accreditation process is not a place to be dumping your complaints and your grievances; you'll kill us.  So I tell you what I'm gonna do okay I'm gonna be in my office every Saturday for the next three weeks from eight o'clock in the morning to as late as necessary, and anybody on the faculty who wants to come and see me with their needs or their complaints or their grievances, I'm willing to hear you, and you can come by yourself, or you can come with twos and threes, you know, or the departments, any way you want to come, I'll listen to you; I'll hear you out.  I'll tell you what I can do.  I'll tell you what I can't do, but you will be heard.  We're not gonna have any nonsense in an accreditation process."  That's what I did.  So, they came, and they came, and you know I was, first, when the first group came I was like flabbergasted because the first group came and people were looking around the office.  I said, "What are you looking at?"  They said, "Well we've never been in the president's office before."  I said, "You've been working here for twenty years, and you've never been in the president's office?"  "Oh no, the president's office was out of bound.  You never could go in the president's office."  All right, so that gave me a sense of the alienation that these people had been feeling, okay.  And then I said to them, I said, "Look, you know, the other thing we're gonna do is we're gonna hold a mock reaccreditation process to get ready for the real accreditation team who comes in here," and so I went and got some terrific people from other community colleges, really sharp folks, and I asked them to come in and act like an accreditation team, okay, and to take these folks through a whole process, you know, like they were accreditation you know, and which was very, very helpful.  So, that, by the time the reaccreditation team got there, we were in good shape, and we got reaccredited.  So, that was the, I would say that was the big thing I did--
Story_ID: 237537
Speaker 1: I think probably the other big thing I did--and it was a stroke of luck.  I hadn't been there [Roxbury Community College, Roxbury Crossing, Massachusetts] maybe a month when Governor [William] Weld's folks came to see me to say, "We want to bring the school board track to Roxbury Community College."  It was slated to go to Northeastern University [Boston, Massachusetts].  A deal had been cut between [Michael] Dukakis and Northeastern [University, Boston, Massachusetts] to have the track over there.  This was the track that was thirty years in the making, and Weld said, "No, it's not going to be at Northeastern; I want it on public land, and do you want it at Roxbury Community College?"  I said, "Absolutely," I said, "absolutely, you know, let's work out a deal, yeah, I'm real interested."  The trustees said, "Yeah--." Then we got into a squabble about where it should be placed, if they wanted to place it on, you know, on the parking lot, you know, going off the current parking lot away, right beyond, going away from Boston [Massachusetts], and I said, "No, you can't put it there."  They said, "No, that's the place we want to put it."  I said, "You can't put it there," I said, "if this," you know, I said, "if this institution is really operating up to its capacity, eventually we should be building new academic buildings on the parking lot.  So, from a master planning point of view, it makes no sense to put this track--."  They said, "Well, that's where we want to put it."  So, I said, "It can't happen; it can't happen," so they went back, and they finally said, "Well, we bid some land at the corner of New Dudley [Street]," you know, and it was owned by the city, but we think we can get the city to buy it from us.
Story_ID: 237538
Speaker 1: The track was sited at the corner of New Dudley [Street] and Columbus Avenue, a marvelous facility that was of great benefit, not only for school board track, but for the black community at large, and it's been a fabulous thing.  I would say my greatest contribution in that whole thing was that I forced the state to add a gymnasium to the deal.  When they originally came, they said it was just a track.  I said, "Well, where's the gymnasium?  They said they don't have a gymnasium.  So go back and tell well we're not interested.  We need a gymnasium.  Our basketball team is going all over the place you know to practice and play, we have no gymnasium here.  We need to have a gymnasium.  So, just tell we're not interested unless we have a track."  Ten days later they came back and said you got a track.  But the thing that's important here in terms of my progression is that having done the Roxbury Community College [Roxbury Crossing, Massachusetts] job, having to use every chip I had, every, all of my social capital, every skill I had ever had in life to pull this off, made me realize that I was marking time at Boston University School of Social Work [Boston, Massachusetts], that I had done the job of transforming the School of Social Work, that I probably was no longer operating at my highest level of productivity and ability and skills.  So when I came back to BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] in August of '92 [1992], I was pretty clear with myself, I probably was marking time, and although was a very tough job, you know, doing two jobs at the same time, plus television at the same time, and plus radio at the same time--was on radio at the same time with a talk show on WRKO [Boston, Massachusetts], I realized that it was time for a new leadership, so I went to John Silber and I said, "Look, I'll be out of here in a year," and finally convinced him that this was real, I was going be out of here in a year and then we--he finally accepted it, and I decided to move on.  And I knew I wanted to do some different things.  I wasn't sure what they were, and in fact I went into a little panic after it was announced that I, you know, there was going to be a new dean and so forth.  I went into a panic and I said, "Whoa, what am I going to do--?" Kind of sounded silly.  Then I got, I accepted an offer to go to UMass Boston [University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, Massachusetts] to work at the [John W.] McCormack Institute [for Public Affairs; John W. McCormack Graduate School of Policy Studies, Boston, Massachusetts] as a senior fellow, about half-time, to work on any project of interest to me and do a whole set of things I cooked up and did.  So, it was an enormous opportunity, and also at the same time I started working for the [W.K.] Kellogg Foundation for their national leadership program as a senior advisor, and I did that for six years, starting in 1993.  And in 1995, I was clear I wanted to leave the McCormack Institute.  There were some issues going on up there and squabbles, and I was being called into mediate, and although I was good at it that's not what I wanted to do at this stage in my life, and I decided I was going to leave.  But just at that time, the chancellor called me, office called me to say, "We want to talk with you about the fact that we need to reinvigorate our urban mission.  We don't--we're not a key player in the city like we should be.  What do you think we should do?  Any ideas about what we should do?"  And I said, "I'll think about it, and I'll write you a memo."  So, I wrote him a memo with a whole set of options they had and strategies they--
Speaker 2: Who did you send this to?
Speaker 1: To the executive assistant to the chancellor.  Because the chancellor, Sherry [H.] Penney, had just left to go be the acting president of the University [of Massachusetts] System okay.  And so I sent him, I sent him this memo and said, "This is how I think about it, and these are your options, and if you're really serious about this you ought to create a position to work for somebody who has not only substantive, but political skills to work on this stuff.  I'm not interested in the job, I wanna be clear about that, but I will find you somebody.  I'll play a role in finding you somebody who might be able to do this if you want me to participate in that process."  Make a long story short, they ended up convincing me to take the position.
Story_ID: 237539
Speaker 1: So, in December 1995, I went into the chancellor's office as special assistant to the chancellor on a three day, on a four day a week basis I believe it was initially, and went about developing strategies to have the University [of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, Massachusetts] more seriously engage with the community, being a larger player in the community, developing all kinds of innovative programs, one of the most impor--
Speaker 2: When you say community, you mean, you're talking about the City of Boston [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 1: The City of Boston (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The entire City of Boston, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: The City of Boston.  One of the things I you know--
Speaker 2: And so what did you, what did you initiate, and what did you accomplish?
Speaker 1: Well, I would say one of the most important programs I put together was the City to City program.  I developed a partnership between the university, the chamber of commerce, and Mayor [Thomas] Menino who where we would take a group of Boston leaders every year to another city to learn best practices from that city and its leadership around issues that would and challenges that were relevant to where Boston was and where Boston could go.  And I basically the first year we went to Atlanta [Georgia] in 1997.  I basically played a major role in putting it all together with the help of the chamber and the Boston Redevelopment Authority [BRA], and that started something that had never happened in Boston before.  Boston had had leaders from other cities for years coming to Boston to learn about Boston and its institutions, its colleges, its universities, you know, and we never saw fit to go out and learn from somebody else, okay.  It was a part of our Boston parochialism, and so it was, we thought it was important to break that, break that parochialism and understand that there were things out in other cities that were important to learn that would be of benefit, that benefit, and so it has gone on for, you know, we did not only domestic travel, but international travel, you know in '97 [1997] we went to Atlanta, '98 [1998] we went to Seattle [Washington].  In 1999, we went to Belfast, Northern Island and Dublin [Ireland] as well, briefly.  In 2000, we went to Barcelona [Spain] primarily because they had transformed this water front.  Boston is in the process of transforming this Boston water front.  There were things possibly we could learn you know learn from that.  Went to San Francisco [California] and Silicon Valley [San Francisco Bay Area, California], went to Chicago [Illinois].  So, it's--and it's been a, it turned out to be a very powerful way to connect nonprofit leaders and corporate leaders and government leaders, led by the mayor.  The mayor went on all of these trips.  So, I would say that was probably one of the most important projects that I cooked up and led while I was at UMass Boston.  I put on a major forum.  I developed a Columbia Point [Boston, Massachusetts] community partnership that brought together all of the stakeholders on the peninsula to agree to work together in a partnership to advance developments at Columbia Point.
Speaker 2: Columbia Point being?
Speaker 1: Columbia Point being where the university is in Dorchester [Boston, Massachusetts], Columbia Point, Dorchester, and this was a partnership that also involved the residents, the working class and poor residents in the Harbor Point housing development, which is a mixed income housing development, so I was doing something that had--
Speaker 2: Adjacent to the university?
Speaker 1: Adja--yeah, adjacent to the university--
Speaker 2: This way our viewers will understand.
Speaker 1: Adjacent, yeah, it was adjacent to the university, and the university had never in my judgment been seriously engaged with residents.  There been a lot of community relations nonsense, but not any serious engagement, so there was a lot of skepticism when I came along saying, "Hey, we're gonna get a partnership; we're gonna listen to you; there's gonna be power parity between residents and The Boston Globe and the university and [John F.] Kennedy [Presidential] Library [and Museum, Boston, Massachusetts] and the banks and the radio stations and all the folks who got a part, became a part of the partnership," okay.  And basically that was taking a page of [Senator] Robert [F.] Kennedy's book, because he had done something in the '60s [1960s] in Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York, New York] like this where he had pulled a community together, you know, to work on reconstructing and developing a neighborhood, so it was that playbook we were using.
Story_ID: 237540
Speaker 1: So, these were some of the, you know, so these, these were some of the things we did (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Didn't you have a youth initiative also?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, we had--as a part of the City to City program we developed an emerging leaders program, which meant that we took some young leaders on some of these trips so that they could begin to engage with, quote unquote, older leaders.  Boston [Massachusetts] has just a very tough time allowing young potential leaders into circles of influence and power, okay.  Out of our trip to Atlanta [Georgia] and Seattle [Washington], one of the things we--people were saying on these trips, they were saying, "You know in Boston we don't very much about developing young emerging leaders," and so Sherry [H.] Penney, the chancellor, who had been on these trips and herald as--and she decided, she left the chancellor's job, she got a quarter million dollars and she decided, from State Street [Corporation], and she decided to create an emerging leaders program where thirty-nine to fort-five leaders, young leaders, very diverse, every year for over a period of nine months come together and learn a great deal about how to operate in the city or work on common projects and so forth and so on, so that, that sort of flowed out of all of this.
Speaker 2: And you were in a position of special assistant to the chancellor for how long?
Speaker 1: 'Til nine, 'til 2001, 'til December 2001.
Speaker 2: And then what happened?
Speaker 1: I decided it was time to retire.  I decided that it was time to no longer work for an organization.  I was beginning to  move on towards seventy years of age, and I decided there were lots and lots of other things I probably still wanted to do--
Story_ID: 237541
Speaker 1: Well, let me back up if I can to Roxbury Multi-Service Center [Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts], the establishment of the Task Force on Children Out of School.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That led to one of probably thirty or more organizations that you helped to form, initiate, build, rebuild and are still with us today.  What was the organization that actually came out of the task force?  Tell me about that?
Speaker 2: In nine, oh, in 1973, the Task Force on Children Out of School was renamed the Massachusetts Advocacy Center, and then recently it has been renamed the Massachusetts Advocates for Children [(MAC), Boston, Massachusetts].  In 1973, the Task Force on Children Out of School got a major grant from the Ford Foundation, and it was clear that we were getting into children's advocacy beyond education.  We were getting into lead paint poisoning, we're getting into juvenile justice, we're getting into a whole bunch--so the Task Force on Children Out of School was a misnomer now, and we had to change our name and--to make it clear we were involved in children's advocacy across the board.
Speaker 1: And what was your specific role in that transition?  What role did you play?
Speaker 2: My role, well, I was chairman of the board.  I was founder and chairman of the board for its first ten years of the life of the organization, so I was there during the transition from task force to the Mass. Advocacy Center.  I stayed on the board, I stayed on the board for thirty years, okay.  About year twenty-nine, I, twenty-eight, I got off of the board and then got into some trouble around executive leadership.  There was a crisis, and it was getting into trouble, and I was asked to come back onto the board to save it, basically, and so I met a guy named Steve Rosenfeld [Stephen Rosenfeld], came on, came back onto the board.  He had been on the task force way back.  This was after he had just left being chief secretary for [Michael] Dukakis--(unclear), so we convinced him to come back onto the board and chair the board and I, then I would agree to come back and raise the money and get new executive leadership so we could try to get to a new place and we now are in a spectacular place now, going very well.
Speaker 1: Your long-term contribution and involvement for the Mass. Advocacy Center resulted in a testimonial for you, last April 2004, put on by MAC.  Tell us about that testimonial, because it was a very important event.  Tell us about that tribute to you.
Speaker 2: Well, for me, it was sort of like being at your funeral.  You know, it's nice to live long enough to be at your funeral.  It was a coming together of not only colleagues I had worked with over many years on many, in many organizations, on many battles.  It was also people who I had played a role in helping through the work that I had done with many, many organizations.  It was a coming together of my family from all over the country, including folks from Ghana.  It was just a grand reunion of the people who have meant a great deal to me in my life.  It was an amazing evening.  I generally hate to go to those things, and I, you know, I have to go to a lot of them, but this turned out to be a joy because of the program that the folks put on, and I had no idea what the program was gonna be, 'cause they kept me out of it.  I kept saying, "Well, what's the program?"  They said, "You stay out of it; just stay out of it."  The only thing I knew was that they would allow the Boston Children's Chorus [Boston, Massachusetts], which we had put together, to sing as a part of the program.  That's all I knew, what I knew.  I had no idea that there, you know, 'Five On Five' television clips were gonna be run, which turned out to be quite entertaining and revealed where I was on a whole set of issues over many years and Avi Nelson and some of the 'Five on Five' crowd would be there.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna come back in a minute to your 'Five on Five' [WCVB-TV] Channel 5 [Boston, Massachusetts] television program.
Speaker 2: But, I--
Speaker 1: Something else was established that evening with your name on it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, we made, it, yeah an agreement was made that half of the net proceeds would go to start the Hubie Fund at The Boston Foundation [Boston, Massachusetts] that would give me an opportunity to fund programs that I care about over time and that was a nice thing to happen, and so I'm right in a happy place right now of being able to support a number of organizations who need not a hell of a lot of money, but some money to continue doing important stuff.
Speaker 1: Have you made some initial grants there?
Speaker 2: Yeah I have made now five grants.  I've made five grants.
Speaker 1: Are you the sole decision maker on these grants?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well no, well, the sole decision maker really, the decision is made by the foundation, but I made the suggestion.  So, in a sense I'm a sole decision maker, okay, so I make, I fill out a suggestion form, and I want X amount of money to go to, and so far they have approved my suggestions, so in that sense I'm the sole decision maker.
Story_ID: 237542
Speaker 1: Well, the social and civic landscape of Boston [Massachusetts] has certainly been influenced and impacted upon by you, and there were a number of other organizations that you've started and administered and carried along to the present day.  Would you share with me three or four of those that mean the most to you that, that you think have been significant?
Speaker 2: Well, Roxbury Youthworks was an organization I helped found with Judge Julian Houston when he was head of the juvenile court in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts].  He wanted to form an organization that would provide services to youngsters who came before the court so that they could once--that being dealt with by the court, that they could get some good educational help as well as work training opportunities, and so he asked me and a group of other folks if we would come together, form a board, and start Roxbury Youthworks.  It is--I was president of the board for ten years.  It is going very, very well right now.  Great executive leadership, being funded very well and doing a job, so I think that's an important, important piece of work that was done because these kinds of youngsters don't get served by traditional community service agencies and social agencies and youth service agencies, and you really needed a different kind of vehicle committed to this kind of work.  So, I would say that was an important piece of work.  I played a major role in founding the Citywide Educational Coalition, which is no longer existing, but it existed for many, many years that played a major role around school reform.  It also played a major role during the 1974, 1975 implementation of desegregation when all the--everything was busting loose in terms of violence and all the rest.  So it was good that it was there to, you know, to really help some parents, you know, get through all of that.  I played a major role in the founding of Roxbury Community College Foundation.  That's how I got involved in, invested in Roxbury Community College [Roxbury Crossing, Massachusetts], and I was president of the board of the foundation for probably about seven years.  I had to give it up when I became acting president of the college, and I never went back, really went back, after my acting presidency.  So, that was, you know that was an important thing to leave to the community.
Story_ID: 237543
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Give us one more that stands out in your mind that you're very proud of, and--?
Speaker 2: Well, you know right now, I mean it's too early, but I'm, you know, I'm proud of the Boston Children's Chorus [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, about five years ago I sort of--a light went on, and I recognized that maybe the best way to bring children together across racial, ethnic, and social class divides, that was really powerful, would be through music and the arts.  I think that idea got lit by an experience I had about four or five years ago when I heard the Chicago Children's Choir sing in Chicago [Illinois] at a City Year national convention.  I saw a diverse chorus singing at a level of artistic excellence that was just unbelievable.  So, I saw the power of them, and so I began to look into Chicago Children's Choir, and out of serendipity I got involved in bringing together a number of children's choruses in Boston [Massachusetts] to form a 280-voice children's chorus to sing at the dedication of the [Leonard P.] Zakim Bunker Hill [Memorial] Bridge [Boston, Massachusetts], okay, when it was dedicated.  And then I decided based upon what I had learned in Barcelona [Spain] through the City to City [program] trip to use this as a way to see if we could capture the imagination and the attention of the corporate and foundation community to start a permanent new organization called the Boston Children's Chorus.  Barcelona, they're geniuses at using public events to drive change.  They're geniuses at it.  Okay, so when we decided, "Yeah, we'll do this chorus," we said, "well, it shouldn't be a one-shot thing.  It should be used as a way to go somewhere," and to my--not to my surprise, but after the kids sang at the Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge, I started getting calls from people saying, "Wow, that was incredible.  I heard in The [Boston] Globe that you're thinking about starting a Boston Children's Choir as a permanent organization.  Are you really going to do that?  I'll give you some money, you know, what do you need?"  Now I've done hundreds of projects, you know, over my fifty years in Boston, but I'd never had anybody calling me up unsolicited saying, "Can I give you money for a project?"  So, I knew we had something.  I knew we had some potential interest, and maybe we could get some support to do this, and so I went about the process, you know, of putting together a board of some terrific people, and you know, and as we, as you know, we now have our concert choir.  We have two other choirs performing, a neighborhood choir in the South End [Boston, Massachusetts] at IBA [Inquilinos Boricuas en Accion], which will start next week.  Just hired an African American woman to be the choral director for the neighborhood choir.  Our idea is that we want to be--one, we want kids to, you know, learn how to sing at an extraordinary level of artistic excellence.  That's one thing we want, obviously, that's number one.  We want them to be ambassadors for the city in terms of singing in major public events, and they have already, okay.  They sang at the [2004] Democratic National Convention [Boston, Massachusetts], which was a big thing.  They sang at major event at the Boston, new Boston Convention [and Exhibition] Center [Boston, Massachusetts] for the ten thousand media people who came here for the convention.  Okay, they've been invited now to go to Japan to be a part of an international festival next July.  A lot of this stuff is coming, a little too fast, 'cause you know they're still a fledging chorus, but so--that vision of being ambassadors for the city, I mean, The Globe calls us ambassadors of harmony, okay, and we're seeing it happen.  You know, I mean, I get great joy when I go to a rehearsal, I slip into a rehearsal, and I don't know--the black kids from Jamaica, "[HistoryMaker] Mr. [Hubie] Jones, Mr. Jones, how you doing? I was, last week I was in Dover [Massachusetts] with so and so from the choir, you know we had a great time and somebody, kid from, white kid from Marshfield [Massachusetts] was in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts], staying overnight with so and so."  No, not being programmed by us, not being programmed by us.  It's coming out of the relationships and the trust and the good time they're having together and what they're learning together.  Now, we want to do something with this chorus that's different than what other people do with these kinds of choruses.  We want to use this as an instrument for social change, okay.  We want to use it as a way to bring the city together, okay.  Now one thing we're thinking about--and we're not gonna do it right away, but probably will happen in 2006--we're gonna have a community sing in Boston probably in the Boston Common [Boston, Massachusetts] or Copley Place [Boston, Massachusetts] or both, where we bring the diversity of this city together to sing together, okay, and so that's, I mean, that's just one example of that it is just not a matter of having kids getting good instruction, it's how can we use this as just another way to pursue what I've tried to pursue in other ways, and so my other ways were illusions.  They went up in smoke.  So, this is my last illusion.  This is my last illusion, and I think it's probably not gonna be an illusion.  I think it's gonna, I think it's gonna work.

Speaker 1: You were also for twenty years part of a major media institution in the city of Boston [Massachusetts].  You were a regular panelist on a program called 'Five on Five,' a public affairs program.  Tell us about that twenty-year marathon with [WCVB-TV] Channel 5 [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Well, 'Five on Five' was probably in some ways the most important work I ever did.  A black person prior to that never had an opportunity to be a constant presence on television, analyzing public affairs, you know, major events of the week, both locally, nationally, and internationally.  That had never happened before.  So, to have that opportunity to play a role in basically shaping public opinion was a very big thing, and I took it very seriously, and I did it for twenty years.  I first started in 1980, January of 1980.  I did it part-time, sharing a seat with Doris Kearns Goodwin.  We rotated, not knowing that they were really getting ready to dump somebody who had been a regular from the beginning, and then they did dump that person, and then just about at that time, John Kerry, who was a panelist, decided he was going to run for lieutenant governor, and so his seat opened up, and they asked me if I would take his seat on a full-time basis.  So, it was in 1981 that I, yeah '81 [1981], late '81 [1981] that I started full-time as a panelist on 'Five on Five.'  It gave me just an enormous opportunity to present my position on a range of issue, whether it had to do with human welfare, whether it had to do with politics in the community, you know, city government, international affairs, national affairs.  I just had a wide-ranging opportunity to comment.
Speaker 1: How frequently was this program aired, at way day and what time?
Speaker 2: It was aired on Sunday mornings, every week.  It came on right after the national program, 'This Week with David Brinkley.'  It was so popular that we outdrew the national program, many, many times.  In fact, at the end of the reign, when [David] Brinkley had left the program, 'This Week' program and Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts were the main features of 'This Week' with the national program, it was sinking like a rock, and we were out-polling the national program.  So, it was kind of ironic that at that point the plug was pulled, and we never really knew why.  It was the longest running public affairs program of this type in the city.  No, no, only outdrawn maybe--we went twenty-one years and 'Starring the Editors' with Erwin D. Canham from The Christian Science Monitor went for twenty-four years, but that was extraordinary, but very few programs of this type having that kind of staying power, and there's no, and today there's no time I'm downtown or out in the community that somebody doesn't come up and say, "Why is the program gone?" and "We miss the program, but you know we should be discussing these issues--."
Story_ID: 235898
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who were the other four panelists that were regular panelists [on 'Five on Five']?
Speaker 2: Well, the genius of the program was that there were--two of the panelists were liberals and two of the panelists, the other two were conservatives, so we had the former mayor, John [F.] Collins, as a regular panelists for many, many years until he died; he was conservative.  Avi Nelson who was there from day one until the very end, a conservative talk show commentator.  Doris Kearns Goodwin for many years was my comrade in arms as the other liberal person on the program, and then, then it was me for much of that time.  There were other people who came in and out as we, you know, were absent for one reason or the other, but the program had its best chemistry when these four folks were there, you know, doing the work.
Speaker 1: Quickly what was the process of putting together the weekly discussion?  How did that happen?
Speaker 2: We had a producer by the name of Marjorie Arons-Barron who was excellent.  She basically decided on the topics.  We could call and give her some suggestions if we wanted to, but basically that rarely happened.  She selected the topics.  It was always a local topic, sometimes two, but always one, and it could be a national or international topic of the week.  We would get called on Thursday and told what the topics were.  She prepared a set of clips on each topic, magazine articles, newspaper articles, or whatever and a memo which covered it saying, with a set of questions, not necessarily the questions that were asked by the moderator, Peter Mehegan, or Mary Richardson, but it was Peter Mehegan for most of the time, but they helped you do the reading, so you could focus, and so I would go in a good hour before the program and read all the clips and prepare.  Sometimes I would go over on a Thursday night and get, you know, and prepare the night before.  And sometimes, there was information I needed that other people in the community had, so I would be totally ready, so I would call people on a Friday morning and say, "What's the issue, what is the issue, what's the statistic, what's this, what's that."  But, you know it was an important piece of work.
Speaker 1: Is this still a missing part of your life?
Speaker 2: At the beginning it was.  You know, at the beginning it was, but you know, but twenty years was a long run, you know, twenty years was a long run, so I, you know, I had a good piece of time to let the world know what I thought--
Story_ID: 235899
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way you have lived your life?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I've been, you know, I think I've been fortunate, one, to live in a city where, if you want to try to get something done, it's small enough so that you can make an impact.  If I'd stayed in New York [New York], I never could have had the impact on public affairs and social developments and organizational development that I've had here.  So, in that sense, I was--it was a stroke of luck that I was able to stay in Boston [Massachusetts], and it's given me an enormous opportunity to use my skills and my knowledge and to grow in ways that I could make a contribution.  You know, the downside of this is that I'm a workaholic, so you know, when one of your children at the dinner table turns you--I remember my daughter Cheryl [Jones] one night at a dinner table turned to me and said, "Daddy, are you a workaholic?"  You know, and, boy, that really cut; that really cut because the message was also like, maybe you're not around enough, okay, so there's, so although I've had enormous opportunity to do a lot of things, make a contribution, and I've enjoyed doing it and felt honored to be able to do it, being a father of eight kids means that there are times when you're not as available as you should be, so I would say that's, you know, that's, you know that's a downside.  I am absolutely clear that I am glad that I did not--first of all, I'm glad I did what I was passionate about doing okay.  When my father [Hilma Jones] heard that I was going to become a social worker, he was upset.  He, obviously, he wanted me to be a doctor and live out his ambitions.  I had no interest in being a doctor.  I had no skill to be a doctor.  I had no interest in being a doctor.  And my passion was to you know was to be a social worker and to be in a helping profession and to be in a profession where you could be involved in social change and so forth, and I'm just sort of glad that I made that decision and when I go to speak to young people, whether in colleges or at high schools or whatever my message is go with your passion, okay, go with your passion.  Don't listen to your parents.  Don't listen to anybody else.  Listen to what you are passionate about doing.  You, 'cause you're the captain of your ship.  You've gotta live your life.  I'm also very fortunate, I don't think there's been any day that I have gotten up and didn't want to go to work, okay.  Even when I had to go out and deal with very difficult problems, okay.  I was doing work that I always felt was important, significant, and that would make a difference.  I'm glad that I never made choices about job opportunities or career opportunities based upon the money that was available, okay.  I probably could have made a lot of money if I decided I wanted to be a businessman.  I had no interest in that and all that, with what all that's about, okay.  And I've turned away jobs that would pay me much more money, but that was not consistent or congruent with my personal mission in terms of you know social change, and so on that score, I feel good that I, you know, I kept my eye on the prize and didn't get, you know.  At times it was difficult, you know, when I had three kids in college at the same time.  You know, you know, there were all kinds of choices, you know, one could have made okay, but I kept doing what I set out to do.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you have not done already that you still want to do?
Speaker 2: At this stage, no, not, not at this stage.  There was a time when I wished I could have been the superintendent of schools in Boston, even though I'm not, even though I'm not an educator, I mean, a professionally trained teacher-educator in that sense.  I thought that was, that I had some certain kinds of skills, knowledge--that could have maybe--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: You know, more and more school districts are hiring superintendents outside of academia today.
Speaker 2: I know, I understand that.  I know that.
Speaker 1: You've still got opportunity.
Speaker 2: No, no, my--I've done my thing.
Story_ID: 235900
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you would have done differently along the way from South Bronx [New York, New York] to retirement?
Speaker 2: No, you know, I was fortunate to have a wife [HistoryMaker Katherine Jones] who put her foot down and forced me to rest and take vacations.  I was very fortunate.  I was very fortunate, you know, I mean, didn't want to hear about the other meeting and this and that, you know, this child, this demand--.  So in that sense I was very, very fortunate to have somebody who would put the brakes on and say.  You know, and I had one, you know I had one wake-up call in 1971 when I was doing too many things.  I was running the Roxbury Multi-Service Center [Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts], trying to save the ecumenical center in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] and running David [Sutherland] Nelson's campaign for congress in the black community, and I wore myself out and ended up with swollen lymph glands, and they thought maybe I had Hodgkin's [lymphoma] or leukemia, and I went to the hospital with a biopsy, you know, and it turned out to be negative.  But the bottom line was that my body was telling me that you're abusing it, and the only way to stop me was to blow up my lymph glands.  So for a while I heeded what that was about, but then of course you find yourself getting back into running.  I would say if there's anything that I would have done differently--but this only comes with wisdom and with age--I tell young people now, in fact, I just met with a guy at lunchtime and who's doing extraordinary work, and I tell him that if you looked at me at age thirty, I was very frenetic.  I was running around responding to every demand, request, whatever people wanted, you know, all these, I'm just running, just okay, and I would say, I was well, well into my fifties before I realized that that was counterproductive, that it was important to be clear about what it is you're trying to accomplish at any one point in time and not allow yourself to be distracted by doing too many things and responding to too many demands.  So, today I don't do anything that is not reinforcing what I'm trying to do, the major thing I'm trying to do.  So, I don't take any speech, I don't take any this, unless it's very, very clear.  And also I don't when I go to meetings now, if I'm in a meeting the first assessment I try to make is: is my presence needed?  If I wasn't here, would it make any difference?  And when I come to the conclusion it wouldn't make any difference, I'm out of there, I'm out, okay, I'm out of there.  And of course the other thing that wisdom brings is, there a lot of other people who can do the things you're called on to do.  So, today I spend a lot of time referring people to younger leaders to do things they say that, "Only you can do the speech," "Only you can help us think through this, this strategy, only you can."  Well that's not true, and so I spend a lot of time saying, "No, I'm not available, but I got a couple of terrific young people who you ought to think about using."
Story_ID: 235901
Speaker 1: The thing I learned also which probably would have been, comes with age, I guess, and experience, the thing I learned primarily from the City to City program is that if you're doing major projects and trying to push major change work, you better do it in collaboration with somebody else.  Now, we--Boston [Massachusetts] is a city that has a culture of non-collaboration, very tribal city, okay, and we're a lots where most people, most institutions think that they're gonna get where they need to go on their own.  It's a whole, it's a big silo mentality here okay, and they stay in their silos, and the idea that they would share their strategic intelligence with somebody else, they would share their resources with somebody else, so that together they could go faster and further than they could go alone is like very hard to grasp, okay.  And so one of the things the City to City program and going around the country has learned that, where people have really made some progress is where there's a really a collaborative thing going on and a sharing of resources, intelligence, social capital, money, you know, to make important things happen, so I think I probably would have been more collaborative.  I would not have been as much in a predicament of solo behavior around some things that I, you know, I was into that a little bit.  And when young people come to me now--I have a lot of people come to me who want to be mentored, you know, and they got, they have some big ideas--and the first thing I ask them after they tell me what is they want to do, I ask them, "Is there anybody else doing this?  Could you do this with somebody else?  Is there anybody you could do this with that would help advance where, what you want to do?"  Well, usually they say, "Well, I haven't thought about that yet; oh well, I don't know."  I said, "Well, let me just tell you something.  There's nothing I can do for you.  There's no advice I can give you.  There's no mentoring I can do for you unless you first find out who you can do this with, okay, and when you figure that out come back and talk to me, okay, because I'm not gonna support go-it-alone, silo, non-collaborative behavior.  It's not in the interest of you; it's not in the interest of the city; it's not in the interest of the community, the local community--" so now he was like, "Oh, oh, oh, okay."  And the other thing I usually say to folks is, "Okay, well, has anybody else done this in the city?"  They say, "No, nobody else has done this."  "Has anybody else done this in the country that you can learn from?"  "Well, I don't know, I don't know."  I said, "Well, you better know, and if you tell me that nobody else has done it in the country--has anybody else done it in the world, okay?  And until you can tell me who has done something that's in this field or in this realm and that you can go learn about so you don't have to repeat something from, you know, from ground zero, this is counterproductive, this is counterproductive."  So, I would say that I've come late to this, you know, I mean in terms of a real, you know, passion around getting people to collaborate in a real way, not only surface nonsense.  So, that's I would say that would be, that would be what I would change, okay.
Story_ID: 235902
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?  What do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: Well, I want them to say what they, I think what I want them to say is what they said on the program, you know, "[HistoryMaker] Hubie Jones: a passion for change and compassion for people."  I mean, for me, I thought that summed it up.
Story_ID: 235903
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well, one, for the City of Boston [Massachusetts] I hope that what I've done in terms of institution building leads to a stronger social fabric in communities of color.  Without a strong social fabric, institutional fabric, there's no way for the institution and the community to prosper, and so I've left models and examples of how that can--about how that can be done.  So, I hope that the work that I've done and the way I've done it serves as an inspiration and a model for the community to just have a very strong institutional fabric that makes it possible for the community to be seriously respected and dealt with, okay.  I'm pleased that there's a shift, a major shift, going on in terms of the politics in the City of Boston.  The enormous voter registration and voting in the last election is a signal that the diversity in the city now can now be leveraged so that we could have a mayor of color in Boston, that's within reach, that's within reach.  I think it's clearly in reach when you look at the voting patterns for the sheriff's race where you know Andrea Cabral, the African American woman sheriff got half of the white votes in Roslindale [Boston, Massachusetts], Hyde Park [Boston, Massachusetts], et cetera, which was unthinkable twenty years ago, okay.  So, there's a real chance for coalition politics, you know, okay, but it's got to be a coalition politics that's respectful of everybody in the city, okay, and that there's serious power-sharing, okay, when we have a chance to control city hall, all the rest.  We don't get into the other kind of--the nonsense that the folks before us got into in terms of keeping it to themselves and cutting people out and exclusivity and all that stuff.  So, I thought I'd--I didn't think I would live long enough to see Boston at a point, one, where we have this enormous diversity in the city, you know, where people of color now are over 52 percent of the city, city's residents, and where the politics has changed and where you could have serious coalition across race.  So, I would say that's the most hopeful thing right now.  Hopefully, we don't squander it, but there a lot of people out there working at it, very smart, you know, and I'm supporting a couple of folks who are doing voter registration and just gave some of them some money out of the Hubie Fund [The Boston Foundation, Boston, Massachusetts] so that they can continue to do this work in the right way and with capacity.
Story_ID: 235904
Speaker 1: You've received many recognitions for your work for social change, social justice, not just in Boston [Massachusetts] but going on across the country, and you have a recent award that you shared with me.  Would you tell us about this recent--?
Speaker 2: Well, in May 2003 the University of Maryland, which is a major research university in the country, gave me an honorary doctorate, a doctorate of public service, and I had other doctorates, honorary doctorates, but I think this meant a lot to me because it came from a major university and that it was recognizing that a public service of substance should be honored.  And so this one means a great deal to me, and it may be the fact I don't have an earned doctorate also makes it mean something to me, but this doesn't make up for not having an honorary doctorate.  But, so it was a wonderful occasion and one of my nephews from Washington and his wife came down to be there, it was just, and some of my colleagues who were at Boston University School of Social Work [Boston, Massachusetts] who are now at the School of Social Work at the University of Maryland [Baltimore, Maryland] were there, and so, it was just a sweet thing.
Story_ID: 235905
Speaker 1: Is there anything else that you want to add to this [The] HistoryMaker[s] interview that I have not asked you about?
Speaker 2: No, I would just say that, you know, to partially understand me is to know that I have been driven by the fact that my father [Hilma Jones] never had the opportunities I had to use his brains and his skill, you know, to make a difference in a major way, and so there have been many, many times when opportunities have come my way that I would sort of say, "I'm not gonna do it, I'm not gonna take it, I'm not gonna do that," and I said, then I would stop and say, "my God, my father would have died to have had this opportunity."
Story_ID: 230659
