Speaker 1: All right.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight magazine-ish--People magazine-ish type questions we always ask, and they only require a short answer.  They're kind of a warm-up.  And the first one is:  Do you have a favorite food and what is it?

Story_ID: 102361
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It's Bessie Sims Moore.  S-I-M-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is approximately May of 1910.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And her place of birth is Wilkes County, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them first of all?
Speaker 2: Well, I can't really trace the family too far back on my mother's side.  I remember when I was young I visited with my grandmother, who lived in Wilkes County, Georgia.  And I didn't like the country.  I was down there for about two or three years.  Because in the country, there was work from the time the sun came up until the sun went down, and I didn't like that.  And the first thing I had to do in the morning was get up, walk about two miles to the spring, get fresh water and bring it back two miles, and I just didn't like that.  The only thing I liked about the country was I liked slopping hogs, and I also liked feeding the chickens.  But other than that, I was ready to get out of the country.  When my father [Howard Moore, Sr.] came and got me, I was happy.
Speaker 1: Yeah, two miles is a long walk--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  It is.
Speaker 1: --to carry water back two miles?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: That's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And the water--the spring was nice.  It was moss all around the spring, and the water was very clear and always very cold regardless of what time of year it was.  If it was July, the water was still cold.  When it got back to the house, I don't know whether it was cold or not.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What would you have to carry--
Speaker 2: You have two buckets.  You know, two, maybe a gallon or two-gallon buckets and you carry--and sometimes you put them on a stick or a piece of ripened sugarcane, and you would then put this cane across your back and carry them so that the buckets would hang down.  I liked to carry the buckets in my hand.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well, is there a tradition that--was your grandmother always in Wilkes County?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And my mother had two or three brothers, and the only one that I knew very well was Uncle Shep, because Uncle Shep moved to Atlanta [Georgia].  He lived in Atlanta for a period of time, and he lived nearby.  I used to visit him every other Sunday.
Speaker 1: Now, did her side of the family talk about slavery or Reconstruction or any of those?
Speaker 2: No.  Not to my knowledge.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did they talk about what life was like down there or what, I mean?
Speaker 2: Well, they may have, but I was a kid.  I was only between--at the time I was about three and six years of age when I lived down there.  And I have no recollection of their talking about anything except for it's time to slop the hogs or to feed the chickens.  And I also liked the time when we kill them, kill, kill the hogs, and we hung hams to be cured, 'cause they had a barn, and the barn had sort of like a cathedral ceiling with beams that ran from one side to the other side.  And what they would do, they would take tin and wrap the beams all in tin.  And they would grease the beam, the beams.  And they would hang the hams from the beams, and they'd put a bucket underneath to catch the drippings, because they would use the drippings, the grease, to make lard.  And the reason that they wrapped the beams in tin, I understood, and grease it to keep the rats from getting to the ham, you know, 'cause the rats come in from the field and they'll eat up the hams.  And they would take the grease from the hams and make it into what they call lye soap.  They mixed it with lye and cook it in a big cauldron on the outside.  And you get a big old cauldron of soap, and you cut it up and sell some of it--if anybody wants to buy it, and you use it for the rest of the year.  I liked the ham part (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did they own their own land?
Speaker 2: Yes, they did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know anything about the story about how they got the land?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 102362
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Bessie Sims Moore] grow up on the farm out there [Wilkes County, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: She grew up on the farm, too.  She was about fourteen; maybe fifteen, then she came to Atlanta [Georgia].  And in Atlanta, she became what they call, not a registered nurse, but an occupational nurse.  She did--and she did that kind of work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she go to school in Atlanta for that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She finished high school in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she have any stories about growing up?
Speaker 2: No.  My mom never told many stories about her growing up down in Wilkes County.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you get the impression that--or did they just not talk around you or did you get the impression that they really didn't want to talk about it?
Speaker 2: Well, it may have been that.  They always treated me differently.  I always remember people--everybody treated me differently.  Outside of asking me to do some work, everybody seemed to have kept their distance from me a bit, even as a child.  And I don't really know the reason why, but that's the way I remember it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, we'll try to get to the bottom of that later.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But (laughs)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: All right (laughs).  I hope I get to the bottom about it (laughs).
Speaker 1: But, okay.  So your mother moved to Atlanta when she was about fourteen.
Speaker 2: I'd say about fifteen.  Yes.
Speaker 1: You know.  Became a nurse.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Occupational nurse.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so there're no stories about the ancestors on that side that you know of at all?
Speaker 2: No.  No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have no--that's one of the things that I find is void, because I can only go back and go back in a very limited way to my mother's side of the family, and not much further on my father's side either.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you know your grandfather on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I had never seen him at the farm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it was your grandmother and your mother's siblings?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and her brothers; they were on the farm, and they picked cotton.  Cotton was a big thing that they picked.  That was the big crop that they picked.  And the other big crop that they used--they had was corn.  And people always talking about picking cotton and (unclear) and stuff like that.  But what I didn't like was picking--was shucking corn--not shucking corn, but what they call pulling fodder, 'cause now at the end of about July, the beginning of August, the corn is ripe, it's ready to be pulled, and you got our first and feel, and you pull the fodder from the corn stalks.  I didn't like that, man.  That was rough.  And, plus the people'll tell you these stories about the snake, and it's called a coachwhip.  And these things--these stories were probably just made up, but they say that the snake, coachwhip a long black snake, and what the coachwhip would do, he'd catch it and wrap himself around you and whip you, you know (laughs).  But I saw a couple of two or three of them killed.  My dad [Howard Moore, Sr.] came down and he was a good shot.  I mean, he killed snakes with a rifle.  Most people kill them with a shotgun.  He could kill a squirrel and a snake or rabbit with a rifle.  And it's much better if you're gonna kill a squirrel or a rabbit with a rifle than a shotgun, 'cause the buckshot gets in them--into the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --body, and it's not--you have to pick it out before you can eat it.  But when you shoot him with a rifle, it's just one shot.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  When you shoot a shotgun it sprays pellets out.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Right.
Story_ID: 102363
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now, can you give us your father's full name and spell it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  His name was Howard Moore, Sr.  It's spelled just like mine, and Senior was abbreviated to S-R.
Speaker 1: And what was his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't know my father's date of birth.  My father was born in Sparta, Georgia, and I forget which county that is [Hancock County].  And he had four sisters--three or four sisters.
Speaker 1: Now was he older than your mother [Bessie Sims Moore]?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So would you kind of guess about how much older he was or maybe?
Speaker 2: I think he was probably about ten years older than my mother.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So maybe about 1900 or so he was born.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So what do you know about the ancestors on your dad's side?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know much about the ancestors on my dad's side either.  I know his sisters.  I know basically Aunt Fannie best of all, because Aunt Emmy--Aunt Emma, she died in about 1938, because that was the first time I had heard the word "death."  And it was a Sunday afternoon they said that "Aunt Emmy is dead."  I thought they meant that she'd been hit in the head.  But she died, you know.  And my mom, my dad, and my aunt Fannie buried her.  And the other sister, her sister Lillian, she died a year later on.  And my father died in April--not April, but February 1943; just two and a half weeks before my birthday.  He died from pneumonia.  It was kind of sudden.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were about eleven years old?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I would have been eleven years old within two weeks.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So you don't know much about the ancestors on your father's side either?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, did they--were they--did they have a place in Sparta?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I never visited the country in Sparta.  I knew my father and his sisters from--and my aunts--from Atlanta [Georgia].  And Aunt Fannie had been a school, a school principal.  And at one time, she was married to a guy who owned a construction company by the name of Sam White.  And her name was Fannie White.  And she was a longtime school teacher, and she was teaching at the time she died.  She teached in Rockdale Park [Atlanta, Georgia], and she taught the fifth grade.  She was a fantastic woman.  That's the reason why I'm not a teacher myself.  From my Aunt Fannie, I thought that to be a teacher you had to be brilliant.  Aunt Fannie, she seemed to have known everything; she played the piano, she could sing, she directed plays, she corrected other teachers.  And she was just really a fantastic woman.  She was really, really, really, really very smart.
Speaker 1: So she made a tremendous impact on you, I see.  You mean she was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  I mean--and my relationship with Aunt Fannie was probably closer than with anyone else.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, now, is there a story as to how your father's family moved to Atlanta?  Did they--was there--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They came to Atlanta to go to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  They wanted to be educated.  It was difficult to get education back in that day in the country.  And it was somewhat easier in the city, even though it was still difficult, difficult because there were few schools for blacks--for African Americans even in the city.  But the opportunities in the city were much better than they were in Sparta, Georgia, and they were much better in Atlanta than they were; living conditions were much better in Atlanta than they were in Sparta, Georgia.  I know I had--in about 1990 or '91 [1991], I was back in Atlanta doing a case, and we had a--it was at the end of the day, and this fella called me over.  And he introduced himself.  He told me who he was.  His name was Nathaniel Hill, I believe.  And he had been a student of my aunt in the fifth grade out in Rockdale Park.  And he told me that he wanted to tell me that his father died and that my aunt--and he was in school that day--and my aunt told him that his father had died and that she took him home.
Story_ID: 102364
Speaker 1: He had never thanked her.  And that was the story.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, did your father [Howard Moore, Sr.] go to college in Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 1: Yes.  My father went to college.  He went to high school, and he went to college.  But he never used his education, because the only job that was available to him was in the post office.  And my father didn't--wasn't the type of person that could work under any kind of regime like that.  And so my father learned the art of being a tailor, the craft of being a tailor.  And he worked as a tailor, and he--my father was really a guy who enjoyed his life.  He had a good time.  And what would happen sometimes, around May when the Kentucky Derby would take, would happen, he would go North to the derby [Louisville, Kentucky] and even maybe to Belmont [Stakes in Elmont, New York] to the Preakness [Stakes in Baltimore, Maryland] and see what he could do, see how his luck would run.  And if his luck ran out, he would then play semipro ball or whatever until he could get a stadium, then he'd come back home, you know, and work.  But my father loved to have a good time.  I remember when my father was alive, that on Saturday night, for example, my mom [Bessie Sims Moore] would be in the kitchen cooking, and Aunt Fannie [White] would be playing the upright piano, she had an upright piano; my dad would play the spoons; and another friend of his would be playing a washboard, you know (laughs); and somebody else would have an improvised bass with a broom and a wire rubber.  And they just sing and play until they couldn't sing and play anymore.  They'd just have a good time.  My dad and Aunt Fannie had that same kind of disposition.  My mom was very different.  She was very observant and very quiet.  And I never heard my mom curse or say a curse word or say anything bad or evil about anybody else.  But she would always observe people and say something about what they were doing and how they were doing it and doing it better.  In my family, from the time I was a little boy, I knew I was going to go to college.  And so that never crossed my mind that I wouldn't go to college.  And my mother didn't--nobody in my family looked at going to school, getting an education for the purpose of getting a job.  That was never mentioned that you got to go to school to get a job.  My mother always said, "You have to go to school to get the wool off your eyes."  Said, "There's a lot of wool over your eyes."  Said, "People try to keep you in darkness.  They put wool over your eyes.  They tell you lies.  And you have to get as much information as you know, as you can, so you'll know that these are lies and how to deal with the lies."  And she always emphasized that, you know.  "You got to get the wool off your eyes, Howard."
Story_ID: 102365
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story about how your parents [Howard Moore, Sr. and Bessie Sims Moore] met or about their courtship?
Speaker 2: Well (laughs), I don't know.  They met, they had a good time.  They had my sister.  I had a sister named Mary.  She was about two years older than me.  I never knew her because she died at age two from food poisoning; that's what I understand.  But I--from what I heard from my dad, he saw my mom, he liked her and they hit it off.
Speaker 1: Did they meet at a party or a church or at--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I'm sure they didn't meet--he might have seen my mother at a church passing--he was passing by.  My mom may have been at a church, but my dad wasn't in a church.  My dad didn't want to have anything to do with church, okay.  And my Aunt Fannie [White], she was pretty close to the same point of view.  And I think that my mother's interest in church was more of a social one than it was of a religious one.
Story_ID: 102366
Speaker 1: That's kind of unusual in Atlanta [Georgia], you know.  When you think about the South, you think about the Bible Belt.  And when you're in Atlanta now, I mean--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you're bombarded with church.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, I mean, were they [Howard Moore, Sr. and Bessie Sims Moore] criticized by other people for that stance?  Or did you--I don't know.
Speaker 2: Well, I went to church, okay.  I went to the--on Butler Street.  The church is still there now.  It's the Butler Street C.M.E., you know, what's it, Colored African, Methodist Episcopal Colored Church.
Speaker 1: Yep.  Yep.  It used to be Colored Methodist Episcopal (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Whatever it is.
Speaker 1: Now it's Christian Methodist Episcopal.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So one time we had the situation where the church sort of split up, because we had a light-skinned minister by the name of Rev. Denton [ph.].  He was a pretty good minister.  And so one congregation split up and went and started having services in the Hanley's Funeral Home [Hanley's Bell Street Funeral Home], which is located on Bell Street in Atlanta.  It may still be there if it hasn't been torn down.  And it was a three-story building.  And the auditorium for where the church met was on the third floor, and you had to walk up the steps to the third floor.  And so when you get to the second floor, they have the bodies laying out in the casket.  And back in those days, man, when a fellow was in the casket or a woman, they really looked dead, because they didn't have the makeup and cosmetics that they have now.  I mean, you looked really dead.  And you go up some stairs to the third floor and hear the preacher talking 'bout getting up, going to heaven and Judgment Day, and all that stuff, and glory, and you say--I would say to myself, "How can that be true with this guy in the box?  There's no way he's going to get out of that box, that coffin that he's in, you know.  I don't care how pretty it is, it's a box.  And they gonna lock him up."  And I said, "Wow, I'm outta here."  And I started going to the movies (laughs).  And I would go to church occasionally then after.  And when I was in college, I went to Wheat Street Baptist Church because Rev. Williams Holmes Borders, Sr. was a fantastic minister.  He was, you know, college educated.  He had degrees from Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois] in theology, and he was a terrific minister and had built this fantastic church.  They had over 3,500 members.  And he had--he conducted his services with the sign.  They had--his daughter Jewel would render the services in sign language for the people who are hard of hearing or who had a hearing deficit; had a trumpet player, a guy with a drum, snare drum; eventually, he got a guitarist (laughs); and it was pretty smooth.  I mean, his Easter sermons on Easter Sunday morning, his sermon was something else.  I mean, he would have Jesus in the crypt, and he would roll back the rock.  He would get down and he'd be blowing into the mic, and then as the rock rolls back and Jesus ascends--is resurrected, then the snare drums come up, and then the trumpet come in, and the guitar and then the choir come in.  I mean, you get--that's a good feeling, you know.  It's a good presentation, a good dramatization, you know.  And it's a lot of spirit in the church.  And then--and the church is very democratic except for one position, that was position of pastor (laughs).  And Rev. Borders is now deceased.  I don't know how well the church is doing, but--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It's Rev. Brodess?
Speaker 2: Borders.  B-O-R--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Borders.  Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  B-O-R-D-E-R-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we would refer to the church as God's Mighty Fortress on Auburn Avenue.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right there on Auburn.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 102367
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this:  When you think about your parents' personalities, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I'm probably a little of my father [Howard Moore, Sr.] and my mother [Bessie Sims Moore], because I have that observant--I think I have the observant quality of hers, and I love to have a good time.  And so I think I have a little of each, but especially my mother in terms of being observant and sometimes being calm and not panicking.  I rarely panic, especially when it's something very important.  It's not likely that I'm gonna panic.  I might get excited and exclaim a lot when it's something minor, something trivial.  But if it's something important, I'm very calm.
Story_ID: 102368
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Boy, my earliest childhood memory is going to movies with my father [Howard Moore, Sr.] and my aunt [Fannie White] and walking back home.  And the other memories are playing catch with my dad, and playing baseball with my dad.  He played baseball.  He was very good at baseball.  And the other memory that I have is, every March we would fly kites.  In those days, our dry cleaning would come in long brown bags, just like grocery bags are today, and you take those bags and we probably, we'd probably take some reeds or small sticks from sugarcane or something like that and make a kite, a triangular-type form kite.  And then we would let it go, you know.  And the street that's there now, it's Baker Street.  And sometimes my dad would get a kite and it would go all the way down to the next block in the air.  The next block would be Butler Street.  And that's probably about twice the size of a football field from where we were.  We'd catch the wind and the kite would go in the air and be that far away, you know.  And we did that in March, 'cause in March you always have high winds.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And one of the things about Atlanta [Georgia] now is that where I live, there's no physical memory object to associate your memory with the place.
Speaker 1: There's no remnants of it now.
Speaker 2: Right.  Because--well, we lived on Fort Street, F-O-R-T, the second house from Baker Street.  Now, and Fort Street ran from Bedford--not from Bedford, but from Forrest Avenue all the way to Edgewood, and I think a little further.  And at Forrest Avenue, which was named for Bedford B. Forrest, one of the founders of the Ku Klux Klan.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Nathan Bedford Forrest.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.  And then from Forrest Avenue to Ponce de Leon Avenue, it was known as Bedford Place.  And from Ponce de Leon all the way out past beyond the Piedmont Driving Club it was known as Argonne.  And so when you go to Atlanta now, the Fort Street that I lived on is known as Bedford, because that goes all the way into Edgewood, I believe now.  And they moved Fort Street to about two blocks west, and it's about, I think, a one-block street and it's a vacant.  Where we lived is actually a vacant area and part of a park, part of the--I don't know what they call the park--but that's what's there.  And that's really one of the bad things about urban renewal and all.  It destroys urban memory, you know.  You don't have landmarks to associate with your memory or anything, it's gone.
Speaker 1: The house is gone too?
Speaker 2: Everything's gone.
Speaker 1: It's gone?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The whole community is gone, you know.  You couldn't--you can't find a single person who lived there in that community now at all.  And that would mean--it would take you probably two or three months to locate people who once lived in that community, and their children and grandchildren.  There's nothing there anymore.
Story_ID: 102369
Speaker 1: Well, tell us what it was like living there and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, the sounds were--it was pretty quiet.  And basically, the sounds were sounds of birds and chirping and people walking down the street talking.  And sometimes there'd be a fight down on Clifton Place.  That would be on Saturday; but otherwise it was very quiet.  And it was very pretty and green.  Fort Street was paved.  On one side it was concrete, on the other side it was brick.  There were trees on one side on some blocks and trees on both sides in the other blocks.  And the other streets were the same way.  Clifton was not paved, and the next street over, forget the name of it--for one block it was--they were both one-block streets, and they weren't paved.  But the other streets in the neighborhood were all paved.  And we all walked to school.
Story_ID: 102775
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now you grew up during the heyday of Auburn Avenue [Atlanta, Georgia] and all of that.  So you must have--what--you were telling us about the sights and sounds and smells of the neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Right.  And it was just a beautiful neighborhood.  And at one time at the corner of Fort Street and Baker [Street], there was a Jewish family that lived there, and they ran a grocery store.  But either during the war, World War II, or right after the war they moved out.  And when they moved out, there were no other white people in the community.  And actually if you saw white people, you had to go all the way to Boulevard or some place.  And we could go for weeks and weeks and not see any white people, and not even be concerned that we didn't see any.
Story_ID: 102776
Speaker 1: And I went to David T. Howard elementary and junior high school [David T. Howard High School, in Atlanta, Georgia], which later became a senior high school.  And it was a very beautiful school.  It's a U-shaped building up on what then was Houseton [ph.] or Houston Street.  It's now, I think, John Wesley Dobbs Drive [sic, Avenue], 'cause he lived across the street from the school.  And there was a U-shaped red brick building, had a beautiful lawn, big playground; and we just had a great time in school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And when we first--initially, we would have hand-me-down band uniforms and hand-me-down books.  But around 1948 or so that changed.  We got new books; we got a new gymnasium; got new uniforms; got uniforms for our teams, for our basketball, our track team and our baseball team.   And one of the interesting things about my high school is that we had women sports. We had women basketball and we had women track. I never thought anything of it.  And I didn't think anything would happen in women sports until, you know, the late '70s [1970s] or '80s [1980s], when it became an issue.  And I don't remember any agitation to have women sports.  I don't how we got women sports.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That seems to be--a lot of people I talk to, a lot of women played basketball in high school--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 2: --in those days, you know, back in the '30s [1930s] and the '40s [1940s], you know.  I guess it disappeared.  I don't--you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It was a terrific--see, I wrote for my high school.  I wrote and I covered the high school sports, and my articles appeared in the Atlanta Daily World.  And so the--we loved basketball season, because some women traveled with us.  We all traveled on the same bus (laughs).  That was a lot of fun.  We had a good time.
Story_ID: 102777
Speaker 1: Okay.  I don't want to take you too far too fast, but I want to take you back to grade school days.  So was there a name for your particular neighborhood?  Did they call it something?
Speaker 2: We called it Fourth Ward.
Speaker 1: Fourth Ward.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was the main drag through your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: The main drag would be--running perpendicular to Auburn Avenue would be my street, Fort Street.
Speaker 1: Fort.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And the next main drag would be Butler Street.  And Butler Street cut through Buttermilk Bottom.  And one of the things I remember about--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now (laughs) tell us what Buttermilk Bottom is.
Speaker 2: It was tough.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Buttermilk Bottom was tough.  I mean--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It was like a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was--except for Butler Street, which was paved and all, the other streets in other areas, other streets, weren't paved in Buttermilk Bottom.  And a lot of rough people there starting cutting.  A lot of people got razored in Buttermilk Bottom.  I even had a paper route at one time in Buttermilk Bottom when I was in the seventh grade.  I remember I had a paper route.  I was doing the Atlanta Daily Journal at the time.  And so our teacher, Dr. P.E. Johnson, was teaching us declensions and conjugations and all that stuff, you know.  And so, at that time, we had the responsibility of collecting from subscribers.  So this one subscriber I had lived in this two-story house; big ol' two-story apartment-type house; big ol' house with about 16 or 20 units; lived up on the second floor.  So--and it had a porch, so you could walk--you access it from the outside; you didn't have to go inside.  So I went up to his apartment one day.  I knocked on the door, "bam, bam, bam."  He said, "Who is it?"  And I replied, "It is I.  Your Atlanta Journal paperboy."  Said, "Who?  What?"  And so, he came to the door.  He opened the door, he said, "Nigger, why didn't you tell me it was you?"  And I said, I explained to him that Professor Johnson was teaching us how to speak properly and the conjugated verbs and all.  And he said, "That nigger gonna get you killed."  (Laughs.)
Speaker 1: The conjugation doesn't work in every instance.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  Right.  You know.  Yeah.  So, you know, I was just practicing up, you know (laughs).
Story_ID: 102778
Speaker 1: That's a funny story.  So--but, you know, so you could have a route in Buttermilk Bottom [Atlanta, Georgia] even though it's dangerous.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But you weren't really afraid or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't afraid.  Nobody bothered me.  I was known as Miss Bessie's [Bessie Sims Moore] boy or Aunt Fannie's [Fannie White] boy.  Nobody bothered me anyplace, okay; because, one, when my aunt was alive, she would help other people who couldn't read too well or couldn't read at all or couldn't write too well or couldn't write at all.  And she would go read.  She would read to them if they would ask her.  If they ask her to write a letter or something, she would do that.  So when my aunt died in 1945, some of the people thought that I had inherited her assistance, you know; community assistance, so they would ask me to do it, and I would do it, you know.  And I never thought anything about it, 'cause I was known throughout the community.  Nobody bothered bother me, no bullies or nothing.  I had one incident with a guy that caused me a little trouble.  I was doing my route.  And I was collecting my route, and Jab, this big ol' dude--Jab was about 6'2", he was real buffed, and he was about five or six years older than I was, you know.  And so he kept following me, and he was playing the dozens.  I said, "Jab, I don't want to play the dozens with you.  Leave me alone.  I'm collecting my route."  So he just--he wouldn't listen.  So he just kept on, you know.  So I acted irrationally, 'cause I'm only--I'm a little dude in a way.  I'm only--I'm 6'2", but I only way about 135 pounds, you know.  And I'm not buffed at all.  But my temper got the better of me and I turned around and hit Jab upside the head, bam.  And I knew I was in trouble.  So I took off running, and Jab took off behind me.  And just as I got up to my house, I ran up the steps, I saw what was a curtain rod or something over on the corner.  I grabbed it and I turned around and I hit Jab across his nose and blood went everywhere, and Jab fell back on his butt and I thought he was dead, you know.  But he just had a broken nose, and so we had to take care of his medical bills and that was it.  They never called the police or anything, you know.  But nobody ever bothered me.  And they talked about how I hit Jab, too, you know, how I laid Jab out.  They said, "You see Lamb [ph.]"--they called me Lam back then--"the Lamb laid Jab out, you know.  He hit that sucker, and so and so and so and so."  And that was cool, you know.
Speaker 1: They called you Lamb?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now why did they call--where did that come from?
Speaker 2: Well, a lot of us were called Lamb, you know, because I was really--I was very quiet.  I was a very nice person, you know.  And I could talk to everybody, and I'd help people who didn't do well in school.  And I was like a safety patrol.  And one of my responsibilities one time was pick up two guys every morning and bring them to school.  One was named Sylvester Evans and the other dude, his name was Rabbit.  And I forget Rabbit's real name, but the reason why he was called Rabbit is that, sometimes in class we have a spelling bee, you know, and you'd get a word, and, you know, you have to spell that word.  And so the professor called out "rabbit," and he spelled the word, you know.  We were all--everybody in class was surprised.  So from then on, we called him Rabbit, you know.  But I had to go get him every morning and bring him to school to keep him from laying out, you know, him and Sylvester.  I don't know what became of Sylvester or what became of Rabbit, you know.
Speaker 1: So that was a job as a patrol boy, you'd actually have to go and escort, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as a truant--almost like a truant assignment or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I pick them up in the mornings, and sometimes Jasper would be with me, and Jasper, Jasper Warren, he played on the football team, and he was a little dude.  He played guard.  But he had perfected this technique of submarining, going underneath the opposing player and getting into the backfield and making tackles.  So Jas [ph.] was on the team.  But Jas had convinced us that he was an orphan.  And, you know, we all would--everybody helped Jas.  I helped him; Billy helped him, Dr. [William Holmes] Borders' son, Billy Borders [William Holmes Borders, Jr.]; Pete did, Pete Lyma [ph.].  And Jas died about 1967.  We went to the funeral and Jas's mother was there.  She came down from Chicago [Illinois], you know (laughs).  And so Jas wasn't really an orphan.  He was just distanced from his, I guess, natural mother, whatever, you know, didn't want to tell us or whatever.
Story_ID: 102779
Speaker 1: But we really had a--I mean, it was--we had a good time in school.  I mean, we had really--I enjoyed it.  I learned a lot in junior high school.  I don't remember learning anything in high school.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: But I had a real good time in high school.  I enjoyed high school.
Speaker 2: Now, what high school did you go to?
Speaker 1: David T. Howard [High School in Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: See, the school became--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In 1948 it became a full-fledged high school.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So it started--it was the elementary school you went to-- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It was elementary--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: ---became a junior school.  Right?
Speaker 1: It was elementary, junior high school--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --elementary and junior high, and then it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --then it became a high school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was the second high school in Atlanta [Georgia].  And the land for the David T. Howard schools had been given to the city of Atlanta by David Taliaferro [sic, Tobias] Howard, who was a well-to-do black mortician in Atlanta.  He gave the city a whole city block.  And if you go there, you can see it now.  It's this huge block.  And they moved what was once known as the Summer Hill School to that site, and it became--they named it for David T. Howard.
Story_ID: 102780
Speaker 1: Okay.  There're so many--now, you came along at a time when there were so many prominent Atlanta [Georgia] people doing things; doing great, great things.  I mean, you know, John Wesley Dobbs, you say, was right across the street from the school [David T. Howard High School]?
Speaker 2: Right.  He was with--he was the head of the sleeping car porters at the time.  Walter White, who lived on what we called Houston Street--other people called Houseton Street [ph.] rather than other people call Houston Street--he was the secretary of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  He was from Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Walter White--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in his book "A Man Called White"--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he opens it up with passing his father the rifle during the riot of 1910.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Shooting the people coming across the lawn.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That's, I mean--you know.
Speaker 2: He was there.  And there was a congressman--not a congressman, but a member of the City Council in Chicago by the name of [Christopher] Wimbish.  He lived in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He actually lived on Fort Street.  Ben Davis, Jr. [Benjamin Jefferson Davis, Jr.], who lived in New York [New York City, New York], he became--he was the--he lived in Atlanta as a practicing lawyer.  He had graduated from Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] in 1931 [sic, 1929], and he represented Angelo Herndon, who was accused of a capital crime in Atlanta.  And after the Herndon case, he moved to New York, and he became a City Councilman.  And he wrote an autobiographical book called the "Communist Councilman from Harlem."  There was Mattiwilda Dobbs, she was a famous singer.  She was an operatic singer, John Wesley Dobbs's daughter, one of his daughters.  There was Dr. William Holmes Borders, Sr., who was a well-known minister throughout the country at the time.
Speaker 1: Now he was a Wheat Street--(unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Wheat Street Baptist Church.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And there was Wynton Kelly, who was a pianist, a jazz pianist.  And at one time, Little Richard was in Atlanta, 'cause he studied with a famous performer by the name of Billy Wright, and used to perform at the Royal Peacock, a club there.  Now it's still there.  It's between Butler Street and Cortland on the right-hand side.
Speaker 1: And so (unclear) seems like a--now, did you know [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] coming up?  I mean--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I knew Dr. King.  Yes.  Yes.  I knew Dr. King, and his brother was in--when I graduated from high school, with me, A.D. [Alfred Daniel Williams King]
Speaker 1: A.D.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  I knew Dr. King.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And they call--some people who knew Dr. King called him "Mike," you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He was always pretty much the same.  I mean, sharp dresser and had a reputation of being very smart, 'cause he entered college [Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia] at, I think, fifteen.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now, A.D. was his older brother.  Right?  He was the oldest, was he?--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I think A.D. was the younger brother.
Speaker 1: He's younger?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: The sisters [HM Christine King Farris], I believe, are older.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  Okay.  Yeah, because Dr. King was born in '29 [1929], I think.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  You were born in '32.
Speaker 2: --'Cause he's three years older than I am.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Right.  Okay.  Now, did you know the Bonds in Atlanta?
Speaker 2: These Bonds?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (Laughs.)  No.  They were newcomers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Bonds were newcomers.  They were latecomers to Atlanta, 'cause I mean, when my wife's [HM Jane Bond Moore] father was the president of Fort Valley State [University in Fort Valley, Georgia], that's down in the country, and I knew of Dr. Bond from his contribution to the brief in Brown v. Board of Education.  He was one of the scholarly contributors to that brief.  And his name appears on at least a commemorative issue of the brief, if not on the brief itself.
Speaker 1: Yes, Dr. Horace Mann Bond?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 102781
Speaker 1: Now who is at Morehouse [College in Atlanta, Georgia] then?
Speaker 2: At Morehouse, Dr. Benjamin Elijah Mays.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He came to Morehouse about 1938 and--1940, and he really turned Morehouse around, 'cause at that time, Morehouse was having a lot of serious problems.
Speaker 1: Now, and--you got Dr. Mays; you got, let's see--now, did ever meet Dr. [W.E.B.] DuBois?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  I knew of him, but by the time I was, you know, in college or whatever, I didn't meet--Dr. Du Bois wasn't in Atlanta.  There was a fella by the name of Dr. William Boyd, who was the--who taught political science at Atlanta University, and he was the chairman of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And doctor--and, of course, Colonel A.T. Walden, who--in a way, he was like the de facto mayor of the city.  And he had been--he was a graduate of University of Michigan Law School [Ann Arbor, Michigan] in 1911.  And the story is told that when he returned to Atlanta--returned to his hometown in, I think, Bibb County, Macon, Georgia, that they wouldn't allow him to come into the courthouse and file his papers.  He had to bring them to the back door.  That's the story that I was told about him.  But, he was a brilliant man.  And nothing happened in Atlanta unless he was consulted.  And in 1948, I'm told that he stuck with [President Harry S.] Truman.  And after Truman was reelected, I understand that Truman wanted to make him the governor of the Virgin Islands, which that was a position that usually went to African-Americans; and that Dr.-- Colonel Walden--they called him Colonel Walden, 'cause he had been--that's an honorary title for lawyers in Georgia at that time, and also he had been in the military and had, I believe, attained that rank as well--and that Colonel Walden refused to be appointed the governor of the Virgin Islands.  And he told--I understand that he told President Truman that what he wanted, that he wanted anyone who would be appointed to the Federal District Court and to the Court of Appeals in Atlanta and in the Fifth Circuit at that time, to be vetted through him, and that Truman wouldn't appoint anyone that he didn't approve of.  And apparently Truman agreed to it.  So, as a result of that, we got judges who were a bit more moderate than they would have been if they didn't have to have Colonel Walden's approval.  And he eventually became a municipal judge in Atlanta.  And I think he passed around 1965 or 1966 [sic, 1965].  So I remember going out to a hospital with [A.] Leon Higginbotham [Jr.], because Leon had found a book that talked about Colonel Walden.  And he took it out to Colonel Walden and autographed it for him.  That was in 1965 or '66 [1966], 'cause my wife [HM Jane Bond Moore] and I--I believe she went with us--we went out to see Colonel Walden in the hospital.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was Judge Higginbotham from Atlanta?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he, you know, he was a tremendous researcher.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he'd found this book discussing Colonel Walden, he thought Colonel Walden would like it.  And since he was in Atlanta, he wanted to take it to him and we went with him.
Story_ID: 102782
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Thank you for that sharing that with us.  I never heard of him [Colonel A.T. Walden] (unclear).
Speaker 2: But he's an unsung, unsung person of that era.  He was the old guard.  And when the young people came in, like [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and SNCC, Students Nonviolent Coordinated Committee, and sometimes they referred to people of doctor--of Colonel Walden's era as "Toms," you know, because, you know, they had relationships that they had nurtured.  They couldn't break those relationships and take the same posture and the stances that Dr. King or the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee could take.  And so in that sense, they could, I mean, could be perceived by many as being Uncle Tom.  But he fought for equalization of schools; of teacher salary, which didn't exist; equalization of books and supplies, which didn't exist.  He fought for fifteen years to get African American police officers, because the first agitation of note for African American police officers in Atlanta followed the shooting death of Blind David Glover, who was shot to death in 1932 in the back.  And for some fifteen years, there was agitation to get police officers.  And in 1947 and-or '48 [1948], Atlanta got its first black police officers.  And the officers had--their precinct was in the YMCA, the Butler Street YMCA.  And I remember that Saturday when they first came on duty, because all of the--it was six to twelve officers [sic, eight], it may have been.  It was a small contingency.  They walked from the YMCA all the way down Butler Street, up to Forrest Avenue, and back up to--back down Fort Street   back to Auburn Avenue.  And they couldn't arrest any white people at that time.  They didn't have authority to arrest white people at all.  But that was the beginning of African American police officers in Atlanta.  And Colonel Walden was instrumental in doing that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they--so, yeah, what you described to us, some of the neighborhoods were pretty wild, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in those days in the South.
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, Buttermilk Bottom was pretty-- pretty wild, okay.
Speaker 1: So the white officers would--now, when Blind--David--what's his name?
Speaker 2: Glover.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Glover was shot--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he was actually blind, I suppose (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.  He was a blind man.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And, you know, people couldn't understand why you'd shoot a blind man (laughs).  You know.  So that led to the agitation for black police officers.  It took some fifty years to do it.  And Colonel Walden was responsible for organizing and giving direction to the black electorate, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's interesting.
Speaker 2: Every (unclear), the mayor, William B. Hartsfield, which--who had a reputation of being somewhat of a liberal.  And the City Council didn't make any moves without discussing it with Colonel Walden.
Speaker 1: So that's why you call him the de facto mayor--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of the city.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: 'Cause even in those days, the population of Atlanta was largely black.  Right?
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't largely black, but it was becoming black.  But Colonel Walden, his knowledge, his insight was so deep and keen that if you were sensible at all, you would consult this man, 'cause he could give you some insights on how you could do things and what should be done that would pacify, to some extent, blacks and be acceptable by whites.  So he was just an invaluable resource in our community.
Story_ID: 102783
Speaker 1: You know, Atlanta [Georgia] was different from most places because we had our own institutions.  We had our own bank.  From the time I was a little boy, I had an account in the Citizens Trust Bank.  I still have an account in Citizens Trust Bank.  Okay.  We had our own radio station.  It was WERD, which was sold some time ago to a white group.  But it was owned by J.B. Blayton [Jesse B. Blayton Sr.], who was a CPA; and I think Dr. Milton and Dr. Yates.  And it was a daylight station and licensed from Canada, 'cause it could only broadcast between the daylight hours, from about six in the morning until dark at night, WERD; but we-they exposed us to jazz because no other stations, as far as I know, played jazz except WERD.  And we had people like "Jockey Jack" Gibson ["Jack the Rapper"] and [David] Dave Bondu.  I think "Jockey Jack" Gibson is probably still alive.  He lives in Florida, you know.  But they exposed us to jazz.  We, you know, got all the latest jazz from New York [New York City, New York], Chicago [Illinois], wherever.  We had our own--what you call them--drugstores and pharmacies; the Yates and Milton [Drugstore] (unclear) at the corner of Butler and Auburn, and the other one was at the corner of what then was Westfair and Chestnut Street.  The name has now been changed on the West Side.  And there may have been a third store.  But you can go in there, and you can get a sundae, you know.  You can go in there and get a nice sundae, banana split or whatever.  And you can go in with your date, and you'd really have a nice time.  It was a nice, clean, well-run place, you know; hot dogs and stuff.  And on Auburn across the street, at one time, there was a bakery, the New Moon Bakery.  They used to sell Joe Louis sodas.  It isn't there anymore.  It was a good bakery.  And, of course, there was the Royal Hotel [later the Royal Peacock], which was right across the street from what then was the Yates and Milton; and Atlanta Life [Insurance Company] was right there at the corner, the Atlanta Life Building; and the Federal Mutual Savings was up the street.
Story_ID: 102784
Speaker 1: Now, when you were, I guess, between junior high school [David T. Howard High School] and your second year in high school, you lost your--the second or third year in high school, you lost your father and your aunt.
Speaker 2: Well, my father [Howard Moore, Sr.] died in '43 [1943], so I was still in elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember when my aunt [Fannie White] died, because my aunt died in September 1945.  And the reason that I remember so vividly when my aunt died, is that August 6th, when they dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima [Japan], on the top of the page, there was some pictures of this mushroom cloud with the word above, "A-tom Bomb"--"Atom Bomb," rather.  And so I took the paper--and this is the "Atlanta Constitution"--I took the paper in to my aunt.  I said, "Aunt Fannie, they dropped the A-tom bomb."  And she says to me, "Howard, it's not A-tom, it's atom."  And that was the last words she taught me to pronounce, you know, it was "atom."  And she died in September.  And when my--my mother [Bessie Sims Moore], at the time, was living in Ohio, in Lorain, Ohio.  She was working at the National Steel Plant [U.S. Steel] in Ohio.  She worked there during the war.
Speaker 1: So you were actually living with your aunt then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was living with my aunt.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my aunt was--called me in one day, about the middle of August, and she told me, she says, "Howard, you go out in the backyard to the coalhouse," 'cause we had a coalhouse in the back, "You go over in the corner on the same side as the door is, you know, there's a door opens onto, and I want you to move all the dirt and stuff down to about two or three inches, and you'll see a piece of tin, you know.  And pull that tin up.  It's gonna be some more dirt and you dig that up, and it should be about a ten-gallon jar there.  And go down and do that and come back, and let me know if it's there and what you saw."  And so I did what she told me, and I went back--and I went back and told her.  I say, "Yeah, it's there."  And I say what I saw, I saw money in the jar.  She said, "All right.  Did you cover it up?"  I said, "Yes, ma'am, I covered it up."  And she said, "You make sure that nobody knows it's been disturbed."  She says, "If anything happens to me, you dig that jar up and you give it to Bessie.  All right?"  Talking about my mom.  And she said, "That's for you, to take care of you," you know.  And so after she died, I gave the jar to my mom, and it was a considerable sum of money in cash.  And so at my aunt's funeral when they were burying her, some lady says that--was saying, "Well, Bessie should have put her in a vault."  Meaning, you know, you know what vault is.  Right?
Speaker 1: Mmhm.
Speaker 2: It's concrete and you cover the casket in concrete, you know.  So my mom said, "Fannie didn't her money thrown away.  She had purpose in her life for her.  She had a further purpose in life for the use of her money.  She didn't want me throwing it away on a vault."  Says, "The same thing gonna happen to you, whether you're in a vault or not, you know, you're gonna rot, you know.  That's the way it is.  And you ought to know that, and stop running around here making these ignorant statements."  That's what my mom told this lady, you know (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 102785
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when your aunt [Fannie White] died, did your mother [Bessie Sims Moore] come back from Lorain [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  She came back and we stayed in Atlanta [Georgia].  She came back and she took over the house and everything, you know.  But that was the saddest time in my life, though, when my aunt died.  Wow.
Speaker 1: You said you spent some of the money when your mother got sick, that some had to be spent on her.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, 'cause she had to have nursing care, and she had a stroke.  And so she recovered and--but she had to have nursing care.  And she had nursing care until--from--for the next 18 to 19 months that she was alive, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is--is this like after--how--about when was that?
Speaker 2: This is in 19--my mom died in 1971.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She died January 1971.
Speaker 1: Oh, so there was still some of that money left in '71 [1971].
Speaker 2: Right.  'Cause my mom never threw anything away.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  She never threw any money away.  I gave her some of--gave her the money and she used it, 'cause she would--when she worked in the steel mill [U.S. Steel], she was buying savings bonds.  She bought--she had a whole stack of shoeboxes of savings bonds, 'cause she bought a savings bond every pay period for $50.  You know, you pay $37, you get a $50 bond during the war [World War II].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she was taking advantage of all the--I know a lot of women were employed during--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the war because there weren't men around to do the jobs.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: The money was good.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Money was real good, you know.  My mom saved her money, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My mom didn't throw away anything.  She didn't have any kind of extravagancies at all.
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 1: So you finished high school [David T. Howard High School in Atlanta, Georgia] in--now, did you--I didn't ask you, but did you have a favorite teacher in high school or in school period?  'Cause you were in the same school all the way through.
Speaker 2: (Laughs.)  No, I didn't.  I didn't have a favorite teacher in high school, you know.  Mr. Furlough (sp), he was mean.  He would say, "I'll ruin you."  My favorite person in high school was the principal, Charles Gideon, C.L. Gideon, 'cause he was quite a character.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his last name?
Speaker 2: G-I-D-E-O-N.  Gideon.
Speaker 1: Gideon.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he was a character.  And he would--if we would cut school or something, he'd come looking for us.  And it'd be like a roundup.  And he would say, "What would Chief"--we called him Chief Gideon--"What would Chief do to you if you don't get back to school?"  And you'd say, "The Chief would smoke my britches."  And the Chief would have us running back to school, man.  That was our favorite person in high school, it was the principal, Chief Gideon.  And I guess T. Herman Graves, who was the coach of football, basketball, baseball; all the sports.
Speaker 1: Now did you play sports?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  I couldn't play sports, because when I was in high school a lot of the people who played sports were veterans who were coming back from World War II, and they would go to school because they could get the G.I. Bill.  So these were full-grown men usually.  And I was, you know, I was about 6'2" and I weighed about 135 pounds.  And, man, you get hit by some of those guys, man, it's like you're in another world.  'Cause we used to play--try to play at the Boy's Club.  The Boy's Club was down on Auburn Avenue between Bell Street and what was Fort Street.  And the Boy's Club was a room about the size of this room here in width and somewhat longer with, you know, of course with a basket on each end.
Speaker 1: A small--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's small.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a small--(unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And if you go up for a lay-up, you're going into the wall.  And when you get home, you're black and blue.  And it hurts.  And people throw the ball, they throw the ball a hundred miles an hour and hit your fingers, they all sore and everything (laughs).  No, it's not a way to enjoy the game, you know.  And, hey, I don't have any manhood to prove in here.  I mean, let me out of this.  I'll go write about this stuff.  Let you do it, you know.  No way.  And you don't want to get hit on the football field.  'Cause you get hit on the football field and you're light skinned, they'll come over and start talking to you. "Red nigger, get up."  You know.  "If it's your mama, she'd get up.  Get up, red nigger," you know.  So you got to get up then, you know.  I mean, but you're hurting all through your pelvis, you know.  Your gonads be hurting, you know, from getting hit.  I mean, no, I didn't like that part of any sports.  I liked watching them and watch other people getting hit, but when it comes hitting me, no.  I wished I'd known about Tiger Woods, you know.  I'd probably been down for golf.  Joe Louis used to come to Atlanta.  He played golf at the Lincoln Country Club, which was a privately-owned African-American club on the West Side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you ever meet him?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I met him once on Auburn Avenue at the bakery, New Moon Bakery; not the Blue Moon Bakery, it was New Moon Bakery; yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think he was pushing his drink then, the Joe Louis; had Joe Louis Orange Soda and there may have been a grape soda.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know they had Joe Louis Milk in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  They were still selling it a couple years ago.
Speaker 2: Oh, wow.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: Joe's still not getting the royalties (laughs).
Story_ID: 102787
Speaker 1: Now, were you a good student in school, high school [David T. Howard High School in Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: I was a good student from elementary school through the ninth grade.  When my aunt [Fannie White] died, everything just seemed to been different.  And there were just two things that occurred when I graduated from junior high school; that is at the end of ninth grade.  My aunt died and my best friend went away to Exeter [Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire].  My best friend was a fella named Nathaniel [Reid] LaMar (ph), who lived on Boulevard, next to [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  And his father was a physician.  His father died when Nat must have been about three years old.  And his mother and his aunts were school teachers, and they knew my aunt, Aunt Fannie.  And Nat went away, and it just seemed like the whole world was just vacant, you know.  Then my aunt's gone, my best friend's gone.  And, it was, you know, hard getting back to doing the things that I had always done, you know.  I used to study and write.  And sitting on the porch with my aunt and write, you know.  And that was difficult.  And there was nothing like grief counseling, you know.  You didn't have no grief counseling in 1945.  You're on your own, you know.  'Cause I know I stopped reading.  I used to read magazines and things all the time.  I stopped reading magazines and all, you know.  And I really didn't pick up until probably I started back to college again.  I started, you know, reading more and more when I got into college [Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia].  But high school was, I was just in high school.  You know, I could--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Were you a member of any clubs?  Now you wrote sports.  Right?  You wrote for the sports.
Speaker 2: Right.  I was the editor of the school paper.
Speaker 1: Editor of the school paper.  Okay.
Speaker 2: I may have been the member of some clubs, I don't know, you know.  We had interpreting--interpretative dancing.  I wasn't interested in that.  But it was interesting that we had it, you know, we had programs like that.  And I had a job when I was in high school.  I had a job and I kept the same job from the time I was either a sophomore or junior in high school, until I graduated from college.  I worked at a private Jewish club in Atlanta two nights a week, Tuesdays and Saturdays.  I worked in the game room, gambling room.  And I made very good money.  And during the summers, I ran the locker room, the tennis court and the patio.  And I made excellent money in the summers.  And so going to college hit me in terms of expense.  I didn't have to tap the money, any of the money that my aunt left.  I wrote my own checks for my tuition for all four years and my books, you know, from the money I earned.  And I kept the same job.  I didn't give the job up until I was drafted in the [U.S.] Army.  So I always had money, and money was never a problem, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  It was never a problem.  I never wondered whether or not I'd be able to afford to go to college.  I'd have to hustle or get a scholarship or something. I knew I was going,  I had the money.
Story_ID: 102788
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what year did you graduate from high school [David T. Howard High School in Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: I graduated in 1950.  June 1950.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you started out--started at Morehouse [College in Atlanta, Georgia] the same fall?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Fall of 1950.  Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Four years later [1954] I graduated.
Speaker 1: Now, so what was Morehouse like when you there?  Now, Benjamin [E.] Mays was the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He was the president.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was there.  Okay.
Speaker 2: It was an exciting, interesting place.  And being designed to expose us and develop us to become leaders in the community, and to think beyond the strictures of our immediate circumstances, and basically segregate-- race segregation, how that hemmed us in; and exposed us to the "Great Works," 'cause at that time--what was his name?  Larry Adler, Mortimer Adler, Larry Adler [sic, Mortimer Jerome Adler]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --at the University of Chicago [Illinois]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --was one of the proponents of exposing people to the "Great Works."  And that type of modality was very active at Morehouse; to expose us young men to the "Great Works," to expand our mind; and as my mom [Bessie Sims Moore] would say, to "pull the wool off our eyes."  And when I went to Morehouse, I had gone with the idea that I would become a journalist, because, what's his name that writes for the Ebony magazine?
Speaker 1: [HM] Lerone Bennett.
Speaker 2: Lerone Bennett and what's his name?  Evans?  The assistant editor at Ebony also went to Morehouse, and they graduated in 1948 with [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  So I knew about them, you know.  And I knew about the Atlanta Daily World.  I would work at the Atlanta Daily World.  So I really wanted to be a journalist.  And so I thought to be a journalist I needed to study English.  But when I thought about becoming an English major, I thought it was not a good idea for me, because Dr. [Gladstone Lewis] Chandler, who's a legendary head of the department at Morehouse, had certain citizenship requirements (laughs), you know, in the sense that you have to be neatly dressed, you have to do this and you have to do that; and you have to tithes or give to some organization or something.  And--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: You had to tithe to an organization to be--?
Speaker 2: Something.  He had some rules, you know.  And I just didn't think I could live up to those rules and, therefore, that I shouldn't go into the English department, 'cause in the English department, you're gonna be there for two and a half years to get a major in English.  So I didn't know what I was gonna major in at that point after I decided I wasn't gonna major in English.  So one day I was down at a beer joint called "The Draft Board," 'cause they sold draft beer.  We were in there drinking and having a good time.  At about one o'clock, everybody left to go up to class.  So I walked in the class, and there was this older fella there, real slick; and he was drinking beer, and I didn't know him at the time.  So I went on up to this class with a friend of mine that was in the basement of what is Sayles Hall at the time.  And the guy who was in the Draft Board that was real slick and a little older than I, he was the professor, Dr. Robert [Hughes] Brisbane.  And he started lecturing on--he was talking about political science; he was talking about the formation of the Congress and how the Congress operates and stuff, and I liked that.  And so I decided I'd major in political science, and I became a political science major and with a minor in economics.  And I took every course in economics offered at Morehouse and at Atlanta University [now Clark Atlanta University] when I was in college.  'Cause in the summer I went to--took summer school classes at Atlanta University and economics from a person by the name of Hugo Skala, and I think he spells his name, S-K-L-A-R [sic, S-K-A-L-A], who had been the finance minister of Czechoslovakia.  And I took classes from him.  They were really very stimulating classes.  And the reason I could do that is because I didn't have to be at work, at the club, until noontime, and I'd go and take the early morning classes.  And the other benefit of going to summer classes is that, the person I admired the most at Morehouse outside of Dr. Brisbane was Doctor--Dean Brazeal, Bradford Brazeal.  He was the Dean of Morehouse.  But I didn't want to take any classes from Dean because Dean was a very dry lecturer.  But he--his dissertation was on the sleeping car porters.  And every day he had a routine.  He would leave the administration building and walk over to his house over on Ashby Street, and if you catch him coming back and walk with him, he'd tell you all about the sleeping car porters and the research that he did, and how he did it; I mean, just be a fountain of knowledge.  I mean, you just learn so much from Dean Brazeal just walking and talking with him, you know.  And that was a great thing about summer school.  I could meet him and talk with him.  You know, I really enjoyed that.  But I never took the class from him (laughs).  All right.  And I enjoyed Morehouse.  I really had a good time at Morehouse.  I enjoyed every day of Morehouse.  I don't remember missing a day.
Story_ID: 102789
Speaker 1: Did you--do you have any stories about Benjamin [E.] Mays?  I know he would lecture to the students periodically.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The only bad experience I ever had at Morehouse [College in Atlanta, Georgia] was with Dr. Mays.  I discovered that I was entitled to get out-of-state aid.  You know, they have the separate but equal situation, and it has some fine points, and one of the fine points was that, if you were in a college or university and you took courses which were not offered at the black colleges, you know, Negro colleges, that the state was required to pay you for it, okay.  I found that out.  So I went and got the papers.  And in order to get the payment--it came to 'bout $50 a semester, you know, 'cause the school's tuition is $125, $150 a semester, something like that--the president of the college has to sign it.  So I made an appointment to see Dr. Mays and his secretary, you know, set up the appointment.  I went to see him bright and early one morning.  And I took my paper in, he looked at it, he signed it; then he got up and went to the door and stood in the door, my paper in his hand, you know.  He didn't say anything, you know.  I was expecting him to say something; and, you know, I was going, you know, say--well, you know, whatever he said to me, if he asked me how I was feeling or whatever, how was I doing, I'd say "I'm doing fine, so and so, and so and so and so," you know.  But I expected him to ask me something, but he didn't ask me anything, you know.  He went to the door and stood in the door with his paper in his hands; so what can I do?  I'm just sitting, now I got to get the paper and leave.  I think that was a very unpleasant experience for me, 'cause I expected him to ask me something, you know.  But he didn't ask me not a single question.
Speaker 1: And didn't say anything.
Speaker 2: Didn't say anything, you know.  I was only in his office for maybe less than ten minutes.  He didn't say a word.  And I was pissed off, to tell you the truth, 'cause I asked him, and I thought he was gonna ask me something and not make some perfunctory response, you know. And that was the worst experience I had in the four years I was at Morehouse, except for the day I graduated; that was tough.
Speaker 1: What happened that day?
Speaker 2: Well, we were graduating.  When we graduate, the custom was, is that, we would march from Sayles Hall down to John Hope's grave.  And that's probably about two or three hundred feet from the chapel, okay.  And when you get there, you're gonna sing--we sang "Dear Old Morehouse" for the last time.  But as I was walking down the walkway, I kept asking myself, "What do I know?"  And I got an answer.  "Nothing."  It just seemed incredulous to me that you'd spent four years in college, and you ask yourself the question, "What do I know?" the only answer you get is "Nothing."  But that was the right answer, because you don't know nothing.  You don't know anything after four years.  You're not supposed to know anything.  The whole purpose of education is to make you want to know.  But I didn't realize that at the time.  It was only years later that I realized that, you know.  I just felt kind of empty.
Speaker 1: So you felt like that those four years of all the good conversations and what you learned in class, it really hadn't added up much?
Speaker 2: Right.  I didn't know anything.  I knew I was going to law school.  But that wasn't the answer that I was looking for.  "What do you know?"  "Well, you don't know--I don't know anything.  Nothing."  It's just kept--it just over and over and over, nothing.  So we down and I took part in singing the hymn and that was it.  My mom [Bessie Sims Moore] and somebody else, and we went home and we had a big dinner.  And I was getting ready to go to law school, then I got drafted.  I was in the [U.S.] Army for two years--for almost two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is 1954?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 102790
Speaker 1: So you were drafted at about--was the--the Korean War was just winding up, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was in the--it was cessation of hostilities at that time, but they were still drafting.  As soon as they found out I was gonna go to law school, I got a quick notice.  And I had to--the Army, it extended my horizons somewhat, but just only a little bit.  I never got out of the South.  I had basic training at Fort Jackson, [Columbia] South Carolina.  Then I went to--they sent me to Fort Benning, Georgia, for the signal corps training.  And then I went from Fort Benning, Georgia, to Wolters Air Force Base [Texas], where we were assigned to a group called the Special Category of the Army with the Air Force [Special Category Army Reassigned with Air Force].  And Wolters Air Force Base is about forty-six miles west of Fort Worth [Texas].  And that was really a desolate place, especially for an African-American back in 1954 or '55 [1955] or whenever it is I landed out there, 'cause in the town, in the town of Mineral Wells [Texas], which was the nearest township, there was one street for African-Americans called Fifth Avenue, one whore house and one whore (laughs).  And that was it, you know.  So it wasn't much life in Fort Worth--in Mineral Wells, Texas, for a brother.  And from--after Wolters Air Force Base, then I really got a big jump.  They sent me to England Air Force Base in Alexandria, Louisiana.  And after we were there for about six months, the Secretary of Defense said that he didn't need my services anymore, and I was separated; got a Good Conduct Medal and something else.  I had a good job when I was in the Army, though.  My first sergeant, when we were in Mineral Wells--in Wolters Air Force Base, called me in one evening, he says, "PFC Moore" or "Private Moore"--I may have still been a Private at the time--"Tomorrow morning, I'm asking for volunteers.  You are volunteering.  You hear?"  "Yes, sir."  And so, the next morning we fell out and he called for volunteers, and I volunteered.  And I'm glad I did, 'cause he made me the Company Armorer, and I took care of the weapons, and that was cool, man.  That was so cool 'cause I had my own office that was separate and apart from everything else where the weapons were kept, and I worked completely by myself.  And I had a nice desk, and I could look out the window and see if anybody was coming.  And if someone was coming, if I was reading a book, I'd put the book in the desk drawer, you know.  I read--I must have read every book offered by the Book of the Month Club when I was out there.  And I didn't have to wear the--I could wear low quarters, and I didn't have to pull a KP [kitchen patrol], I didn't have to do guard duty.  So that was cool, man.  That was cool 'cause guard duty, man, who wants to be out walking guard duty at midnight, you know, especially in Texas; rattlesnakes and this and that.  But that was--I'm glad he asked me to fall out, and I fell out and I volunteered, and I kept that job until I was discharged, separated rather.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you came out, what, in '56 [1956]?
Speaker 2: In February of '56 [1956], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 102791
Speaker 1: So you went back to Atlanta [Georgia], I guess.  Right?
Speaker 2: I went back to Atlanta briefly.  And then a friend of mine, who had graduated from Morehouse [College in Atlanta, Georgia] at the same time, we went to Cleveland [Ohio] 'cause we had both been accepted in law school, and we decided we'd go up North and live for a while, so we went to Cleveland.  And I worked in Cleveland from February until about September of '56 [1956].  And then we took the bus and went over to Boston [Massachusetts].  And when we got over to Boston, we decided that we were going to lay out for a year before we started school, 'cause, you know, we come through sixteen years of education and military service, and so we did.  And I worked for a year, and then I started law school in September of '57 [1957].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you went to Boston College?
Speaker 2: Boston University.
Speaker 1: Boston University [School of Law in Boston, Massachusetts].  Okay.  That's where [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] got his Ph.D.  Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  At BU.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, is there a reason why you chose to go to Boston University?
Speaker 2: Well, there was one reason.  I wanted to go to a white professional school, because I felt that sixteen years of going to all-black schools, I needed to see how the other people did--what the other people did and how they worked.  And the other reason is that, Boston University--I only applied to one law school--recruited us in a way.  Demetrius Newton, who was a recent graduate from Birmingham [Alabama], came down and urged us to come to apply to Boston University.  A good friend of mine, two good friends of mine, Richard Warren and O.T. Wells--O.T. practices in New York--they had been admitted to Boston University.  And we had a graduate who was a very noted graduate of Boston University, a guy by the name of Charles Anderson, who I think had graduated in 1948 or so.  And we were led to understand that he'd had the highest average in the history of the school.  And when he came down to visit with us, he was working for the then-Governor [Paul] Dever of Massachusetts, working and codifying the Massachusetts Code; and he urged us to apply to Boston University.  And Boston University had had a history accepting African-American students.  So I applied and I was accepted.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, those are good reasons.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Story_ID: 102792
Speaker 1: All right.  So how did you like law school [Boston University School of Law in Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved it.  Yeah.  I loved law school.  It was fun except for the first year.  The first year is kind of disappointing, because you expect it to be exciting and dramatic, but it isn't.  And they keep talking about this fictitious person, this reasonable man, and you never meet that fella, you know.  But they talk about him all the time.  That was kind of dull and dry.  And then the second year, the second year is the toughest year in law school, especially at that time, because they taught--there was a class called Negotiable Instruments, which is basically the Uniform Commercial Code, which didn't exist in most states at the time, but was being discussed.  And there was another class called Sales.  And Sales, I thought, was the toughest course in law school, because in Sales, you have to learn to draw the distinctions between the various types of warranties, like the warranty of merchantability, warranty of fitness, and other warranties.  And the difference between those warranties is so fine that you really have to have, approach it in a very rigorous way, because whether it's one or the other, the consequences to the client, to the parties is quite different.  So when you study Sales, it really, it really sharpens your mind.  It's almost like taking--it's like polishing a shoe with a shine cloth.  It really whips up the mind, at least in my point of view.  And the third year was a cakewalk.
Story_ID: 103109
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So we're talking about the third year of law school [Boston University School of Law in Boston, Massachusetts] was a cakewalk.
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was a cakewalk.  Yeah.  I enjoyed the third year.  I had a good time in the third year.  I took Law and Behavioral Science, which was a--which had mixed discipline in it.  We had a psychiatrist, we had lawyers who were with the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, and we had a public health lawyer and professor, and we visited Walpole Prison [now Massachusetts Correctional Institution-Cedar Junction in Walpole, Massachusetts], and studied a lot of psychology.  It was a really very interesting class and it was kind of one-of-a-kind at that time in 1960, yeah.  It was--yeah, it was the second semester.  So that would be the second--I graduated in 1960 (unclear). F. Lee Bailey was one of the guys in my class.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a classmate of mine.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He was a veteran of the war.  (unclear) Marines or something?
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  Yeah, he was a Marine fighter pilot.
Story_ID: 103110
Speaker 1: So what did you do immediately after law school [Boston University School of Law in Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Well, the first thing I did is that I knew eventually what I was gonna do.  And I had known that since I started law school, even before, 'cause back in 1952, I met Donald L. Hollowell, who was-- who had set up a practice in Atlanta [Georgia] after graduating from Loyola Law School in Chicago [Loyola University Chicago School of Law in Chicago, Illinois].  And one day in the summer of 1952, I was getting a ride across town and this guy stopped me.  Well, he didn't stop me, I stopped him, and he gave me a ride.  He had this old car.  It was a Kaiser.  You ever seen or remember a Kaiser?
Speaker 1: Yes. Yes.  It is old.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was painted khaki-colored brown.  And so as we were driving from the West Side over to the East Side, he told me that he was a lawyer.  I said to myself, "This dude ain't no lawyer in this old raggedy car," you know (laughs).  And he said--you know, I told him I was--become interested in law.  He said to keep in contact with him and where his office was.  And he said to stay to contact with him.  So I knew that when I finished law school I could go back home and start practicing with him.  But we talked and he told me that I should try to get as much experience up North as I could, because I wouldn't be able to get experience, the same kind of experience, there.  So first I tried to get a job with the National Labor Relations Board, Region 1, but they weren't hiring Negroes at that time.  I was overqualified.  I'd just graduated from law school.  I don't know why I was overqualified.  And then some guys in Boston, [Louis] Lou Maples, among others, and he and O.D. Woodhouse [ph.] wanted me to see if I could get a job as a claims adjuster with an insurance company.  Again, I visited and interviewed by about half a dozen insurance companies, and it was the same story, that I was overly qualified.  But I needed a job, you know (laughs).  (unclear) whether I was overly qualified or not; but you make that decision, but they didn't.  So I sort figured that this city is not gonna really work out the way I want it to work out.
Story_ID: 103111
Speaker 1: So one day late in the fall, I believe in 1960--yeah, 1960, yeah, I was at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts [Museum of Fine Arts, Boston], and it was having an exhibit of [Amedeo] Modigliani.  And I had come upon this Modigliani drawing of himself, I think, with the left hand.  And I sat down.  I was sitting on the floor looking at this drawing.  And I said to myself, "How can anyone get that much into themselves, you know, in drawing."  I was just really fascinated by what I was looking at.  And a fella came over and tapped me on the shoulder by the name of James Harkness [ph.] or Hartless [ph.].  He also worked with Lou Maples out of Lou Maples' office, and he asked me what I was doing.  I told him, not much.  He said would I like to work for a judge.  And I said, "Sure."  He said, "Well, come down to my office on Monday and bring your resume.  So Monday I went down to his office, and I had what I thought was a resume, and I gave it to him.  He broke out laughing, says, "Howard, this is not a resume."  Back in those days, they didn't have resume-writing classes and things.  So he helped me and we put my resume together.  And he said he would take it to the Judge.  And in about a week later, he called me in, he says, "I took your resume to the Judge, but he's not here.  He's out of the country now.  He's in Africa and he'll contact you when he gets back."  And I said, "Oh, stuff.  That means the same old thing, you know, only this time I'm just not overqualified."  So one day in February about eleven o'clock, I got a phone call.  And as my mother [Bessie Sims Moore] would say, God was guiding me, 'cause I didn't answer the phone the way I usually answer it on that particular morning.  The voice on the other end of the line says, "May I speak to Mr. Howard Moore, Jr.?"  And I replied, "This is he speaking."  P.E. Johnson all over again, you know, from David T. Howard [High School in Atlanta, Georgia].  And he said, "This is Judge Charles E. Wyzanski, Jr."  And he told me his purpose in calling; he'd like for me to come down that afternoon and be interviewed.  And I told him I couldn't down that afternoon.  I wasn't sure I had my stuff together.  And then I said, "Could I come in on an afternoon that is convenient for you?"  He says, "Tomorrow at 4:30."  I said, "Yes, sir."  He said, "I'll see you tomorrow at 4:30."  I got up and went to the drycleaners and got my clothes ready.  I got on the T, the subway, went down to Tremont Street and walked down to the office, 'cause I want to time it and find out where it was.  I didn't want to be looking for it on the day I'm supposed to be there, you know.  So I knew exactly how much time I needed to get down there.  So the next day I went down, I got there exactly at 4:25, I walked through the door.  And the voice from inside, when he heard the door open, says--I think it was Ms. Cooper, whoever his secretary was--"Is that Mr. Moore?"  And she said, "Are you Mr. Moore?"  I said, "Yes, I am."  And she says, "This is Mr. Moore."  He says, "Just tell him to be seated.  I'll be with him shortly."  So about twenty minutes later I'm called into his office.  And when I get in there, this little short guy, almost as black as I am.  I mean, this guy is almost about five feet tall, you know, comes around the desk and greets me and makes me feel comfortable immediately.  And so we sit down and we start talking, and he told me he had recently been in Africa, one of his trips to Africa and all, with the Ford Foundation. And I was kind of up on African things, because [Patrice] Lumumba's death had just been announced in the West, and I was reading about Africa.  So we talked about Africa.  And finally he said to me, he says, "Mr. Moore, will you take this job?"  And I broke out laughing.  And I said, "Judge Wyzanski, I didn't come down here to see whether I'd take this job.  I came down here to see whether you would take me."  And he laughed.  He said, "I'll let you know," and the next day or so I got a letter telling me to start work.  And I worked for him until July of 1962.  And at one point, I decided that maybe I didn't want to go back down home, 'cause I really liked working in Boston, you know, working for the Judge. I moved to Beacon Hill [Boston, Massachusetts], and I had an apartment on Mount Vernon Street right at the corner of Charles and Mount Vernon over the pharmacy, 118 Mount Vernon.  And I enjoyed looking out the window from the chambers into the water flowing from the Charles River into the Boston Harbor, you know, and that was cool.

Speaker 1: But when I came down to take the Georgia Bar, I hadn't prepared.  But when I got in there and I saw those crackers, I said to myself, "I'm gonna pass this bar.  I don't care what happens, I'm passing.  I'm not letting any of these fellas here pass this bar and I not pass."  So I rolled up my sleeves and went to work.  And the hardest part about the Georgia Bar Exam was staying awake (laughs), 'cause it was a three-day exam; that was the hardest part about it.  So that December, Mr. [Donald L.] Hollowell calls me from Atlanta [Georgia] and tells me that he has good news for me, that I passed the Georgia Bar and to come home and come home immediately.  I couldn't go right immediately, but I did go in July, and I started working for Mr. Hollowell.  And when I first got there, Horace Ward, his partner, was on one side, and he was on the other side, and my office was in the middle. And I didn't have a window, and I had like an old wooden khaki desk with a straight-back chair.  And we didn't have any hours of work.  We only had one thing when I worked for Mr. Hollowell:  that was work.  We worked all the time.  It was never a downtime.  It was simply do seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day; that's all we did was just work.  And I worked like that probably until I came out here and after the [HM] Angela Davis case.  I mean, that's all we did is just work.
Speaker 2: Is that case after case?
Speaker 1: Case after case or event after event or something to do.  I'd be traveling with Vernon, [HM] Vernon [E.] Jordan [Jr.].  He was a field secretary for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and some Sundays we would go to various churches and places where he would make speeches and talk about what was happening in the Civil Rights Movement, because the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was only being talked about; it hadn't been even offered as legislation.  And that's--as I was saying, that's all we did was work.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you did a lot of traveling with Vernon Jordan?
Speaker 1: Yeah, on Sundays.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Every Sunday.  Almost every Sunday we traveled someplace.
Speaker 2: Were the, were the cases in Atlanta civil rights cases?
Speaker 1: Atlanta and all over Georgia, 'cause at that time in '61 [1961], there were only about ten African American lawyers in all of Georgia.  And only maybe four or five of them did--actually did trial work litigation.  The other lawyers were transactional peoples, who basically did title searches; like, for example, in Atlanta, the title searches for the Mutual Federal and the Citizens Trust Bank was done by this one lawyer--two lawyers; Mr. Henry worked for did the searches for Mutual-- Mutual Federal.  And I forget the guy who did them for the Citizens Trust Bank.  And that was pretty much the pattern throughout the state except for [Chevene Bowers King] C.B. King [Chevene Bowers King] down in Albany, Georgia; and Mayfield down in Savannah, Georgia.  So Hollowell covered the whole state.  I mean, he was a trial lawyer for the state of Georgia.  And one of the people in the office who was the most precious and the most giving and the most unsung and, unfortunately, her history was never captured, was Alice Lewis, who was the office secretary.  Ms. Lewis never missed a day and was never late and never complained and was always there if we needed her, worked any time of day or night.  And, actually, when I took over the office and then we became Moore, Alexander and Rindskopf, I didn't even know where the checkbooks were.  I never took in any money.  Any money that came in the office went to Ms. Lewis.  And I knew nothing about the actual administration or the managing of the office.  Ms. Lewis handled all that.  I had no idea where the checkbooks were; bills, how the bills got paid.  They were paid.  I know the lights were never turned off, the phones were never turned off, and our rent was always paid.
Speaker 2: So all you had to do was practice law, basically.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  Ms. Lewis did the whole thing, you know.
Story_ID: 103113
Speaker 1: And I never will forget my first criminal case.  Mr. [Donald L.] Hollowell came to me, and Mr. Hollowell says--always pronounces every word, speaks ever so slowly with the best diction, and he had a really smooth voice.  He says, "Howard"--I didn't have a car at the time; he says, "Carl"--Carl was like our office driver, a guy named Carl Simms--"Carl is going to take you down to Spalding County, Georgia, in Griffin [Georgia].  And when you get down there, go around the back and some people are gonna meet you and they'll have something for you.  You get what they have and go into the courtroom.  And there's a fella there by the name of Brown or something like that, and we're supposed to be representing him."  So I get into the car, I drive down to Spalding--to Griffin County, I go around the back and meet some people, and they give me a brown bag, it's got something in it, it's got some money in it, and I put it in my pocket, I go in the courtroom.  And the Judge said, "Is the lawyer from Atlanta here?"  So I supposed he was calling--referring to me.  I said, "Yes, sir."  He says, "What's your name?"  I told him my name.  He said, "Well, we just indicted your client, Herman Fletcher Brown.  We're ready to select the jury."  And I said, "Well, your Honor, I haven't had an opportunity to interview the client to conduct any investigation."  He said, "Well, you're a lawyer.  You ought to be prepared to try the case.  This is the time and place where we're trying this case.  Are you ready?"  And I said, "No, sir."  He said, "Well, bring in the jury."  So they brought the jury in and picked the jury.  And it turns out that what had happened is that our client, who was about 15 or 16 years of age at the time, had been picked up one morning by this young fella to go to--a white fella who was taking him to his father's farm, 'cause they were chopping (unclear), they were chopping cotton that day.  And so after they got out to the farm, he and Herman got into a fight.  And so they were fighting with the hoes, you know, you know what I'm talking about, the hoe that you use to chop cotton, not--you know.
Speaker 2: Not a Don Imus-- (laughs).
Speaker 1: Don Imus-type hoe. All right.  And so the hoe that Fletcher had slid down the handle of the hoe that the other guy had and cut him on his hand.  And they charged Fletcher Brown with felonious assault, which is a very serious crime and carried about ten years at the time.  And so I tried the case as best I could under those circumstances.  And at the conclusion, when the closing arguments were made, the Solicitor General argued that, "Some people say 'negro.'  Some people say 'nigger.'  But I say something in between, 'nigra,' N-I-G-R-A;" that's what he said.  He says, "Now you take this boy, Fletcher Brown, he's been up in Atlanta on (unclear). He's come back down here with rebellious ideas."  And then this pause for effect, you know.  And then he says, "Oh, how I wish I could sing and dance like they do.  I can't even carry tune in my capacity."  This is closing argument, so I objected to the argument.  It was overruled.  And the jury came back and convicted him, Fletcher, of misdemeanor assault, which carried eighteen months in jail and a $1,000 fine, and we appealed.  And I appealed to the Georgia Court of Appeals, and they decided the case after almost a year or a little longer on bond and reversed the conviction and sent the case back because of the improper argument of counsel, the prosecuting counsel.  They sent the case back down to Griffin for a trial.  So I called the prosecutor and asked him when was he going to retry Herman Fletcher Brown.  He told me, say, "I will let you know."  And from that phone call to this day, I have not heard from the prosecutor nor have I heard from Herman Fletcher Brown.  And that was my first criminal trial ever (laughs).
Story_ID: 103114
Speaker 1: And another occasion, [Donald L.] Hollowell--got a call, and says, "Howard, here is Volume 24 of the Georgia Code."  And in the Volume 24, a book, it has a big 24 on it, there were two subjects; coroners and contracts, and contracts came before coroners 'cause coroners starts--after "o" is "r."  He said, "Howard, now, you look at the sections here on the coroners and on your way down there, and you be ready, gonna be a coroner's inquest, that's it, and the decedent is A.C. Hall."  That's all the information I got.  We get down to Macon, Georgia, and I started to the courtroom and there were about 5,000 Negroes on the steps, about 3-- or 400 in the courtroom upstairs in what, in you know, in the Negro section of the courthouse.  I walked in the courtroom and they say, "That ain't Hollowell," you know (laughs).  So, I sit down and they're having a coroner's inquest.  I don't know what to do.  But I say, "Well, all these people here," I say to myself, "All these people here, I have to do something.  I'll just object."  So I objected to every question, every answer, I had some objection.  So somebody roared out "That ain't Hollowell, but it sound like Hollowell."  And the guy in charge say, "Ya'll be quiet up there.  I'm gonna put you all--all ya'll out, ya'll hear."  And so they were quiet.  So we got through that day.  And that Friday, Hollowell was able to go back down to--go down to Macon.  And the police officer that shot this young fella was on the stand.  Hollowell conducted one of the most beautiful cross-examinations I had ever seen in my life of this police officer.  He just slowly took that police officer detail by detail to the point he turned the police officer--had the police officer to turn A.C. Hall around so that Hall is facing him; unarmed, his hands to his side, clearly visible.  And the officer shot him.  And Hollowell said, "You shot him while he was looking you dead in the eye, unarmed."  And the officer started crying, you know.  And they even called (unclear)--and, you know, they called some other witnesses, and the coroner's jury came back with a justifiable homicide verdict nevertheless--you know.  Those were some rough days, man.  There were really rough days in the South, you know.  We were fighting.  There was a fight for everything, fighting just to be in the courtroom.
Story_ID: 103115
Speaker 1: I remember one time [Donald L.] Hollowell sent me down to some little county.  This advances forward somewhat to about 1964.  And my orders were to go down to the county and bring back this document that related to some kind of probate.  That's what my instructions were.  It was nothing in between.  So I got there, and I presented myself.  And the clerk, who was a woman, was just insisting that she couldn't file that paper.  So I would talk to her, I was polite, you know, 'cause my orders were to bring it back, you know; wasn't to make any points about segregation, about the respect, about the order or the relationships, but to bring that paper back.  That's what I construed my directions to be.  So I'm talking to her and all of a sudden a voice in the backroom calls out, he says, "Emma Lou"--her name was something like that--"Is that one of Hollowell's boys?"  And she says, "Well, he's from Hollowell's office."  And so she sent me back to see the clerk, who was just behind, you know, the desk area.  So I went and talked to him.  He said, "Where is that old Hollowell?  Where is that rascal?"  I said, "Well, you know (unclear)."  He says, "What is that old rascal Hollowell doing?"  He referred to Hollowell as a rascal (laughs).  I said, "Well, he running for judge of the Superior Court against Durwood T. Pye.  He said, "Shut up."  (Laughs.)  "Shut your mouth.  Hollowell running for judge?"  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "He'll make a good'en, but he not gonna be elected, you know that, don't you, you know?"  And he talked to me some more about Hollowell, you know, and he said, "Don't pay no attention to Emma Lou.  She just--oh, she get into them details and sometimes she's kinda lonely and look like sometimes she's married to the details.  Just don't pay her no attention.  Everything'll be all right."  And so he called out and said, "Emma Lou, whatever you got there, just take it and file it and give him the paper so he can go back, and tell ol' Hollowell I said hello."  And when she gave me the paper and she told me, she said, "Tell Mr. Hollowell we say hello," you know.  And she referred to Hollowell as "Mr. Hollowell," you know.  But I was really proud to be one of Mr. Hollowell's boys, you know, 'cause the people throughout the state respected Mr. Hollowell.  And the white people respected him because he respected everybody, but he didn't step back, you know.  He never scratched his head or tap danced or smiled, you know.  If you said something to him that was insensitive, he would bring it to your attention, you know, in a polite, intelligent way.  And when he was in the courtroom, they knew that he was the master of that forum.  And they had--his respect for you was just amazing.  And the people, you know, expressed it in different ways.  One time, Hollowell sent me down to this judge's place to get a--to get a Rule 9C, which is just an order to show cause.  I think that's the right (unclear).  And, anyway, I was speeding, 'cause I had to get to the judge's house before five o'clock, 'cause the judge said that his office hours at home were the same as it were when he was in his office in the courthouse.  And I was speeding and a police officer stopped me.  And so the police officer said, "Where you goin', boy?"  I said, "I'm gonna to see Judge Carpenter."  So I had this package in my hand that--and I had a label on it saying, "Law Offices of Donald L. Hollowell," you know.  He said, "You the messenger then from the law office?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  He said, "Follow me."  And he got in his car--a motorcycle--it might have been a motorcycle, turned on the siren and lights and took me directly to the judge's house and told me when I got there, say, "Now, you go on around the back, you hear," you know, "and the judge'll see you, you hear?  And when you come through here again, remember what the law is, 'cause I might not be around here.  It might be somebody else."  I said, "Thank you, sir."  So as I was going up to the judge's house, a lady, his wife came on the porch and says, "Are you from Don Hollowell's office?"  I said, "Yes, ma'am."  Said, "Come on.   The judge been waiting for you."  And she then went in the house and I sat down.  She asked me if I wanted some tea or coffee, and if I want a Coke.  Now, in Georgia, you can refuse tea and coffee, but you don't refuse Coke.  I said, "Yes, ma'am.  I think I'll have some Coke."  And the judge signed, he said, "Tell ol' Hollowell come see me again and try to stay out of trouble.  See, he always got these last minute issues.  Tell him to get here a little sooner sometimes, you know.  I may not be here, you know."  I said, "Thank you, sir."  And that was it.  But as I was saying, Mr. Hollowell was so well respected, you know.  And it was really a great learning experience to work for him.  But all we did was work.  I think that's one of the reasons why he probably--you know, he died a couple of years ago at eighty-seven.  He had lost his sight, 'cause he had untreated glaucoma.  And that was very unfortunate.
Speaker 2: That is.  Well, thank you.  That's a piece of history that I think that's going to be valuable down the line.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 103116
Speaker 1: Now, you were involved in--well, during the days that you were there, the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] headquarters was in Atlanta--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: In Atlanta [Georgia], yes.  Right.
Speaker 1: The SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] headquarters then developed after '61' [1961].
Speaker 2: Right.  It was direct--it was only a couple of blocks from our law offices [Hollowell and Ward].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were on Raymond Street, we were down at 859 1/2 Hunter Street, which is now Martin Luther King [Jr.] Drive.
Speaker 1: Right.  And I take it that the offices of [Donald L.] Hollowell and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Ward [Horace T. Ward].
Speaker 1: --Ward were associated with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or so.
Speaker 2: Well, we had a working cooperative relationship with the legal defense, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we, of course, did work for the NAACP for Mrs. [Ruby] Hurley, who was the, I think, field secretary or the regional secretary for the NAACP at the time.  She was one or the other.  And whenever, of course, they ask us to do anything, we always did something.  But we had a working relationship with the Legal Defense Fund in New York [New York City, New York].
Story_ID: 102396
Speaker 1: Now, who were some of the--I know in the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] office, was it Wyatt Walker and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, [HM] Wyatt [Tee] Walker and [HM Andrew] Andy Young.  Reverend Bernard Lee, I believe; Hosea Williams and Reverend [Ralph] Abernathy; and Dora McDonald, who was [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]'s secretary; and a couple of other women that I remember very well.
Speaker 1: Okay. Then I think Ella Baker had started in that office.  And then when SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] formed, she was a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: She went with SNCC.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That was her and [Robert] Bob Moses and --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Bob Moses, James Foreman, [HM] Julian Bond, [HM] John Louis, Ivanhoe Donaldson, Faye Bellamy [Powell], [HM] Judy Richardson.  Boy.  Some of the names escape me.  Freddie Greene [Biddle].  Lots and lots of people.  Yeah.  There's Stanley Leroy Wise.
Speaker 1: Okay. Those--
Speaker 2: There's Cleveland Sellers.
Speaker 1: Right.  They were like challenging some of the Civil Rights rules in Atlanta [Georgia].  Right?
Speaker 2: But they were challenging them throughout the South to the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, SNCC.  And they had a number of actions in the city--within the city of Atlanta trying to desegregate the facilities.  Because at that time, Atlanta was pushing the slogan "To Busy to Hate."  And they had made some voluntary desegregation in places like the Merchandise Mart and some other places; Rich's Department Store; and the five and dime stores Kresge and Woolworths; they had all desegregated.  Maybe a couple of other places.  But by in large, the city was still segregated.
Speaker 1: Now--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Places like Krispy Kreme, the Leb's [Restaurant], the Pickrick, Lester Maddox's Place, the Varsity; they were still segregated.
Speaker 1: By mean "integrated," say, if you went to Kresge, then after they supposedly integrated, could you sit at the lunch counter?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You could sit at the lunch counter.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the same thing at Rich's at the Magnolia Room, you know.
Speaker 1: But did they employ black people as salespeople and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I don't recall any black salespeople, okay, at that time.
Speaker 1: Maybe that was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That may have been.  I wouldn't rule it out, but I don't recall any.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  During the same period of time, that was the issue, I think, in Ohio and other places in the North.  You couldn't be a salesperson in a department.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: You could go in there and sit down or buy, but you couldn't--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.  Couldn't--yeah.  And see, in the South, there's some places where you couldn't even go in and buy.  Yeah, you could go in and buy, but you couldn't try on; like, for example, you couldn't--some places you couldn't buy shoes and try them on or even buy suits and try them on.  You had to buy them and take your chances.
Speaker 1: What's interesting, you know, is a--you know, when I was a kid, I thought all that was just down South, but we were just like ten years away from that in Ohio (laughs).
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: You couldn't try on clothes there ten years before.
Story_ID: 102397
Speaker 1: Right.  Well, that's what people don't realize.  They don't realize that discrimination was nationwide, and it was more intense and concentrated in the South.  But in every part of the country it was the same, because slavery, to many respects, was nationwide, except perhaps in the Northwest Territories, which escaped any formal slave system.  But in the rest of the country that was one of the issues, whether or not slavery was going to be national, and that's exactly what the Dred Scott decision [Dred Scott v. Sandford] did.  It made it possible for slavery to be nationwide, which was, in effect, overruling the Northwest Ordinance, which set aside what now is Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and parts of Minnesota and Michigan, to be free.  And the territory south of that could possibly be slavery.  And that's why Missouri was slavery--was a slave--came in as a slave state.  And then you had the Nebraska, Kansas Ordinance [Kansas-Nebraska Act] compromise, where they agreed that whether or not you could--whether a state was slave or free would be a matter to be voted on by the electorate.  And that had the potential of extending slavery to every state for sure, because if the--if it was put to popular vote, you can very well vote for slavery, 'cause that was one of the way of quick development, to use slave labor.  And an interesting thing, when they began to bring in the Chinese, this was precisely at the end of the Civil War when there's free black labor, and you don't want to deal with this free black labor, you want to deal with another source of cheap labor.  So then they allowed the Chinese to come here on a limited basis.  The men could come and not bring their women.  And I don't know exactly what we have now.  We pretty much have--in some ways, we have the same problem now, that they refuse to educate free blacks.  They will not provide quality education for free blacks in this country, and that's virtually nationwide.  And they won't use free black labor, because apparently they don't want to pay free black labor what is due.  And, you know, they're encouraging the laborers to come and work at cheaper rates from South America.  And in some ways, encouraging Mexicans to come back and reclaim old Mexico, 'cause we live in old Mexico.  California is a part of Mexico.  See, you have vestiges today, even today of what happened in the past.
Story_ID: 102398
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  Okay.  Now, I was--I have, like in--on an outline, I have that you were able to, I guess, by about around 1970 or so, you were able to--in the case where [HM] Tyrone Brooks and some other Civil Rights activists in Georgia were imprisoned without trial, you were able to move their cases to the federal courts or you--now, how did that work? Tell me what happened--(unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell you about it.  This was in 1964.
Speaker 1: Oh, '64 [1964].  Okay.
Speaker 2: Let's see.  It's '64 [1964]--it was in '64 [1964] or early '65 [1965].  I forget the precise year.  But it was pretty much after we had--just before and right after we sort of won the hamburger war.  That's what I refer to the sit-in movement, "the hamburger war."
Speaker 1: (Laughs.)
Speaker 2: And--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Why do you call it that?
Speaker 2: Because most of the cases I dealt with involved a hamburger stand in some way.  And they had arrested about sixty or more SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] workers at a place in Atlanta [Georgia] called Leb's [Restaurant], and I also--I think also at Krispy Kreme, a donut place.  And I had discovered when I worked for Judge Wyzanski [Charles E. Wyzanski, Jr.], this statute that had been enacted in 1866 as part of the 1866 Civil Rights Act, which allows a person, who cannot enforce or is denied his equal rights or her equal rights in any state, to remove that case to a federal court.  So I decided that I would try to use it.  And I drafted this petition and filed it.  When you file a petition, it's automatically moved from the State Court to the Federal Court, and the State Court can proceed no further until the case is remanded.  So in this case that I filed, the first named plaintiff was a guy named Thomas Rachel, who was a student, I believe, at Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia], who had been a participant in the sit-in.  And we filed the case and the case was remanded.  But we decided that we wouldn't appeal, and there was a question about whether or not it was even appealable at that time.  But after [Donald L.] Hollowell and I completed about a two-months', two-and-a-half-months' misdemeanor trial for a young white woman who had come down from the North to work with SNCC by the name of Mardon Walker, we got word that the prosecutor was gonna try some more of the people, and that the people that they were gonna try were "red diaper babies;" meaning that they had been--that they were children of people who had been in the Communist Party.  And we didn't want information to come out in the press that some of the people who were taking part in the Civil Rights demonstration were children of communists, because they would use the fact of communism against the Movement.  And if anything could turn American people against the Civil Rights Movement, it would be some type of affiliation, identification with the Communist Party.  So we decided we would appeal.  And I filed a notice of appeal.  But technically, the notice appeared to be too late.  And--but anyway we appealed the case, and the case was decided in the Fifth Circuit of Appeals.  And Judge [Elbert] Tuttle, who was the principal judge on the case, did independent research and he discovered that the rules, which limited the right to appeal to ten days, had never been approved by the Congress. So the Rule really didn't exist.  So the Fifth Circuit entertained our appeal and held that the case could be removed to the Federal Court.  Then the State of Georgia applied for a writ of certiorari, a petition to review the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.  And the petition was granted.  And at that point, the legal defense, we got the [NAACP] Legal Defense and Education Fund to come in and take over the case.  And Tony-Anthony [G.] Amsterdam, who is a volunteer lawyer with the Legal Defense Fund and had clerked with [Supreme Court] Justice Felix Frankfurter, took over and became the principle lawyer in the case.  He was a professor at the time at the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and had been at one time Assistant U.S. Attorney, I believe, in--for a year or so, in the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.].  And he was our advocate in the Supreme Court.

Speaker 1: In the meantime, we had another case that arose in Greenwood, Mississippi; Peacock against the City of Greenwood [City of Greenwood v. Peacock].  And it involved demonstrators, and I think [HM] Tyrone Brooks and other people were a part of the demonstration, certainly (unclear) Peacock was.  And we lost that case in the District Court, and we appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.  And on that panel, Judge Griffin Bell, who then later became Attorney General of the United States, was the principal judge; and I forget who the other judges were on the panel.  But--and they ruled that the removal petition was valid, and that we could remove cases involving demonstrations on a public street in First Amendment-type cases.  In the meantime, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had become law.  So when we get to the Supreme Court, the issue becomes whether or not the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is retroactively applied, and they had already decided that it was retroactively applied.  And they went ahead and decided that the removal was proper in the Rachel case [Georgia v. Rachel], because the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Title II, had substituted a right for what had previously been deemed a wrong; that is, the refusal to leave a lunch counter after being asked, which then becomes a trespass.  And so we won Rachel, but we lost Peacock.  And by the time we got to the Supreme Court, we weren't interested in Rachel anymore, we were interested in Peacock, because Peacock would protect us from--give us a right to come into federal court in almost any situation where there's demonstrations in the street, and things like that, where rounded up by local police and herded off to jail and then whatever.  But the Supreme Court thought that that was too--an expansive use of federal power and would basically usurp local police power; that is, to control unruly crowds and things of that sort.  And so we lost Peacock.  But we won Rachel.  So we were happy for what we got.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in '64 [1964], now, is that evidenced by some papyrus on the wall?  You went to Egypt--(unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I went to Egypt and I--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Sixty-four [1964], yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, first I went to Egypt in '67 [1967], which was a stopover.  It was right after the 1967 war [Six-Day War].  It was very gloomy in Cairo.  And in 2004, I went to Egypt.  That's when I got these papyruses here.
Speaker 1: Oh.  All right.  So '67 [1967], okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I thought it was '65 [1965].  I got the dates mixed up.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Story_ID: 102401
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, well, any of the other--that's the moving of those cases [City of Greenwood v. Peacock and Georgia v. Rachel] from the Georgia courts to the Federal Courts--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that's the most dramatic thing that happened?
Speaker 2: That was a very dramatic thing.  And then, of course, the next case, and for me, personally, that was dramatic, was my brother-in-law's case, [HM] Julian Bond, when he was excluded from the Georgia Legislature.  I mean that was sensational at the time.  But--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now, was he your brother-in-law then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was.  Jane [HM Jane Bond Moore] and I have been married since 1963.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, how did you meet, you know?
Speaker 2: How did I meet what?
Speaker 1: Your wife.
Speaker 2: Oh.  That's a long story.  But I'll try to shorten it.  She was walking down the street one day with [HM Andrew Young] Andy Young's wife [Jean Childs], and I didn't know it was Andy Young's wife, but I was actually looking at Andy Young's wife and she turned around, and Jane turned around and looked at me and I waved.  And the next time she saw me I was in court, and I introduced her as a lawyer.  And then, as she tells the story, that the girl, the woman I was interested in wasn't interested in me and recruited Jane to go along with us on a date.  And so, anyway, we met at this club and we all left, The Carousel [La Carousel] in Atlanta [Georgia].  It may still be there.  It's where Paschal's [Paschal's Restaurant] is.  And so the first drop-off--I wasn't driving--the first drop-off was the girl that-- June--and so she lived with her parents.  So I got out of the car and went to the door with her and kissed her on the jaw and got back in the car, and the guy drove us out to Jane's apartment.  She lived further out of town on (unclear) Street.  And Jane and I, we got out of the car and we went home together.  We've been together ever since.  And that's been it, you know.  And we got married about two or three months later, July 7, 1963.  Never will forget that day when she promised to obey me (laughs).
Speaker 1: (Laughs.)
Story_ID: 102402
Speaker 1: But, Julian's [HM Julian Bond's] case was exciting.  And it was the first time I had got a chance to argue in the [U.S.] Supreme Court.  And one of the real things I remember about the case [Bond v. Floyd] is that, initially we were scheduled to argue the day before we actually argue the case.  And just before our case was to be argued, there was a case that was argued--I think the name of it was Acme Products-- Acme Products against the United States [sic, United States v. Acme Process Equipment Co.].
Speaker 2: Now, let me just, maybe, just set the stage, but some people are not going to know what this case is.  But Julian Bond was elected to the Georgia State Legislature, but wasn't--they wouldn't allow him to take his seat.  Right?
Speaker 1: Yes.  I'll explain that in a second.  All right.
Speaker 2: All right.  Okay.  Right.
Speaker 1: And so this case that was argued, that was on the calendar, was actually argued before the Bond case.
Speaker 2: That's Acme versus--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: The Acme Products against the United States.  And a woman argued for Acme Products, and that woman was brilliant, man.  But Thurgood Marshall, then-Solicitor General of the United States, argued for the United States.  Thurgood argued for five minutes.  And the Court said, "Mr. Solicitor, we think we have your point of view.  Would you cede your time?"  And he did.  He called that lady back and they undressed her.  And at the end of the argument, the Court recessed for the day.  And Thurgood came over to me and said, "Young man, you're up tomorrow.  I wish you a lot of luck."  And I had gone to law school because of Thurgood.  I heard Thurgood Marshall speak in Atlanta [Georgia] in 1952, I decided I wanted to go to law school.  I went home that night and I told my mother [Bessie Sims Moore], I say, "Mom, I want to be a lawyer."  And she said, "Well, Howard, what does it take to be a lawyer?"  I said, I don't know."  She said, "Well, why don't you go and ask Dean [Bradford] Brazeal what it takes?"  So the next day, I went over and went in to see Dean Brazeal.  I told Dean Brazeal that I wanted to become a lawyer.  And Dean, he's a man about my complexion, a little bigger, and maybe was a little taller with a big, thick mustache, and a kind of heavy voice, slower talker.  And Dean looked me dead in the eye, he said, "Mr. Moore, you got to pull up on your record."  And, boy, that was just like putting salt in an old wound, you know.  And I thanked him, so on and so and so and so, and I reported back to my mom.  And years afterwards I thought about what Dean told me.  You know, he had a lot of options in what he could have told me.  He could have said, "Well, you know, Mr. Moore, it's difficult as a Negro to get into law school, and then when you get out, it's difficult to make a living as a Negro lawyer," and all those things.  But what he told me was absolutely correct, because that's the only thing I had control over, is pulling up on my record, displaying myself in my remaining semesters at Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] as a person deserving of being in law school, and deserving perhaps of one day becoming a lawyer.  And that was, you know, what got me into law school was Thurgood Marshall.  And it's kind of serendipity--that may not be the right word--that on the date when I make my first argument before the U.S. Supreme Court, that the person who stimulated me to become a lawyer and had risen so high himself, having been a circuit court judge, and now Solicitor General, and targeted to go on to the United States Supreme Court, would come over and wish me well.
Story_ID: 102403
Speaker 1: And the next morning, our case [Bond v. Floyd] was called.  And basically what the case was about, is that [HM] Julian [Bond] was at home and an enterprising reporter called him at home, because the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC], at about the end of December or the first of January of 1966, issued a statement condemning America's participation in the conduct of the Vietnam War, and saying it was hypocritical for the United States to be advocating that it was seeking to bring democracy to Vietnam when it didn't respect that same democracy for Negroes in the United States.  And the reporter asked Julian did he agree with the SNCC statement.  Mind you, Julian's at home.  He's not out on the corner.  He's not making a speech or anything.  He said, yes, he did.  Then the conversation went further and they began talking about draft cards.  And I believe Julian said he could understand why someone would burn their draft card, but he wouldn't burn his.  And word got out that Julian had endorsed the statement.  And he was scheduled to be sworn in as a member of the [Georgia] House of Representatives in a couple days or a couple days afterwards.  And the people in Georgia became outraged that a Representative would endorse such an un-American, unpatriotic statement.  And so they then decided they would challenge Julian's fitness to sit in the House of--Georgia House of Representatives.  And when the day came, they voted against him.  I think there were only about ten votes for Julian.  And he was excluded from the Georgia House of Representatives and never allowed to take his seat.  And the case had eventually went through the Supreme Court through the District Court.  And on direct appeal, and direct appeal means that you bypass the district--the Court of Appeals, was in the Supreme Court; and that was the case that I was arguing.  In the District Court, we had won the jurisdictional question, at that time was questionable whether or not a federal district court could exercise jurisdiction over a matter that touched upon the right of a state legislature to determine the fitness of its members.  And we won that argument by three to one, and we lost the First Amendment argument as to whether or not Julian had a right to make that statement and be protected by the First Amendment by two to one.  And in the Supreme Court, that decision was reversed by 9-0 decision, saying that a legislature of all persons would have a right to speak out and to express himself on such an important question.  And that was a pivotal decision in the antiwar movement at that time, 'cause had we lost that dec-- case, it probably would have put a chill on the willingness of people to speak out against the Vietnam War.  And one of the significant things about it, it is the first time ever that a Civil Rights organization, such as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, had taken a position on an issue of national importance affecting the conduct of foreign affairs.  And so after that case, everybody started speaking out.
Story_ID: 102404
Speaker 1: And the next case of significance involved the Atlanta [Georgia] riot of September of 1966 in Summerhill, Atlanta, when an African American was shot by the police, and Stokely Carmichael and others from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC] went out to Summerhill to speak to people.  And Stokely was arrested and charged with disturbing the peace and with insurrection.  Now insurrection was a capital crime.  The insurrection statute had previously been declared unconstitutional in the Angelo Herndon case [Herndon v. Lowry].  But the State of Georgia apparently had ignored it and charged Stokely with insurrection.  And the response in the black community to Stokely's arrest was something I had never seen before in my life.  When I walked down the street, people came out of the stores to speak to me and to wish me well and to let me know that they supported Stokely.  And when I went to court in the first hearing that we had, I was equally surprised to see my mother [Bessie Sims Moore] and her posse there, because she had never seen me in court before.  And that was just overwhelming to see my mom there.  And people came down from New York [New York City, New York], lawyers; and from Detroit [Michigan] from the National Lawyers Guild, and they helped us out.  They went out and conducted--got affidavits and statements from every person they could find who knew anything about the incident and events, and returned all that information in to the Court, and the Court declared the Atlanta Disorderly Conduct Ordinance unconstitutional, which was the first time in the history of the United States that a local disorderly conduct statute had been the--the ordinance had been declared unconstitutional on vagueness grounds, and on the grounds of overbreadth--overbreadth meaning that it could be applied to people who were exercising their First Amendment right of speech.   And that case was known as Carmichael against Allen, and [Ivan] Allen was somewhat known as a progressive mayor of the City of Atlanta.  And we used Carmichael v. Allen elsewhere; in Prattville, Alabama, for one; in another case involving Stokely Carmichael, and throughout the South to get injunctions against the enforcement of overbroad statutes against the exercise of free speech.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's--okay.  So that takes us to 1967 or so?
Speaker 1: About '67 [1967].  Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 102405
Speaker 1: Yeah. You were explaining the difference between black--what Black Power really means--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --as opposed to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --just being an alternative to nonviolence --(unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, the thing is, is that Black Power is not an alternative to nonviolence, 'cause Black Power can incorporate nonviolence.  And Black Power is very, is disassociated from nonviolence.  Black Power is simply recognizing that within the individual African American, the individual Negro, the individual black person, there is something of worth, something of value.  And when you project that to a whole community that there's something of value in that community, and that we as an African people had a history, and our history was a rich history; a history of contribution that the world literally is built upon the back of Africa; that every--almost everything significant in the world that we think about or do is from Africa.  And as African Americans, we don't know much about our history in Africa and about Africans.  We don't understand the power that we have and that Africa has.  Now, today when you look-- think about--whenever Africa is depicted in the media, whatever, you usually see something about starving children or warfare or things that seem to be inexplicably dumb and cruel or you see a hut or something or an animal running through the forest or the woods or the jungles or whatever they want to call it.  You never see a building or anything.  But when you stop and think of what all Africa has been through: the slave trade; wars both within and outside of Africa, people warring in Africa, disease, poverty, intrigue, imperialism, colonialism.  But there are a billion Africans in Africa today.  So how do a billion people survive these kinds of devastating, historical events that just not started yesterday, but go back hundreds of years as such, unless they are people of inventiveness in terms of organizing human beings for survival.  And I think sometimes if we look at Africa that way, we could see Africa differently.  And when you think that in the world today, they'll probably find a hundred million or more Africans or descendants of Africans who live outside of Africa, overseas Africans.  So there're basically on the planet today there are more Africans and Chinese than there are any other people.  And then when you look at modern, modern technology and science, they cannot exist without the basics from Africa, the materials from Africa as such.  So the world as we know it would not exist without Africa.  What we consider to be Democratic norms, what we consider to be philosophical methods and techniques, are all derivative from Africa.  There're even scholars who say even all our religions have derived from Africa; all our monotheistic religions, because Africans were advanced in contemplating the source of life and the causes of life.  And from that emerged these monotheistic religions.  There have been scholars who say that the Bible itself, the source of the Bible as we know it, is derived from the Egyptian mysteries from Africa.  So, and all knowledge in a way starts with Africa.  So when we talk about--you hear people say today that when you study and you try to learn, that you're acting white.  You're not acting white, you're acting African.  Because the Africans put together the ideas and concepts that were borrowed and taken and advanced, I supposed, from people from Europe in some way.  And the people from Europe then disclaimed that any of it was derived from Africa.  So you have that.  So as Africans and descendants of Africans, we should be proud of ourselves, but we need to know more about ourselves.  And if we did know more about ourselves, some of us wouldn't act the way that some of us act.
Story_ID: 102406
Speaker 1: Okay.  But Black Power as such is a, I guess, a natural extension of gains in the Civil Rights Movement.  If you have the right to do things, you're gonna want to exercise some power.  Right?  Or-- and control over your right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But Black Power, in the sense that now that you are not under the shackles of segregation, that you can then say, "I'm worth something."  And if we're going to have an integrated society, that it can't be on the basis of destroying everything that identifies me as an African or as a black person, because that is genocide.  Because when you destroy the history, the memory of a people and deprive them completely of their religions, their customs and traditions, then you destroy them as a people, and they become a new people, and you can control them, because they're new to the new--to the arrangement as such.  And look what Black Power did.  It stimulated other groups to assess themselves and what they contribute to this mix that's the United States or that's the world, the global world today.  Look at women, women who have been struggling for centuries, how they rose up once the Black Power Movement emerged.  The gay people.  The Stonewall [riots] didn't occur until 1969 after the Civil Rights Movement.  So, all these people are saying that we are people of worth, and that we have to be respected as we are.  We will participate in this melting pot, but we will not lose our identity.  And the gay people say that "We will not hide our orientation any longer.  We declare ourselves gay," you know.  That's an aspect--that's something that may not have occurred at the time it occurred, had it not been for the Black Power Movement that says emphasize the things of value in your group, and that you have a right to be respected for who you are.  And that had never fully existed in this country.  And this country is--basically, there are writers who say that the United States is a slave nation.  There's a book that's been written by that name ["Slave Nation"] by Alfred Blumrosen and his wife Ruth Blumrosen, in which they relate a thesis that the colonists rebelled from England because they feared that if they remained under British rule, that the British would do what they did--eventually do in 1807, outlaw slavery.  And without slavery, the economy of the new world of North America would collapse.  And so they seceded from the British by declaring themselves independent and fighting the War of Independence [American Revolutionary War].  And then they traced through there where that was not just a--that is, the Blumrosens in the "Slave Nation," well, that wasn't just the first secession, but there had been subsequent secessions, like the Civil War being an attempt to secede, because the Northern states, if they get the power, may declare, outlaw slavery.  And the Southern states feel they couldn't exist at all without it as such.  And I think we're probably having a third (laughs) secession at the present time.
Story_ID: 102407
Speaker 1: What would have happened to African American people if Black Power had not come on the scene in 1967 and '68 [1968], and we've gone over into this integrated world where all of our institutions and values were being destroyed as the price of integration.  Where would we be had it not been for Black Power?  Would that be, for example, something that, I guess, is satisfying; naming buildings after black people or naming streets after them, for want of better examples to illustrate my point.  Where would we be?  Would we be a dead people by now if we had just gone into an integrated world and left all the values of blackness behind or feeling that we had no self-worth as a group value to contribute to this new, integrated world?  In the last forty years, we will be virtually wiped out instead of growing stronger, as we have been growing stronger each, each year.
Speaker 2: Now, what are your reflections on Stokely Carmichael, Kwame Toure, as he was when he passed?
Speaker 1: Well, he was a deep thinker, a brilliant orator, and was committed to the advancement of black people, and to the advancement of what some people in the earlier period called negritude.  And he lived that life.  He lived the life of a conscious African or conscious person of negritude and that of being a person of color or blackness was a thing of value.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Did you keep in touch with him over the years or did he keep in touch with you.
Speaker 1: Sometimes.  Not as much, 'cause he was out of the country a lot.   And I think he called me about--when he was out here about a year or so before he passed.
Story_ID: 102408
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you said earlier, earlier I guess, you kept up with what was going on in the Congo with Patrice Lumumba--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Right.
Speaker 1: --when the U.S. killed Lumumba over there [in 1961].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So have you made an attempt to keep up with foreign affairs in Africa and what was going on with African people?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  You have to.  I've been--visited Africa five or six times, and I try to keep up with what's going on in Africa.  I was--my last trip was last year [2006], I was in Sierra Leone.  And I went over to observe the arraignment of Charles Taylor before the Special Court [for Sierra Leone, SCSL] in Freetown [Sierra Leone].  And I don't know whether the allegations against Taylor are true or not, but he's certainly been painted as a monster in the West.  But as Africans, we should closely watch this case, because what I think that the Taylor case will do if successful, and it's likely to be successful if it continues on its present course, to introduce into Africa a new legal paradigm that will not benefit Africans, but will benefit Westerners.  And that paradigm would be one where a legal mechanism, namely, the prosecution for war crimes and crimes of genocide, can use or be against any African leader that the West decides contributes to an environment of impunity.  And by impunity, apparently what that means, in fact, is disagreeing with the dictates of the West, and refusing to accommodate the interest and needs of the West.  No African leader could exercise his or her discretion in a prudent and reasonable manner to promote the interest of their country against the wishes of the West in the face of the present prosecution--pending prosecution of Charles Taylor, because Taylor is not charged with committing any crimes in Liberia, where he was president.  Rather, he is charged with committing crimes in Sierra Leone.  And specifically, the best they would ever be able to prove against Taylor is that Taylor probably contributed in some way material support to the Revolutionary United Front, that from all apparent purposes, and certainly from my visit there, the RU-- and the RUF and another group did wreck havoc in Sierra Leone.  And (unclear) to--you know, you see that people had to meet you at the airport who have missing limbs.  You see all the public buildings in Freetown have virtually been destroyed, and you still see the bullet marks and things on the public buildings and things.  Certainly, the war is very devastating; the fourteen years of war was very devastating to Sierra Leone.
Story_ID: 102409
Speaker 1: But the prosecution of [Charles] Taylor seems to be a complete aside.  And, in my view, I don't see how it's gonna contribute at all to the development of Sierra Leone. 'Cause when you're there, you don't see any evidence of any program to develop the country at all.  And what you do see, you see a people that are quite a beautiful people with a lot of energy and a high degree of intelligence.  The energy level in Sierra Leone, is fitful.  And people wanna do something, but there's not much for them to do.  We went-- one day we went to the, I believe it was a public library, and it was very hot that day, and the power grid in Sierra Leone is such that, when we were there in 2005 [sic, 2006], it wouldn't even support ATMs and Visa cards.  You couldn't use them, you know.  And so these kids, they were up on the third floor and there's no ventilation, no light; and you got about 10 or 20 kids to a table sitting around doing their homework in those conditions, that they're so eager to learn; they want to learn, they want to school themselves.  And you see people coming out of places that certainly don't even approximate the projects that we--remaining projects that we have in the United States dressed in their school clothes and going to school every day, every morning trying to learn.  And it's just a frenetic amount of activity.  But there's no plan of development.  And that's likely to continue because our oil reserves have now been discovered, and that whole region, starting with Mauritania all the way down, I believe, to Guinea.  And so, in addition to a mineral wealth there's oil wealth.  There's gonna be a fight in the West to control it.  But any thoughtful person should take a very close look at the prosecution of Charles Taylor.  And, unfortunately, his case has been removed on a change of venue from Freetown to The Hague [International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands], where the conditions of confinement are much more restrictive than the conditions of his confinement were in Freetown [Sierra Leone].  And in The Hague, it's more likely than not he will not be able to get a fair trial, 'cause you have the problem of transporting witnesses, finding and transporting witnesses that distance and maintaining them for a period of time until they can give their testimony, which will be very problematic for him, even though Taylor declared at his arraignment that he wanted to be tried in Freetown.  And I don't know why the motion to oppose the change of venue wasn't, wasn't made.  And he's--and this is a Special Court under special laws which didn't exist, by and large, at the time the crimes were supposedly made--were committed.
Story_ID: 102410
Speaker 1: If you use the standard that they're using to charge, indict, and try Charles Taylor, you could easily use it against [President] George [W.] Bush or any--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.  Last night they had the Nuremberg trials on (unclear) TV or the night before.  And they were--some of the same questions are raised.  But--and then you just had the trial of Saddam Hussein and other people in Iraq.
Speaker 1: Saddam didn't have a trial.  In no way you could consider that to be a trial.  I mean, you got a judge killed today and a prosecuting attorney killed; and yet, and tomorrow, the defense attorney the day after that.  How in the world can that be a fair trial?  You know.  If it had happened in this country, we would recess the trial until we could establish calm, and then try to restart the trial.  Saddam didn't have a fair trial.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: At least in my opinion he didn't.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you're saying that to have a fair trial, you've got to lay the groundwork for it.  You can't rush into, you know, you can't rush into it.
Speaker 1: Right.  You just can't have people--you can't have a trial where the violence permeates the whole process.  And that's exactly what happened in Saddam's case.  He had been tried by what is a puppet government.  And then that's--what's a puppet government gonna do but what it expects--it's manipulated--wants it to do?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I don't think anybody expected any other outcome then what it was.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  And Saddam's crimes couldn't be half as bad as what's happening there now or has happened in the last 14 or 15 years.  I heard on some program the other day that there're three thousand--three million widows in Iraq.  You can't have three million widows without three million dead husbands.  And in a country of 24 million people, that's outrageous.  And to have a policy where you're gonna stay the course for however long without any end in sight with the same things happening is, to me, imprudent.
Speaker 2: So what you're saying is that, it's whether a trial is fair or not is largely subjective in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No.  It's that I think there are objective markers of whether a trial is fair or not.  And in a trial where it's permeated by violence, objective violence obviously can't be fair.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  Well, all right.
Story_ID: 102411
Speaker 1: Well, can we talk about the [HM] Angela Davis case?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  What would you like to know (laughs)?
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Free Angela.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: The power of the people will free Angela Davis.
Speaker 1: Now this is about, like, 1970--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: 1970, '71 [1971] and '72 [1972].  Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear.)
Speaker 2: Yeah.  People thought I was crazy, man, 'cause I would saying "The power of the people will free Angela Davis."  And it did.  In a moment, I'll try to explain.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't know Angela before this incident.  I'd never met her or seen her.  And I was talking to a friend of mine by the name of [W.] Haywood Burns, who was later killed in an automobile accident in South Africa.  And Haywood said that I should go and visit Angela when she was in prison--in jail in New York at the House of D-- Metropolitan House of Detention.  And so he set up the meeting.  And it wasn't for the purpose of trying to represent Angela, 'cause that was the furthest thing from my mind.  I went to see her as a--I was an activist lawyer, I suppose--and out of interest.  And so when I--I went to see her on December 22nd, 1970.  And just before I went in to see her, I had learned that Justice Harlan had denied her request to stay her extradition to California.  And so I got there and I cleared security.  They told me that Angela would be across the floor in this rotunda.  There's a big--it was a big rotunda in the House of D.  So as I was walking over from the entrance to where I was to meet Angela, I passed a redbone woman in a green smock.  I saw her talking to another woman.  And I didn't pay her much attention, except she was a redbone woman.  And I went over and I sat down and waited about twenty minutes.  And after about twenty minutes, this redbone woman came over and introduced herself as Angela Davis and apologized to me profusely for having kept me waiting.  And I say to myself, "How in the world did I pass by this woman I've seen and not recognize her?  I've seen every picture of her in the newspaper, magazines and on television; and why didn't I recognize her, and all these other people who claiming they, they recognize did her."  And we talked, and she asked me some questions about what did I think about her representing herself.  I thought it was a good idea, and I explained her why.  And as I was leaving--oh, she asked me, when did I think that she was going--they couldn't move her back, take her back to--take her to California.  I said, "You're going back to California, tonight."  They're gonna take you tonight.  It's not gonna be two weeks or three weeks.  They gonna take you right now, because possession is 99 percent of the law, and the sooner they get you back to California, the fewer chances you'll have to frustrate their efforts to get you back for the legal proceedings.  And so as I was leaving, I asked her what can I do for her, and she said, "Would you call my parents and tell them that I'm okay."  I said, "Okay." And that was it.  I didn't hear any more from Angela until sometime in January, Franklin-- Franklin called me.  (unclear) Franklin Alexander, yeah.  Franklin called me and asked me would I--how would I think of--what would I think about representing Angela and being her chief counsel.  And I said, "Well, you know, I got a situation here in Atlanta [Georgia], but I'll see what we can do," 'cause my mother [Bessie Sims Moore] was ill at the time.  And so my mother passed at the end of January, so then I was able to agree to come out to California.  And I came out here and I--and initially we would stay out here for a year.  Jane [HM Jane Bond Moore] and I agreed that it would probably be very interesting to bring the kids out because--and live in Berkeley [California], because Berkeley had a voluntary desegregated school system, and we just come out for a year, 'cause I anticipated the trial might take a year, 'cause California had a reputation for having long trials.  So I came out for a couple of hearings in February, and then I moved out here in March.  And after I was out here for about a week, this house became available and I rented the house.  It was--[HM Ronald] Ron Dellums lived here before we rented the house from him.  And he had been elected to the Congress, and so I rented the house from Ron Dellums.  And then in July, Jane and the other, and the children came out.  And we worked on the case.  And people thought I was really crazy 'cause I said, "The power of the people will free Angela Davis."  And they said-
Story_ID: 102412
Speaker 1: [HM] Angela Davis and "The power of the people freeing Angela Davis."  And the people must have said, "That girl must be crazy.  She done gone to Georgia and got this black lawyer from Georgia, and he running around here talking about "the power of the people gonna free Angela Davis."
Speaker 2: Now, what did you mean by that?
Speaker 1: What I meant by that is that, it was necessary to have the people support Angela, because she and her immediate friends and organization didn't have the financial means to support her trial.  And she needed contributions from the public in order to wage the kind of defense that she was required to wage and have the personnel that was necessary to defend her in a case like this.  Mind you, a lot of cases are considered to be cases of the trials of the century, because they got different kind of publicity and exposure; in particular, the O.J. [Simpson] case.  But there is no case that's quite like the Angela Davis case, because in Angela's case it is the courthouse and the personnel of the judicial system that are the victims; and the crime scene is the courthouse itself.  Whenever you had a case where you have a dead judge [Harold Haley], a murdered judge actually; or dead witnesses or a district prosecuting attorney who is wounded and paralyzed from the waist down, and jurors who have been shot and wounded in an attempt to escape from a courtroom; and you have an accused defendant whose guns registered in her name were used in the crime; who's captured almost two months later, three miles--three thousand miles away in disguise.  That's a pretty tough case.  And not only is she a black woman, but she's communist, too.
Story_ID: 102413
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: Okay. So I was just talking about, you know, the difficulties in the [HM] Angela Davis case.  And no one should never--if they're unaware of it, they should never forget the significance of the fact that she was communist.  We did public opinion surveys.  We never released any of our surveys to the public, 'cause they would have found purposes internally.  When we started out, the negatives concerning Angela with regard to being a communist were up to 95 percent.  Ninety-five percent of the people polled felt that what she did as a communist was unpardonable.  The negatives in term of her being a black person started out somewhere between 85 and 90 percent.  By the time we got down to the trial, the negatives with respect to her being a black person was around 20 percent, you know.  We'd almost erased the whole idea that, you know, her blackness being an obstacle or being a reason to treat her that way rather.  But with respect to being a communist, it never got down below 65 percent, if it got that low. The negatives about, about Angela.
Speaker 1: So public opinion--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Very important.  Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And the prosecutor [Albert Harris] started out with a theory that he should have stuck with.  And that theory is that, Angela was politically motivated to conduct--to engage in the crimes charged:  conspiracy, murder and kidnap.  The idea that, for political reasons she wanted to--she enjoined in a conspiracy to free George Jackson and the other prisoners, the Soledad Brothers [Fleeta "Drumgo" Drumgoole and John Clutchette], from San Quentin [State Prison in San Quentin, California].  And they had a lot of evidence that they could have used.  Angela's political motivation from the statements that she made quite innocently at other times, and before her political views fully matured, because at one time, she was a member of the Black Panther Party, you know.  And, she, as a young person, in the early twenties or something, you make a lot of statements that are well felt, but not well thought out.  And like others, she was guilty of that kind of--engaging in that kind of rhetoric, and they could use that rhetoric against her.  But at one point in the pretrial proceedings, the prosecution got hold of a diary that Angela had written to George Jackson in which she expressed love for him, not only just a platonic love, but actually physical, carnal love for George Jackson.  I mean, it was a very warm, sizzling diary.  And the prosecution then seized upon the seizure of that diary to change his theory, that the motivation was not a political one, but a romantic one.  And the reason that the prosecution changed his theory, because of the agitation of the people, that she was being prosecuted for political reasons.  And the prosecution wanted to outmaneuver the public and make the public believe that she was being prosecuted for romantic reasons, not for political ones.  That was the power of the people that literally reached into the courtroom and brought about this change.
Story_ID: 102414
Speaker 1: She [HM Angela Davis] was actually charged with supplying the guns to Jonathan Jackson--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Right.
Speaker 1: --the brother of George Jackson to--
Speaker 2: They were her guns.  Okay.  And the idea was that she supplied them, but she didn't even know the guns had been taken.
Speaker 1: She wasn't on the scene at all.
Speaker 2: No.  She wasn't on the scene when the guns were taken from her closet in Los Angeles [California].  And--but the prosecution [Albert Harris] on had her diary to support that theory.  And Leo, who was very conversant with California law--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: [HM] Leo Branton [Jr.].
Speaker 2: Yeah--believed that we could get the diary significantly edited so that all of it wouldn't be admitted into evidence at trial.  'Cause in California, they have a rule of evidence under Section 352, which directs a trial judge to exclude relevant evidence if it prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value.  So we went through--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now, what does that mean (laughs)?
Speaker 2: Ha. Well, what it means is that it's more prejudicial to the defense than it is proof of the crime, okay.  If the proof of the crime, and especially if there's other evidence to support the crime, the less need there is for this prejudicial evidence.  In other words, that type of evidence that will excite reason and make people not be calm and dispassionate in their deliberation of the defendant's guilt.
Speaker 1: It may make them dislike her rather than--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, for some other reason other than the crime.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  That's a good, excellent way of putting it.  And so we were able to edit the diary almost down to nothing.  And so the prosecution was left with the edited version of the diary.  And that weakened his case considerably.  Then the other thing that weakened the case was that it relied heavily upon eyewitness testimony.  And we were able to, one, to question the credibility of the eyewitnesses through cross-examination.  Like, we brought out in one cross-examination that the witness was actually colorblind.  And we had a witness who claimed to be able to identify Angela Davis in the courtroom, identified altogether a different person, and Angela is sitting right next to the person.  Okay.
Speaker 1: So what kind of--I'm curious as to what kind of eyewitness could be brought to bear against someone who wasn't on the scene.  I mean, what were they asking for?
Speaker 2: Well, she--they claimed that they seen her the day before, okay--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: -casing the joint, more or less, you know, at the courthouse.  And that may have been the witness who claimed that he saw her at the courthouse on the day of the shooting, but I'm not--I don't recall that detail that vividly.
Story_ID: 102415
Speaker 1: And we [Moore and HM Leo Branton, Jr.] put on a psychologist, a Dr. Robert Buckhout.  He was a guy I had found almost through happenstance.  I had a woman who was working with me as a secretary by the name of Marlene Barmain [ph.].  And I was over to her house one afternoon for lunch, and she had this friend there who was from England, and she was just raving about this Robert Buckhout and about what a fantastic perceptual psychologist he was.  So I asked her, I said, "Where does he live?"  She said, "He lives in Berkeley [California] over up Regent Street."  And she gave me his address and phone number.  I went up to his place, and he lived in an apartment in the basement.  And I went in the apartment, and in the middle of the room he had a table, and he had a stack of books up in a U-shape.  And he was sitting at the desk behind the books.  And I walked past the books over to him, and I said, "My name is Howard Moore, Jr., and are you Dr. Buckhout?"  He said, "Yes, I am."  I said, "You've just walked on the stage of history.  I want you to be a witness in the Angela Davis case."  And he agreed.  And the day he testified, it surprised me, 'cause I should have briefed him on this, but I didn't.  He appeared in a turtleneck sweater and a tweed jacket.  My preference is that, he, you know, be buttoned down with a shirt and tie.  And as we were about to call him he started shaking, went to shaking, you know, trembling.  So I grabbed him and put my arms him and kissed him on the jaw.  I said, "You can do it."  (Laughs.)  Then and he pulled himself together and he went in the courtroom.  And Bill turned to me and says, "Howard, you'll do anything for Miss [HM Angela] Davis, won't you?"  I said, "I just did."  (Laughs.)  And he went in and testified, and his testimony proved to be very helpful in getting the jurors to question the eyewitness's testimony.  And that was about a half dozen, maybe eight eyewitnesses who had placed Angela at the scene or in the vicinity of the scene at the time.
Speaker 2: What did he say basically?
Speaker 1: Well, he showed how they had conducted tests and especially the one that said different race, when it's say a white person identifying a black person on the subway, that was one of the tests that he talked about, and it would be the white person who would be given a knife in the test and stab a black person, but the witness would usually say it was a black person who stabbed the white person.  Okay.  And then you have a situation where a witness will fill in detail something that the witness had not seen, but he'll add detail to it, even though he never saw it.  And then you have the feeling witness who wants to be a part of history.  And where there were tests done, people were told that a certain building had burned up, but there was never any fire.  And people would come forward and say, "Yes.  I saw it," and describe in detail the flames and everything, you know, 'cause they want to be a part of history.  And he gave that kind of testimony.  And we had examples of each of those kinds of things in our case.  So that was quite helpful.
Story_ID: 102416
Speaker 1: And we had a pretty good jury.  And in the jury selection, I was conducting the voir dire of the woman who later became the jury foreman, Mary Timothy.  And we had a stock set of questions that we would ask, and I'd asked her most of the questions.  And as I was getting ready to ask her the next question, the courtroom became infused with a bright white light.  And there were only two people in the courtroom, Miss Timothy and myself.  And a voice came to me, a message came to me, and it said to me "You can trust me.  Question me no more.  You can trust me."  So I stopped questioning her.  And after the trial, I learned had I asked the next question, she surely would have been disqualified.  And the next question was:  "When is the last time you've had a social visit with a black person in your home?"  Had I asked that question, her answer would have been, "Last night."  Okay.  And if she had given that testimony, I would have had no doubt in my mind she would have been disqualified, been struck peremptorily by the prosecution, and she wouldn't have been on the jury or the foreperson of the jury.  And here we are--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Now, just back to this bright light.  Now, we don't hear these kinds of stories much.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But you actually saw a bright light and heard a voice?
Speaker 1: I saw a bright light.  It was just as clear.  It was only two people in the courtroom.  Everything was still.  It was almost like a movie, like a heavenly scene or something, you know.  But here's this bright light, and I get this message and I stopped questioning.  People wanted to know at the table why did I stop questioning her.  I said, "Don't worry."  'Cause they were a little upset with me because I didn't continue to question her.  But I was told not to question her anymore, you know.  That--my mother [Bessie Sims Moore] would call that "mother wit," you know, that was speaking to me, that was guiding me, you know.  And because, you know, I used psychologists to help select the jury in the case.  We had four--five psychologists who volunteered their time, and they would come and sit in the courtroom and observe the jurors, their nonverbal comments as well as their verbal comments, and then tell us what they thought of the jurors afterwards.  And they proved to be very helpful.  I didn't tell anybody we were doing that during the trial, it was only afterwards.  And after the Angela Davis case, the whole industry now has grown up of jury consultants.  But the Angela Davis case was the paradigm for the use of jurors.  It's much more developed and sophisticated now, as you would expect it to be.  But after the notoriety attending our use of psychologists to select the jury in Angela's case, the jury consultant industry emerged.  It was a fantastic two years of my life in that case.
Story_ID: 102417
Speaker 1: So the trial took two years to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, I was in there for sixteen months; from January of '71 [1971] through July of--June, rather, of '72 [1972].  But the worst feeling, though, is the day after the trial.  That is about the worst feeling that you could have, 'cause your whole has been this case for close to two years.  You eat and breathe and sleep this case.  You have a special courtroom with a judge who's only assigned your case, has been especially assigned to hear this case.  And this is the first case where there was wide use--widespread use of metal detectors with people going in and out of the courtroom.  Our courtroom and the area behind it had been cordoned off with eighteen-foot metal screen--wide fence--with razor wire on the top.  And the day after the case, you got nothing to do.  It's all over, you know.  And it's really kind of "what do I do today?"  "I don't know," you know.  "Where do I go?  I don't have any place to go."  I mean, the case is over.  I didn't have any press conferences to meet, have a courtroom to go to.  I had no briefs to write or nothing, you know.  But we had a good party the night of the--and we had a real good party the night of the victory, though.  Very good party
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how long was it before you knew whether you had a victory or not?
Speaker 2: I never doubted it.  I think the case was given to the jury on a Thursday, and we had a verdict Sunday afternoon.  And they deliberated throughout the weekend.  And I felt as long as this lady, Miss [Mary] Timothy, was on the jury, that she'd never be convicted.  I never worried that she would be convicted.  And I remember when we got the word that the jury had the verdict, we were out at the Portofino Apartments in San Jose [California].  Leo [HM Leo Branton, Jr.] and I shared an apartment together.  And I went over to tell Angela [HM Angela Davis].  I said, "Well, it's time to go in."  And she was all broke up.  I mean, she was so nervous.  I don't know how she got herself together.  And we went in and the jury read off the three verdicts:  not guilty, not guilty.  And that was it.
Speaker 1: So the three charges were--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Murder, kidnapping and conspiracy.  And the conspiracy was the toughest charge, because it's the easiest charge to prove.  Two or more people who reach an agreement and do some act in furtherance of that agreement, refer to use it as an overt act.  It's enough to establish conspiracy.  And then any person who joins in the conspiracy afterwards is as guilty as the originators of the conspiracy.
Speaker 1: Now, did they ever produce somebody else that was supposed to be involved in the conspiracy--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, they produced--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --who wasn't all ready dead or something, you know?
Speaker 2: They produced Ruchell McGhee, but he was on--he was a victim.  He wasn't really in the conspiracy.  And Johnson [sic, George Jackson] had been killed.  William Christian--Christmas--Christian [sic, William Christmas] was killed.  And there was no one else who gave any statements establishing there was a conspiracy who was alive, you know.
Speaker 1: That was the fella that drove her around for a while.  That was--was that--
Speaker 2: That was basically Jonathan.  Jonathan Jackson.
Speaker 1: No.  The fella that drove her around, across the country and--(unclear)
Speaker 2: Oh, you're talking about [David] Poindexter.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Poindexter was acquitted in New York for harboring a fugitive.  Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was acquitted before Angela.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So--yeah, so in all, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: We're done then.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's--so that was--that was that.
Story_ID: 102418
Speaker 1: Okay.  So any other cases that, you know, you would consider--?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a case that--I've had a lot of cases that are very interesting.  I have some even now.  But I had a death penalty case in 1964 that--I received a letter.  It was, I think, March 31st.  The next day is April Fools' Day, April first.  And I got the letter when I returned to my office that afternoon, March 31st, and it was on my desk unopened.  And I opened the letter and I read it.  It said, "Dear Mr. Moore, they're gonna kill me tomorrow in Reidsville Prison [Georgia State Prison in Reidsville, Georgia] at ten o'clock.  Please help me.  Don't let me down.  Yours in Christ, Ernest Whippler."  So I read that letter for 'bout--I don't know, how many times, hoping that it was just an April Fools' Day and I wasn't required to do anything.  And then, as my mother [Bessie Sims Moore] would say, a voice, my better voice came to me and said, "Maybe you should find out whether it's an April Fool or whether it's for real."  So I called down to Reidsville, Georgia, where the death row is, which is about 335 miles from Atlanta [Georgia], and I asked to speak with the Warden.  The Warden was a rather nice guy, somewhat progressive for his time and place, by the name of Ralph Balkcom.  And I told him that--I asked him, "Do you have an Ernest Whippler there?"  He answered affirmatively.  I said, "Is he scheduled to be executed tomorrow at ten o'clock?"  He answered affirmatively.  And then he volunteered some information, that some lawyers had represented Whippler all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, but their petition had been denied, and that their offices were in Macon, Georgia.  And he was kind enough to give me a phone number, and I called over there and spoke to the lawyer, he said, "Yes, we did," and went on.  And he said, "Well, we did all we could for Whippler.  He was a good boy until he went off to the Navy.  Then he came back here with some bad ideas.  And we done the best we could."  And they gave me the number of his case in the Georgia Supreme Court.  And I still had a little time to run over to the Supreme Court and look at the records over there and I did.  And I discovered in reading the records that Whippler had claimed that he killed this man in self-defense; that he went into this convenience store of a kind near Macon, Georgia, and his intent was to rob the man, but the man pulled a gun on him.  And Whippler saw a bayonet or he brought the bayonet in to the store with him, and Whippler stabbed the man with the bayonet; even cut one or two of his fingers off; a brutal murder, you know, with a bayonet.  You can imagine that.  This knife is about a foot long.  And he had expressed the idea that he was defending himself.  But the problem with that is, that in the course of robbery you don't have a right of self-defense, you know (laughs).  So I decided, what can I do for Whippler.  And I did a little research around the law and I found out that the Governor had the power to establish a post-conviction sanity commission of three people who could investigate whether or not the defendant, the condemned man, was sane or not.  So I had never seen Whippler.  And in Georgia, at that time, the state of mental health services was very meager, if nonexistent.  And I knew two people who were psychologists.  One worked at Emory University [Atlanta, Georgia], a woman by the name of Bonnie Strickland; and the other fella who had come down from Canada and worked at Morehouse [College in Atlanta, Georgia].  He was just working there temporarily as an instructor, by the name of Harry Steinmetz.  So I spoke with Dr. Strickland and Dr. Steinmetz, and they agreed that they would be my vouchers on my petition, you know.  So I got the petition, I got the petition together, and I called the Governor's office to speak with the Governor's counsel, 'cause the Governor was out of state.  But the Governor's counsel wasn't in his office.  He was in Macon, Georgia.  And the lady gave me the number for the Governor's counsel in Macon, Georgia, and I called him.  And he said that he would be in his office in the morning--that's the day of the execution--and to meet him there at 8:30, "you hear?"  So I said, "Yes, sir.  I'll be there."  He said, "I'll take whatever you got for the Governor at that time."  And so at 8:30 we were there, but he wasn't.  Nine o'clock came, he still wasn't there.  The execution is scheduled at ten.  Nine-thirty comes, he's not there.  We wait and we wait.
Story_ID: 102419
Speaker 1: About five minutes to ten, this fella walks into the room and says, "Is there a lawyer here with a petition for me?"  I said, "Yes, sir.  I'm the lawyer."  He said, "You have the petition?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  He said, "Give it to me."  I gave him the petition.  He said, "Wait here."  I didn't trust the white man, all right.  So I gave him the petition, and he left out the room, and I let him get about ten paces ahead of me, and I walked out.  And I followed softly behind him, hoping he wouldn't turn around and see me or feel my presence.  I followed him down to the Governor's office.  And at that time, you could look into the suite where the Governor's office is from windowpanes in the side.  So I looked in and sure enough, he went into the Governor's office.  So I went back to where we were, which was about thirty feet from the Governor's office.  And after about five minutes, he returned to where we were.  And he said to us, he says, "I got good news for you.  The governor has stayed [Ernest] Whippler's execution for the space of ten minutes."  (Laughs.)  Man, that's really--that's comforting.  Right?  And so ten minutes went by, and it was long and short at the same time.  You know how a thing can have this kind of a dual reality.  And he came back and he said that the Governor had granted my petition, and he was going to appoint a sanity commission to have ten days--sixty days to make their investigation and finding.  And so I knew that they were going to find--they were going to rule against the petition, but it would give me time to get a habeas corpus petition together, in which at least I could claim that Whippler was denied a fair jury, that there was discrimination in the trial and Grand Jury.  And I went to see Whippler.  And I had a list of questions that I wanted to ask him.  I went down to Reidsville [Georgia State Prison in Reidsville, Georgia] and got in the prison.  And they put me on an elevator and we go up to the fifth floor, wherever they kept him; I think it was the fifth floor.  And they have a trustee that operates the elevator.  When you get up there he call it out, "Death Row," you know, then you get off.  And when you get off the elevator, smack in the middle of the room was the electric chair.  I had never seen the electric chair before.  I'd seen an electric chair in the movies, but this was a real set.  And it was painted white; a glistening, gawking, mocking white, smack in the middle of the room.  And the line, the power line, made off into the distance to the back.  And the condemned men, some of them, were arranged around the electric chair in kind of an eight-sided configuration.  And I--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So they could see it from their cells?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they could see it.  But on the day of the execution, they're removed from their cells and taken down below, because the odor is too horrific, you know, from the execution itself.  But--and so I walk past the chair over to--the electric chair-- over to Whippler's cell, and they put a little stool or something for me to sit on to talk to him through his cells bars.  And he didn't notice me at first.  He turned when he felt me approaching me his cell.  And he was a guy, a little shorter than you are, walnut skin color, and his face was very sad.  And the only time the sadness about his face and his countenance was broken if he smiled, you know, and he didn't smile.  He might say something and that would break the sadness.  And I started talking to him and told him, you know, why I was there, what I'd done, things like that.  He said he appreciated it.  And then my attention was distracted.  I heard the chirping of a bird, and I was trying to locate where the bird was.  And I looked beyond Whippler, and I saw this cage in his cell.  And he had fashioned a birdcage out of cigarette packs.  And in the packs--and it was hung from the ceiling--and in the cell was this little bird that he had named Ray, and the bird was just chirping away.  And it was so incongruent with his status that this bird would be in his cage, you know, a condemned man caring for a bird that I never got back to the questions I had to ask, 'cause I could never get my mind off the incongruence of a bird being in his cage.  And that was the only time I saw Whippler.  I don't have any recollection of any correspondence between the two of us.
Story_ID: 102420
Speaker 1: But in any event, I got his [Ernest Whippler] case to court.  We went to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and I won.  And the Court of Appeals ruled that Georgia's habeas corpus rules were too restrictive, because at that time, the only defense--constitutionally issue that you would raise on habeas corpus in Georgia was one that went to the issue of whether or not your trial counsel was effective or not.  And questions such as whether or not your jury was improperly constituted--the Grand Jury was improperly constituted, and since that was, you know, racial exclusion or even whether or not you'd been subject to a coerced confession, cannot be raised, because habeas corpus was limited to affect the assistance of counsel.  And the Fifth Circuit ruled that was too restrictive.  And as a result of that, the Georgia Legislature then enacted new rules, which allowed any constitutional claim to be raised in a Georgia habeas corpus proceeding, because that was the only way they could control these post-conviction proceedings, because otherwise every case would automatically go to the Federal Court because you could bypass the Georgia courts, 'cause it would be ineffective and inefficient to go to a Georgia court when you know that they're not going to hear that particular issue, because they're, by decision, precluded from doing so.  So that changed the law throughout Georgia, existing law today.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In 1984, Whippler was paroled.
Story_ID: 103117
Speaker 1: [Ernest] Whippler was paroled in 1984.  And in 1988, he was released from parole.  And I've always been disturbed by my participation in the case.  And initially, I didn't think anything of it.  Some years later, I was conducting a Reginald Heber Smith Fellowship Training Program, and Judge Griffin Bell, who later became Attorney General of the United States during the [President Jimmy] Carter Administration, was there.  And I mentioned the Whippler case to him for some reason and told him how I was brought into the case, somewhat in the way I related it here to you.  And Judge Bell said that he was amazed that when he was lawyer, said he wouldn't have known what to do with something like that.  He was just amazed that I had worked--figured that out in such little time.  And that made--I began thinking about the Whippler case at that point, 'cause I hadn't thought about it after he'd been sentenced, you know.  And I'm somewhat con-- disturbed by my role in it.  And the question that I've asked myself, "Do I have enough concern about people or do I--am I just a coldhearted technician."  'Cause I never established any kind of a relationship with Whippler, you know, to have learned about his family, about--really about his bringing up, who he is and how he became the way he was, you know; none of those things.  And usually--it took me a long time to talk about the case in the kind of detail that I've given you this afternoon.  And the only reason I'm able to do it now is because of Jane [HM Jane Bone Moore], my wife, made me go with her to the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa] to a writer's conference, and the people at the writer's conference insist that, since I was there, I had to write something.  So the only thing that came to my mind to write was to write something about this case.  And I could not write it in the first person, 'cause I was supposed to write an essay, and essays should be written in the first person, and I could only write it in the third person.  And I wrote it up.  And then I--ever since then, I've always thought about being so distant, you know, and not being, say, perhaps a more caring person, you know, and not knowing more about this man.  Maybe I'm too hard on myself.  Maybe I'm not hard enough.  I don't know.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah, a lot of questions.  I mean, I just-I can see the value of doing or getting involved in that.  And I don't think the value was clear at first what the outcome was going to be, but you--I mean, there was some good achieved by being involved in it.
Speaker 1: Right.  Well, I just--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: --once I found out that he was gonna actually be executed, I had to do something, 'cause I've always been opposed to capital punishment, 'cause I think that it's a--I think it lowers society, because you reduce yourself to the level of the criminal, 'cause you're using the same means as the criminal used to solve even real or imagined problems, imagined problems.  And I don't see any place in modern civilized society for capital punishment.  It's just a form of vengeance.  I see no way to justify it.  I'm against capital punishment and all crime.  That doesn't mean if you were to do something to one of a member of my family I wouldn't want to kill you, and I might kill you.  But that's not society killing you, that's me.  And society shouldn't act the way I would act, as irrational as I might act or as vicious or malicious as I might act, you know.
Story_ID: 103118
Speaker 1: Right.  So, now, you established a--now, why did you stay in California after the [HM Angela] Davis trial [1972]?
Speaker 2: Oh, the reason why we stayed is that my wife [HM Jane Bond Moore] went to law school.  And she applied to Emory [University School of Law in Atlanta, Georgia], but Emory put her on a waiting list for the following spring.  The University of California Boalt Hall [University of California, Berkeley School of Law in Berkeley, California], which is a better law school and cheaper, too, admitted her immediately starting that September.  So that we, you know, it took three years to finish law school, so we just stayed out here.  I had an opportunity to go back in 1981 when--well, I could have gone back anytime I wanted to.  I might still go back for that matter.  Maynard Jackson who was then mayor of Atlanta, who's a friend of mine, he'd gone to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] too for a while, invited me back to become the city attorney for the City of Atlanta.  And I considered it, and then I decided that it wasn't what I wanted--what I should do, because when you represent a party or side in a case, you should be 100 percent for that party.  And I didn't want to be in the position of representing police officers who had committed or used excessive force against African Americans.  I didn't want to be in that position, and I didn't want to be defending fire departments that were excluding African Americans from service.  And I felt that that's not what my parents [Howard Moore, Sr. and Bessie Sims Moore] encouraged me; certainly what my mother encouraged me to do with becoming a professional.  And somebody else can do that.  I don't need to do that.  I mean, that's not my cup of tea and I shouldn't do it, 'cause I couldn't be 100 percent.  Because if I was on the other side, I would want to be as fearlessly supportive of the police officers and the fire departments as I am of the plaintiffs who are suing them.  And so I declined to go back to Atlanta at that time.
Story_ID: 103119
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, now you formed, when your wife [HM Jane Bond Moore] finished law school [University of California, Berkeley School of Law in Berkeley, California], when it happened, you formed Moore and Moore.  Was it immediate or what?
Speaker 2: It wasn't immediately, because when she finished law school, she worked in the office for a little while.  Then she went to work for the Bank of California.  Then she worked for the Federal Trade Commission.  But when [President Ronald] Reagan came to power, they fired her, okay.  I don't know whether it had anything to do with Reagan coming to power or not.  But anyway, she wasn't fired; her job was terminated.  I think that's what happened.  And then she came into the law office and it became Moore and Moore.  And she worked there for a period of time, and then she became General Counsel for the Oakland Unified School District.  And now she's semiretired.
Story_ID: 103120
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, you've also, you know, taught at the University of California at Berkeley [Berkeley, California].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And when did you start?
Speaker 2: I taught--I started in 1976.  I taught a course in the African American Studies Department [Department of African American Studies] called the, the Law in the Black Community.  And I taught four hours a week.  I loved the course.  I thought I was very good at it.  And then I took on a case for a member of the Socialist Workers Party, who claimed that campus police had used excessive force against him.  And so shortly after I got into the case, I got a memo from the department saying that it wasn't enough money in the budget to support my--to pay me for my class.  And they weren't going to offer it again for three years, and they would let me know when they were going to offer my course again.  And that was that.  So after about eighteen months, somebody called me from the department and wanted to know if they could use my syllabus.  And I told them "Yeah, you can use my syllabus, but you have to pay me a royalty.  I copyrighted it."  (Laughs.)  And that's the last contact I've had with the department.  I really enjoyed the course, and that's one thing that I really miss.  I used to teach from "Native Son," Richard Wright's book, questions about black on black crime, the causes of crime; you know, for example, if you're familiar with the book, the scene where Bigger Thomas takes Mary Dalton, on the first night after he brings her back to the house, upstairs because she's inebriated.  And while he's there putting her in the bed--he hadn't bothered, molested or anything--Mrs. Dalton, who's blind, appears and Bigger doesn't know how to explain the situation.  He completely panics and he strangles Mary to death and ultimately takes her body and burns it in the furnace downstairs.  And so, you know, you want to ask your students, you know, "Why didn't Bigger say to Mrs. Dalton, 'Mary was inebriated and I brought her upstairs.  She's here on the bed.  Would you like to check her out?'  You know.  Or articulate something to her.  Why does he fear a blind woman in such an irrational way, then commits murder, you know."  And then you talk about, you know, is it poverty?  Is it lack of education?  What's going on?  Is this a personality quirk or what?  You know, in teaching that.  And the kids really get excited, you know, and they home and read the book, 'cause I require them to read five books.  I had a reading list of 300 books, and my requirement said you read five books, and you write a short review of what you read.  And when they first start writing, some of the kids just write, "This is a great book, the best book I ever read."  And I write, "This is not a book review."  'Cause saying the book is great is not a review of a book.  You have to talk about what the book is and how it's organized, what the author's point of view is, and the critique you might want to make of the author's point of view as to the author's style or whatever.  You know.  And they'd catch on.  And by the end of the semester they would be writing good reviews.  And the other thing, when we had classes with enough whites--people other than African Americans in the class, I'd ask them to go to any courtroom they wished to visit, convenient for them to visit, and pair up with a person of a different race or gender, and go and write up their observations.  And they would do it, and the observations would be so different, you know, based upon their race or their gender of what they had seen.  And they found that very instructive, too.  I loved teaching that class.  I don't think anybody can do it better than I could, you know (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you only taught until about 19 what, '78 [1978]?
Speaker 2: I taught 'til 1986.
Speaker 1: Eighty-six [1986]?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was ten years.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you were there about ten years.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was just one semester once a year, you know, for four hours, yeah.
Story_ID: 103121
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was some of the other memorable cases, I guess, here in California after the [HM] Angela Davis case?
Speaker 2: Well, after Angela Davis, some of my memorable cases--one case my wife [HM Jane Bond Moore] and I worked on a case with Dr. John L. Williams who sued the Alameda County Health Services Administration [Health Care Services Agency].  We won that case.  We got a big verdict for him.  And the--some of the other big cases here were the case against the Alameda Naval Air Rework Facility, NARF.  It's closed now.  It's one of the bases that was closed on the Base Closing Act [1993].  That was a class action suit, and we got a consent decree, and we enforced the consent decree for about ten years.  We got it renewed and we got every job that they promised us.  And it's got some African Americans in jobs that pay $70---, $80,000 a year, plus overtime.  Of course, when the base was closed, those jobs were lost and they haven't been replaced.  And the other--one of the other significant class actions I had was against the Oakland Fire Department [Oakland, California].  We had the Oakland Fire Department under a consent decree for about ten years.  And sometimes when I'm kind of down, you know, you don't feel too good, you know; you feel kind of blue or something like that?  And I walk down the street--I'm walking down the street and a fire truck comes by.  And you see white, yellow, brown, red, male and female on there.  And it makes you feel good to say, "I had something to do with that," you know.  It just picks up your spirit.  Or you're walking or you're in a restaurant or something and somebody comes over who worked for the fire department all these years, you know, it's a woman or something, and they greet you.  It's a tremendous sense of accomplishment from things of that sort.  Then I've had a number of individual cases, like I had a case with this--malpractice case for a woman client [Linda E. Stanley], a well-to-do client from Marin [Marin County, California] in which the trial judge treated me like I was stupid, like I was a dog, and issued a nonsuit.  And I could see, during the course of the trial, that the judge wasn't let me be a lawyer, you know, wasn't let me do what I like to do as a lawyer.  And I told my client that that's what was happening and would she commit herself to paying for the trial transcripts so we could appeal.  She said she would.  At that point, I didn't care what he did.  I knew that I was going to be able to appeal.  And I appealed the case and it was reversed.  And it's one of the most exciting cases in California in the area of expert witnesses, fiduciary duty, and one other point; but it's been recited in over a hundred cases, and it appears in every (unclear) in the State.
Speaker 1: What's the name of the case?
Speaker 2: Stanley against Richmond [Stanley v. Richmond, 1995].
Speaker 1: Stanley against?
Speaker 2: Richmond.  Yes.
Speaker 1: v. Richmond?  Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had a case against Amtrak.  I've got a number of cases against Amtrak.  I'm in a couple of Amtrak cases now.  But this case I had against Amtrak was involving a white woman [Meriola Z. Gotthardt] who was one of the first women engineers on the train, and she had been subjected to a hostile work environment.  And I won the case in the District Court, and it became an issue as to whether or not she was entitled to front and back pay or whether or not the 1991 Civil Rights Act had capped her damages at $300,000.  And the court agreed that the amendment to the 1991 Civil Rights Act only capped the damages for emotional distress, but not for front pay and back pay. And the front pay and back pay for her came to a little over a million dollars.  And eventually another case from Ohio went to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court agreed with that point of view and cited the Gotthardt case, my case against--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: What's the name of the case again?
Speaker 2: Gotthardt, G-O-T-T-H-A-R-D [sic, G-O-T-T-H-A-R-D-T], against the National Railway Passenger Corporation [Gotthardt v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 1999].
Story_ID: 103122
Speaker 1: And I was in a recent case, National Railway--Amtrak against Morgan [National Railway Passenger Corporation v. Morgan], which was decided by the Supreme Court in, I think, in 2002, where my brother came to my rescue--came to our rescue.  Brother Clarence [Thomas].  Clarence stepped up to the plate.
Speaker 2: Now, this is interesting.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And in a five-four, the City, and because we lost one part of the case.  But we didn't lose in a hostile work aspect of the case.  And Clarence wrote it with us.  He wrote the decision, five-four.  Actually Clarence has written about--Justice Thomas, I should say, rather--has written about six or seven opinions that have been very helpful in the area of employment discrimination and in the area of procedural issues.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And what was the name of that case, that particular case that would be?  Now, that's still the --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That was National Railway Passenger Corporation--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --against Morgan.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the young woman [Pamela Y. Price] who started her career with me, actually she--even when she was in law school, she worked with our law offices, she actually argued the case before the Supreme Court.  My idea, I'd like to encourage as many African Americans still argue before the Supreme Court as I possibly can.  It's very difficult to do nowadays, because there're people who specialize in arguing before the Supreme Court.  But once your case approaches the Supreme Court, they solicit you and they're really very excellent lawyers, but that doesn't help our community.  We need people in our community who can go there, 'cause you got to look to the day when nobody's gonna solicit you.  It's going to be that unpopular case or the case that doesn't--it may not be a winner nobody's interested in, you know.  And you need people who have that experience; plus it just helps you in your practice to do that.  And I notice the difference between the way the practice has developed at that level from the last time I argued myself in the Supreme Court, which was in 1974, when I argued Steffel against Thompson [Steffel v. Thompson].  And when I argued Steffel against Thompson, I was in the court all by myself.  If the client had walked into the courtroom, I would not have recognized him, you know.  I was--it was just me and the Supremes.  And I won that 9-0.  Now, when we went to court with Morgan, there are Supreme Court Institutes.  There's one in Georgetown [Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C.], there's one at Stanford.  I knew about the one in Georgetown.  I didn't know about the one at Stanford [Supreme Court Litigation Clinic at Stanford Law School in Stanford, California].  So we called Georgetown the day that the Court granted certiorari; agreed that it would review the case.  And Georgetown agreed that they would accept our case for moot court purposes.  And Amtrak called right after that, but they had to refuse Amtrak.  And so we had--before we went over to Washington [D.C.], we had a moot court out here with experienced lawyers.  We get to Washington, we have a moot court.  At Georgetown, we experience law professors and lawyers, which was really terrific.  Really gets you ready to argue the case in the court.  And then after that, we had a moot court with the Lawyers' Committee [Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights under Law].  And it was at Sidley and Austin [Sidley Austin LLP] and they--on the first floor, they have a courtroom.  They have their own courtroom, practice courtroom, you know.  And that was really terrific.  This guy, [Richard] Rich Seymour, who is an expert in employment discrimination law, he really took Pam to school.  And that was very beneficial.  After that she was ready, 'cause that was the most difficult moot court she had had; most penetrating questions and everything.  And I must say that I've seen a number of people who have been to the Supreme Court or clients who've been to the Supreme Court, but I've never seen a client who got his day in the court the way Abner Morgan [Jr.] got his day in court.  Every clerk, every assistant at the courthouse knew Abner.  And he held court.  He was around talking to everyone (laughs), you know.  He really enjoyed himself, you know; brother from the hood in the Supreme Court.  He really enjoyed himself. And--
Story_ID: 103123
Speaker 1: We may be going back [to the U.S. Supreme Court] sometime next year.  It's likely that we'll be going back for the for--African American chief of police of San Francisco [California].  That case is likely to make it to the Supreme Court.  It's now up for rehearing before the Ninth Circuit.  So we'll probably find out sometime this fall if we're going to get rehearing.  We'll probably find out in the next two or three months we're going to get a rehearing.  We'll probably find out next fall if we don't get a rehearing, whether or not the Court is going to review it.  And the question there is:  Does a District Attorney have absolute immunity from prosecution, where he conducts a fictitious, false investigation of a person that results in the ruination of the person's career, you know, after--I mean, Chief [Prentice Earl] Sanders has worked for the San Francisco Police Department for some forty years, you know; and then at the end of his career to have something like that to happen, it's a travesty.  So we'll see what happens on that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you're still practicing law?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  I still practice here.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't go to the office every day like I used to.  I got an office downstairs, now, and I like working over here better than I do going over to San--over to Oakland [California], you know.  I go over there once or twice a week now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 103124
Speaker 1: We always ask this question:  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I hope we can develop a little leadership and develop a program and get people into significant places, but particularly public office, who have some vision.  And that, and that we don't fall in the trap of letting race limit what our vision is, and limit our approach to the formation of public policy, which is very, very crucial.  We cannot sit back and wait 'til somebody uses the N-word or uses inappropriate language such as Don Imus did, to become aroused.  Because that's gonna happen infrequently.  And usually if it does happen, the train has already gone.  We have to be interested in everything that's going on, and not just in the terms of Civil Rights.  We have to be interested in the formation of the budget.  What's in the budget?  How is it gonna be spent?  If there're earmarks, then why aren't there some earmarks for the African American community?  Why not some pork us, you know.  We got to become more a concerned or more informed electorate.  And we have to go back to basics, and the basic is education, education, education.  One reason we're often behind the eightball, because the other people generally are better educated than we are.  Not that they're smarter than we are; they're better educated.  And we got to open our eyes.  People in this country don't spend billions of dollars on education, because it doesn't benefit them.  It doesn't allow them to control others.  They spend it precisely for that purpose: to prepare each generation so that it can be in control of the wealth and the politics of this country.  And we have to go back to the question of education.  And we put too much emphasis on what's negative in our environment.  You know, there're a lot of blacks who are just falling, falling, falling by the wayside.  That's true.  But there's so many who are falling by the wayside because they don't have the opportunity or the means to go forward.  To those who want to go forward, but don't have the means or opportunity, it's our responsibility to see that they have the means and the opportunity.  And to do that, we must be activists in the area of the formation of public policy at every level.  Whether it's building highways, we can't look to get a set-aside.  So maybe we can get a $500,000 contract on a $5 billion project.  That's no money.  A set-aside is no good.  The set-asides are basically gone.  Only a few people get their hands on a set-aside.  But where is that highway going?  And what communities is it going through?  Are the people whose property gonna be taken by eminent domain, are they gonna get fair compensation?  Are they gonna get some kind of bonus because, as a minority, they gonna have to pay a tax to move elsewhere, you know.  So we've got to be concerned about every aspect.
Story_ID: 103125
Speaker 1: And we also have to begin to get--some of us have it.  I'm not trying by any means to imply that none of us have it.  But more of us have to have a global attitude and a global understanding of what's going on in the world, 'cause we live in a world.  Like Andy Young [HM Andrew Young] pointed out in the speech he made that, you know, this whole thing about being a minority is really transitory, 'cause I'm a minority this afternoon.  In Berkeley, California, I get on a plane, I land in Johannesburg [South Africa], sixteen hours from now, my minority status is gone.  I'm no longer a minority, you know.  And we have to understand that.  And we also have to understand that our opportunities for success and to express ourselves is not limited to the United States; that anyplace in the world where we are trained and have something to offer, there's opportunity for us.  I met a brother the other day, and he works in Singapore.  What does he do?  He's a computer consultant.  Why is he working in Singapore?  Because he's got something to offer.  And you just can't limit yourself to the United States.  My daughter was in Paris [France] about two months--about a month ago, and she met an African American woman who lives six months and lives in, I think, Denmark six months.  Well, she was a stockbroker, you know.  So she moved completed out of the United States, you know.  And we got to develop that kind of thinking.  And one of the things that could help us a lot is to look closely at the Jewish community, you know.  There are forty million black people in the United States.  They're from six to ten million Jews in the United States, but they have far more influence than we do, you know.  And the reason for that is not just that they're Jewish, but because they have habits of pursuing education, of developing good relationships with people, of understanding people; of knowing--having know-how, how to manage enterprises, managing them effectively and efficiently so they can make money; and how to manage money.  And how to be a true international people, because there're Jewish people all over the world.  And as African Americans, we have to understand that.  So we should look and learn from the Jewish community.
Story_ID: 102430
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could do it again?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I've never been--I'm not satisfied with anything I've done.  If I win a case, I'm not satisfied; I lose, I'm not satisfied.  I always feel that whatever I've done, I could do better.  And there's a good reason for that.  You never know as much about a thing before you do it than you know about it after you do it.  And so after you do it, you can do it better or should be able to do it better.  And everything I've done, if I think about it, and I usually think about the things I've done, I would do them differently or see some way it could be done differently or some way that I didn't do it well enough.  And one of the things I've done as a lawyer, I've always been very reluctant to say I lost a case because the judge was prejudice.  Because that's the easy way to become incompetent and inefficient.  I'd rather feel that I lost a case because there's something I should have done that I didn't do or something I did that I should have done better, 'cause that lies within me.  I can control that or I can influence it or how much influence I'm gonna have over a prejudiced judge is gonna to be very doubtful, especially when the judge doesn't realize that he or she is prejudice to begin with.  And I never tell a client that a judge is prejudiced.  I'd rather explain to the client that the Judge has a different judicial philosophy that's more restrictive than some other judge might have.  And, as a result of that restrictive philosophy, there may be a different outcome.  And I feel very strongly about that, 'cause it's easier to say that you didn't do something because somebody is prejudiced.
Story_ID: 102431
Speaker 1: But if you look at all the wonderful things so many people have in this country despite prejudice because they had the perseverance.  After--take Percy Sutton.   I heard him explain that he had been trying to get money for a number of years.  He'd gone to some-sixty-five sources to try to borrow five million dollars so that he could buy a particular radio station in New York.  And that one day he was walking down Fifth Avenue and he ran into this guy who was the vice president of Mechanics Bank, and they struck up a conversation.  And at the end of the conversation, he asked Percy what--did he need anything.  Percy said, "Yes, I need a loan.  I need five million dollars."  The guy said, "Come see me tomorrow."  Percy went to see him, he got his money, and now he's in control of a large number of radio stations, unless he sold them to Clear Channel or someone.  And I said to myself, hearing him recount that story, supposing that the thirty-fifth time Percy said, "Oh, I'm black.  I ain't gonna get the money," or "Is any crack around?" or "Can I get a shot of heroin?"  "Give me some marijuana."  "I'm gonna be an alcoholic, I'm dropping out."  But what's in a person character that causes them to continue to persevere, to continue to strive for a goal and objective that they want to accomplish?  And that's the thing about America, about the United States, that makes it an appealing country for most people, is that here you can be anything you want to be.  But you got to have the will to become that person to go seek that thing that you want to seek.  Like in the recent story about Chris Gardner in the "Pursuit of Happyness."  I mean, here he is, he's got this job, he's got this opportunity to become a stockbroker, but the condition is, he has to work for six months, and--but he has the--without pay--he has the perseverance to be homeless for six months and to study, you know, under whatever conditions exist, because he wants to become a stockbroker.  You have to pay a price sometimes to reach your objective.  And in the U.S., if you stick to it, sometimes you can get--you can make it; sometimes you won't, 'cause one thing is that if you have luck, you got to be prepared to take advantage of your luck.  So that would mean that you have to prepare to realize your dreams.  Like Dr. [Benjamin E.] Mays used to say at Morehouse [College in Atlanta, Georgia], that the worse thing is not having a dream that you don't reach, but it's not having any dream at all, you know.  And America is a devilish place.  We've been here a long time, and we're still surviving.  Our share of the national gross product is probably pretty close to what it was over 100 years ago, one half of one percent.  I think they say that we controlled about 600, $700 billion.  But the national product is in the trillions (laughs).  But, you know, everything is relative.  But there's more money in the African American community now than ever before.  There's more savings in the African community, African American community than ever before.  And there're more people living well in retirement now who are African American than ever before.  There's more job opportunity in America for African Americans now.  There's more opportunities for enterprise in America now for African Americans than ever before.  But you have to be prepared to take advantage of it.  And preparedness is something that you have control over.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, likewise, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't like to think of legacies, all right, 'cause that's just somebody who is not doing it is dead.  And, you know, everybody probably is gonna die.  So that's a--that's guaranteed.  So if I have a legacy, I'll have one.  If I don't, I won't.  But I think that the most meaningful legacy, if you can call legacy, is being a parent.  I would not like to be a 75-year-old African American man without any children.  I think I would find like rather empty if that were the case.  You know, I like to see--have some grandchildren to see that, you know, things may go on after my set of children, 'cause I'm an only child, and I did all I could to honor my ancestors, my parents, by having three children.  And so I hope that my children will, you know, at some point in life have some children.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, well, tell us about your children.  You got three.  Right?
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, our oldest daughter is Grace, and she is a Registered Nurse and Nurse Practitioner.  And she works as a Clinical Specialist in San Francisco with Brown & Toland.  And when--I had never thought about children until Grace was born.  And I wasn't at the hospital when she was born.  They called me and said that--the doctor called me and said, "You have a beautiful daughter."  I went down to the hospital, and I went down and I saw this child there in the nursery close to her mom [HM Jane Bond Moore], and she was just so gorgeous, like the most beautiful piece of fried chicken I'd ever seen in my life, you know, with this curly black hair.  I'd never seen anything like that in my life.  And for the first six months of her life, she was with us all the time.  And I remember when Jane said that she couldn't sleep in our bed anymore, I got mad because I thought, you know, she shouldn't be put in a crib by herself in the adjoining room, you know.  But Jane had her way.  You know, I can understand that.  Then the next kid was Constance.  And Constance was a--and Grace was--only weighed about six pounds, little over six pounds, and she's real heavy now.  She needs to work on that.  And Constance, the second dear girl, she was named after Constance Baker Motley.  Grace is named after Jane's godmother, whose name is Grace.  And Constance weighed about seven pounds plus, and she's very thin now.  And she's an art--elementary art school teacher here in the Bay Area [California]; an artist and a curator.  And Kojo, he's our youngest child.  He's a lawyer.  And he works in Fresno [California] as a public defender.  And when Kojo was born, I never will forget it.  I took the girls out to see Kojo at the hospital.  And soon as we came out of the room, out of the nursery where Kojo was, Constance turned to Grace and started crying and exclaiming "Oh, baby brother is ugly."  And Kojo had a purple mark on his forehead, he was all white and everything.  But he's grown up to be a handsome young man, and a very good kid with a big heart, a very generous heart.  He will not only give someone what he has, he'll give them what you have (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so in terms of, you know, being education people and having worthwhile professions and undertaken them. I'm very, very proud of my kids and very satisfied with them.  I just hope they go to the next stages as they take it up to the next level (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I haven't asked you, you think we need to talk about before I ask my--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I sure have.  Sure.  As soon as I take this mic off, I'll think about it.  But right now, we've--been a pretty long day, and I appreciate this opportunity.  And I guess this will be seen by people after I'm not here on the planet anymore.
Speaker 1: That's our hope, that it, that these will last a long time.
Speaker 2: And I hope I'm here a long time.  So maybe you--the taped fades some (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different:  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I don't really think much of that either.  I hope that I am remembered.  And if people do remember me, I hope they remember me as a generous and thoughtful, considerate person.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you, sir.
Speaker 2: Thank you--(unclear)--.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Good.

Speaker 1: Picture of my mom [Bessie Sims Moore].  That was taken about 1965.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  All right.  Ready.
Speaker 1: And that's a picture of my father [Howard Moore, Sr.].  And it was taken sometime between 1936 and 1943, and in a suit that my father made.  And that's a picture--a posed picture in a studio.  It was a Sunday photographer.  That was common in that period of time.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  And what's the letter?
Speaker 1: The letter is a letter to my mom dated December 6, 1961, to share with her the news that Mr. [Donald L.] Hollowell had called me and told me I had passed the Georgia Bar, and I'd be coming home soon.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  That's exciting.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
