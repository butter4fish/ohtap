Speaker 1: I'm [HistoryMaker] Harriette Cole, I'm the vide- (laughter) what am I?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm the interviewer for today's HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] interview.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Today is October 27th, 2016, we're at Skadden, Arps [Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP] at 4 Times Square in New York City [New York, New York] and we are interve- interviewing The Honorable Ronald L. Ellis.  I would like for you, please, to say and spell your name and tell us your birth date.
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Ronald L. Ellis, the L stands for Louis, L-O-U-I-S, first name Ronald, R-O-N-A-L-D.  I was born on July 4th, 1950.
Speaker 1: July 4th (laughter). And what do you do?
Speaker 2: I am currently a United States magistrate judge in the Southern District of New York [U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]--that's in Manhattan [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Excellent.
Story_ID: 654301
Speaker 1: So we're going to start with some, what we call People magazine type questions.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Food?
Speaker 2: I actually don't, do not have a favorite food.  I like, I like so many different kinds but unlike some people, I just, I just never had a favorite.  I just, I, maybe it's just because, I think eating is such, if you can just eat, that's good enough.  Being fussy, growing up, wouldn't have gotten me fed.
Speaker 1: So, just no favorite?
Speaker 2: No favorite.
Speaker 1: Time of year?
Speaker 2: Spring.
Speaker 1: Vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Although my wife [Kathleen Ellis] won't particularly like this, my favorite destination is home (laughter).  I'm a home- I'm a home person, but I live in New York [New York] so I like to, what I like to do is to explore New York because there's so much that really, you can see and do and so I'm still trying to, after so many years, still trying to see so many of the sights in New York.
Speaker 1: Right.  And do you have a favorite saying or phrase?
Speaker 2: Do the right thing.
Speaker 1: Befitting of a judge.
Story_ID: 654302
Speaker 1: I'd like to talk about your family and your family, family history, and let's start with your mother.  If you tell me her name, (cough) pardon me, her birth date and where she's from; about her.
Speaker 2: Okay, my mother was born Ella Mae Moore [Ella Moore Ellis] and she was born June 14, 1929, I know in Louisiana, I'm not exactly sure where, I mean, I have it in the records--
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) but, and she, she was a housewife, domestic, beautician, she, she did a number of different things.  She was the oldest of thirteen children and as that, she was looked to as the, sort of the, the center of her family in that generation, but when I was growing up in, in Louisiana, she was, I mean, very few opportunities for a black woman and so she did mostly domestic work.  She learned how to do people's hair and that was a way that she supplemented the income of the family.
Speaker 1: Did she have a beauty shop or it was just by appointment?
Speaker 2: It was just, just in the home.
Speaker 1: In, in the home.
Speaker 2: She, she didn't work in any beauty shops as far as I know.
Speaker 1: People came to the house to get their hair done regularly?
Speaker 2: People came to the house.  I remember, you know, on the, on the stove with, with those hot curling irons and, and people sitting there and her going through the hair. And so, but that was it.  It was like ad hoc.
Speaker 1: And that smell.  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I remember the, I remember the smell of the hair and the, and the, I guess the chemicals and, you know, it, it was one of those things that it's hard to forget.
Speaker 1: Sure.  And your mother's parents, who were they?
Speaker 2: Well, my--I did get to know them a little bit.  Her father's name was John Moore [John Moore, Sr.] and her mother was Ellen Hampton [Ellen Hampton Moore] and, I got to know them only because in the, in the little place that we grew up, the grandparents' house, for me, the grandparents, that was the center.  And so, many of her siblings were both at home and came to visit.  And so, I, but I can't really tell you that much about them as, you know--
Speaker 1: Do you know what their work was?
Speaker 2: I don't.  I think I was eleven when I left and, you know, you don't pay so much attention back then.
Speaker 1: And, and how far back can you trace your mother's family?
Speaker 2: I, I think one level beyond the--
Speaker 1: Grandparents?
Speaker 2: The grandparents.  We, when everybody was trying to figure out their roots, we started asking about, you know, who, who was the generation before that.  I think, unfortunately, because my mother passed away so young and she would have been the best person to talk to, we never really got to ask beyond that.
Speaker 1: How old was your mother when she passed?
Speaker 2: Fifty-one.
Speaker 1: And, and her siblings.  What did your mother's siblings do?
Speaker 2: Oh, they did, they did various things.  You know when you have twelve aunts and uncles, the one, the only ones I really remember are, there're a couple of who came up to New York [New York] for a period of time.  One worked in the federal government, the VA hospital.  A number of them were actually contemporaries of mine because we had, she had siblings who were of the same age as her children and I didn't really follow what, with what happened to them after I left Louisiana.
Speaker 1: The, the place where she lived in Louisiana, was it in a city?  Was it in a rural area?
Speaker 2: Well, I was born in a place called Lafourche Crossing, which is a bayou crossing and that's where the grandparents' home was and it was rural.  I remember not many homes but a lot of crops and fields.  It--less than two hundred people in the--
Speaker 1: In the town?
Speaker 2: --in the town.
Speaker 1: Was it called a town?
Speaker 2: It was just called Lafourche Crossing.
Speaker 1: Crossing, the crossing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it, it was, it was a railroad track across the bayou and on either side of the bayou there were, there were little settlements and so that's what that was all about. So, it's hard to get more rural than places where, on one side, I think, maybe there may have been fifty families and the other side, probably about the same.
Speaker 1: And w- thi- was this an all-black community?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: On both sides of the railroad?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 654303
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father?
Speaker 2: Okay, my father was the youngest of nine and he--
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: Herman Ellis [Herman Ellis, Sr.], H-E-R-M-A-N. And he had the misfortune that his mother passed away soon after he was born.  I think he maybe was, been one or two and so he did not have the benefit of having a mother's influence. And being the youngest child of nine, he, I think he learned to fend for himself and so he had a certain toughness about him. And the other thing is while we, we saw his family a little bit, there's a differ- part of it, I guess, is being, you see more of the mother's family because we got to know more of those aunts and uncles, we got to see them more.  We, we met his family on occasion but as the youngest, so many of his brothers were just older, brothers and sister, and, and so there wasn't as much family gatherings that involved them, you know, funeral every now and then.
Speaker 1: Do you know what his parents [Jeanetta Ellis and Samuel Ellis] did?
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: And do you know anything about the generations before him?
Speaker 2: I do not.
Speaker 1: Okay, where was he from?
Speaker 2: He was also from Louisiana, one of those towns around Lafourche Crossing.  I think it was Houma [Louisiana].  There were a couple of places.  I have this only because I can look up in my family tree maker but I know it's either Houma or Raceland [Louisiana] which are towns, maybe about twelve to fifteen thousand people.  So, those would have been the big--
Speaker 1: They were bigger?
Speaker 2: --the big place that you go to.  And then my family actually moved to a bigger city, too.  We--
Speaker 1: And what was that?
Speaker 2: It's called Thibodaux, T-H-I--T-H-I-B-O-D-A-U-X.  It was actually a parish seat [of Lafourche Parish] in Louisiana.  Again, we're talking about some place where the, it's in the, in the teens; seventeen, twenty thousand people.
Speaker 1: So it's still small a town?
Speaker 2: It's still small.
Speaker 1: But huge compared to where you were?
Speaker 2: Yes, and, you know, with paved streets and boulevards so that--
Speaker 1: Okay, and when was your father born?
Speaker 2: He was born August 10, 1929.
Story_ID: 654304
Speaker 1: In the--well let me ask you this.  What--do you know how your parents [Ella Moore Ellis and Herman Ellis, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: No, I think we were from an era people didn't talk. (Laughter) You know, we, when we asked them questions, they didn't talk that much about the Louisiana experience so I, I don't have a story on how they met.
Speaker 1: Did they marry young?
Speaker 2: Well, for back then, not so young, but they were about twenty, each of them was about twenty.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Um-hm. And how many children did they have?
Speaker 2: Five children.
Speaker 1: And where are you in the birth order?
Speaker 2: I'm number two.
Speaker 1: Number two.
Story_ID: 654305
Speaker 1: And so, if you go back to your early childhood, what is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the earliest thing I remember is I was always sick (laughter).
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I was, I was one of those sickly children.  I had--if--I had all the common childhood diseases, you know, chicken pox and mumps and measles.  I had, and they said I had polio and--
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: --and one of my legs was a little shorter than the other.  I had scarlet fever which apparently was touch and go.  I remember my mother [Ella Moore Ellis] giving me alcohol bath to try to break the fever.  I remember being in a hospital and--
Speaker 1: And what age were you when these things are happening?
Speaker 2: I, well I, I, probably about six or seven.
Speaker 1: Do you remember having polio?
Speaker 2: I don't.  I just remember people talking about that.  I had trouble with my, my legs and, and I wore special shoes.  I do remember the, the scarlet fever only because being in a hospital was an interesting thing for a--
Speaker 1: A young child (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) a little kid.  I--
Speaker 1: And what town were you in when--
Speaker 2: This, this was in Thibodaux [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: So, Thibodaux had a hospital?
Speaker 2: No, actually I was in a hospital in New Orleans [Louisiana], that's my recollection.
Speaker 1: And New Orleans would be how far away from Thibodaux?
Speaker 2: About sixty miles.
Speaker 1: So when you were in the hospital, did your mother stay there with you?
Speaker 2: I assume she did.  I mean, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You don't really remember.
Speaker 2: I was, you know, you're in a ward and, I mean, she was not in my room the whole time like you might be able to do now but she always seemed to be there when I remember.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh. So being sick like that, I mean, these are real illnesses.  Were you afraid as a child?
Speaker 2: Not--I don't recall being afraid.  I, I think, you know, being young you don't, you don't think about mortality so much.  I, I think, I just remember people always paying attention to me (laughter).
Speaker 1: That part was good?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, I think that's--but, and, and nobody ever told you anything about how serious anything was.  So, nobody would sit down and say, "Well you know, it's a very serious illness."  They would just say, "We need to do this," so it was just matter of fact.  Kids didn't know very much back then.
Speaker 1: Did your sickliness affect your school, school work?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I mean, I don't know how much time I missed--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --but I did well in school, so.
Story_ID: 654306
Speaker 1: And where did you go to school?
Speaker 2: When I was in Louisiana, we went to a Catholic school, St. Luke's [St. Luke School].  My parents [Ella Moore Ellis and Herman Ellis, Sr.] were not Catholic but they, they made the decision to send us to that school because they thought it would be good for our education and they believed in education.
Speaker 1: And it was in Thibodaux [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: It was in Thibodaux, and was all black, of course.
Speaker 1: And this was, how far did the school go?
Speaker 2: It, it went up to eighth grade, elementary.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 654307
Speaker 1: So going back to your early days, if you think about, you know, where you grew up--well tell me, when did you leave the, this la- Lafourche [Lafourche Crossing, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Lafourche?  I was, I was too small to remember that, it was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but it's before we started school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so then in Thibodaux, in your home, your neighborhood where you're growing up, what are the sights, sounds and smells that you remember as a kid?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember we had a backyard, which I, I didn't think that was--I mean, everybody around us had yards and they had houses and, you know, running through the grass and the fences and, and barefoot and there was a, there was a, I guess it's not--a ditch, we had a ditch that ran along the property, not just our property but through the neighborhood.  I remember that body of water, so to speak, as integral to our environment and--
Speaker 1: Did you ever get in that water?
Speaker 2: Well we, it wasn't, it was more like a little creek and you could jump over it and I remember going over it but nobody would go in it.  It would swell when there was a hurricane or something like that but, you know, I, I do remember the, every home seemed to be fenced, everybody had their yard fenced.  It was very quiet and so the sounds that we had were not, not traffic sounds but the night sounds in the country and--
Speaker 1: What, what animals were there?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I remember dogs.  I don't remember in the neighborhood any, any particular animals, maybe I was just not paying so much attention.  I mean, people had dogs, and I remember that, but I don't remember other animals, not in the neighborhood.  So, I just don't have a memory of animals (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's okay.
Story_ID: 654308
Speaker 1: What did you and your siblings like to do when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you spent time together?
Speaker 2: Well we have to separate that between, in the Louisiana time.  I think what we--
Speaker 1: (Cough) Excuse me.
Speaker 2: --what we like to do is to go out in, in non-school days, go out and just run around the neighborhood.  Even though we had our little yard, I mean, mostly as a, as a group, we would just, just, just disappear into the neighborhood. And it's mostly the three older ones.  As it--we had--my older brother [Herman Ellis, Jr.] and my, the one below me [Larry Ellis], we, we were, we were born on successive years, '49 [1949], '50 [1950] and '51 [1951] and so we hung out more.  The younger ones were actually too young for, to, for me to remember them doing much in Louisiana because we moved the, the baby girl [Lenora Ellis Shea] had just been born and the youngest boy [Dudley Ellis]--we had four boys, and then a little girl. And the youngest boy, he was, let's see, how many years different?  Well, it was, it was three years but it seemed like a large difference now that I think about it.  So the three older ones hung out more; and the little one, he just wasn't part of the action.
Story_ID: 654309
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: I, I was an excellent student.  I, I was the top of my class and, and so--
Speaker 1: From elementary [St. Luke School, Thibodaux, Louisiana] all the way up?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what was it about your growing up or you that made you so studious?
Speaker 2: I'm a curious person.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I, I was always reading things, always looking up things and I hate not knowing.  You know, if, if somebody mentioned something I didn't know, it would gnaw at me and I'd want to find out what it was.  If I heard a name or somebody told me, for example, what their father did, you could be sure that I'm going to go look it up, that kind of thing.  So, I'm not sure why I was curious but--
Speaker 1: Looking it up as a child when you were growing up, where were you looking?
Speaker 2: Well, I know we had a dictionary in Louisiana because that's where I, that's where I would get most of my information.  I suspect that was probably not usual but, you know, if people mention a word and it's, you know, just go look it up.  And so it, it was a way of knowing things and once, and once you have a personality where people recognize something, it, then it starts to feed itself and one when you're young, it's always good to have something that people say, well, he's that one, and it's not so bad for them to say, he's the, the smart one.  And so, I, I just, I might actually be a little bit compulsive when it comes to finding information.  That is, if I get onto a topic, I like to exhaust it.  It's a good thing we didn't have the Internet when I was young because I'd probably be still looking up things because one thing would lead to another. But that was it, and I--I really like information.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 654310
Speaker 1: Now in Louisiana, when you were growing up, this is during, obviously, segregation.  What was your experience, you know, across the racial divide?
Speaker 2: You know there--I, I guess the biggest thing for us is that we were pretty much insular.  I mean, we would, we would take a bus to school [St. Luke School, Thibodaux, Louisiana] so we would pass through different neighborhoods, literally across the tracks, go into, we were just outside the main part of the city and we would--
Speaker 1: Where you lived?
Speaker 2: Where we lived, and we'd take a bus into the, the center of Thibodaux [Louisiana] where the school was.  Wasn't, wasn't much talk about race.  Wasn't much talk about mixing.  There was no talk about integration.  We, we were in our area and I think the only person who really experienced the, the racial issues was my father [Herman Ellis, Sr.] because he was working in a place where there were people of, black and white. But the kids, we didn't, we didn't even have the experience of some people where, I think people said they had, when they were younger, they'd have some white kids that they would play with.  We didn't really have that experience.
Speaker 1: Were there people of any other cultures that you'd play with 'cause Louisiana was somewhat of a melting pot of cultures?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, there were, in the school, there were some cultural mixing because we'd have some Creole but I don't recall in my neighborhood.  If, if I knew then what I knew now, I would have probably been more cognizant of those things but--
Speaker 1: So in your school, that there were Creoles in the school.  Did--was there, did you think there was a difference between you and them or did it feel that you were part of the same culture?
Speaker 2: No, I think we all thought of each other as the same.  I mean, you know, I guess kids, kids would pair up into groups but it wasn't along any particular lines.  I think my experience was that kids paired up along the lines of, for example, the kids who had the same interests, the kids who were supposed to be the smart kids--pretty much what happened in the schools.
Story_ID: 654311
Speaker 1: Did your father [Herman Ellis, Sr.] share any stories of racial incidents?
Speaker 2: Well, (pause) not racial violence, although what ultimately precipitated him leaving Louisiana and bringing us is that he was, he was, he's very much mechanically inclined and he, he, you know, if there was some kind of machine, he could run it.  If--he could work on cars.  He could--but in Louisiana, he was always a common laborer. And, and what, what he found out was that, although he was training people on machinery and, and doing a lot of different work, the way he tells the story, there was a young white man who, who let the cat out of the bag about how little he was making compared to those people and--
Speaker 1: At the same job?
Speaker 2: Yes, and actually, he prob- a lesser job because, you know, although my father was doing various jobs in the, in the factory, I guess sugar cane factory, he, he was just paid as a laborer and that's when he decided he would leave and, I mean, so it wasn't, it wasn't the kind of thing where anybody threatened him or made comments, it was just, you know, just not being valued. And so he decided he was going to be part of that migration up north.
Speaker 1: And so the migration at that time, a lot of people were leaving--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and, and going north for opportunity.  Did your father talk about that?  Did you hear other people talking about the move?  Did, did you even notice that people in your neighborhood were moving?
Speaker 2: No. You know, we're from the era when my father said, this is what we're doing, this is what we did--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, there were, you know it's not we sit down, here's why we're doing this and, you know, he left on his own first so it wasn't as if we all packed up and left.  And so, actually, we, we left in three parts.  My father left, he, he got somewhat settled up in New York [New York], then he sent for my mother [Ella Moore Ellis] and the, the three younger children and left me and my older brother [Herman Ellis, Jr.] in Louisiana because--
Speaker 1: With whom?
Speaker 2: With one of her sisters.  And so we stayed for a number of months more and, and then we had to come up on our own.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: So that was, that was one of those adventures.
Story_ID: 654312
Speaker 1: Your family was heading to New York [New York]; and you, you and your older brother [Herman Ellis, Jr.]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --were left.  So what did you do during that time when you were there with your family, by yourself, independent kind of?
Speaker 2: Well, I think my mother's sister says, "You really want to take these boys and bring 'em with you."  I think we were enjoying our freedom, if we could put it that way, and--
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: Well, I was eleven and he was thirteen.  So, we, we, we didn't check in regularly.  So weekends were a time when I think our aunt was a little bit concerned about keeping up with us.
Speaker 1: And we'll leave it at that (laughter).  So, when you moved to New York City, where were you living?
Speaker 2: We're living in Harlem [New York, New York] on the south part, 112th Street and what was 8th Avenue [Frederick Douglass Boulevard] then.
Speaker 1: And what was that neighborhood like at that time?
Speaker 2: It, it had issues.  There, there was crime.  There were addicts sometimes in the, in the hallway.
Speaker 1: What year, what year are we talking about?
Speaker 2: We moved in '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: So then this is what, heroin?
Speaker 2: Yes, at least, based on my recollection, the symptoms.
Speaker 1: And had you ever seen that before?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Well you were coming from a very small town [Thibodaux, Louisiana] to the big city?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So your experience of the, what you saw, what you witnessed, what, at eleven years old, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes that's--although I turned twelve that year--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but, actually the thing I remember most wasn't so much that but my father's [Herman Ellis, Sr.] reaction to it because he, he took on the landlord because the landlord wouldn't keep the front door lock fixed, and, you know, wouldn't keep the place safe so he fixed the lock and then, as far as I can tell, then took the landlord to court and prevailed. But his idea was, you know, he wouldn't tolerate them not doing what they were supposed to do.  And so, he was a, he was a self starter.
Speaker 1: And how did that make you feel?
Speaker 2: Well, probably better as I look back on it than when, when it was happening because, you know, my father was a strong personality and him doing things just seemed to be that's the way my father is.  My parents were pretty strong personalities that way.  When they--for example, a story about my mother [Ella Moore Ellis], for example.  When we moved from Louisiana, they wanted to put us all back a grade.  And so when my mother heard this, she marched down to the school [St. Thomas the Apostle School, New York, New York] and said, "Well, my kids are smart, just give them a chance, don't put them back."  And so, they put us in the grade that was equivalent to our age as opposed to just accepting it.  And so--
Speaker 1: There was assumption based on your coming from the South?
Speaker 2: That--yes.  And so, you know, they're both that kind of personality.  When they felt something strongly, then they would do something about it.  So, so it's the kind of thing where, I think, I appreciated those stories more when I was older than when I was younger.
Speaker 1: So you grew up in 112th and 8th, in an apartment building?
Speaker 2: Yes, a five floor walkup.
Speaker 1: And what floor were you on?
Speaker 2: Fifth floor.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Of course (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Of course.
Story_ID: 654313
Speaker 1: What school did you go to?
Speaker 2: I went to another Catholic school, St. Thomas the Apostle [St. Thomas the Apostle School]. That was in like, Herns- 18th Street [118th Street] in Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: So your parents always had you in a private school?  That's a--
Speaker 2: They had us in Catholic schools, yes.
Speaker 1: Catholic school, uh-huh, and with five children, you mean, even though Catholic school's not as expensive as traditional private schools, it's still, it's not free?
Speaker 2: That's correct and, in fact, the--if you heard the numbers today about what it costs, you would say, wow, that's, that's nothing but, no, they, they worked hard to keep us in those schools in part because, you know, it worked and they believed in education.  I think they always were concerned that they didn't have an education.  They, obviously, didn't want us to not have opportunities, and I think, I don't remember a time when my father [Herman Ellis, Sr.] didn't have multiple jobs and, you know, and my mother [Ella Moore Ellis] knew how to handle money and so they, I don't know what miracles they worked but they kept us through the, the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Did they ever talk about why they chose Catholic schools?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Not really.  I know that when, when they were, when they were making the decision to send us to school, the, the Catholic school they had heard about and they, they determined that was the best option for us but I don't know exactly what was going through their mind.  Again, we're not a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A lot of families choose Catholic schools--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and, and what faith did you grow up in?
Speaker 2: My, my parents were Baptist and the children were both.  We, we were, we were Baptist and then I think all of us then were baptized as Catholics but, later, not when we were younger.  I think we're all in, we're in New York [New York] when that happened, so--but growing up, we, we actually went to the Baptist church and the Catholic church.  So I guess parents didn't think it was bad to go to two churches.
Story_ID: 654314
Speaker 1: And then you went to Cardinal Spellman High School--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --in the Bronx [New York]--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) which was a very, was and is a very highly regarded high school.  Did you--how--was that just a natural progression?  How did your family know about that school?
Speaker 2: It, well, the religious order that was at St. Thomas the Apostle [St. Thomas the Apostle School, New York, New York] also had a big presence at Cardinal Spellman. And they, they wanted to keep the ones that they wanted and so they, they had suggested Cardinal Spellman and, you know, it seemed like--well, for me, it was a little bit different because my brother [Herman Ellis, Jr.] was actually there and so I had the advantage of my brother and there were a couple of the students from St. Thomas who were, the academic students who had also chosen that so it seemed like a reasonable choice.
Speaker 1: And this was an integrated school?
Speaker 2: Integrated, yes.  This was our first experience with a school that wasn't all black--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and then we went from being all black to being a real minority.
Speaker 1: Right, so what, what was the ethnic composition, demographics there?
Speaker 2: Italian, Irish, I'd say, 95 percent split between those and we, we made up about, I don't know, a half of a percent of the black students.  It was--we might have dipped into double digits in the school that was, let's see.  Yeah, we had, we had over two hundred students in our class and we didn't, you know, my math is a little, maybe more about 5 percent, maybe ten out of two hundred would be about the ratio.
Speaker 1: And so, this for you is culture shock, completely different experience?
Speaker 2: Yes. Again, I had the advantage of my brother being there and the, I had the advantage of my ego.
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: Well, well it was one of those odd kinds of situations where, before I got to Spellman, the Catholic schools had had a competition, a mental arithmetic contest and it involved students from all of the elementary schools in the, in the city and I had placed first on that and so some of the students actually had remembered that.  And so I go into the school with sort of a reputation.
Story_ID: 654315
Speaker 1: People--you know, their culture was not--pe- people didn't really talk about culture as such because school, there's school culture and a school culture centered around clubs and things that you do and so the athletes are a club.  The, the chess people are a club and so the, it's not the same, you know, what happens at the school is different from what happened when we go back home.  And so it was a culture shock only when you actually started to talk about things that were outside the school environment and so so much of what happened at school was really about school and as long as you were with your affinity group in the school [Cardinal Spellman High School, Bronx, New York], things seemed to go along pretty well.  There were not a lot of deep discussions.  I think the first time we had an issue is, one of my best friends had run for student council president and then we'd heard some ugly stuff but--
Speaker 2: What do you mean?
Speaker 1: You know, racial comments about--
Speaker 2: And this friend was black?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And, you know, I said, things go along well as long as you don't talk about it.  And so, I said, the athletes, you know, as long as they're running, they're fine.  The people in the math club, as long as they're doing math, it's fine.  I was in forensics, among other things, you know, you talk about the speeches you're making and, and so, you know, during the school day, you're really not having the clash of cultures that you would otherwise have and so you go home and then you, you know, you're in a different environment.  I mean, maybe it was compartmentalizing but you certainly wouldn't have any serious conversations in, in the school environment.
Speaker 2: And what were the years that you were there?
Speaker 1: Sixty-four [1964] to '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: So this is a volatile time in the country--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --including the assassination of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  How was the student body affected by what's going on in the nation?
Speaker 1: Well, I think that was just shock.  I mean, it, it didn't, it didn't translate into people having deep discussions.  I think we, we had, you know, we had a number of things that were happening.  For my senior class, for example, it was the same year that Cardinal Spellman [Francis Spellman] had died.  We had a member of the senior class had died, you know, and this guy, Dr. King, it's like there were just so many--'68 [1968] was just a really volatile year in that regard.
Story_ID: 654316
Speaker 1: But through the whole time that you were in high school [Cardinal Spellman High School, Bronx, New York], it was a volatile time--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in terms of civil unrest in the country.  Were you talking about that at home?  You know, were the activities of civil unrest part of the conversation?
Speaker 2: Oddly enough, I think we had more conversations about Malcolm X and the Black Muslims [Nation of Islam] in the neighborhood than we had about civil rights as a whole.
Speaker 1: Okay, well Malcolm X had a big presence in Harlem [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes, and, I mean, that dominated more of the discussion.  You know, people, you know, giving you, Muhammad Speaks [Muslim Journal] and, I mean, I think the, the discussions more, were not so much about civil rights as about, you know, empowerment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so it's, it's, I think it's what dominated, you know, you're in a fourteen to eighteen age group, you know, you're, you're really discussing, you're sort of figuring out who you are, you're going into manhood, and I think there were probably more discussions about just where you fit in as a black male in the society and, you know, discussions about conspiracy to destroy black boys were the kind of things that people were talking about. But not specifically about voting rights and civil rights.
Speaker 1: So that was more what the elders were talking about, maybe?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But for you as a coming of age young man, it was empowerment?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And did you ever see Malcolm X?
Speaker 2: Yes. In, you know, he, he would--because he was around, not too, not too, not for prolonged periods of time but, you know, he would, he was a definite presence.
Speaker 1: And when he--you know, there's stories of him, you know, the most famous of Lenox [Lenox Avenue; Malcolm X Boulevard] and 125th Street on his soapbox and everybody is gathering, but typically he, when you would see him, was he drawing a big crowd?
Speaker 2: Yes, there was always a crowd around him.  I wasn't particularly drawn to crowds at that point but, you know, you're still working things out so, but I, I think, people probably in my group, more reacting to the fact that, you know, you, you, with the presence and the seeing the men who were dressed a certain way, trying to get you to, to take a look at the writings and I would say that, for me, part of the issue was that I was, my awareness needed a little bit more developing.
Speaker 1: Which happened over time?
Speaker 2: Yes.  You know, I think, as I got into broader surroundings, as I got to meet people and more of the majority group and hear what people were saying and to start to process that, some of what happened for me was, taking experiences and then going back and reevaluating things and, and people.
Story_ID: 654317
Speaker 1: When you finished high school, where did you go to college?
Speaker 2: Manhattan College.
Speaker 1: And that's, was also in the Bronx [New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And how did you choose that school?
Speaker 2: Well, a lot of people from Spellman [Cardinal Spellman High School, Bronx, New York] were going to Manhattan College and--
Speaker 1: Because it's also a Catholic college?
Speaker 2: Yes. And originally I was, I had a, I wanted to be an engineering student and I, and I recall I applied to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Manhattan and one other school, which I can't remember right now. And I originally was, I originally decided I was going to go to Harvard and they--I went up to talk about financial aid and they, they didn't really seem all that enthused about financial aid.  And so, I, I said, well, let--Manhattan offered me tuition, room and board and, you know, you shouldn't make decisions based strictly on money, I know that.  And so people would say, "Well would you have made the same decision going, if you had to make it again knowing the advantage is going to an Ivy League school?" And I said, "Well, if I hadn't gone to Manhattan, I might not have met my wife [Kathleen Ellis], so, it's a no brainer at this point." But, I mean, Manhattan also had a good reputation for engineering because the undergraduates at Manhattan would be interacting with doctoral professors and sometimes in the big universities, you actually have doctoral students teaching and that was sort of, in my research, I determined that, you know, let's have the, let's deal with the actual professors rather than the graduate students and, of course, I never thought any of these things would necessarily hold me back, so--
Speaker 1: And deciding to be an engineering major, what, when was it that that became your point of focus?
Speaker 2: Well, during--I was very good at math and very good at science and so that was, that was, that seemed like not a bad thing to do and I also had, what I liked about engineering was that it wasn't subjective and by this time, I had gotten to the point of not being thrilled about subjectivity and, you know, you hear stories about people writing a paper and some teacher thinks it's a C and some teacher thinks it's an A, and I wanted to be more in control because in engineering, it's either right or it's wrong, typically.  And so I was good at it, I figured I had a better shot at not having anyone else control my destiny.  And so I combined those things, I said, well you know, engineering seems like a, something where you could do and you could get a job afterwards too, you know, you'd have a profession.  I was a very practical kind of person.  I like--I guess I like to think I'm still practical but I made a lot of decisions based on practicality and more analytical than probably is warranted.
Story_ID: 654318
Speaker 1: Well, so you got your degree in engineering and then did not go directly into that, you went to law school--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --immediately thereafter, right?
Speaker 2: Immediately.  I actually graduated early from, from college so I had nine months where I was working as a computer programmer, analyst.
Speaker 1: And so, and this is in what year?
Speaker 2: Six- '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Okay, so being a computer programmer analyst, that's at the beginning of that?
Speaker 2: Well, I decided to go to law school before this happened.  In, with all the turmoil that's happening in the country and, you know, seeing some injustice, I really thought I was going to be a great criminal lawyer and I was going to go and defend people.  And so I had this notion that people were being unjustly convicted and if they had a good attorney they could get, they could get better outcomes.  So, you know, I guess there were some TV shows that I looked at and the idea of, you know, winning a criminal case seemed like, wow, that's really cool, somebody could keep them out of jail.  And so, I had decided that I wanted to be a lawyer. And as these things happen, I had, I had actually decided I wanted to go to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and I took a course at a school called Mount Saint Vincent [College of Mount Saint Vincent, Bronx, New York] because I, I had finished my engineering classes, so this is like '71 [1971] in the fall, and I'm taking a course in American constitutional history and there's a professor there and he hears that I'm going to law school and he says, "You know, if you want to do public interest, there's this program at NYU [New York University School of Law, New York, New York] where, you know, you can get a scholarship and you can do public interest work and it was called a Root-Tilden [Root-Tilden-Kern Public Interest Scholarship] program."  And so I, I applied for that program and so that's how--you know, engineering, while I'm, while I was good at math and I was good at science, what I really think I'm good at is people. And so I didn't really want something that was going to be in a lab or being in a, in, confined to, you know, dealing with machines and computers and programming.  And so, I, I decided that I wanted to be a, as a criminal defense lawyer but with the civil rights things happening and I said, well, you know, I'll try this program.
Speaker 1: Well, I was going to ask, so your decision, your interest in liberating people as a criminal lawyer, was--did that grow out of your observation of what was happening in the community?
Speaker 2: Yes, you know, you, you know seeing, you know, people who are caught up in the criminal justice system and the only solution people had was arresting people and putting them in jail and that didn't seem like a good way to deal with the problems and I actually thought people--that there was a whole bunch of people who were just really, just innocent and I think that may have been the movies and the TV.  I've come to realize that it's not strictly speaking, guilt or innocence, it's sometimes people just make bad decisions and whether or not they should spend significant time in jail because they made a bad decision when young people make bad decisions, but as I think I may have intuited the fact that these people shouldn't be going to jail.
Speaker 1: And were you still living in Harlem [New York, New York] at this time?
Speaker 2: For--actually, my parents [Ella Moore Ellis and Herman Ellis, Sr.] had bought a house in the Bronx [New York], South Bronx--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so while I was in college, they had moved.
Speaker 1: Right, 'cause you were on campus.
Speaker 2: I was on campus.
Speaker 1: Where was the campus of Manhattan College?
Speaker 2: It's up in the upper Bronx, they call it Riverdale [Bronx, New York].
Speaker 1: Oh, sure.
Speaker 2: So, I spent four years on campus which, which in retrospect was actually, probably, a good thing to do as opposed to going home and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but, you know, who can pass up a good deal.
Story_ID: 654319
Speaker 1: And so, you make this decision to become a lawyer because you want to be a criminal defense lawyer--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and so the program at NYU [New York University School of Law, New York, New York] is a full scholarship, correct?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is it, again, full scholarship, room and board?
Speaker 2: Not at that time.  It was just, my tuition wound up being paid.
Speaker 1: And did you stay on campus?
Speaker 2: They did have housing for, I was married actually.  I got married in August of--and I started school in September.
Speaker 1: So you got married, so you met your wife at Manhattan College [Bronx, New York], you said, right?
Speaker 2: Well, while I was at Manhattan College, yes.
Speaker 1: Was she in school there?
Speaker 2: She was, she was at a small institution in Yonkers [New York] called Elizabeth Seton College.
Speaker 1: Oh, sure. And what's her name?
Speaker 2: Kathleen [Kathleen Ellis], with a K.
Speaker 1: And what was she studying?
Speaker 2: She was, she was lit- what was it?  English literature.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then she went on to library science, so she's a librarian.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you got married, was it your senior year or the year that you were out because you had graduated early?
Speaker 2: Right, so--
Speaker 1: In '72 [1972]?
Speaker 2: Right, so I got married in August and started, August 27th, and I started school, I think, September 6th.
Speaker 1: Wow, and so the two of you then moved into the campus housing?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: So are you now, you're a full time student, are you also working?
Speaker 2: No I'm not.  In my--let's see, no I'm not working during that period of time.  My wife is working and she's also in school.  She's getting her library degree. The two years that--she's got two years to go--no I'm sorry.  She's in, she's finishing up college at Pace University [New York, New York] 'cause Elizabeth Seton was a two year school.  So, she's going to Pace and I'm at NYU, and we're making ends meet.
Story_ID: 654320
Speaker 1: It's a four year program for your law degree [at New York University School of Law, New York, New York], correct?
Speaker 2: Three.
Speaker 1: Three, and when you come out, actually before you come out, 'cause generally you have internships while you're--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --in college.  What did you do as your internships?
Speaker 2: Well, the first internship I did was out in Minnesota.  I did a summer there.  It was a small firm that did criminal defense for Native Americans and African Americans.  So, it was actually a criminal defense.  And so that was my first internship.  The program also had a requirement that you do an internship during your second year and I had gotten the opportunity to work at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.]. And that, that was one of those, I guess it was serendipity because I had not actually sought out the job there and one of the other, someone else in the program had arranged an interview at the Legal Defense Fund but then that wasn't their first choice so they got their first choice and I passed them on one day just at the law school and they said they had an interview at the Legal Defense Fund.  I said I didn't know they had an opening there and so I said, "Well, you know, that sounds interesting." So I looked it up and I said--I mean, you know, despite all the work that the Legal Defense Fund was doing, you know, not necessarily everybody knows who and what they are and how they're different from the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  And so I went, I went for that interview and they, they said, okay, and so I spent my second year, during the school year, going to the Legal Defense Fund every chance I got.
Speaker 1: So it was different than a summer internship, this was during your--
Speaker 2: During the school year.
Speaker 1: --academic school year?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what were you doing?
Speaker 2: Well, interesting enough, they had me drafting legal documents. And, you know, what they call interrogatories, request for production of documents, even a few complaints. And, you know, being supervised, and they said, they--they didn't have a lot of resources and they didn't have a lot of interns back then and I was sort of like it at that point.  So, I was, I was doing a lot of different things for different people who were there.  If they had a little project, research, then I would do that.  And so, I was mainly doing work with the people in employment discrimination but doing other things too and sort of just having a student around during the school year, gives you an opportunity to see people when there's not a lot of bodies around.
Story_ID: 654321
Speaker 1: Who's running the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] at this point?
Speaker 2: Jack Greenberg.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And did you interface with him at all?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was that experience like?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, I think, one of the things that--the biggest lesson I learned from Jack is that you need to combine passion with information. And he tells the story about where, when he was there and Thurgood [Thurgood Marshall] was the director-counsel and he'd gone to Thurgood outraged about something and Thurgood said, "Well why don't you investigate it?" And when he investigated it, he found out that with a little more information he would have taken a different approach. And, but, you know, the, the group that he had assembled, and interacting with him, he, he was, I think he would get input from people and so it was collaborative in that way, but in the end it was clear that he made the decisions.  So, so that was a, that was a model that I thought was a workable one.  It's like, you, you need to be able to listen to many different voices but also be able to accept the responsibility that you make the decisions.
Speaker 1: And this is something you observed in him during this time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 654322
Speaker 1: And what impact did that have on you as it relates to understanding leadership?
Speaker 2: Well, I, as I said, I--I think that, you need to be confident enough to listen to dissident voices but also you have to accept the responsibility that there can't be multiple decisions.  You have to, you have to have the conviction to say, I've heard everything that, the fact that I'm not going along with you doesn't mean I haven't listened to you but, you know, ultimately the responsibility stops with me. And I think it worked really well as a judge because, you know, you have all these talented people working for you as law clerks and they, you know, you, listen to it, you observe everything they--absorb everything that they say but in the end, your name goes on the opinions.  And so I think you--the lesson is that, really if you're, if you have confidence in yourself, you, you're not, you're not afraid of people who are intelligent.  You're not afraid of, I mean, there were, while I was there, they had enormous number of people who were just in their own right, were talented people.  I mean--
Speaker 1: Like who?
Speaker 2: Well, on the staff we had Deval Patrick [HistoryMaker Deval L. Patrick], we had [HistoryMaker] Lani Guinier, we had, we had Peter Sherwood [O. Peter Sherwood], and I'm probably going to forget someone, Bill Robinson [William L. Robinson], Jim Nabrit [James M. Nabrit, Jr.], you know, when you step--
Speaker 1: All these people who went on to have outstanding careers--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, some people--I mean, Jim Nabrit stayed at the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] and was like a, like a voice for a long period of time but, you know, other people went on to, and this was where I, when they give speeches they have a list of people, they don't forget anybody--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --I know I'm forgetting a whole host of people.
Speaker 1: But in bringing up these names, I mean, it, it points to how it could have been difficult to make a decision when you have very smart, capable people giving you their input and yet still it comes down to, to one.
Speaker 2: Yes, and, and, you know, there were times when we had--were really--there were issues that really divided us. And, you know, just because everybody's interested in furthering the humanity and worth of everyone doesn't mean that everybody thinks that's the way to get there is the same, you know, and that's just the people who were on staff.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Because the Legal Defense Fund also had people not on staff who were, who were giving input in, you know, there were, you know, the Derrick Bells [HistoryMaker Derrick A. Bell, Jr.] of the world where, you know, it's like if, if there were conferences and issues, they would come in and they would impart information.  So, yeah, it was, it was a time when, if, if you really wanted to, you could really absorb a lot and, and hear voices and hear nuances and hear points of view that were well thought out, that were intelligently and cogently presented and, you know, the brain is a, is a muscle and, you know, just being around so many people of, of such intellect, really helps to, to hone your ability to, to tackle problems.
Story_ID: 654323
Speaker 1: Along your journey of maturing into being an attorney, growing as a young African American man, being in the company of these people [at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.], working with them, how are you expressing yourself?  How are you expressing your voice or finding your voice?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, I did a lot of listening--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and I, the one thing I learned to do is to listen before I speak. And I think that's a good judicial trait because even, even when, you know, you have an opinion on something, I mean first of all, you're concerned that you might say it and it will be dissected and so you have to be careful there but, you know, when you, when you listen, I, I find that I'm good at evaluating even if I may not be as good at, you know, throwing things on the table.  And so, the skill I developed was, I said, to first of all to listen because I think, sometim- you know, sometimes when you're, you know, you have an idea you're so focused on giving your idea that you're not really paying as much attention to the other ideas that are being put forth.  And so, what I learned to do is not to be thinking of what I want to say but to, to focus on what other people are saying and, and as I said, there are people who are worth listening to, I mean, that's also the key.  I mean, you come into an environment in which there are so many voices that they, they have the ring of authenticity because you know it comes from a position where they have experience.  And so, it's not that you indiscriminately listen to every voice that's out there but it helps to, to have people speaking where you know that you can, you can give some credence to this and therefore you don't have to, you don't, I mean, that was before the Internet but you didn't--you don't have to go back and see well, why should I listen to this person, you already know that this is a person who, by experience, and by their, just their ability, they are worth listening to.  It does--it's not a matter of whether or not you agree with them but they're worth listening to and so I, I don't dismiss what people have to say and, and even when I disagree with them, I think very often what they have to say informs how I come out.
Story_ID: 654324
Speaker 1: While you are matriculating at NYU law school [New York University School of Law, New York, New York], in a way you're matri- matriculating at the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Education on both sides.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And then when you graduate, you don't start working there?
Speaker 2: Okay, well that was one of those little bumps.  What happened is the Legal Defense Fund had a little financial issue. And it turned out they weren't, they weren't going to hire anybody at the time that I graduated from law school--
Speaker 1: And excuse me, when you were an intern, were you being paid?
Speaker 2: At some points.
Speaker 1: Okay, right.
Speaker 2: I know at the end, not--
Speaker 1: Not always.
Speaker 2: Well, well but not--just enough to pay for my lunch and my, I mean--
Speaker 1: So like a stipend?
Speaker 2: It, it, no, it was an hourly rate but it was a very low hourly rate. But--
Speaker 1: And then when you graduate in '75 [1975], that this is when you discovered that they are not going to be hiring?
Speaker 2: Right, and so, there is actually, there was a, they actually, I think they had intended to hire two people and one other person who has a, had been working with one set of people and they loved that person and one set of people had been working with me, and so, but the money issue, and they weren't going to hire anybody.  And so--
Speaker 1: Then how were, how were they funded?
Speaker 2: Well, back then, mostly by donations and, and grants.
Speaker 1: Okay, because the legal services that LDF offi- offers are free--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to the, to the people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --that they're serving? Okay.
Story_ID: 654325
Speaker 1: And so you go to a law firm using your engineering degree?
Speaker 2: Right, I become a patent attorney.
Speaker 1: And where, where--not--actually in, where do you go?
Speaker 2: It's in New Jersey.  It's in Linden, New Jersey, it's Exxon Research and Engineering [Exxon Research and Engineering Company] and it's chemical patents.  I mean, chemical patents are the kinds of things where--they're processed patents where somebody figures out how to get more of a particular component from oil.  And so, you have these inventors and they're, they're coming out with these processes and you have to argue to the patent office that it's worth getting a patent on so that Exxon can, can use that process and other people can't.
Speaker 1: So it's a, it's a patent attorneys office but it's really for Exxon Company [Exxon Company, USA]?
Speaker 2: Yes, and, and fortunately, Exxon at that time was experimenting with actually doing their own work as opposed to having patent firms do it. Because the model for most companies was, they would prosecute cases before the [U.S.] Patent and Trademark Office but if it got into court, then they would hire a patent firm. And I was there when they were experimenting with doing some actual litigation and so I actually got to work on a case that went into federal court.
Speaker 1: So, so it turns out that your engineering degree really helped you, at least for that first job?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was it interesting to you?  Did you like that work?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess there's a statute of limitations on this but, well, not really.  You know, there's a certain intellectual part to trying to convince somebody that something is patentable but there's really not much people interaction and I had, I really wanted to have more of an impact working with people and so I was able to do it and they paid me for it but--
Speaker 1: And it's Exxon so I'm assuming this was a good paying job?
Speaker 2: Well, it was good compared to the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.].
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So, yes, I, I was getting paid more than I would be paid at the Legal Defense Fund and then eventually when I went to the Legal Defense Fund, I took the pay cut to, to do that.
Speaker 1: And you went soon after?  You were there, just there for one year, right?
Speaker 2: The patent (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well how long were you at the patent office?
Speaker 2: I was at Exxon for about six months.
Speaker 1: Oh, not even a year--
Speaker 2: Not even (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) about six months.
Story_ID: 654326
Speaker 1: And so what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, well, as it turns out--because it was a money issue, the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] had started to, to get into a position where they were going to offer a job but they only had money for one job.  And so, between me and the other person and, and so I said, well--because he had, he had actually not taken the job. And since I was working and I said, "Well you know, I'll defer," this was like in November of that year. And so he got hired and then in February they had some more money and they said, "Well now we have enough for another job," so that's, that's the way it worked.
Speaker 1: And you came on board formally in '76 [1976], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, February.
Speaker 1: February of '76 [1976], joining as a staff specializing in fair employment class action litigation?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And so this is '76 [1976].  What kinds of cases are you dealing with?
Speaker 2: Well, to begin with, the first case I worked on was a case involving the steel industry because I actually, I started on Monday but they had a, they had a meeting the Saturday before. So I remember that I was at a meeting--
Speaker 1: Before you started (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) before I started and that was because the, the steel industry, which had a history of discrimination, had signed some consent decrees with the government and we didn't think those consent decrees had done well by the, the--our constituency, and so we were challenging some of those decrees.  So that was my first entry.
Speaker 1: And this is at a time when the steel industry is very strong still?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And had employed a lot of black people?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And this is the federal case--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --this is the steel industry, nationally?
Speaker 2: Right, and this is, this is really them trying to remedy some past discrimination and a part of the consent decree is how they're going to structure the, the remedy and how they're going to pay for it and our view was that it did not adequately redress the discrimination in the past.  And so that was, that was the, that was the first kind of case I had--
Story_ID: 654327
Speaker 1: Then over the years, in those first early, in the early years [at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.], I spent a lot of time with a case against paper companies and a case against the federal government and state governments.  There were a lot of paper companies, mostly on the East Coast, like Maryland, Eastern Shore and eastern North Carolina, and I think, I had the experience of, you know, you go through a part of the country and everybody was a defendant so we were, we were suing a number of paper companies--
Speaker 2: And what are you suing them for?  What are they doing?
Speaker 1: Well the paper companies were doing pretty much what everybody was doing and that is they had separate white jobs and black jobs and--
Speaker 2: In the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 1: Yes. And when they, when they started to get sued, the problem was, how would you deal with the problem of integrating the black workers into the white jobs because there was a seniority issue because there were, there were blacks who would have seniority in their black job but they wouldn't let them use them to, in the white jobs.  And so, part of what we're trying to do was to figure out ways to, to make sure that there would be integration.  So there was the seniority issue and then there, and then as it turns out, the top job in the black line of progression actually paid more than the lowest job in the white line of progression.  So, if you were a senior black person, if you moved over, if you started out in the bottom of the white line, which you probably had to do because the jobs were all related, then you would have to take a pay cut.  So one of the remedies that, that was established was pay protection.  So you'd move over and you'd work your way up and your talent would probably take you there pretty quickly but you'd still have to start, learn the skills at the bottom jobs so it would prepare you for the next level and move on up and--
Speaker 2: So now all, all of these years, this is in the northeast where these, there are these different tracts--
Speaker 1: Well, actually most of these jobs are in the South.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They're--most of my work was in the states south of the Mason Dixon Line.  I mean, the, the kinds of things that happen in the North were at times more pernicious but different.
Speaker 2: Not as obvious, I would think.
Speaker 1: Right.  I mean, they, they did not have jobs that were uniquely classified as black.  I mean, they had separate locals, black locals and white locals and so. I think more interesting, from my personal perspective, is that I wind up meeting a lot of people who were in a situation that my father [Herman Ellis, Sr.] would have been in--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --if he had stayed.  That is, they were in these jobs and they would never be able to progress regardless of their skill and, and so I met people who had been doing, you know, twenty-five, thirty or more years and they were always in just the lowest level job and no prospects of getting to a job where, whereas the testimony we had in one case is that if it takes a key to run it, it's a white man's job kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Even though none of these jobs sounds like it required education, per se?
Speaker 1: No.  I had one case in--this was a, actually this was at the federal installation in which a person was, the person who was the, the general manager of the facility couldn't read or write.  I mean, that was a little bit extreme but what he had was he had a black man who would read the things to him and, and then convey the, the orders to the people who were under him.  By--when we tried the case.  By all accounts, the person had a lot of leadership qualities but couldn't read or write and--
Speaker 2: And the person who was reading to him or for him was, what was his pay in relation to that person?
Speaker 1: Well, he, he was not getting anything commensurate with the duties that he was actually doing.  The remedy was that he was going to, he was actually, at the end of the case, he was supposed to get the vacancy for the plant manager; but, I mean, that was, that was the kind of things that were happening.
Story_ID: 654328
Speaker 1: And how often were you successful?
Speaker 2: You know, we [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] settled a lot of cases.  In many of the situations, we didn't have to go to trial because the evidence was so overwhelming of the historical discrimination and how those historical discriminations had created barriers to people progressing and we--and settlement was our usual form of trying to resolve these cases.  You might have a class anywhere from several hundred to a couple of thousand people and so the idea was that you would, you would create a change over a broad based community.
Speaker 1: And the settlement would give financial awards to the people in the class action suit, but would it also give people the opportunity to move up in the businesses?
Speaker 2: Yes.  The sad part is that many of the people benefited weren't the people who had experienced the discrimination the longest because they were, they were going to have time to benefit from the structures that were put in place and, and also there's a statute limitations so you can, you can get compensation, but the compensation only goes back so far.  So, for example, if you, if you bring the case in 1978, you might be able to go back to '76 [1976], depending on when they first filed charges; but you wouldn't get any relief for the twenty or thirty years that they had been victimized.
Story_ID: 654329
Speaker 1: What were some of the other types of cases, employment cases that you dealt with over that period [at the NAACP Legal Dense and Educational Fund, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: 'Cause it was primarily employment you were working on, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  I mean, the employment cases really had basically the same form.  That is, almost always, it was--it wasn't so much we had different kinds of cases, we had different industries, so--
Speaker 1: Okay, and in the North, can, what was, give me an example of what happened in the North?
Speaker 2: Well, in the North, most of the, most of the systems that were in place had to do with testing.  I mean, they--the most effective vehicle we had in the North was that they had the, the appearance of fairness because they would give tests, but the tests weren't job related or what, you could use some criteria that wasn't job related.  It could be, it could be height, it could be weight, it could be education.  They would, they would impose, or it'd be paper and pencil tests which was, you know like they would, you might be filling a position as a sanitation worker and there are two hundred thousand applicants so you give a paper and pencil test and you'd cut that down to a more manageable number--
Speaker 1: And paper and pencil tests is can you read and write or--
Speaker 2: Well, or, it could be can you read or write but even can you, if you've done paper and pencil tests, you, you realize that the way they ask the questions and the, just the idea of taking a paper and pencil test, I mean, some people are traumatized by paper and pencil tests because of the legacy of discrimination and so they're just not good test takers.
Speaker 1: The same issue that we have with kids in schools today?
Speaker 2: Yes, and for example, to give you an example.  My older brother [Herman Ellis, Jr.] is a terrible test taker and when he applied to college, they told him he had like a 50 percent chance of getting a C average and he wound up, of course, finishing college and going onto medical school and he got a medical degree. But basically, anytime he had to take a standardized test, it was a problem for him, not a true measure of his intelligence, just a measure of how he takes tests.  My advantage growing up is that I was a whiz at taking tests and, you know, you put a test in front of me, I'm just as, you know, whatever it is, but I always--but that meant that I went into the test with a mindset that, well, this is a test, you know, I do well on tests. Which meant that I did well on tests because I thought I would do well on tests. But, you know, you get paper and pencil tests to the typical black person growing up in this society where, you know, you're told that you can't take tests, you don't do well on tests, you, and the pressure of just sitting down and taking a test, high stakes test, impacts how well you do on the test.  And so, we, the Supreme Court accepted the notion that you can't do paper and pencil tests, you can't impose any requirement, unless it's job related.  And so you can't do general intelligence tests if you want to test, if somebody wants to be a sanitation worker or, for that matter, if they want to be a police officer, if the questions you ask are not somehow related to the job and that's the, that's really, I think we have more disparate impact cases in the North than disparate treatment cases. And the difference is, in the South, they were more overt, in the North, it was a lot more of, we do something and we adversely impact the group that should have been protected; and then they had to, we wanted to establish the principal and we did that.  They have to show that it was related to the job they were testing for.
Story_ID: 654330
Speaker 1: So, in 1984, you're named director of the Legal Defense Fund's [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] fair employment program.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What does that mean, stepping into the director's seat?
Speaker 2: Well, it, mostly it means you don't get vacation time.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Mainly it means that in terms of, you know, what the program is going to do, where it's going to go, you, you have some broader say.  You're, you're the person who's responsible for, you know, setting the, the, the priorities and, again, you do this in conjunction with what people are already doing and, and, what are the problems that we have out there, what are the coming issues in terms of employment.
Speaker 1: And what are, at this point, in 1984, what are the biggest issues that we're facing?
Speaker 2: Coincidentally, what we're facing in 1984 is, the federal government is bringing a lot of reverse discrimination cases.  And so, what we, what we're doing is we're playing defense.  We are trying to maintain the gains that we've had, trying to convince people that the biggest problem in America is not that white males are being discriminated against, and trying to, sometimes just keep cases from going to the [U.S.] Supreme Court.  So, we're, we're finding situations where people are trying to, to broaden this notion of reverse discrimination and trying to be more of a stop-gap to make sure that that idea doesn't spread, because it not only stops the progress but it can reverse many years of progress in terms of recognizing the, the systemic issues that people of color have to face in employment.
Speaker 1: Do you recall any particular cases that bear this out?
Speaker 2: Well there, as it turns out, we had a number of cases that--this is an era in which in some places African Americans are in government, Detroit [Michigan], Richmond [Virginia] and those people are being challenged for affirmative action that they're taking and those are the things that, that stick out the most that, you know, you're, you're now in a position where you--they're in a position where they're trying to address decades of inequality, trying to put into, into place programs to address longstanding discrimination.  This is the era where people are talking about set asides and affirmative action and programs and, you know, it's, it's basically a time when people are--we as an organization and people around the country, are trying to figure out how the remedies that we put into place will now be challenged as discrimination themselves.  And so, we have people who are saying that, you know, we should only give preferences or consideration to people who are identified victims of discrimination. And in their model, the identified victim is the person who didn't receive the job twenty years ago or ten years ago and I'm basically going around telling people that that's sort of a very narrow view of who the victims are. And I started this during, actually, during, in the late '70s [1970s]. That, you know, just like you can benefit from what happened to your father.  If your father's rich, you can have benefits.  If your father's poor, you can have certain issues to overcome.  And so when you deny a father a job, you're impacting his child.  When you deny a father a job, you're impacting his family because he doesn't, the family doesn't have resources, not just his immediate family but the, you know, his cousins, his uncles.  When you deny that job, it impacts the community.  And so we're trying to, to broaden the definition of victim while other people are trying to narrow the definition.  And so that's, that's a large part of what was happening during the, the administration that came in--the federal administration that came in in 1980.
Story_ID: 654331
Speaker 1: When it began, this whole reverse discrimination push, were you all surprised? Because so much work had gone--you know, Voting Rights Act [Voting Rights Act of 1965].  I know that you worked on assuring voting rights. That--there are all these different things that you had done to help people to have some measure of parity and, and now this?
Speaker 2: I, I--the short answer is, I think we were surprised that it got as much traction as it did. We were not surprised that people would bring up the notion, and, and in part because the federal government--I mean, the justice--the Civil Rights Division was, was--of the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice]--was, was fostering this notion.  And so, I don't think we anticipated that it would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is under Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I don't think we anticipated it would have as broad a cache as it did.  I mean, I think we always recognized that you don't gain something and rest, that you have to keep fighting, but we didn't realize that it would have such an impact that it was really rolling back things as much as it did.  I think as, it's, it's the kind of thing that you--when you're making progress, you, you, you sometimes forget the tenacity of the people who are opposed to you, and we had been doing very well in the [U.S.] Supreme Court and the state courts and the federal courts and we were winning cases and, you know, it's just, you get into the mindset that, you know, the country's changing, we're changing, we can make progress, and you just didn't think somebody would make it their, their main thrust is to roll back that progress.
Speaker 1: So, in facing this potential rollback, how successful were you at stopping it?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd say that we, we, we were moderately successful and, and what, by that I mean is that, there are just some things which never got reversed at the Supreme Court and that's important.  I mean, we, we still had disparate impact as a vehicle for remedying discrimination.  We didn't have to prove that every time a systemic problem caused harm that you had to prove that there was evil in somebody's heart.  And so, just having that notion survive, I think was a, was probably the biggest success that we had.
Speaker 1: And is--when does Clarence Thomas join the court?  Isn't it--
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah it was later.
Speaker 2: --two [1992] or '3 [sic. 1991]. I know we're about contemp- I joined the--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --bench [U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York] about the same time.  I, I think it had to be '93 [1993] because I remember when we were, we're talking about him and I know I wasn't on the bench.  So--
Speaker 1: You were still, I think you were still there at, at, at the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.], weren't you?
Speaker 2: I, I started in November of '93 [1993] and I think Thomas started earlier, in '93 [1993].
Story_ID: 654332
Speaker 1: In, in '90 [1990], you were named director of the poverty and justice program as part of the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.].  So now your responsibilities change a bit?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: Well, poverty and justice was a different notion, it more--it was probably more holistic in terms of the harms that people were suffering and it, it basically, it wasn't about employment, it wasn't about schools, it wasn't about the environment, it was about all of them and how poverty impacts on people's ability to have a decent life.  It meant low income housing and making sure that was available.  It meant, looking at where waste was dumped and it meant making sure that there was access to hospital care for low income people.  It, it meant making sure that there was school equity.  And so, it sort of fit in with the idea that what you find when you do these kinds of cases, when you do civil rights cases, is you find that the people have a lot of insults to their everyday lives.  Survival is not just whether or not they have a decent job.  It's not, you know, there's, you know, without the decent job, they don't have decent housing, they can't afford medical care.  Their communities can't stop companies from putting hazardous operations in their neighborhoods.  And so, it seemed to be the, you know, as part of my growth, the idea that you need, you know, even once you get a good job, there can be, still be problems. And also it, it also was something that wasn't just a, there was no north, south divide 'cause poverty was impacting people whether they lived in Chicago [Illinois] or New York [New York] or St. Louis [Missouri] or Birmingham [Alabama], or Miami [Florida], and so it was, it just had a, as I said, a broader mandate and, but also more challenging because, again, the problem of trying to deal with issues that aren't necessarily easy to address by showing that somebody has evil intent.  You know, you'll have policies that are neutral on their face but they impact on people who have less financial ability and--
Speaker 1: Well, this was the hot button topic for King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that probably accelerated the end of his life--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --many believe because it's really touching on the core issue of quality of life.
Speaker 2: I think, you know, you talk about people ahead of their times because when you, when you start, certainly when you're in the community and you start to, to, you know, address the problems that people have and, obviously, as a minister and with a broad mandate and just being in the community, you realize that, you know, people sometimes try to separate poverty and race but they're both different and they're the same.  And so, and when you combine the two, it's unique. It's--if I might acknowledge either two, well there's discrimination on the base of race and there's discrimination based on gender but black women face particular problems because they will get some pushback when they're in the male era, area where black men won't and, but they'll also get pushback on the race issue.  And so, when you combine the effects of poverty and the effects of race, you, you realize that it, it's a double whammy. And so, I mean, even, even things that people don't necessarily think about.  If, if you come from a poor family and you happen to be the successful person in your family, then money, it's not like you inherit wealth, you, you help the generation that's before you so you're financial situation is affected because you want to, you know, the, your parents, your grandparents, your other family members, money's flowing out so your wealth doesn't accumulate.  And so, you know, you'll have people who will say, well, who paid for your child's tuition?  And they say, their grandparent did it.  Well, in many black families, that was not an option.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so, that, those are the kinds of things where the, the thing that race put in place and the things that systemic problems caused affect current generations and generations going forward.  And so, I think you start to realize this the more you, you interact with the people who are having those issues and, and as I said, you start to, you start to, to look outside of the, the just the legal aspects of it.
Story_ID: 654333
Speaker 1: And there was a particular case, Sheff v. O'Neill [1989], which, do you remember that one?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you, can you describe that case?
Speaker 2: Well, Sheff v. O'Neill had many aspects, some of which had to do with busing. And the thing is, in a place like Sheff where in the center city of Hartford [Connecticut], and then you have the surrounding suburbs, everybody's being bused. But the busing is--and then the parents want busing but they don't want--
Speaker 1: This is around what time?
Speaker 2: Well, Sheff goes back, it's, it's more than thirty years old.
Speaker 1: So the case, '89 [1989].
Speaker 2: That was the trial, yes, that was the trial (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, that was the trial, so it occurred prior to.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  The case had been going on a long time before the trial.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--but what it--it was a school equity case and a segregation case because Hartford being a, a typical urban area in the North, the Hartford city schools, predominantly black, the suburban schools, predominantly white, so there's a question of integrating the schools, then there's a question of the poverty within the Hartford school system [Harford Public Schools], and that makes the school equity case.  What does the state do about the fact there are poorer kids in Hartford than in the suburbs. And in, at least in Connecticut, the state constitution guaranteed every child an equal educational opportunity.  And so, piggybacking off of that, we [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] said that if children come to school with certain deficits, they, they don't get good meals, they, they need other kinds of accommodations, then the state has to make up the difference, it can't be based upon the local ability to pay. And that's what, that's what we litigated.  We had a component having to do with the, the negative impacts of race and I think I, the experts never could, could demonstrate the positive aspects of race on a short term basis.  The one thing that, the only thing that was clear about race from the experts, from our experts, was that people who lived in integrated environments, who went to integrated schools, tended to live in integrated environments when they got out of school. So you couldn't prove that they did better in school, 'cause that's very hard because it's hard to figure out what's the control group and--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --but unequivocally, when they got out of school, they are more likely to be in environments where they were not segregated, both the white and the black students.  So, the one thing that we determined was that people who go to school with people who are not like themselves, feel more comfortable when they get out of school with people who are not like themselves. But we, we litigated that case and it was, it was still going on years after the trial because, I think two or three years ago, they were telling me there were still some things that were happening. Because every time there was a remedy, the legislature would do something to change parts of the system and then there was a reevaluation.  So, there, there was a finding that there was a problem but then the remedy is what causes the--
Speaker 1: Which is something you mentioned earlier, even when there is an end to a trial and a verdict--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --it doesn't mean that that holds?
Speaker 2: It, it's two things.  One is, you have to be concerned about whether or not there's going to be some backsliding. And two, there's implementation. Even, even just trying to figure out what's the best way to remedy things that happened in the past, you know, with, without unnecessarily trammeling what's happening in the present.  And so, there's a--sometimes they have years and years of people getting together and committees trying to figure out how to implement a remedy which addresses problems that had been going on for decades.
Story_ID: 654334
Speaker 1: In 1993, you become a magistrate judge for the U.S. District Court in New York [U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York].  How does that, how does that happen because you've spe- now spent many years at the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] and becoming a judge is an opportunity that comes to you?
Speaker 2: Okay, well, you know, actually I had thought about the idea of being a judge in part because the Legal Defense Fund had been very successful in getting people in judgeships during the Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] administration and then they reprised that during the Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] administration. But the Legal Defense Fund had made a lot of enemies and we had had some people who had gone up and had a difficult time getting through people on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.].  And so I sort of put aside the notion that that was in the offing but--
Speaker 1: And, and had made a lot of enemies, why?
Speaker 2: Well, and some of them blamed us for, Robert Bork, and--
Speaker 1: Explain.
Speaker 2: Well, Robert Bork had been nominated for the [U.S.] Supreme Court and he had written extensively about his philosophy and there are a number of civil rights groups who had analyzed those philosophies and determined that they were incompatible with the things that we wanted to have happened with civil rights and he wasn't really the kind of person who ought to be on the Supreme Court.  So he had a very big paper trail because he didn't mind saying what, what he thought. And the Legal Defense Fund, along with other organizations, had been very vocal in talking about him not being a good person with the Supreme Court and there was sort of a momentum with Bork in which there, at some point, his support got to the point where he, he was not a viable candidate and there were some people on the Hill who blamed the Legal Defense Fund in part. And when we had--
Speaker 1: For helping to shut that down.
Speaker 2: When we had people going before committees, they faced problems and this was, and these were executive branch people.  I mean, like [HistoryMaker] Lani Guinier.  We had a person named Bill Lann Lee and he had a very good back story and they--and so there was this, this, this sort of negativity.  There were even some people on the right that said that, they would never let anybody from the Legal Defense Fund get through.
Speaker 1: Is that why you think Lani Guinier was shut down?
Speaker 2: I think that's why she was--I think that's why the narrative around her was not a true narrative. And, you know, people, people spin a narrative around you which is designed to paint you as somebody as undesirable and it wasn't, it wasn't really what she was about. And it did seem as if that was, that was sort of a, the tenor of the times.
Story_ID: 654335
Speaker 1: The idea of, you know, the idea of going through [U.S.] Congress, you know, my, I mean, I had been very vocal on affirmative action.  I--there was no way I was going to hide those--I mean, I'm in print, I'd given interviews. So, and having seen what had happened to, to people who had gone through it, it didn't seem like a viable alternative.  I didn't realize that magistrate judges didn't go through Congress.  I didn't really know that much about them. But at the time, in our court [U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York], we had Robert Carter [HistoryMaker Robert L. Carter] and Connie Motley [Constance Baker Motley]. And Robert Carter had said that he had been trying to, to get them to appoint a black magistrate judge and the, the response he got was, you know, "If a qualified candidate is there, then we'll consider them."  So he called the director-counsel at the time, who was [HistoryMaker] Elaine Jones, and said, "Send, have somebody apply who's a qualified candidate."  And so she came to me and I didn't really know that much about it.  I said, "Well, you know, sure, I'll give it a shot."  And so I put in my application and I put it, I actually put in the application before I found out that much about the job. And then I found out about the job and then I put in an application for the Eastern District [U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York], which also had a vacancy.  I said, "Well, this looks like a very good job." And well the magistrate judges go through a merit selection panel and they evaluate the people without regard to political party or leanings; and so I got through that, and then they recommend you to the board of judges and I got selected there.

Speaker 1: And can you explain exactly, what is the role of a magistrate judge?
Speaker 2: Well, magistrate judges are created by Article One of the [U.S.] Constitution and they are there to assist the Article Three judges in any way that any particular district believes they are--they can help.  In the Southern District [U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York], which makes it a very prestigious job, is that magistrate judges get all kinds of cases.  They get them through, they get them either just for discovery, they can, they can try a civil case on consent if the parties agree, they, they do the criminal intake.  And so, on a day to day basis you could have intellectual property cases, employment cases, police misconduct cases, contract cases, it's not true in every district that the magistrate judges do all sorts of cases, but at least in the Southern District you get to do any kind of case that comes through, if it gets referred to you, and you start off with a district that has probably a better mix than almost any other place.
Speaker 1: Because the--what is the composition of the Southern District of New York?  What areas are included?
Speaker 2: The Southern District includes Manhattan [New York, New York], the Bronx [New York] and some of the lower counties in Westchester [Westchester County, New York].
Speaker 1: So because it includes Manhattan, that's why it's--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --everything?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Manhattan, Manhattan alone probably gives us the most interesting mix of anything that we do.
Speaker 1: And how many judges are on this court?
Speaker 2: There are eleven magistrate judges in Manhattan and there are three in White Plains [New York]; and I--the number of authorized district judges, I think is twenty-nine.
Story_ID: 654337
Speaker 1: What have been some of the interesting cases that you've had come before you [in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, some- sometimes when you say, interesting cases, depends on whether or not you're from my point of view or from the point of view of the public but (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, well I can be more specific. Bernie Madoff [Bernard Madoff].
Speaker 2: Which was--we--talk about being, talk about being surprised.  I, I had the Bernie Madoff case and the way it works is magistrate judges take criminal duty a week at a time.  And so, on the week that I was on, an issue comes up involving Bernie Madoff because the government wants to remand him and it's, it's pretrial so it's a bail issue.  And so the government presents its case and so normally on a bail decision, the one, I guess, the one consideration I made, is that I would do a written decision because you can do a bail decision and just do it orally but it, at least it became clear that there was interest in this and I thought it important enough to at least make sure that it was clear what we were saying and why we were saying it.  So, to make a long story short, we analyzed the case, I decide that there is--the presumption of being bailed has not been overcome and so h- we add some conditions to his release but say that, you know, he'll stay in, under basically house arrest. And my life hadn't been the same since.  There are people, there are some people who the marshals [U.S. Marshals Service] had to visit because people were saying things that were threatening.  There were, there were cartoons and editorials and op-eds and all sorts of things about, you know, Bernie Madoff being out while people who had committed lesser crimes were in jail and, you know, a lot of basic misunderstanding about how bail is supposed to work but--
Speaker 1: So a lot of criticism of you?
Speaker 2: Yes, there was a lot of criticism.  We had anticipated there would be issues. And it was, it was one of those situations where, you know, it would have been simple to, to remand him and I'm not sure anybody would have really been all that concerned about it considering what came out later, but what I always tell my law clerks is that you should, you should not do it because it's popular and you should not do it because it's easy, you should do it because it's the right decision to make.  And so we did, you know, we get the research, told 'em what it seemed like and they put the framework in, I put in a few choice footnotes and, you know, it was really a question of, you know, under the Bail Reform Act [Bail Reform Act of 1984], was there a substantial risk of him not appearing or being a danger to the community and if there was a risk, could you address it by means other than keeping him in?  And it was, it was as simple and as difficult as that. And it was in the framework in which he was, he's basically under house arrest and I--the--and what people may not, people in the public may not know is that the government moved to detain him, basically, on danger to the community because he was dissipating assets as opposed to the actual risk of flight or nonappearance.  I mean that, that was in there but the, the main thing was that he had sent some things out. And so that was the question: whether under the circumstances there was a risk to the community, and whether or not that risk could be addressed. And that was the, that's what's in the opinion.

Speaker 1: This is a continuation interview. I'm [HistoryMaker] Harriette Cole, the interviewer for The HistoryMakers, Scott Stearns is our videographer, today is November 11th, 2016, we're at Skadden, Arps [Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP] at 4 Times Square [New York, New York], continuing our interview with The Honorable Ronald L. Ellis [HistoryMaker Ronald L. Ellis].
Story_ID: 654339
Speaker 1: So we were talking about the Bernie Madoff [Bernard Madoff] case and, and how it really changed your life. And--well, you said, that it changed your life.  So I'd love for you to explain how.
Speaker 2: Well, I guess the big way it changed my life is that I became notorious.  I, I'd had a fairly substantial career at the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.], had worked on cases, had, you know, worked on the [U.S.] Supreme Court, done trials, all sorts of issues, and in the legal profession, sometimes you do a lot of work that doesn't get noticed and even when you're on the bench, you do a lot of things that don't get noticed, everyday things, the substantial opinions, the, the issues that you deal with. And when the, when the Madoff case came to the court [U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York] and I had written the decision concerning whether or not he would be bound over, whether or not he would continue to be on bail, that notoriety, I wasn't prepared for, in part because I'm not seeking that and it wasn't part of the, the environment that I was used to. But it meant that people knew you who you had no idea that they'd have any idea to know you.  I mean judges work day in and day out, they have large dockets, you don't generally get to know them.  They're not a profession, they're not like politicians, we can't speak out on cases.  And so, when a judge gets to be known, it's sort of a different kind of environment, different kind of setting that you have to get used to.  It did mean that people would know about you that wouldn't ordinarily know about you.  That also meant sometimes students would apply to you and you'd ask them what they knew about you and they would know about Bernie Madoff.  You'd go to conferences or other settings and people ask you about the Madoff case and you'd have a career that spanned decades but they would want to know about the Madoff case. And I've come to accept that as not necessarily a bad thing.  It, it gives you an opportunity, for example, to explain your views about bail. And, and so once, once we got over the people who were saying negative things, the idea that you, you had achieved some notoriety, I--when young people see that you have a wiki page [Wikipedia], it makes a difference and, you know, you're looking for people to, to at least think that it, there's a value in clerking with you, interning with you or just having the opportunity to, to meet you, to know that you are a person.  As I said, it's a different thing for a judge and, you know, as long as you don't let it go to your head, it does open up opportunities for, for you to have a voice because the, the most difficult thing is to have a voice, even when you're in a position, such as a judge.  And so, you turn that notoriety into the ability to have contact with people, to talk with people, to, to at least be a known entity. Everybody wants known entities.
Story_ID: 654340
Speaker 1: Well it's interesting you say that because my father [Harry Augustus Cole] was a judge and I remember, because he was a judge, he said he could not go to political events, you know, for any party.  He was, he was not allowed to show any partisanship which was--and so therefore we weren't allowed to show any partisanship.  Is that, what is, what is that rule?
Speaker 2: That--I think you've essentially stated the rule.  The idea is that the judicial branch should be above politics, that we should rule on cases without regard to the political aspects of it, to apply the rule of law and to decide cases based upon the facts and the law.  And the other thing that judges are constrained by is we want to avoid the appearance of impropriety.  It doesn't mean that a judge who might have some political leanings won't be fair in the case but we want to have it so that when the public sees us, they don't even get an inkling that, if they come before the court, they won't get a full and fair opportunity to present their case.
Speaker 1: Now that said, you know there's a lot of interest in what happens on the [U.S.] Supreme Court.  Obviously, that's not your court but you know how it works and a lot of political interest in, you know, which president gets to appoint someone based upon political views.  So given the rules that you're not supposed to be partisan, can you explain why there's so much jockeying in terms of who gets to have that role and why it's so important, you know, across, depending upon the party, why people are so adamant about, who gets in the role on the Supreme Court.
Speaker 2: Well, I actually think it's a function of fact that we have more information about judges and about people.  You know, if you were a judge thirty, forty years ago, if you wrote in a journal, most people wouldn't see it.  Now with the Internet, judges' views become, even if they're not talking politically, their views on how to analyze the [U.S.] Constitution, how to approach the Constitution, they become known and, and that, and I think people understand that sometimes the way you approach a problem can lead to a certain result. And I think that's, the recognition of that has caused people to try to figure out where judges would be ruling on the political issues that they're concerned about.  It doesn't mean that the judges have said anything political, but just the difference between whether or not you believe the Constitution needs to be an original intent Constitution or a Constitution which lives according to the, the, each succeeding generation, that interpretation makes for different kinds of results.  And so, I think people are trying to figure out, politicians are trying to figure out what helps their politics based upon how they think judges will rule.  Obviously, a judge can't say, "If this case comes before me, I'm going to rule that way," but it's the same with almost anything in law, it's how you analyze it, the burdens of proof you place on the parties, how you determine where you're going to begin your analysis, that can have an impact on where you end up.  So, I think we have a tendency to politicize everything these days and, and because the, the Supreme Court is--small differences can--you know, we have five to four decisions on a lot of major issues, it makes the politicians feel as if we know every, every consideration on the Supreme Court becomes monumental.  And so, I think they have politicized it.  I think that, you know, it, but it's, it's what happens when you have one court that's the main court, and a five to four decision, it's still the law of the land.
Story_ID: 654341
Speaker 1: Let's talk about what a judge does.  I think, you know, thanks to television, we get to see what at least, television says lawyers do, (laughter) but normally what we see of a judge is sitting on the bench, you know, with the gavel, saying a few words, but a lot happens behind the scenes.  Can you describe what--in particular, what--you're a magistrate judge--what, what does a magistrate judge do?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well let me begin by starting, in general--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because very often people ask me, "Well how do you make the transition from being an advocate to being a judge?" And those are different kinds of personalities. And I begin the process by saying, you know, when I was at the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.], much of what we were trying to do is give people access to justice.  I mean, we were, we were proposing certain positions but ultimately we were dealing with clientele who, access to justice, just getting into court, was a significant advance in their lives and with a history of not being able to testify and not being able to right wrongs, we had people who, the single biggest part of a case was them being able to testify in court, much as you want to testify in church, to bear witness to the things that had happened to you.  And so we'd have people who, whether they won, lost or didn't, the fact that they could get up there, tell their stories and people would listen to them, that became a significant part of what we were trying to achieve.  We know we couldn't win every case, but to give voice to those people who felt that they never had a voice, nobody would listen to them, that was an important part of the job that we had.  And I think when--I bring that sensibility to judging.  When, when I get a case, I want everybody to have a fair chance.  So a magistrate judge is--in the Southern District of New York [U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]--is, what happens is, a case comes into the district, it gets a magistrate judge assigned and a district judge assigned and the magistrate judge could do all the pretrial work, they could get settlements of the cases, they could deal with certain motions, the parties could even consent to have the magistrate judge act as a district judge and, and there wouldn't be any district judge involved in the case.  Since most of what we do is pretrial, settling those disputes becomes a significant part of what the job of magistrate judge is.  Parties are disagreeing about whether or not they need to provide information, whether or not that information needs to be made public, whether or not they can get a protective order about it, whether or not people need to be deposed and who can be deposed and for how long. And part of the process, if you're doing discovery as a magistrate judge, is to see that the scales are balanced, that there's a proportionality between what somebody's seeking and the importance that it bears to the case.  And so I spent much of my time giving people reality checks and telling them that, you know, just because you want to ask a lot of questions, doesn't mean that you get to ask a lot of questions.  Just because you want to take a hundred depositions, doesn't mean that you get to take a hundred depositions but the idea is to balance.  It's always about balance so that each of the litigants has an opportunity to present and to defend the ca- the position that they have.
Story_ID: 654342
Speaker 1: And so, we spend a lot of time, at least in--in my court [U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York], looking at those equities and making sure that, for example, if you have a pro se that a lawyer doesn't take advantage of that--
Speaker 2: What is a pro se?
Speaker 1: A pro see is someone who doesn't have an attorney, and you want to make sure that pro ses are not taken advantage of.  And so, I'll have a pro se case, I'll call the lawyers, the lawyers on the other side, and I'd say, "I don't expect you to take advantage of this person, I expect you to defend your client, but if the pro se doesn't know all of the, the procedures and they ask you a question, if it's not in the exact form, I expect that you will answer it anyway so that we don't get bogged down on this issue of, you know, they don't know how to practice law because they have a right to have their case heard."  By the same token, if a, sometimes pro ses come in and they think that they want to, they want to depose a whole host of people and they misperceive what's important to their case. And so sometimes I'll say, "Well, tell me why you want to depose that person, why do you want to ask those questions," and to try to balance the needs of the pro se litigant and the fairness to the, the litigant who has an attorney.  So sometimes it's bring a reality check to the pro se and sometimes it brings a reality check to the attorney to make sure that they understand that it's a search for the truth, it's not a question, it's, it's not an endurance contest to see who could outlast the other one.
Speaker 2: So do you feel like a fair amount of your job is educating people on other side?
Speaker 1: It's, it's educating them to how I think things ought to happen. So that, for example, in addition to the technicalities of it, there are certain kinds of decorum which I expect in my court and if somebody violates that, so, for example, someone's talking and someone starts to interrupt them, well I take the time and I tell them that they can't do that and that, in my court, we'll respect every person, you'll get a chance to talk but we don't interrupt.  I mean, that's, you know, sort of the Miss Manners [Judith Martin] kind of thing.  And so, you know, you have a gavel but I nev- I've never used a gavel, but I've always told people that there's a certain way that you're going to react and respond to your opponent and that's not going to be that you're going to raise your voice, you're not going to yell, you're not going to interrupt, you're not going to say things about their character, stick to the facts of the case, let's talk about what the case is about.  And so, that atmosphere, I think, is part of making sure that people aren't necessarily intimidated, that the loudest person doesn't win.  That the person who's the, who's got all the tricks up their trade--up their sleeve, aren't--isn't the person who's going to get the judge's ear.  So, I think that's all a part of balancing, to make sure that everybody's case is heard and that nobody uses some trick or, or some little thing that they know about the judge or the process to get an advantage.
Story_ID: 654343
Speaker 1: So you mentioned you know the balance and, you know, just 'cause you want to depose a hundred people, I may not allow you to do that. How do you balance making those decisions, which ones are the ones that should be deposed and which not? And in the context, you know, like you said, when you were at the LDF [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.], you know that there are plenty of times when those decisions were skewed in favor of someone who is not your client, back, you know, unfairly skewed, let's say.  How, how do you make the decision as to what is a fair deposition and what is not?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to, simply I can say, it's experience.  That is, after you've done it for a while, you're not intimidated by somebody saying, okay, we've got to find all of this out but the first conference that I have with people, they would tell me about the case.  They would tell me what the issues are and then we would talk about what they need in terms of discovery and we would, they would explain to me why they need to do what they need to do.  If they have to do overseas depositions or if they have to do depositions in other states, explain to me why that's going to happen.  And so, that initial conference where we talk about the necessity and the extent of discovery, that's where I make the first cut.  The second thing is that I believe in flexibility.  And so, I always tell the parties, if, if I've made a mistake and I've been too restrictive, if you come back and you show me something because you've, you've done some depositions or you've gotten some answers and you find out that there's other information that's going to make it broader than you thought, then you come back to me. But at least I give them some guidance and just don't do--I don't say do everything that you want. But here, here are the parameters that we're setting, understand that life changes, circumstances change. If you can show those changed circumstances, if you learn something during the process that remarkably changes the way this looks, then tell me and I'll listen to it and to the extent that you're willing to be flexible, then that works and, of course, normally people don't come back because they can't make the compelling case but occasionally people come back and they want more and by the time they're finished, they've made their case; and we said, "Okay, let's extend it, let's give you more."
Story_ID: 654344
Speaker 1: Do you feel like your experience with the LDF [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] and going through the South and just seeing how cases were tried then, especially in the racist South and you were dealing with a lot of those kinds of tensions, do you feel like that experience affects the way that you approach your judgeship now?
Speaker 2: Well, I think one thing that was different about the way we litigated is, we had limited resources.  And so, when you have limited resources, you have to make the determination about what's important.  You can't say, well, we've got this much money and we've got this many days, you make those determinations, you learn how to, to triage, to determine, you know, if we're going to litigate this case, what's the most important issue.  What are the most important issues?  Who are the most important people?  Sometimes in litigation, these days, particularly when you have big firms on either side, they don't make those determinations the same way because they don't have the same constraints.  So, I think working in a situation where you have to make those critical determinations about the use of resources, assists you in evaluating whether or not people need to do all of the things that they want to do. Because lawyers have a tendency to want to make--I had a lawyer once, told me he needed to take more depositions because there were some things that he didn't know.  I said, "Well that's life."  You know, you, you know, you sometimes have to make do where you don't know everything but you have to decide which are the things are most critical; and that's the decision you're going to make and we'll live with it.
Story_ID: 654345
Speaker 1: Now let's talk about the support staff that you work with [at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]. Just this--the natural course of doing business for a judge, there are many people who are a part of your process.  Can you talk about those relationships?
Speaker 2: Okay, well, magistrate judges, in my current configuration, I have two law clerks and a courtroom deputy and as many interns as we can fit into our chambers and that we can supervise. And that the courtroom deputy does the scheduling, making sure that the cases that come in are, there's a place for them on our, on our schedule, how much time we're going to give them, when it's going to happen and the law clerks' responsibility is for the cases that come in, any motions that we get, to make sure they brief me on what's happening in the cases because, obviously, I couldn't possibly read all of the things that come in on cases.  And so, their responsibility is, first of all, to make sure that any case that comes in, they brief me on it.  We, we have this ongoing issue where I tell them that, whatever they show me can only fit on one side of a page. And they have learned the art of small margins. But, you know, the idea is that, that, they're my first line of knowledge and, of course, I'll get on the bench and I'll use that as an entree to question the lawyers to find out what's going on.  Their responsibility also goes to when we have things which are going to result in opinions.  They will draft opinions on their own.  They will have interns draft opinions and they will edit the interns' opinions and then it comes to me. 	So we have a process where I--I believe in the draft opinion method as opposed to, write me a memo and I'll write the opinion myself.
Story_ID: 654346
Speaker 1: So, we have the interns doing drafts based upon looking at pi- prior opinion, the law clerks go through it, two, three, four, five times depending on the intern and then when they think that it's in good enough shape, then it comes to me, then it goes to two, three, four more drafts also.  What happens is, I will read the drafts first, just to see if it hangs together and then we'll fix those kinds of issues, see if the overall structure and conclusion seem sound based upon what's in it.  And then, when we've got that worked out, then I do a different kind of read in which I deconstruct what's in it.  I will look at, I'll look at opinions that they've cited, see if they stand for what they've done, presumably, the law clerks have done some of this already but part of it is my instinct of what seems right and then I'll have conversations with the law clerk or the intern about, "Well, why did you say this?"  "Why do you think this stands for that proposition?"  If, if everything seems consistent, then we move to the grammar usage stage to make sure it's all said properly, that it's not in too much legalese.  So, after those three processes are complete, then we figure it's ready for being published.
Speaker 2: And what is that time period normally look like?
Speaker 1: Well, it varies.  We did, we did the Madoff [Bernard Madoff] opinion fairly quickly.  We can, we can do some things in a couple of days.  We have some cases that have been going for months.  It depends on how, how much information is there because it's not just the law but how you state the facts.  I think it's important that anyone reading an opinion read the facts first so that the opinion makes sense and that it, and don't just gloss over the facts.  Make sure they're stated in plain English. And some cases are complicated.  We have some cases that involve social security where there are lots of medical terms and a lot of that is making it so that we translate medical diagnoses into terms that lay people can understand. But we can, those can run twenty or thirty pages of facts, depending on how complex the medical problem is.
Speaker 2: So you, you have two law clerks and however many interns you can have.  Are--in these iterations and the steps that you just described, are you commonly having them have different opinions?  You know, how, how strong are their opinions and how much jockeying goes on between you as you're trying to get to what you think is your ultimate decision?
Speaker 1: Okay, so first of all, they're, they have different parts of dockets so they're not working on the same case but in terms of what happens, I think the reputation I have with my clerks is that it's like defending a dissertation.  And so, they're, they're very conscious of, by the time they give me a draft, that they're willing to defend it.  And so, we'll go through it and, you know, there are times when I will say, "Well, I don't, I don't see this," and we'll talk it through, we'll ask whys.  There are even occasions when, despite the fact that I put a lot of faith in what they do, I'll say, "Well, I just don't think it's sustained this way and we need to look at a different result because while I understand why you say it, I think ultimately it has to be that when you write it, it's, it's consistent, it's not a reach." I mean, we're, we want to do justice and sometimes you, you have something that seems like an injustice and the question is whether or not you can write it so that the injustice doesn't exist but you still have to be true to the law.  I mean, you can't, you can't bend it so much that it doesn't make sense or that you stretch it beyond its natural boundaries, and you also have to be cognizant, as I tell them, that when, when you make rules of law, it doesn't just apply to your case, the one that's before you, and you have to consider that if you do this in the case before us, somebody else is going to use it in another case, in a different way, because judges cite other judges' cases, and are you comfortable with this result if we change these facts a little and now it's a different person who's, who's now before the court [U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]. But I'd like to think that they, the law clerks, believe that, if they make a compelling enough case that I will agree with them.
Story_ID: 654347
Speaker 1: Another big case that you, that came before you [at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York] was the Ken Burns documentary about the Central Park Five ['The Central Park Five'] in 2013, I guess was when it--was that when it first came to you?
Speaker 2: I'm--it--I'm not exactly sure, I mean, 'cause we were ending the case near about 2013 so I don't know--
Speaker 1: Okay, so the--
Speaker 2: --if it was totally 2013 or late 2012.
Speaker 1: So what came to you?
Speaker 2: Well, the city [New York, New York] had asked for outtakes from the documentary. And so the question was the balancing of the, a filmmaker's rights in terms of being able to keep the, the confidentialities of some of the things that they had filmed and whether or not it was important to the city in prosecuting the city's case.  So it basically came down to the question of whether or not the city had made out a case that the outtakes could potentially be relevant to the claims in the case and my ruling was that they had not made out that, that case. And bear in mind that there is a certain amount of protection that we want to give to people in the position who are making documentaries and just--so those protections that we afford to them, the court, the courts have come up with ways to balance those interests with the public interests to know in any given litigation. And if, if presented with the facts, you know, we, I said, we always look at them and say, who's got the burden and have they carried the burden. And, you know, we had the, we had the city argue what could possibly be in the outtakes and whether or not what could possibly be in them could be relevant to the case if it went to trial and, as I said, it seemed speculative to me and--
Speaker 1: So this was pretrial?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Pre--the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Central Park Five trial?
Speaker 2: Well this is, this is, this would have been the civil trial--no this, this is, we work, we're working toward having a civil trial in federal court and some of the information that's in the documentary was, were interviews that had been taken of the, the plaintiffs about things that happened in the past, things that were, happening to them in the present and to the extent that they were talking about the present, it seemed to be hard to see how that would be relevant to the decisions that had been made at the time they were prosecuted.

Speaker 1: So this is one--one of the biggest hot button cases in New York [New York], you know, even now in 2016, there's still something discussed in part because Donald Trump was the one who took out the ads back in '89 [1989] when, when the crime was committed, when the rape was committed and these five young men were accused of raping this woman. And then he suggested the death penalty for them and that has continued to come up over, again.  Because this was such a high profile case, do you, how do you approach it knowing that the scrutiny is that much greater?
Speaker 2: Well, that's another thing you can say for the Madoff [Bernard Madoff] case.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean, having gone through the Madoff situation, I think we had reached a position where, whether it's car- compartmentalization or what, is to try to put aside the potential media storm and to focus on the issues from a legal point of view and I think what we were able to achieve is, is that kind of a balance that, whether it was my clerks or me or anyone associated with us [U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York] is that our job was really to make sure that each of the parties in this case got the information they needed. And that can be apolitical. That can, that's, that's not really a question of whether or not there was an injustice that was done in 1989. The question is, given the parties' positions, what is it that you need in order to either prosecute your case or to defend your case. And, as I said, having gone through the Madoff situation, the Central Park Five case, while it had a lot of media interest, it wasn't, it wasn't actually acidic.  It wasn't--I mean, unlike where there were things written and said that caused the marshals [U.S. Marshals Service] to be concerned--
Speaker 1: With Madoff.
Speaker 2: --with Madoff, for the Central Park Five, there, you know, it seemed to be more balance in the sense that people were willing to give us the benefit of a doubt for whatever rulings we made, people weren't rushing to judgment, they didn't, they didn't react viscerally to it.  And so we didn't get the same kind of pushback in that case so, and, and in some respects, it was a lot easier to do that case.  There was media interest but there wasn't, there weren't people who were looking at ou- the decisions that we're making and saying, "How could you?"
Story_ID: 654349
Speaker 1: So ultimately, how did you rule?
Speaker 2: Well we--it settled.  I mean, one of the things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And this is one of the things you negotiate on a regular basis, these settlements?
Speaker 2: Well, we, we had been talking about settling the case for, actually a very long period of time. Actually what changed in the case was, there was a change in the administration and in the corporation counsel's office. Because, I mean, everybody wants to settle a case but the--and that's true of every case that, where they're settling. And the big issue is the number that you're going to settle the case for. And I think with the change of administration that just changed the dynamic of how the case was valued and because of that, I think that's what made the difference in settling the case.  I mean, you know, judge, you know, people like to think judges make a big difference, but ultimately in, in any case that I'm working on, even if I'm working on it for settlement, what I tell the law clerks, if you get the right number, the case will settle, and that's a number that makes each side feel that they've gotten the best deal that they can get out of it.  And so--
Speaker 1: So in this case, the settlement, the money's going to whom?
Speaker 2: The five plaintiffs will get the lion's share.  Obviously, attorneys got a, a--
Speaker 1: But this is about the documentary ['The Central Park Five'], so--
Speaker 2: Oh, the documentary?  Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: I mean, that, your case, I mean, the Central Park Five case was about the documentary, was it not?
Speaker 2: The Central Park Five--well, the Central Park Five case was, the five plaintiffs had sued the city [New York, New York] for their wrongful incarceration.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So that was the, the documentary case came in as a part of that case.  So, when people talk about the Central Park Five case, I think of the overall case.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The documentary part was once I ruled that the city wasn't going to get the outtakes, they had the choice of trying to appeal it, but you, evident--discovery issues aren't generally appealable.
Speaker 1: But you also had the case with the five plaintiffs from--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --yes, and so in that case, that's what was settled.
Speaker 2: That's what was settled.
Speaker 1: And so, the settlement was between the city and the plaintiff?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Story_ID: 654350
Speaker 1: But there's still more to this case [the Central Park Five], correct?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  One of the things that happened in the case is that a lot of documents that were produced in the case were produced under seal for various reasons.  Because of the importance to the public, after the case, (clears throat) after the case was over, we had been working, trying to figure out how to balance the interest of the public's right to know and the privacy interest of the persons who were involved. So just an enormous number of documents that need to be reviewed and, and the idea would be that because of the public's right and the public interest in these cases, these will be made available, these documents will be made available at some time in the future. But the process of going through and determining which ones need to be made public and which ones shouldn't, is a, is not a simple process.  It's not easy to go through documents and figure out what needs--what can be published and what can't be published.
Speaker 1: And that's what you're going through with this case now?
Speaker 2: That's what the city [New York, New York] and the plaintiffs are working together to try to, to come to common ground about that.
Speaker 1: So when you're involved in a case like that, how daunting is it for you to be making those kind of decisions as to what becomes public or what doesn't?
Speaker 2: Well, at this point, I haven't had to decide it yet.  Initially it had come up before the case settled and some newspapers had sought to intervene to make the documents public and I denied that and said that the case was going to trial and that would be enough publication of the, the information.  When the case settled, that was no longer going to be an option but in terms of what the ultimate decision is going to be, I think everybody involved is very conscious of protecting the rights of the individuals who were touched by the litigation because it involved people who were arrested and not charged and people who were charged with other crimes and just some information that had--they just discovered as they were doing the investigation. And we're, we're hopeful that protecting those, the privacy rights of those individuals in the end, what will happen as a city and the plaintiffs will present to me what they think ought to happen; and I think we'll just deal with it when it happens.
Story_ID: 654351
Speaker 1: In addition to being a judge [on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York], you also teach law at, at NYU School of Law [New York University School of Law, New York, New York], correct?
Speaker 2: Well I used to teach at NYU (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You used to.  Oh when were you teaching there?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I taught at NYU I think from '86 [1986] to '94 [1994].
Speaker 1: And when did you go onto the magistrate court?
Speaker 2: Ninety-three [1993].
Speaker 1: Okay, so there was a bit of an overlap?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so, tell me about that, that time of teaching at NYU?
Speaker 2: Okay, I, I actually taught at NYU and at New York Law School [New York, New York] and now I'm currently doing a different kind of course at Columbia [Columbia Law School, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Columbia, right.
Speaker 2: But the one at NYU and at New York Law School, were both premised on the intersection of race and law in American society.  It was a seminar course in which we talked about how race impacts on people's lives, both intentionally and by way of structures.  And so, it, it explored how, how the factor of race can impact on whether or not you get arrested, whether or not you get charged, whether or not you get convicted, whether or not you get housing, whether or not a toxic dump is placed in your neighborhood. And in some respects it was related to some of the things I did under poverty and justice, that is to understand that race often is broader in its impact on people's lives than the individual thing that you're talking about at any given time.  And basically the idea was if, if the students could understand, to some extent, the--not only how those structures work today to impede peoples progress but how historically they've worked--we spent a lot of time on history in talking about the historical aspects of race in America--and to understand that it's, it's in our Constitution that race, race played a part in how we were going to look at representation and the structural nature of racism, I think, was part of the theme so that if you, you first have to recognize that there are problems before you can address the problems.  So we had a, sort of a self selected group of individuals who had come through the classes while I was there and I think we had a number of good discussions and I think, I've always been interested in sort of the, the young minds.  I wasn't that much older back than but at least the idea of trying to interact with young minds, whether it's doing, teaching a course or interacting with the interns at LDF [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] or working now and talking to the students at CUNY Law School [City University of New York School of Law, Long Island City, New York], getting a lot of interns into my chambers, just talking about how to address, how to think, how to analyze problems, how to deconstruct issues and, and to try to work for change.  And so, I've always thought that sort of, an aspect of, you know, making change through other people.
Story_ID: 654352
Speaker 1: And so, what has the racial composition been in these classes, at the various law schools where you've taught?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the good thing is that the classes have been--it hasn't been just minority students, not just people of color.  I think we've had, we've always had really great students who wanted to do good and I think sort of a model for institutions like the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.], you have people of goodwill, of various races, genders, coming together to try to make the world a better place.  And so, the interest in how race played a, and continues to play a part in what happens in our institutions, it's important to have people to make that not a monolithic problem.  It's not a black problem, it's an issue that needs to be addressed by our country from all individuals.  And so, we, we've, we've done a very good job of getting people who are interested and as I said, who are very diverse.
Speaker 1: And I asked that question in part because as we look in contemporary times, there, there are a lot of people who are not minority, well meaning, who don't understand what some of the issues of race are and who often say, "You're just complaining too much, this is past, that's in the past, why can't you, why do you have to keep complaining."  I mean, the complaint mantra seems to be something that people, well meaning people, sometimes say that we've gotten past that and I'm curious as to know, especially since you are dealing with the law, but as you're teaching these classes, how do you, how do you open someone's eyes when, it may not have been their experience, they--a lot of people do not believe that there, that racial tension still exists or that their racial biases that are institutional racial biases that still exist; and, you know, first step is opening people's eyes.  How do you do that?
Story_ID: 654353
Speaker 1: I think one of the reasons that, to have a historical component in, in any course that you're teaching about racial structures in America is that you can show the parallels to the structures that were in place when there was intentional overt racial discrimination, gender discrimination and the structures that are in place now and why, whether it's a glass ceiling or some other impediment to people progressing to their full potential, you first have to get people to recognize that there is a problem. And some of that is just people just don't know a lot of things and one of the major components of any educational process is to make sure that people have facts.  We, we have so many areas and opportunities for people to get information, but people don't get facts. And they're, they're in an echo chamber, and so they just don't know facts.  Sometimes the best thing to do is just to lay out the facts for people. And I gave a speech in which I was talking about the difference between the incarceration rates for African Americans and whites in America and, and I converted it to a situation. I said, "Well, you know, if the incarceration rates for blacks was the same as the incarceration rate for whites, they'll be six hundred thousand fewer African Americans in jails." Six hundred thousand people.  I mean, you know, these--I mean, you know, is people would be--I mean, my idea is to present facts in a way that people see it in a different way.  I mean, you could say there's a 1.8 percent incarceration rate and there's a 2.7 percent incarceration rate, people look at that and lawyers don't know numbers but, you know, when you say six hundred thousand people, then you can say, well, think of six hundred thousand people being taken out of black communities around the country.  Think of six hundred thousand people who--that's bigger than Baltimore [Maryland], that's bigger than Atlanta [Georgia]. Six hundred thousand people who, whose earning power is taken away, who are taken out of families.  I think once, if you can get people to, to see that the problem is, may be more than, you know, just a bunch of numbers that people turn around. Even when people talk about unemployment, what does that mean?  So we, we're, the policy people are very much into, you know, these percentages and numbers but they, they don't mean anything.  You need to make things real to people and I think what we try to do in, in the class is to, to talk about real examples, what their impact is, what they mean. And it's sort of like--what, what you're taught in law is, first you want to convince the people that you ought to win, then you get to the part of them figuring out why you ought to win. And, you know, so a lot of it is understanding the historical aspects of it, understanding that the, the prisons really came into prominence in, in many of our states when they eliminated the slavery in those places (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Slavery, sure.
Story_ID: 654354
Speaker 1: Well, and, and I'll play devil's advocate here, during the presidential campaign for '16 [2016], there are a whole lot of people who, they may not have said six hundred thousand but what was said is, "Well, you know, there's so much crime because you all are criminals and that's why there's so many more of you in jail," and it was u- that information, those facts were used in a distorted way.
Speaker 2: Well, again, I think that's the, the difference between facts, I mean for example, there's no evidence that drug use--I mean, let's talk about nonviolent drug use.  There's no evidence that drug use is more prevalent in black communities than in white communities.  So, why are there more incarcerated black people for drug crimes and what does that mean?  I mean, is it a, what makes it a distortion?  Part of that is understanding the criminal justice system, deconstructing the criminal justice system when people, you know, are, when, when people think you're more suspicious, they're more likely to accost you and, you know, if you, if you took a thousand people in any community at random and searched them, you'd probably find drugs.  When you have something such as stop and frisk where, you know, you're, basically what you're doing is you're stopping large numbers of young men on the streets in certain communities, well, you will find things, but if you stop large numbers of young men in any community, randomly, you'd probably find drugs.  So, getting people to understand that, you know, some people have come to recognize it.  The litigation in New York got people to understand how, that meant that, you know, 97 percent of the people stopped were just people going about their lives, how that impacts on those people, and impacts on communities.  One of the most--it, it--you hit on a, one of the most difficult issues and that is, people assume that the criminal justice system is getting people who--it's working fairly.  That is, if you believe it's working fairly, then if it gets disproportionately more people, then that's just because they're doing it.  How do you get people to, to recognize that that's not the case?  Again, some of the facts have to do with looking at how, how the criminal process works.  How, for example, if, if--and I, and I guess, we don't want this to become just about the criminal justice system but, for example, the bail system.  If you get arrested and you, and you don't have the means to, to post bail--and it could be a small amount, I mean, people don't realize that you could have, you say a hundred dollars of bail, and it'll keep some people in jail. But you have people who are pleading guilty because, if they plead guilty, they will get out.  If they plead guilty, they have a criminal record.  If they have a criminal record, everything that they do after that is colored by the fact they have a criminal record.  They're more likely to serve time, they're mo- they're less likely to be able to go to trial.  They're less likely to get a good plea bargain.  So, so poverty impacts on who, who ultimately has criminal records and who ultimately gets in prison because, you know, what happens is that you get a better break if you have never been arrested or if you've never been convicted but if you're poor, you know, you have a job that is an hourly job, you know, it happens even in the federal court and we don't have the money bail system but somebody comes before us and they're, what they want to do is they want to get out because you, you don't want to miss a day of work but all of these things keep, once you get into the, the criminal justice system, all of those things start to make your life more difficult and make it more likely that the next encounter you have, whether or not it's your fault, will lead to a worse result.  And so, sometimes it's, you know, we, we pick, we'll take it step by step and show that each stage of the process, how the things, the structures, can impact who gets arrested, who gets in the system, who gets a record and that ultimately it, it just creates numbers that, if we were to go back and not incarcerate those individuals who are nonviolent, it would just remarkably change the, the makeup of the prisons and the communities that they've been taken from.
Story_ID: 654355
Speaker 1: Let me begin by saying that, as, as I said, I--if there's, if there's one passion I have, it's young people. And, you know, I, I think, from--my philosophy goes something like, today's future is tomorrow's history. And what I mean by that is, today's future are the young people who, whose minds you can impact and whose thought processes you can--to get working in a way that's going to effect change and that future, that's why that's tomorrow's history because they become the history makers.  You know, my, my model is, you need to, to think in terms of training a new generation. And there's two reasons, at least two, I guess we should always say there's at least two.  One, I found that, you know, if you're one person, you have limited ability to do things. So you, I mean, one thing that the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] taught me is that you need a lot of people to fight against injustice. And so you need to train people to do that.  There are some extraordinary people who are so inspirational that, you know, their lives can inspire people to do things.  I'm not one of those people, I'm a teacher kind of person, you know, and so--and the first thing is, you just need more people out there.  And secondly, what you find if you study this from a historical point of view is that these things don't go away.  That is, you don't win a battle and then rest on your laurels.  These things keep coming back. And I'll be older, gone, and you need people.  You need to have a younger generation understanding the problems, being ready and willing to deal with those problems.  And so I think it's important to look forward, to look to those people to make sure that they have the capability, have the information, have the skills, to do that.  I have--some judges don't believe in interns.  I have had more than two hundred interns, about forty law clerks.  One of the things that we do is, we have lunches together. And in those lunches we talk about issues.  I have had people who've gone through my chambers as an intern and meet them a decade later and they talk about the things that we discussed and how it impacted on their lives. Because, you know, we could, we could talk, you know, about what's on Netflix, but when issues come up, it's important, not just to, to be aware of them, but to talk about them and to understand them in a way that when you go out there, you're prepared for dealing with, with the problem.
Story_ID: 654356
Speaker 1: And so we spent a considerable amount of time talking about strategies and how to approach things. And I, for example, I told them that one of the things that I did when I was teaching my class is, I read the, I read these very racist things that had, you know, I'm reading from a book and I'm reading all these racist things and I said, "Well, would you, would you listen to anything else that this person had to say?"  And, you know, so they said, "No, no.  Somebody that racist, we wouldn't listen to anything else that that person would have to say."  And so, I used to do this for my class, and the class would be, and we'd discuss it and why they wouldn't listen to this person who was racist and was clearly racist stuff and I said, "Well, let me read to you something else that this person read.  We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal."  You see, a lot of people don't know [President] Thomas Jefferson's history.  I mean they know that some of the thing about the slaves and the Sally Hemings thing but, you know, some of the things that he wrote in the 'Notes for--on Virginia' ['Note on the State of Virginia,' Thomas Jefferson], you know, if you read them today, people would say, well, this is probably not somebody who we want to deal with as their original intent because it's not really what we want. But what--but the point of it is that, I tell, I bring this out to my, my students, interns today to let them know that, you know, it's important if you know things when you're making arguments because people will say things and they're just not true. And you need to be prepared, you need to, you need to come into these encounters, you need to read and you need to read something outside of reading the, the websites that you go to and you need to also never accept the fact, just because you read it, go back and try to find primary sources. And my wife's [Kathleen Ellis] a librarian and she's, she, she would say how, you know, people would Google things and, or they would go to whatever their favorite dot com is and nobody would ever look at the facts.  I mean, so many things were said in this, in this last election and the thing that disturbed me the most is that people were saying things which were just factually not true and if you, and if you're saying things that are factually not true, you cannot come to a solid--sound conclusions.  And so, if, if you have a situation in which the, you know, there are young people involved, then, you know, I'm there, I like to, you know, take the opportunity to, to say things to those young people to, to just give them, you know, tell them your story, even.  I mean, sometimes that's all you really need to do and, you know, some people will listen to your story and they'll hear that, you know, you were a poor kid and you, you're now a judge--just the possibility of it.
Story_ID: 654357
Speaker 1: You know, I--you mentioned earlier--well, a number of things--that the, the short term memory is, is part of a challenge that we have. But you mentioned, stop and frisk and how it was proven, it's not worked in a way that it was intended.  There's talk of Giuliani [Rudy Giuliani] being attorney general.  It was under his watch too stop and frisk was instituted and I just wonder from a perspective of, both the citizen and a judge, how, how do we raise awareness about these through lines?
Speaker 2: Well, I think citizens should--I mean, awareness is an, and I think what the lawsuit did is it raised awareness of what really was happening. And that is that you can, you can look at us, you know, okay, so weapons were found, drugs were found, but at what costs?  It is, it's certainly, as I said, I think if you randomly picked a thousand people in a neighborhood, you'd find that people were doing things they shouldn't be doing. But the cost is something which you don't often hear about, how people's faith, I mean, I had a nephew who called me once and said that he's walking down the street and the police took all of the young men and said, "Empty your pockets." And here I am a federal judge and he wanted to know what could he do. And I didn't really have a good answer for him. But this is, this is, this is what's happening to people, what's happening to people in communities and I don't know how in the long run finding some drugs on people is going to counterbalance the fact that people will not feel that the, the justice system means justice for them.  So I think knowledge and education of the, of the people as a, people as a whole, I think, has the potential to let people know that this is just not working, at least not the way it's supposed to work.
Story_ID: 654358
Speaker 1: And, you know, this, this--just for point of reference for this interview, we are in November of '16 [2016], you know, a few days after the presidential election where Donald Trump [President Donald John Trump] is now the--(laughter) hard to say, to be the president. But people are, people are grappling with what it means, including legally what it means, you know, what it means for people of color, what it means for people who are poor, things that you have discussed just a few minutes ago.  Legally, how do people protect themselves, the poor, African Americans, minorities, religious, people with different religious views when, when it looks as if many of the things that you worked for, for example, LDF [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.], could be--could shift.
Speaker 2: Well, I think--well, let me just say.  I don't want to contradict what you say but I think it's wrong to think of people protecting themselves. Because I think that the idea of personalizing this is what is part of the problem, that people looking out for their own interest.  I think the question should be, how can we protect the people who are unable to protect themselves.  I, I think one of the, the disconcerting things about the, the tenor of some of the discussions that happen in the election is, people seem to be more inner directed than outer directed and so much of the dialog had to do with, what can I do for myself.  You know, I remember, I mean I was young but I remember the speech, "Ask not what my country can do for me, ask what I can do for my country." People should be asking, what can I do for those who are less fortunate?  What can I do to change the dynamics that some people are, have an inability to, to have a decent meal.  What can I do?  And so I think if we leave the people who are powerless to defend themselves, we've already lost the battle. And I think what we need is for people to be outraged and to feel that if, if you, if you do something against those who are, who don't have money, who don't have power, who don't have jobs, who don't have housing, then it's our collective responsibility if we're going to be the kind of nation that we ought to be, to make sure that somebody protects them because they have the inability to do that.
Story_ID: 654359
Speaker 1: And so, I think what we need is to have a change in the, in the whole idea of the way the, the nation perceives itself.  I mean, part of this whole idea of being insular, of thinking that other people are out to, to do harm to you, we've got to sort of reverse that kind of thinking and much of what we've, we did at the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.], was really directed to our people who, you know, they didn't have a voice and we gave them voice.  They didn't have power, and we gave them power.  They didn't have means, and we found means to help them.  And I think we need to have--half the people voted one way and half voted another way.  We need to have the dialog be about that more outer directed.  It, it seems consistent with what people's rhetoric is about what kind of a nation we're supposed to be and that is a nation that looks at how we deal with the least among us. I mean, that is the, you know, much of the religious rhetoric is, you know, we need to, we need to protect those people and we'll be judged by how we deal with those who are the less fortunate.  And so, it's sort of, like if you were dealing with martial arts.  You take people's words and you say, okay, if you really mean that, if you really mean that this is what guides you, then what does that mean in terms of your behavior?  Does that mean that you can possibly have people who are hungry and not do anything?  Does that mean that you can possibly have people who are unclothed and not do anything?  Could that possibly mean that there are people who are sick and you don't do anything about it?  It, it's--we put so much money into so many things and we still have not come to the conclusion as a nation that there are basic human needs that people ought to be entitled to.  And so, I think, as I said, the question ought to be, and we ought to, to--and there are people of good will who, who will coalesce around the notion that we need to protect those who would otherwise be thrown to the wolves.
Speaker 2: (Pause) Thank you for explaining that.

Speaker 1: Judge Ellis [HistoryMaker Ronald L. Ellis], as you look at your career, which has been very full, what do you hope that your legacy is?
Speaker 2: I think, consistent to what I said before about young people, I think that if, if--you know, some people talk about paying it forward or some people talk about taking a hand and reaching back and helping those, I would, I would like for people to, to think that whatever advantages, whatever positions I've been able to achieve, I didn't think of those as something which were uniquely mine, something that I had to guard and, and, and think of myself as separate and apart, but it's a, it's a call to share.  I mean, I've always believed that it's, it's almost a cliche but, if you're given something, then it really is your duty to, to make sure that you spread that to other people.  If it's knowledge, you should spread that knowledge.  And so I think, to a large part, I would like my legacy to be the, all of the young people who had been through, through any of the things that what, my life touched their life, that they look back and think that that was a positive, that the conversations we had, the things that we shared, that they look back and say, I'm glad that I had the opportunity to interact with Judge Ellis.

Speaker 1: Do you have any regrets?
Speaker 2: I, I think the short answer to that is, I think every, every day, it seems I ask myself, you know, given what I've been blessed with, have I used the talents, the abilities that I have to the best advantage? And I think sometimes it feels like, well, I could have done more, and sometimes I seem to get credit for things and I think I've done very little. And I, I think, whenever I have those regrets, the next time somebody asked me to do something, I'm just more inclined to say, yes.  And so, I think it may be, you know, you can, you can take things that might seem negative but you need to turn them into something positive and as long as I feel that I could do more, I think I need to have that feeling and it spurs me on to, when somebody calls to say, "Okay, yes, I'll go ahead and I'll do that."

Speaker 1: And you, you've talked about mentoring so many young people throughout your career.  What advice do you have to offer to a young person, especially a young person of color who's interested in entering the field of law today?
Speaker 2: Well, what--I tell people that, you know, you can go into law for many different reasons but it's a skill that you can use to do good.  You have, you have people who will look up to you.  You have people who will respect you.  If you don't use all those positive attributes to make the world a better place, then you've wasted all the things that were, that had been given to you.  I say, it doesn't matter what you do in the law, you know, you can, you can go into direct services, you can be a public interest lawyer, you can be a corporate lawyer, but in all aspects of that, you have to keep in mind that your role ought to be to make the world better, and it ought to be to make the world better for someone other than yourself and to never forget that nobody makes it on their own. And that when I help you, it's not because it's, it's necessarily you, you're the only person that is going to be able to, to carry on, it's because each of us has the responsibility to make sure that things don't end, that it keeps going forward.  I mean, people talk about half full and half empty, you should have the, the view that until the glass is full, then your work is not done.  And so, however you can, do what you can where you are with what you have.

Speaker 1: Is there anything you'd like to share that I have not asked you?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know, I'm not sure how much we talked about my family but I, I think the--we talk about things that you're proud of.  I am proud that my children, my two sons, have the sensibilities of feeling that they want to do good. That--both in terms of how they interact with people that they know, and even strangers.  You know, they will, they will even do things that surprise me. I mean I remember once my wife [Kathleen Ellis] and I were walking with my younger son [Jelani Ellis] and there was a, there was an elderly man, he was struggling to bring something to a recycling area and my son spontaneously went over and asked him could he help him. And I think that's the kind of thing that, you know, both my sons do.  I mean, it's like they, they feel like they've had the opportunities, they actually both went to Ivy League colleges and came out without debts so, but, but they both have a sensibility for doing right.  I think that my wife helped instill in them the, the idea that yo- family's important and that doing good is important.  And so, I think whatever energies I have, it's, it comes from a family that shares that.  I, I told you I give a talk to the CUNY Law School [City University of New York School of Law, New York, New York] each year coming in.  My wife and I had gone to Spain for our twenty-fifth anniversary and she scheduled the, the trip around me coming back to CUNY to give the talk.  And so, I mean, and, you know, I mean, I didn't ask her to do it, but knowing how that was a part of what I- was important to me, despite the fact that I think if she could have, we could have stayed longer.  You know, I mean, that kind of support from your family allows you to do a lot of things that you wouldn't otherwise do.
Speaker 1: What, what is your son's work now?
Speaker 2: The younger one is a second grade teacher which, in itself, is a challenge. And my older son, [Jamil Ellis], now I'm going to forget the name of the organization he works for but, BlocPower.  It's an organization that works to, to deal with communities to bring about change, both in housing and other kinds of grants to change the, the lives of people in those communities.
Speaker 1: So they're both doing things that make you proud?
Speaker 2: Yes.

Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Judge Ellis [HistoryMaker Ronald L. Ellis], money and the law, there's a commonly held perception that, that people who have more wealth or resources have a better, you know, results from the legal system.  What are your thoughts on that and what needs, if anything, to be done to help balance that so that people who don't have money have a fairer chance?
Speaker 2: I think that--and it's been said quite often that it would be better to be rich and guilty than innocent and poor if you want a better outcome in the criminal justice system. And I think to a large extent, that gets played out so often.  From the very first decision about bail, if, if you get out on bail, you just, you're likely to have a better outcome.  I think we need to--we are--while there's a right to counsel, the amount of resources that are put into the, the, the public defender system, the federal defender system, compared to how much is put in the prosecution, is just disproportionate.  I think if, if we're committed to having people have good outcomes in law, we should be concerned about whether or not they have the resources to defend themselves and to make innocent until proven guilty a reality, we should not begrudge the amount of money we put into defense.  I think sometimes people give the impression that people are just guilty and so why should we put more money into defense.  I, I think, if you're going to balance the scales of justice, you do need to have just appreciation that adequate counsel is, is just an important aspect of making the right to justice a reality.

Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  The other one, and I know this is a broad or deep topic maybe, but just the laws in institution, like many institutions, how well is it keeping up with technological and social change?  So many institutions seem to be overwhelmed or being overwhelmed by that, and I just wondered your thoughts on that.
Speaker 2: Well, the--law is, is more like an ocean liner than the speedboat. And because of that, it doesn't change as quickly.  We have--the younger, the younger people coming into the law, they are, they're more equipped to deal with electronic data information and look-up.  I think the concern is that it's--they not depend on that so much that they lose their ability to think and that winning a case is more than coming up with the right words for a, a data search but I think the younger people are, are comfortable with the, the whole electronic process.  As I said, I'm concerned that those kinds of sensibilities might lead them not to, to focus on what, I think, is the most important thing about anything that a lawyer does and that's the people involved.
