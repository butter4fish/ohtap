Speaker 1: Alright, my name is Larry Crowe. I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers. Our videographer is Matthew Hickey. Ma'am, can you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My full name is Sharon, S-H-A-R-O-N, Loretta, L-O-R-E-T-T-A, Haynie, H-A-Y-N-I-E.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story behind your name?
Speaker 2: All that I know--you're talking about the last name? Well, let me, let me start with my given name (laughter), Sharon, first. My parents were very young when they had me, were about to give birth. And my mother [Inez Penn Haynie Dodson] actually was going to name me Gertrude after the name of my, one of my father's [William Henry Haynie Jr.] girlfriends. And I think, and her, her stepmother, in her wisdom saying, that does not make sense to do that. And she asked me to name my middle name in honor of my grandmother, my paternal grandmother, whose name is Loretta Haynie. So they gave me a name, Sharon. And all of the names for my siblings were--well, my mother said, sort of common names. She didn't want any of us to have nicknames, so she chose names where intentionally, we wouldn't get a nickname out of it. So that's how Sharon came, told you about Loretta. And Haynie, from my understanding--so this is my father's side of the family, every single person I've met, either black or white who has their name H-A-Y-N-I-E spelled Haynie, 'cause another common way of it being spelled is H-A-N-E-Y, ultimately has roots in the northern neck of Virginia. And my sense is that the blacks who were named Haynie were slaves, and it's clear from, if you look at the coloring of my father's side of the family, that they probably came from some miscegenation with their masters, but they were named after their masters, the Haynie's. And from what I've gathered, because unintentionally, I was contacted by a couple of Haynie's, one who found my name in a search. He was a scientist at Queens University in the U.K. and said, you know, I notice from your science, your area that, you know, maybe we're related. You know, my family originally comes from Virginia. And I just had a big smile when I read the note because, you know, as he was describing, you know, that we may come from the family lines. And I said, you know, I think we definitely come, historical origins from the same region, but relationship is master and slave. And so every now and then I do get connected, not so much with him, but another member of the family who's a historian and trying, you know, keeping together the archives, not of the slave side of Haynie's, but the white Haynie's in that region. So they, apparently, their origins are from England, and that's as much as I know because, you know, again, that's their side. I don't even know, I know my aunt has attempted to go three generations beyond my grandparents. And we're stuck. We don't, we don't know. So we just know they came--they were slaves in the northern neck of Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Date, November 6, 1955 in Baltimore, Maryland.
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: I'm a research scientist and I usually use a generic title, principal investigator, and just a general member of the scientific ranks at DuPont.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, now, you're a chemist by training, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and would you also consider yourself a material scientist?
Speaker 2: I would say probably biochemist, yeah, be more closely aligned with biochemistry than material science, but I've certainly, touched it.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: The 24 of March, 2013.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time, and you don't have to give your address, but--
Speaker 2: Okay, we're at my home in Center City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Story_ID: 626595
Speaker 1: Alright, now, before we go into depth, we've got five, lightweight questions that we ask as kind of a warm up, and they only require a short answer. The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Purple.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Fall.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I used to say, "It beats walking the streets" (laughter). That comes from the 'Mod Squad,' (laughter) but I stopped saying that when people of newer generations look at me like I'm from outer space, and they don't get the context. So I don't say--I don't have a favorite phrase anymore (laughter).
Speaker 1: A lot of things beat that, so (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 626596
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history. I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but separately, so we can keep 'em straight.
Speaker 2: Good.
Speaker 1: So we're gonna start with your mother. Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Her full name Inez, I-N-E-Z, I guess her maiden name, Penn, P-E-N-N. She always wants Haynie, H-A-Y-N-I-E, and her last name is Dodson, now, legally, D-O-D-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: 09-02-1938.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was she born?
Speaker 2: In Baltimore, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family? How far back can you trace them, and are there any interesting stories about what they were doing?
Speaker 2: So my mother's side of the family, my grandfather was one of sixteen children born in British West Indies. And he was the only one of those sixteen children born of his father, who immigrated to the United States. All the others either stayed, his siblings either stayed in Turks and Caicos, which is still a British colony or they immigrated into the Bahamas. That was far (laughter) for them. So it actually, the Turks and Caicos are to the East of, of the Bahamas. So that's where they immigrated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 626597
Speaker 1: So yes, it is that place. That was in, he lived in Providenciales, yeah. It's a group of islands. There're six inhabited islands for the Turks and Caicos.
Speaker 2: How do you spell that?
Speaker 1: Where my grandfather was from?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Turks and Caicos.
Speaker 1: T-U-R-K-S, and Caicos, C-A-I-C-O-S.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's what I thought, but--okay, but--alright. Alright, so, and your grandfather's name was William Penn, right?
Speaker 1: Correct.
Speaker 2: Now, this is very interesting. You're living in Philadelphia, and your grandfather's name was William Penn?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I know. It's funny because there are, I've given a couple of small fellowships, you know, for, stipends for graduate student poster sessions or if I have a memoriam award during Easter or whatever at my church, not too far from here, and I will list the person in "honor of" and I'll say, William Penn. And I know that most people are thinking it's the William Penn who established and founded Philadelphia, but no. And so sometimes I might edify that statement by, you know, of Lorimers, you know, Turks and Caicos, just to make sure that it's not the historic William Penn that they're thinking of (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, that is interesting. Okay, so your grandfather, William Penn, he was born in Turks and Caicos, one of sixteen children, but he's the only one who came to the United States.
Speaker 1: Correct.
Speaker 2: And what brought him to the United States?
Speaker 1: He was a British Merchant Marine. My grandfather left, as I said, he had a third-grade education, and I've actually been to the school he, he went to in Lorimers, Middle Caicos. He, they had contract boats from what I understand from one of my great aunts, one of his sisters, that used to skirt the coast of the Turks and Caicos, looking for young men to take to work either on plantations back, you know, in the United States. And he ultimately became a British Merchant Marine. And so he sailed on the high seas and eventually came to the U.S. via Baltimore [Maryland] as a port of entry in 1918.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And remember, my grandfather was born in 1888.
Story_ID: 626598
Speaker 1: I guess he wasn't around, I mean--he spent long, quite a bit of time away from home.
Speaker 2: No, so, this was how that, their marriage, my mother [Inez Penn Haynie Dodson] and her siblings came about. My grandfather [William Penn] was a Merchant Marine. He had one child, my Uncle Willie, before he left Turks and Caicos. And I guess he had him when he was 18, and then apparently, he didn't marry his, the mother of his son, Elisa. So he left and was on the seas and was in the British Merchant Marine unmarried until he came to Baltimore. And so he came to Baltimore, met a woman, Mary Unella, my grandmother, my maternal grandmother who was widowed. Her husband had apparently died in World War I.
Speaker 1: And her name is Mary--
Speaker 2: Her name is Mary Unella. It's Penn, but at the time, she was Mary Unella Banner.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how do you spell Unella?
Speaker 2: U-N-E-L-L-A. Her given--her surname before marriage was Defraitus (ph.). She came from St. John's Parish in Antigua of the British West Indies.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was an only child of Joseph and Rachel in Antigua.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So they met and married, so my Aunt Rachel and Aunt Clem, we share, you know, the same maternal root so my grandfather adopted them 'cause he raised them. They were tiny kids. And then they had five children who were born in Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, was there like a West Indian community in Baltimore?
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: Around the Episcopal church or something--
Speaker 2: Around Lafayette Square which is where my mother was raised. And my grandfather was--so, my grandfather was, you know, and now you realize he was old when he had my mother. He was fifty. And by the time my--so when my mother was growing up, he was still working. He was a chef at the Hi-Ho. But my, so he was stationed in Baltimore. So for the raising of all seven kids, my grandfather was very much present and was the anchor. My grandmother was there. She was a homemaker, but she was very sickly, apparently, and I--we can figure this out later, retrospectively, but they all--she, like some other members of my family, had a heart-related problem. So she died a few months after my mother was born. So my grandfather actually, you know, raised her, you know, with members of the community and my mother's older siblings, you know, played a role as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: But he was very much settled. He was, you know, he worked a lot, so he wasn't necessarily present in the home, my mother can recall because he, you know, he was a cook at what was then, it was called the "HiHo", H-I-H-O Restaurant, downtown Baltimore, near the quote "block." But it's, it was just a few blocks from City Hall. So it was a favorite eating place for a lot of the politicians, the mayor.
Speaker 1: Now, does it have anything to do with those crackers, Hi-Ho crackers?
Speaker 2: Oh, you know what? I don't know. I do remember those.
Speaker 1: I just wondered. Yeah, they still sell 'em, I just wondered if--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know if it does or not.
Speaker 1: --the restaurant had some connection to the crackers and--
Speaker 2: No, the restaurant was in a hotel. I mean that, I don't--it doesn't exist anymore, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 626599
Speaker 1: Yeah, so granddaddy [William Penn], he was very present and in my life he was present because he was one of those auxiliary people who helped my mother, as a single mother [Inez Penn Haynie Dodson], raise us. And so he would take the bus from East Baltimore, and come over to, you know, our neighborhood in West Baltimore and help, you know, be there for us after school. And he was, as a chef, he's the person who was, where we got really good cooked meals. My mother wasn't much of a cook. And my brothers actually learned how to cook based on my grandfather's model or role model for them.
Speaker 2: So he set a good example, I guess, and that's why you name things for him?
Speaker 1: He very much is an important person for me. I mean he's a person for whom I dedicated my thesis, my Ph.D. thesis. One, because I think he set an expectation of, you know, trying to achieve and move beyond what we'd had in, you know, as opportunity in our lives. He, based on--well, independent of one's performance for the grandchildren that he had, you know, I still remember how much my grandfather got in social security every month. It was one hundred sixty-one dollars. And every single one of his grandkids still got a five dollars, you know, every month from him, which was a huge offering, you know, just to, just to give. But more importantly, for me, once I had gotten to a point where it was clear that academically, I was going to be a good achiever, he felt it was very important for him to make a big sacrifice as a way of giving a gift to me of, of holding up an expectation of potential. So that's when, in sixth grade, he bought an, a portable typewriter which back then, given what he had, it was like giving someone a Porsche, you know (laughter). And he had to buy it on time. So there was a company, time means, back then it was equivalent to credit. So he went to the H. W. Checkered Company which was next to the Frederick Douglas High School on Hilton Avenue in Baltimore, across from the Mondawmin Mall, and this was a story, sort of a, you know, a store that had all kinds of items. And he, you know, you had a little passbook, and so he bought the typewriter. It was in a blue case. So, you now, it was one of these, you know, the portable typewriters were as big as the original ones that, you know, the Royals and the Smith-Coronas. It was about this high, sort of sleek. It was in a blue case. And he gave it to me Christmas of, in sixth grade. So that would have been like '66 [1966], maybe a year, two years after I came back from Germany, '66 [1966], '67 [1967]. My mother was livid (laughter), which is an understatement because, you know, you know, she knew, you know, this is her father and struggling, and his money, for him to make such a sacrifice to buy this money for, you know, an eleven year old to her didn't make sense. But, you know, I understood what he wanted, and what he said to me that Christmas, that "I want you to take this typewriter. You're doing good in school, and I want you to learn how to type so that you can come, get a good job at Social Security, as a clerk typist." And, you know, that was his dream. That was his aspiration. So, it was a symbol of aspiration to move up in the world. So I understood what, what he was trying to say. So, and I, you know, I valued that typewriter. I ended up--because we used it a lot. You know, this was in the midst of Vietnam War. My father was in Vietnam. He did two tours in Vietnam, and my brother and I, just to earn some pennies, I mean we would sell, you know, cards. We would, we had a little local neighborhood newspaper, and we would use the typewriter to type articles and sell it to neighbors for five or ten cents an issue. So I used that typewriter, you know, religiously, up until high school. And then I got a new one from a friend of my mother's to go off to college, but for those six years, that, that typewriter was a very important asset for me.
Story_ID: 626600
Speaker 1: Tell us something about your mother's [Inez Penn Haynie Dodson]--now, she grew up in Baltimore, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And what were her stories of growing up, and what did she aspire to do?
Speaker 2: So, the, I think the piece of richness from my mother growing up in Baltimore was the fact that, you know, as a consequence of segregation, the black communities--and I'll say communities because there was an East Baltimore and West Baltimore and you were fairly cohesive. We didn't have access to, you know, extensive housing options outside of the city and suburbs. And so during the time she was growing up, you know, what she always talked to us about was the fact that, you know, people who were poor, workers lived next--across the street from people who were doctors or principals at schools. And the tight integrity of the community in terms of being intimately, physically next to each other was an important aspect that gave her a window into, just knowing people, a variety of different journeys, you know, as she grew up. And there was a wealth in that. And people looked out after each other no matter what your circumstance. And for her, it was very important because--and her mother [Mary Unella Banner] died. My grandmother died in 1939, just seven months after my mother was born. And so those women in the community were important because they, you know, were, you know, mothers for her. And some of them, I had the privilege of knowing and seeing them as part of my extended family, from Mrs. Essie Hughes, who was a prominent, one of the first black principals in the City of Baltimore, a renowned educator to Mrs. Pearl who was just--who was a homemaker. She did days work, I think, initially, and then was really a homemaker. But, you know, she, you know, had means, but she, you know, these were people who looked after my mother and cared and loved her. And so that's something that she talks about in, you know, when she talks about growing up. And, you know, we still go back to, you know, and visit friends--Sometimes, I go with her, who are still living there in the community. And she's still very tightly connected to everyone who grew up there, I mean in terms of funerals, etc. So I think that piece was important, and when it came, I know for me purchasing my first home, which was actually here in Philadelphia, what was important for her was not the socio-economic community because it was in a very, it was a changing community. It was, to me, Eden. It was a very mixed community, primarily, poor working-class community with some people coming in who were gentrified. But what was important for her, as she sat on the front steps was that it felt very much like the community she grew up in where people cared and looked after each other. And so I think that was important. What she aspired to? Hum, you know, occasionally we've talked about that. She said if she had had a life trajectory that pointed her to college, that maybe she might have done something in a helping profession like teaching. But that didn't happen. So what she was very good at was dance and so I know that she spent basically, a lot of hours, you know, outside of the classroom in dance. I should say--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm just gonna ask what kind of dancing?
Speaker 2: I would say more classical, ballet, yeah. And, in fact, she talks--I wish I knew the name. I know her first name was Ms. Marie. She, her ballet teacher died just three or four years ago. And she talked about these teachers because these were teachers who in a integrated, open society, would have had access to the stage. So they were very important mentors for her. She, I've seen the place where she took her dance instruction. I think it--I'm not sure if it was Druid Hill Avenue, but, you know, these things were very, very important for her. And one other thing about my mother, my mother was skipped. She was very intelligent, and so she skipped three grades. So she was always younger than her contemporaries, her peers in her class. She finished high school in February of 1955, at sixteen. And I was born in November of that year. She was probably, maybe didn't start working for another year or two. And then she worked as a clerk in the Baltimore City Public Hospital [Baltimore, Maryland], which was where I was born. Then later, I can tell you where she--if you wanna hear now. But when we came back from Germany, which is when she split from my father, she went back to that work.
Story_ID: 626601
Speaker 1: I think she [Inez Penn Haynie Dodson] worked for the Baltimore City Sanitation Department, starting off as a clerk, and realized there was no way she was going to be able to afford, you know, supporting four kids unless she found, did something extraordinary. She was always taking Civil Service exams, always one of the highest in the class, in the scoring. But, and she was aspiring for jobs that were, where they didn't have women allowed. And finally, she was one of a class of a group of women in 1967, I think. So she then trained for the Baltimore City public--police department. So my mother was Baltimore City cop for three years.
Speaker 2: Now, that's really remarkable. I mean it's--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Were there any other black female cops on the force when she--
Speaker 1: There were two others.
Speaker 2: Two others, okay. So she was among the first group--
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a, there was a group before them. There were one or two. I can't remember their names. But in her cohort and I'll be able to show you a picture, there were seven, 'cause they made--'cause it was such a big, I mean that's when they had the first critical mass of women police officers trained in Baltimore City. You know, the "Afro" did--both of our Afro-American newspapers had a big splash, and my mother is there, you know, in the center with, holding her gun with the other women. They made big news. One of them still remains, you know, connected with my mother. She touches base at least once a year. She was white, but she, along with some of the black police officers later, you know, filed a suit for discrimination. It was rocky times. You can imagine in the late '60s [1960s]. And my mother has lots of stories that she, I think as a way of probably protecting her own self, it's interesting. You know, I've encountered people who've, they lived through the Holocaust or very traumatic experiences. Usually, about 30 years post that traumatic that they begin to talk about those stories. And there were a couple just anecdotal--I can't even share them because all I know is that I was on a trip traveling with my mother on a chemistry study tour, and the women at a table next to me tapped and said, you really need to interview or talk to your mother about these stories during her police department because, you know, they're pretty incredible. So that's something that, you know, she still, you know, hasn't talked to me personally about.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that can be--I mean that's a very fixed kind of a culture in the police department. And when it's integrated, it really creates a lot of stories--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and issues and--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, you know--
Speaker 1: The department, she was plain-clothed 'cause they didn't allow police women in uniforms then. And she did a lot of drug and prostitution detail.
Story_ID: 626602
Speaker 1: Are there any particular stories that stand out that you can tell us about your mother's--there's one you were mentioning before we, about almost being shot by a cop?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was on a--as I said, my mother did, because of her beauty, she probably got pegged to do drug and prostitution detail as an undercover police officer, and she was in a raid. And apparently, one of the rookie police officers go a little nervous and shot a bullet prematurely. And she said it came whizzing just millimeters past her temple. And, you know, that really shook her. I think she lasted another year or two. There was a lot of corruption, I'm aware of in the police department. And she was--the one little thing, I don't know the details of it, that I know she was encouraged not to, to tell the truth. But my mother is one of these people whose moral compass is as fixed as, you know, a steel rod. And she told them quite clearly, yeah, she was gonna tell everything she knew. But that ultimately led to her looking for--it wasn't that particular incident, but just a whole, the environment. She, the corruption and just not getting a fair deal. She sought work, again taking her expertise. She was, I know she repeatedly was trying for a position as a claims investigator for the City of Baltimore [Maryland] and which she eventually got in 1974, I believe. There was a six-month period where my mother was unemployed when I was in college. But 1974, she got a position as a claims investigator. And I know, and she knows from the, some of her male co-workers that the then supervisor of that unit said it was gonna over his dead body that he was gonna hire a woman. Well, he eventually had to. The city solicitor ordered him to, and my mother was, had the top score in the exam. So, and that became her career. So she was a claims investigator for the next twenty-two years for the City of Baltimore, going out on claims of, you know, for the city in terms of either citizens or city workers, you know, etc., and investigating them. And so she enjoyed that career, which right now, I think somewhere in the '90s [1990s], they started to make a requirement for that position, people with law degrees.
Speaker 1: Yes, so but your mother did the job without any degrees, making it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, that's right.
Speaker 1: --and I suppose--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It's her inherent smarts.
Speaker 1: And if she was doing it, the others certainly were too, you know, so.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: She's a highly intelligent woman.
Story_ID: 626603
Speaker 1: Let me go to your father's side, and then we'll get them together. So, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: William, W-I-L-L-I-A-M, Henry, H-E-N-R-Y, Haynie, H-A-Y-N-I-E, and he's a junior.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: 05-24-1937 [May 24, 1937].
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was he born?
Speaker 2: Baltimore, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. Well, and what can you tell us about your father--well, you told us something about the Haynie's in the beginning--
Speaker 2: They came from the northern neck, yeah, both--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Northern neck of Virginia.
Speaker 2: His mother, my grandmother and my grandfather both came from the northern neck of Virginia. My grandmother from--and my grandfather, from the Whitestone, Virginia area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they eventually immigrated into the Baltimore area.
Speaker 1: Okay, did they immigrate from rural sort of life to--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yes, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well, what did they do? Any stories about their activities on that side?
Speaker 2: My, my grandmother was a, pretty much a homemaker during the time I knew her. She did work when she was older at--it wasn't Provident Hospital, but it, a clinic at a major black hospital in Baltimore [Maryland]. But when I was growing up, I mean my grandmother was pretty much present. She, I would go to her, my grandparents' home for--'cause they were still in the heart of the black community off of Pennsylvania Avenue, not too far from where my mother grew up. But, and I would go to the Y [YMCA] 'cause that was really the only "Y" that was open to me, Druid Hill. So I would go there Saturday morning with my sister to take ballet lessons or piano lessons. And my grandfather did odd jobs, painting, you know, carpentry. He did odd jobs. I don't know if my grandfather had employment with a specific company or whatever. He would just, it was always odd jobs.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: William Henry Haynie, Sr.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, senior, right, you're--you know, after I asked (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, that's okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: And your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Loretta.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right. Alright.
Speaker 2: I don't know if her, if she had a middle name, but her maiden name was Smith. And her last name is Haynie, H-A-Y-N-I-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, so, now what were--so there're no stories about the northern neck of Virginia, what it was like there or--
Speaker 2: Not really, no, the--and, you know, unfortunately, they, you know, they were pretty much in Baltimore when they were fairly young. So I, you know, I have visited Whitestone [Virginia]. We had a family reunion there in 1986. But, you know, my, I don't have any stories to talk of that, that time from my grandmother or my grandfather. And if they would have come, they would have come from my grandmother. My grandfather was--my sense is that the Haynies, he and his siblings were--a couple were garrulous, but pretty, they didn't engage necessarily with each other much and there weren't a lot of stories, unlike on my mother's [Inez Penn Haynie Dodson] side of my family, my grandfather, they--he was a, he was a talker--
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: --a rocking tour, yeah.
Story_ID: 626604
Speaker 1: What did your father [William Henry Haynie Jr.] aspire to do when--
Speaker 2: I know my father, he did say he aspired to go to college. He did have a college--I can't remember what school he had an offer from college. He had, well, he actually--the school that he went to, so he was sort of on a normal track. And I said my mother [Inez Penn Haynie Dodson] was accelerated. She went to Frederick Douglas [High School, Baltimore, Maryland]. My father went to vocational school. He went to--and he did carpentry. I actually had for a long time a coffee table that he made which he had mosaics with their names and our names inscribed in it. But he had a college--an offer to go to college, but I came along. And so that took care of that. And he joined, he enlisted in the military, in the Armed Forces in probably the latter part of 1955.
Speaker 1: So, did he--what branch did he enlist in?
Speaker 2: Army.
Speaker 1: Okay, in the Army, alright. Okay, I think from what you were saying earlier, your parents split up and, when he was--
Speaker 2: After, from Germany, right. So when I was eight, yeah, nine, yeah. So, so growing up--so in those first eight, nine years, I would say--so I know very early, you know, my father was, he did his basic training in Fort Hood [Killeen, Texas]. I think he was in Texas. I, you know, I don't know--so we lived in the first public housing that was built in Baltimore City [Maryland], the Edgar Allen Poe Homes. And I think he was pretty much still in Baltimore, stationed at Fort Meade, but I'm not sure, for most of the time I was, until we went to Germany when I was in seven--when I was seven. We lived in the Poe Homes until I was five or six, till I was six, between five and six. And then we moved to--once my mother had permanent employment, then their income was such that they had to leave the projects, even, you know, it was--which was--I remember my mother saying that was very hard because, you know, the projects for us achieved everything they were supposed to. It as a transition to stability. They were nice apartments, and when she had to leave, you know, it was, it then put her into, you know, a different--we moved into ultimately the neighborhood I grew up in, Edmondson Village area. But the housing was, at least from what my mother said, at least the first house was just, you know, it was a big transition for her coming out of the projects. But she had to because with her work and I guess my father's income as an enlisted soldier, even though it wasn't much, it was above what was the minimum for staying in the projects.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: And so he was in the Armed Services, and we, then when he was tapped to go to Germany--he had already been in Germany for, in Munich probably, at least a half a year, and then the, we came with him so, to join him. So my mother, she was, she was six months pregnant. She took three of us to Munich, Germany, and we were there for two years. And that's when they split.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 1965. So I was nine, nine and a half, just a little more than nine actually 'cause it was in 1965, '65 [1965]. And then my father spent most of his military service outside of Baltimore. I think during the time I was growing up, I think he had a short tour at Fort Meade in transition coming back from Southeast Asia. He had two tours in South--in Vietnam, and then one in Korea, came back briefly to the U.S. and then went to Chicago [Illinois], at Fort Sheridan. And then he finished his military career at Fort Jackson in Columbia, South Carolina where he lives to this day.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how long was he in the military all together?
Speaker 2: Twenty-two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, yeah, '55 [1955], he--so I was, '77 [1977], yeah, I think about twenty-two years.
Speaker 1: I take it he obtained the rank of some sort of top sergeant or something?
Speaker 2: He was, yeah, yeah, he was a Master Sergeant, I think when he retired.
Story_ID: 626605
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities and this dispositions, their sense of humor, what they look like, what they walk like and talk like, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My mother [Inez Penn Haynie Dodson].
Speaker 1: Okay, why?
Speaker 2: First, although I don't have my mother's features--I do have the hair coloring (laughter). So I can't tell you how many times I've been--and my mother actually is very youthful looking, and I still think she's extremely attractive, that I've been mistaken for her. I've, you know, I was just at my uncle's yesterday clearing up, you know, his estate, and his neighbor, Mr. Roberts, called me, Inez, and his wife said, no, it's not Inez. It's the daughter, Sharon. So there's something in terms of my, my hair coloring that's definitely reminiscent of my mother. I think a sense of rightedness in terms of how you confront the world, I get, I inherit from my mother. I would like to say I inherited a sense of grace, just dealing with the hand you're given in a way that, without a lot of drama (laughter). I can think of a couple of very memorable instances for me which I think, for me, seared an impression in me that is long lasting, and I hold onto it, that my mother dealt with that has been sort of a compass for me in terms of trying to emulate or live into, a listener. I think those are some of the key qualities from my mother.
Speaker 1: Now, did either parent exhibit a curiosity around science?
Speaker 2: No. My mother's open to it, in the sense that, so when I started traveling with a group of friends, these chemistry study tours, the--you know, I invited my mother to go along, travel. Her husband did not fly, and so her opportunity to travel came through me. So any opportunity I was traveling either for work, on professional business or just for pleasure, my mother was the obvious traveling buddy. And when these chemistry study tours came apart, I mean she very much enjoys, you know, it as well. So, but in terms of their just general interests in science, no, no. In my immediate family, I was the--you know, among my siblings I grew up with, no, I was the only one.
Story_ID: 626606
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your siblings. Can you give us how many and their order and name them from top to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Okay, sure. So I'm the oldest. My brother next to me is Michael, M-I-C-H-A-E-L, Eric, E-R-I-C, Haynie, H-A-Y-N-I-E. Michael just turned fifty-five. He was born on the 20th of March, 1958. And Michael and I were pretty much paired throughout growing up. You know, I still have memories, my senior year in high school and Michael was probably a sophomore in high school. We would be up late at night. We'd do our ritual popping of popcorn on the stove, and we'd--over the kitchen or the dining room table, those were the only studies we had, we'd work on our homework till late at night. And so in temperament, the two of us were fairly close. Then after Michael is my sister, Michelle, M-I-C-H-E-L-L-E. So those two, so Michael got the nickname, Mike (laughter), so he's called Mike. That's his short name. And my sister, Michelle, while she was growing up was called Mickie, and her middle name is Yvonne, Y-V-O-N-N-E. Her last name now is Madison, M-A-D-I-S-O-N. And she was born in May the 8th, 1960.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I have a younger brother, Keith, K-E-I-T-H. His middle name is William, and his last name is Haynie. And he was the one born in Germany, May the 12th, 1963. And I have two half-sisters, and we just--we're just sisters, when my father [William Henry Haynie Jr.], I guess it was his second, yeah, it was his second marriage. Aisha, A-I-S-H-A Haynie. She was born on April the 26th, 1978. And then the youngest is K'shana, K-apostrophe S-H-A-N-A. Her nickname is Kesi. She doesn't go by K'shana, K-E-S-I. And her last name is also Haynie. And she was born November the 26th, 1979. I hope I said Aisha was born in '78 [1978], yeah, 'cause they're a year apart. So those are my siblings.
Story_ID: 626607
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: One of them is the parade. So, again, we lived right off of Saratoga Street in Baltimore [Maryland] in these projects. And there was, there was always parades growing up. And I remember hearing the parade and wanting to run to go to it, and my mother [Inez Penn Haynie Dodson] let me go. And just running towards the parade. So that's an early childhood memory. The other early childhood memory was, so that would be--I was probably like four-ish with that memory. The other memory was, and again, we're still in the projects, so all this is, these three memories are in the projects before the age of six, was on, before Christmas and before Easter--of course, my hair was plaited, just, you know, just plaited, lots of plaits, but on those two occasions, my mother would lightly use the hot comb to, to comb out my hair and to curl it with paper bag curlers. So she'd take a paper bag and roll it up to give me, you know, lots of little curls. And so the memory of a burning hot iron (laughter) with those paper bags is a very searing memory. And the, the third memory is again in the projects, and the school that I went to--and the only memory that I have of that school, is PS-161, was when we went to the fire station, to the firehouse in the neighborhood. So it was just around the corner from the school where I lived and going to the fire department and seeing the fire department. So that was a very early memory.
Story_ID: 626608
Speaker 1: Can you describe the neighborhood you grew up in and, I guess, well, there's two neighborhoods, right? You're talking about the projects, yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, so the first was the projects. And that was, again, very memorable for me because the way they were structured, the [Edgar Allan] Poe Homes [Baltimore, Maryland] were, they were low rises, and--they had some high rises, Lafayette Square, which doesn't exist. The Poe Homes that we grew up in still exist today, and they look exactly as they did then. There were a series of--they were in, the rises, the low-rises were built in like a square and each little square, you know, with homes around them, had some kind of play area. Ours had a round tunnel that, you know, open ended, that kids could crawl in. It was cement, that kids could crawl, you know, in from one another and play on or around. I don't remember what the feature was in the other square on the other--I think there was at least one other. There may have been two others. So what they looked like was just very vivid to me, and that neighborhood is very vivid to me. The other neighborhood that I grew up in which was formative, so we lived ultimately in three homes, two of them before we went to Germany, and Dennison Street and Lenard Street, we rented homes after we had to leave the projects. And the, it was part of Edmondson Village, but it was the, on the Eastern, below the school that I went to, Lyndhurst Elementary School 88. When we came back from Germany in 1965, which is where I lived until I graduated from high school, and that's really where my friends and, you know, long-lived connections with friends from that, from growing up, we were the first black family in that block.
Story_ID: 626609
Speaker 1: My mother was able to get a mortgage because of my father being in the Military service. So that was the beginning of what was major blockbusting in Baltimore [Maryland]. In fact, they have documentary on this, and my mother has participated in, in--
Speaker 2: And blockbusting is when a black family moves in and, at the--well, you can explain--
Speaker 1: No, you go, you please explain (laughter).
Speaker 2: For anybody watching this, then the realtors--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and sometimes it's a black realtor, sometimes a--sometimes it's a white realtor, sometimes it's a black one, will call the white neighborhood and say "Don't you wanna sell your house now?" And I know we've heard about the trick of even bringing in a family to walk the streets as if it's integrated when it's not even integrated to--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --with a baby carriage and everything to shock the neighbors to make them move.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. So within, less than a year, the block became all black. So from a positive point of view, I mean I--so I've gone to integrated--so my, my school experiences were different. Certainly, in the projects in the years before we went to Germany, those two years we were in Germany, was all-black schools. Germany was a very different experience. People from all over the United States and so there were only a handful of blacks in my class. Coming back to Baltimore, you know, so the exciting them was we had a house. So my mother was the first in her family buying a house, and it was a big--that was a big, big step for her. It was a very risky step. But I, the first memory I have is going up to the bedroom that me and my sister shared and looking out and seeing a yard, you know, a little, however much of patchwork it was, it was a yard that we could claim that would be ours. It was a city--you know, these were row homes in (unclear). But that community was ultimately just a very rich community. The neighbors--my mother carried with her that same sense of trying to connect, neighbor-to-neighbor, that she had growing up. You know, so whenever, you know, little things that whenever--any time somebody died or had family that died, you know, you collected, you know, monies and, you know, you helped the family. It was always done collectively. We played in the alley between, you know, the back of our houses with the people who lived behind us, and were very connected to them. You know, I just have lots of warm memories, and again, that's shaped by the neighbors in those communities. I was one of the older kids, so unlike my siblings who knew, like everybody in Edmondson Village, so Edmondson Village quickly, not only due to the blockbusting and the push of, you know, the white families moving, the people who moved into the neighborhood had much larger families. And so we were actually one of the smaller families. We only had four and I think principally because my parents split. But the, most of the families moving in had younger kids. And so many of them were contemporaries of my siblings. There were a few that, you know--so I had friends too, but I was one of the older kids on the block.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, so you didn't grow up there, so you didn't have the same kind of relationship that--
Speaker 1: Well, I mean--I did. I mean there were people my age, but, you know, I would say for that generation, I was among the older children. There weren't a lot of people coming in with teenagers so to speak. They were people who were younger families moving in. And so the kids were, you know, fairly young.
Speaker 2: Was Edmondson Village dominated by Edmondson Avenue? I'm not--
Speaker 1: Um-hum, yep, Edmondson Avenue too.
Speaker 2: --yeah, but I've heard a lot about Edmondson Avenue. And the time I heard it, I think things were deteriorated over there in the '70s [1970s], late '70s [1970s]--
Speaker 1: Um-hum, after the riots of 1968, the Edmondson Village was one of the first shopping centers built. It really, just things headed south pretty quickly, yeah.
Story_ID: 626610
Speaker 1: Now, you started school over near the [Edgar Allan] Poe projects [Baltimore, Maryland], I guess, I mean, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, [Public] School 161.
Speaker 1: Okay, 161, and, now, I take it you liked school?
Speaker 2: I loved school.
Speaker 1: Okay, (laughter) it's more than--
Speaker 2: I loved school, yeah.
Speaker 1: --like, alright. Okay, and did you, in those days, I know that everybody's learning everything for the first time, but did you have a favorite subject in grade school?
Speaker 2: In grade school, I don't know if I would have a favorite subject. I mean I was clearly very good in reading. I was, you know, in Germany--my whole experience in primary and secondary school has been tracking, you know, where you're placed based on, I guess, performance and Iowa State national tests as well as your classroom tests. So I recall that I was always in the highest reading class, even when I was in Germany. And then in, when I returned back to the U.S. in Lyndhurst School 88, the, I was in a high track for my elementary school, and I was in accelerated reading to the point that actually, I had an independent reading track. And actually, the same thing happened for math. My teacher, Mrs. Riley, then Mrs. Bochmiller (ph.). She became Bochmiller, said that there wasn't much she could do to help me in math. So I did independent math by the time I was in sixth grade. So I know I loved reading and math.
Speaker 1: Now, was Germany a challenge. Were you prepared pretty much for--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went over to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went over to Germany, and I was also placed in the highest, you know, in, you know--again, that's just my perception 'cause I know we had, you know, special reading groups, and I was with the kids that were considered smart.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're basically, in grade school, you start grade school in '61 [1961], I guess, when you're six or did you go to--
Speaker 2: No, I started school when I was four. I was four.
Speaker 1: When you were four? Oh, so you went to kindergarten--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeah, because I, you know, yeah, because both--I was four when I started school, but I turned five in that year. So that was before they, you know, now.
Speaker 1: Was the kindergarten?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. Okay, so 1960, or '59 [1959]?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: Fifty-nine [1959], okay.
Speaker 2: And then that I--yeah, I was five then by November, yeah.
Story_ID: 626611
Speaker 1: You went to Germany when you were--
Speaker 2: 1963, and it was in March of 1963, so--
Speaker 1: And so you're eight?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Eight years old. Okay, now, '63 [1963] is the year that JFK [President John F. Kennedy] was assassinated--
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah. And, of course, we had no TV. Well, did we have--I'm trying to think. We didn't have TV. We heard it on the radio, and all I remember was hearing it over the radio in that little--I can remember, you know, the little room we had in these apartments on the base, military base and just seeing my mother just sob and sob and sob. So, yeah, we were in Germany when Kennedy was assassinated.
Speaker 1: Okay. And something I--that Kennedy assassination really seemed to effect black people. It seems their level, more sentimental about than white people are, I think, just a general observation. But did you have any sense of that in a way?
Speaker 2: Well, only in the sense from, you know, my mother and, you know, relatives of--I mean I could just own the sadness, but it's a date that I still sort of commemorate and pause just because that day just sort of seared into my memory, but not the kind of emotiveness of my mother, but I think the sense of having someone who would be the standard bearer for ushering civil rights. I mean I think for them it was, it was troubling, you know, the loss of an icon in that sense.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was also the year of the March on Washington, and--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: '63 [1963]. So you were in Germany during all this?
Speaker 2: I was in Germany during all of that, yeah.
Story_ID: 626612
Speaker 1: Now, you're eight, that's like third grade, right or is it fourth grade for you or--
Speaker 2: No, no, that wasn't third grade. It was, gosh, I don't remember. I have to count (laughter). I don't remember. I just--
Speaker 1: You're generally in the third grade.
Speaker 2: So I was actually seven when I got there. I turned eight later that year. So I was in, probably second grade, maybe, second and third. Yeah, I was--I did second, I did the latter half of second grade in Germany, the complete third grade and part of fourth grade because when I returned to the U.S. in '65 [1965], almost exactly two years later, it was fourth grade. And I had fourth, fifth and sixth grade in, at Lyndhurst Elementary School [Baltimore, Maryland], right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was there in second, third and fourth in Germany.
Speaker 1: Now, was it a big--well, was it, how did it affect your family, your parents splitting up, you know, and the--
Speaker 2: Just magnified problems that were there all along, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. But your father had been stationed outside of the U.S. before, right, before--
Speaker 2: I'm trying to remember if he did a tour in Korea before the tour in Germany. I don't know, yeah, I don't know. He had already been in Germany though for at least half a year before we, before we came to join him.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so when he came back, you--now, where did you go to school when you came back?
Speaker 2: The same school.
Speaker 1: Same school, [Public School] 161?
Speaker 2: No, no, 161 was when I was in the projects. So once we left the projects--so those projects are right downtown. They're not, they're probably within, oh, five blocks of Lexington Market, if you've ever been in the heart of Baltimore and maybe ten blocks from the harbor. So the community in Edmondson Village is several miles, maybe three to four miles along Route 40 or Edmondson Avenue to the West. And so then I went to Lyndhurst Elementary School. And that was the only elementary school for that part of West Baltimore. It's a pretty large area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So from, so probably first, I know I did kindergarten and probably first grade in 161. And then I was at Lyndhurst Elementary School starting second grade, maybe even part of first grade, before we went off to Germany.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: And then I returned to that school two and a half years--two years later.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you were in the fifth grade, I guess, when you got back?
Speaker 2: Fourth.
Speaker 1: Fourth, okay fourth grade.
Speaker 2: The second--I had a few months of fourth grade.
Story_ID: 626613
Speaker 1: Now, are there any special teachers at Lyndhurst [Elementary School, Baltimore, Maryland] that stand out that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ms. Patricia Bochmiller. So she was the only--I don't remember my teacher in, at Lyndhurst before we went off to Germany whoever I had for second grade. All I remember were the regular bomb shelter preparations, that you know I had to do when--you know, go in the hallway and stand on the side of the wall, just in case. I mean that was part of everyone growing up in that time. That's all I remember of that. I don't remember a teacher, per se, but certainly, my teacher coming back for fifth and sixth grade, Ms. Patricia Bochmiller was extraordinary. She, her name was Patricia Riley. She grew up--she was white. She grew up in the neighborhood. She lived right across the street from the school. Her, and so, you know, she had a stake in the, you know, in our education 'cause she had grown up in the community, and she was very much pushing, you know, our achieving aspir--you know, being aspirational in terms--the class at that point was probably 95 percent black. There were still a couple of white students. I remember one, Joann, and another one, Salammay (ph.) or Salonley (ph.), who, her family was--they weren't Quaker, they were--I can't think right now, the other community of--it'll come to me later. But she and her family, they still lived in the neighborhood. But she very much was one who, you know, wanted to assure that, you know, these black students, you know, achieve their highest. But she also was a superb teacher in terms of trying to get us to think outside our little boxes, you know, not just out of, from the point of just culture or color, but also culture and tried to endow us with a, just a broader appreciation for a whole host of things, introducing, for example, I remember one trip we took, a bus trip to Philadelphia and "Function at the Junction", I think was the, one of the hot songs then. And people were singing it on the bus, and she asked the question "Do you think these songs are gonna be classics, you know, when you grow up?" And we were talking about the whole notion of what was class. And, of course, you know, people sworn on that, you know, your blue notebooks, people had their notes with all the Temptations, and, you know, you know, each of the major groups, the names, the Motown artists. And she tried to do this in a way that I thought was pretty interesting. I remember how she introduced classical music and musicals because by and large, most of us didn't have exposure to that. So she did it by introducing things that would catch our attention. So for, you know, introducing orchestral classical music 'cause I also consider jazz a type of classical music as well. But she played Van Clyburn's competition, Tchaikovsky competition, 'Piano Concerto Number 1' where it's "dun, doon, doon, doon," you know, "doon, doon, doon, doon." And the drama of it got our attention. And, you know, I'm sure I couldn't have rationalized then, you know, why, you know, it's a moment that, you know, I can always refer back to. But she knew how to sort of sear into your mind something that takes you out of the little box you're in and just--to make an impression, to say, okay, you know. Then you can go back and start educating. So she did that for classical music. She did it with musicals. The musical that she used, again, get our attention was 'South Pacific' because we were able to see sing 'Bloody' and 'Ain't that Too Damn Bad.' So for a bunch of fifth graders to be able to say a, you know, a word, you know, a curse word, "damn", and to sing it with gusto, you know, she could bring us into the music and then start to educate from that point. So she did that over and over, but the most important thing that she did for me, personally, was to give me sort of a license to say that, you know, you can go off independent, and you'll be okay and do it on your own.
Story_ID: 626614
Speaker 1: So, I said earlier that she [Ms. Patricia Bochmiller, teacher at Lyndhurst Elementary School, Baltimore, Maryland] had tapped out for me, specifically, with respect to the math. And so I had to do my math independently from that. And ultimately, I had to feel comfortable doing that on my own. And I know--
Speaker 2: What are you really saying here? I'm just, so the math class took you so far, but you went further?
Speaker 1: Yeah, so she had to--
Speaker 2: On your own?
Speaker 1: --right, she had to, you know, so for whatever curriculum she was using for the rest of the class, it wasn't working for me. And so she had to take me--so, and I don't recall. I know we had different reading groups, and the reading things that we were doing were such that each, you know, she could have independent reading groups and people can move, you know, fairly independently through whatever level they were. But for the math, there were a couple of sections in our class. And this was at the time that everything was overcrowded. I only knew overcrowded schools. I, we were in portables at that time. Our elementary school was significantly oversubscribed. So our class was actually in a portable they built to house the overcrowding. But however she was doing the math, all that I know was that I had to work independently because the math that she had the instruction for, I had already sort of tapped out. And so I can't describe specifically what that looked like, but I know that that's what I did. And in her doing that and saying that to me, I think, you know, I think subliminally for me, that was just an important way to know in terms of how to negotiate sort of on your own without a formal guidance, but a teacher saying, you know, I have confidence that you can do this. And I remember her last words to me before I went on to junior high school. So this was in the era of junior high, we were all moving to a new junior--in the neighborhood I was coming from, there were now two options for junior high school. Prior to that, there was only one which was [Public School] 91, which would have been all black. There, a new junior high was built to accommodate the huge overcrowding in West Baltimore [Maryland], and it was Rock Glen Junior High School. And it was integrated. It was being fed by neighborhoods to the South of Edmondson Village, which were just mirrors of the black neighborhoods, you know, sort of working-class communities. But there was also a middle-class neighborhood too that was feeding into it, but it was mixed. And she knew that I was going into the enriched. So I said earlier that public education in Baltimore was tracked. And so the enriched class was the highest level, and so she said, "I have a suspicion that you're probably going to be unlike what you've experienced here at Lyndhurst, that there're probably a majority of white students, but I know you can hold your own and do well. You've been well prepared. You know, I've given you as much as I can in terms of, of trying to push you as far as the math part so that you will be adequately prepared." And I was. The transition to Rock Glen was seamless.
Story_ID: 626615
Speaker 1: Okay, so Rock Glen [Junior High School, Baltimore, Maryland], is that near your neighborhood or--
Speaker 2: It's about three miles. I mean there were buses, yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) bused over--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So people bused or walked, and bused not in the--there weren't--we didn't have yellow buses. You took--
Speaker 1: Okay, but you had to take (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --public transportation or, yeah, I walked because the buses were, the kids were off the charts (laughter).
Speaker 1: Alright, so and Rock Glen, are you--were you amongst the first black students there or--
Speaker 2: No, it was a new school. No, basically, no, it was, it was integrated. I mean I can show later--it was probably, I don't know if I would say fifty-fifty. So again, this was a new junior high school so that junior high school, it existed. My friends who, who became my close friends at Rock Glen who were there in junior high school, came to that school when it was a fifth grade. So it'd only been three years old when I got there. And they started eliminating the fifth, yeah, the fifth and the sixth grades. So by the time we entered, it was just a junior high school. So it was a relatively new school, and as I said, it was being fed by three major neighborhoods, black and white. So it was the mix of those neighborhoods. So it was--everyone was new to it.
Speaker 1: So this is like seventh, eighth and ninth grades?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you start to take science really for the first time in junior high school or was it taught at the lower level?
Speaker 2: You know, I know I had, I'm sure general science in, in--of some sort, in elementary school. But there's no real memory of it. It definitely became prominent and pronounced in junior high school. That's when you really had very distinct sciences, and the chemistry introduction, as I said, for me, came in eighth grade. That's, it was a special year.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this being a new school, did you have like laboratories and that sort of thing in the--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yep, yep. It was, yep, we had--it was relatively brand, spanking new, and yes, we had very distinct place to do laboratories. That was--I wouldn't say so much hands-on, but demos. So the teachers and the way it was constructed, the teacher--and I can remember Ms. Carroll, my eighth grade teacher and Ms. Barber, the ninth grade teacher, having a distinct space to do sort of demonstrations. So I don't have a real firm sense of hands-on in junior high school. And again, because of the overcrowded, it was a half day. They said schools were severely overcrowded. So they had a morning session and an afternoon session. So I don't even remember which session I went to, probably the morning. But maybe morning one year and half a day the other, but that's the only way they could accommodate it. And it wasn't so much that we were--we didn't lose our total amount of time in school. But one session started very early and ended early in the afternoon. The other session started later and ended later in the afternoon, so that I think during the period, the "P" period where people were at lunch, you had classrooms open.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is '67 [1967], '68 [1968] and '69 [1969], I guess, right, junior high school?
Speaker 2: It was '68 [1968], '69 [1969] and '70 [1970]--wasn't it '67 [1967], when I went in, yes.
Story_ID: 626616
Speaker 1: Sixty-seven [1967] is when I went into, to Rock Glen [Junior High School, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Okay, so you were there when Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated and--
Speaker 1: In eighth grade, yes.
Speaker 2: And you were there when the--
Speaker 1: I was there when Dr. King was assassinated and when Robert Kennedy was assassinated.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And both, you know, again, there are pivotal emotional like for probably my mother's generation, and it maybe the Kennedy assassinations, and to even say you know where you were and what you were doing, what you were feeling, those two. And it sort of set a course in terms of sensibility about guns and a whole host of things, but, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: So what did you--did you have thoughts about guns in those days?
Speaker 1: Well, in a sense it was, they were things to be scared of because my mother had to have one. And we knew she had one in the house. She was a police officer, and this was right in the midst of my mother being a police officer.
Speaker 2: I just--(unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It was very scary, and we also part--I had friends who went to parties in junior high school. And people would crash them with guns. And so it was, yeah, I had very, very strong, negative concerns about guns. They were prevalent.
Story_ID: 626617
Speaker 1: Did your mother have like regular hours on the police force, I mean day hours or did she work at night?
Speaker 2: She, she was just like a regular police officer. She had to work shift work.
Speaker 1: And I would guess, you know, working undercover, maybe a lot of night work and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeah. So we had back-ups. We had, you know, an older--she's a friend now, but, you know, serve as a babysitter who would come over if my mother was coming in, you know, till late, and my grandfather would come over. So, you know, we had a way of managing 'cause we were, she had young kids.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So, alright, now '69 [1969] was also when the moon landing took place. So you were in--that was during the summer though.
Speaker 2: Yep. And I remember my grandfather distinctly said, these--the person who had never touched a plane, and he grew up in 1888 obviously, he said, "I don't believe a bit of it" (laughter). So granddaddy didn't believe a bit of it. But absolutely, you know, I was just fascinated and just ecstatic. Space has always held a lot of just general interests for me.
Speaker 1: Now, did you follow NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] in those days with all the--'cause I know it was a big, in those days whenever there was a launching, it was a big television event. And --
Speaker 2: Yep, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: I think, and they would wheel in the television in the classrooms at school so kids could see the, you know, the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that I don't much remember in terms of the school, But for that one at home, definitely. That was a, that was a big, it was a big event.
Story_ID: 626618
Speaker 1: So had you, by the time you were junior high school, did you, did you aspire to become a scientists or--
Speaker 2: Yes, so I'd already told you earlier about the typewriter in sixth grade. So clerk typist, you know, all I knew was that my grandfather expected me to do good (laughter), as well as my mother. I mean she, you know, she didn't nudge any of us towards any specific ting, you know, doctor, lawyer, chief, just, you just have to do good, do well in your studies. But seventh grade came, and, again, I was excelling in, in everything. So the transition from the all-black elementary school, primarily all black to the mixed class, and particularly the enriched class. So the school was pretty integrated and if you look compositionally at--I don't know if I would say fifty-fifty, sixty-forty. It just reflected the mix of the neighborhoods. But the track classes, you know, unfortunately, it was predominantly white. So I remember two other black, three black students in my class. And I was doing extraordinarily well. That wasn't an issue. But it was eighth grade that I had the notion that, okay, maybe science is it. There were two indicators, one, was we--that was the grade we had to take these aptitude tests, and I still have the print-out from that that tested what you might be, your skills in a variety of different areas, mental as well as mechanical. What kind of career, that trajectory you might have. But more importantly, the class I was in, that particular class in eighth grade was one chosen throughout the United States as a pilot class for a course they were teaching asking the question education experiment, whether or not chemistry could be taught in junior high school as opposed to three years later in eleventh grade, which is when chemistry was traditionally taught. And I fell in love with molecules. That's all I have to say. It was the, you know, you know, sometimes, you know, things don't come into focus until, you know, it's like putting on, you know, I liken it to when I go into the opticians every two years, and they put lenses on, and you're not quite. And then all of a sudden you see clearly. Well, it was the same way. I mean that's, you know, just the molecules, all of a sudden, I could see clearly. I could see--I could begin to envision the world around me in ways that made sense. And more importantly, it, it inspired me to reach beyond what I had ever seen. It was the first time I could articulate as I said to my mother, "I wanna become a research scientists, you know, who could, you know, make discoveries like these people I'm reading about who come up with these laws in my chemistry textbook" and I had talked enough with a teacher to know that I would have to get a Ph.D. if I wanted to go that far, I mean not just be a chemist in a laboratory. It was a notion of discovery that I had to have advanced degrees. So it was in eighth grade that I could articulate that. And the other thing that was important in that, so I have to acknowledge Mrs. Carroll who was the eighth grade teacher, was her affirmation of that. So she was a facilitator-teacher in a course that was fairly structured. So the content was fixed. I remember the shape of the book. And she, you know, reinforced the content, but she didn't have much, I would say control over the content because it was an educational experiment. But when we took the national tests--so there was a fixed test, at the end, she's, her last words to me were, you should strongly consider being a scientist because you're extraordinarily good at this. And so I think that affirmation, along with my own emotional response sort of set it.
Speaker 1: Now, did you, were you able to, or anyone was able to buy you a Gilbert Chemistry set?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. My mother had done that. Yes, so actually, I had had a chemistry set prior to that. So I think either, you know, I asked my mother because this came up. I was on a small, recently a small study group reviewing old chemistry sets, and I tried to get from her a little bit more detail around which year she brought that chemistry set. But it preceded my having a, that course. So she knew I was interested in science. And one of the indicators was, I hated dolls (laughter), and so very early, the last doll I had was a Barbie in Germany. And didn't much care for Barbie, but I did enjoy making the clothes for Barbie. So I had a little, small sewing machine like my mother's big sewing machine. And I enjoyed making clothes for Barbie. But I had no use for dolls, and I would take my brother's, particularly, Michael's, he got the Erector sets. He got the Lincoln Logs, I mean he got all the mechanical stuff. He had no interests. He had no mechanical aptitude. I took them and built the stuff for him. So I think my mother had cues that, you know, I had a more of an engineering science focus. So.
Story_ID: 626619
Speaker 1: Junior high school at Rock Glenn [Junior High School], right? So, now, where'd you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to Western High School for Girls [Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay, so is there a Western High School for Boys?
Speaker 2: No, the counter--at that time, the brother school for Western was Polytechnic Institute.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was an all-boys public school associated with Western, and then there were two other all-gender schools. There was City High School and Eastern High School, and they were on the East side.
Speaker 1: Now, the Polytechnic Institute was for boys?
Speaker 2: Then, um-hum.
Speaker 1: And then, yeah, now, I wouldn't--I think I'd be alarmed if it was still just for boys, but--
Speaker 2: No, they've been--they've had their suit (laughter) like most of the all-boys schools because they had a curriculum that, I mean rightfully so, a girl sued in, I think '79 [1979] for access to the engineering sciences which we didn't have at Western, so--Western still is an all-girls school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's the oldest public high school for girls, that was established before any of the others in the United States.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, there was an article in the 'New York Times' that talked about the reemergence of single-gender high schools, and they looked to the outcomes from Philadelphia High School for Girls [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Western High School for Girls and a few others as models for, you know, outcomes, in terms of leaders.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. So did, did you take a heavy science curriculum in high school?
Speaker 2: You know, again, the math-science. So if you go to--and again, you're tracked, so I was in--I don't even remember which one I was in. But the, I was on a trajectory for calculus so it really was fixed, you know, from junior high school actually, my math was pretty fixed. If I stayed with the program, and the science, there certainly was a lot of latitude because many of my friends who were not interested in science, you know, did more advanced political science and history or English. For me, it was science, and so I had two years of chemistry, you know, physics, and, you know, biology. So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and math, you know, the highest math that I could take.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was calculus?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 626620
Speaker 1: Who were some of your teachers and mentors at Western [High School for Girls, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: So the first that comes to mind is, I'll start with chemistry, Mrs. Olive Kaufman. She was rich for me in a number of ways. She taught my first year of chemistry in eleventh grade, and I had another instructor for Chemistry II in my senior year, but what Ms. Kaufman did was to really tell those of us who were interested in science sort of the real deal, what life, the pressures that would exist for us as women, aspiring to go into the sciences. She had a little foray into industry, and, you know, she was pretty open and honest, and I won't disclose, you know, some of things she shared, but in terms of the pressures as a woman in science and having to make some choices that were hard.
Speaker 1: Would she had rather been working in private industry than teaching you think or--?
Speaker 2: No, I think, no, her passion was (unclear). She came to teaching, I think, recognizing that that was her gift and passion. She was a teacher extraordinaire. She was head of the chemistry department and she was definitely a very gifted teacher, a very gifted woman, but definitely a gifted teacher, very passionate, very supportive, and extremely encouraging. She mentored, she encouraged any of us who were interested in science. She gave us the space to, to grow and be a part of that community by, you know, adopting us as sort of lab assistants. So, and trusting us with responsibility to taking, helping to create the back, materials for the laboratories, working with her laboratory assistant, Mrs. Gloria Mizelle (ph.), and so, you know, she, she was a really big booster and supporter and role model, and also helping us discern what would be the right place for each of us. And she discerned, you know, our temperaments, our interests in terms of the, you know, the college for us. So she was very, very important. The other two--so three others. The other was my trigonometry and calculus teacher, Mr. Edwards. He was there for us in eleventh grade, part of eleventh grade and then had a severe, I guess he was gone for a good part of the year due to hepatitis. But he came back, and he was just--it's funny because if you looked at him in the midst of the early '70s [1970s], he was, he seemed like a contrast. He, crew cut, you know, white guy, seeming straight-laced, but he rode a motorcycle, so I know he had a coolness factor to him. But he got behind each of the women or girls that he taught, and he spent hours outside of the classroom preparing us for the AB and BC Calculus AP exam because he was convinced that the, you know, that every single one of us in our calculus could, you know, opt out of, you know, at least a year of calculus with what he was teaching. But he put in the time after hours. I mean each of these teachers did. I mean they were just extraordinary, committed individuals, and who believed beyond a shadow of a doubt that each of us could become, become leaders. I remember that Mr. Edwards coming back from his medical leave, that we were supposed to get another teacher for math, and we were so strongly--those of us who were going on to take calculus, we demanded that they institute Mr. Edwards as the teacher because, you know, we wanted excellence, and he embodied excellence. He comes to mind, and then Mrs. Ludwig who was an English teacher, but she was also an advisor for the yearbook. I was editor-in-chief of my yearbook my senior year.
Story_ID: 626621
Speaker 1: You spoke earlier of using your typewriter, the one your grandfather bought for you to do a little neighborhood newspaper--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, is this--
Speaker 2: Now, that's funny, I never--you know, I never connected the two. So I never got involved with the newspaper so the journalism wasn't my thing, but, you know, I ended up invited to be editor-in-chief for the yearbook. So I guess maybe I'm sort of more artistic part because the yearbook actually, probably took on more of a, sort of an overseeing, sort of a more artistic element rather than sort of pure journalistic. So I didn't have any interests for the newspaper but the yearbook definitely as a way of capturing sort of our class history and finding ways to allow, you know, our year to express itself, you know, in whatever ways that was appropriate in the yearbook.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so yearbook, and did you run for class office or anything?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't involved in class office. So my activities were, no, I wasn't interested in that kind of limelight. I was more behind the scenes. So the yearbook. I was involved in an environmental advocacy group and the German Club. So I, my German teacher was also very important.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you know some residual German from having lived in Germany at all?
Speaker 2: Very little, but, yes, but I took German for six years. So, you know, we had a language, and German was, if you were going into chemistry, it was a must, because German was still dominant, particularly in organic chemistry. So there was, for me, no consideration of any other language except German because I needed it to go into chemistry.
Speaker 1: Yes, other scientists we've interviewed talk about that. The Germans are--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --like primary in chemistry.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: So some of the early teachers even over here at the major departments in the schools, Ivy League--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --schools are Germans.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you said your German teacher was important. Can you kind of elaborate on it?
Speaker 2: And, again, this goes back to a theme I had mentioned earlier with Mrs. Pat [Patricia] Riley Bochmiller, my teacher in fifth and sixth grade at Lyndhurst Elementary [Baltimore, Maryland] was this notion of allowing me to work independently. So likewise, in German, you know, I had taken German in junior high school and even through high school each year, but by the senior year--and, again, I don't know what the, you know, for whatever reason, she said I had to work independently 'cause I pretty much had, with whatever book we were working with, had tapped out. So I did independent reading for that. I read, you know, I just read German novels.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, did you have a favorite German novel (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, I don't--I can't think of one (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, I thought I'd ask that anyway.
Story_ID: 626622
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you were on the verge of graduation from high school, what kind of counseling were you getting about school 'cause, you were telling me I guess, maybe off-camera, that there weren't a lot of people that went to college in your family and--
Speaker 2: That's true, so my counselor, so my--how I figured out where I wanted to go to college came from the books. I certainly couldn't, you know, use my family to guide me, so I used 'Barron's Guide for Colleges,' based on SAT scores and your academic standing in your class. I knew--and, again, I'm fairly analytical. I should say that right up front (laughter), that based on that, that I should be able to get admittance to highly and most competitive schools. And so I looked, using that as a criteria and also the major--so schools that were strong and had accredited, accreditation in chemistry and biochemistry because I also became very interested in biochemistry. And then geography, and so with that I narrowed down my suite of schools. I also have to say that because of Western's [High School, Baltimore, Maryland] stance in the State of Maryland in terms of being one of the top schools, we had, and the era in which I was growing up, there was a huge open-armed, if you will, of top engineering and science schools coming, flocking to our school, trying to recruit, you know, talented women. So Cal-Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California], I remember Herman Branson coming, Cal-Tech, Princeton Engineering [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey]--
Speaker 1: So Herman Branson, himself, came to--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes--
Speaker 1: --recruit students?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah. And--
Speaker 1: This is Dr. Herman Branson of the--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, with that article with--I still have his article with Noble Laureate, Linus Pauling--I'm trying to remember, yeah.
Speaker 1: I think so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He later became the president of Central State University [Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Oh, did he, afterwards,--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in his later career? That I didn't know. Princeton School of Engineering and MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. So those were three that I remember coming to talk to us in some setting at Western, trying to recruit us and saying, you know, emerging opportunities for young women who excel in science and math, and we want you. So that's when I became aware of Cal-Tech and MIT and the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]. So, again, with the manner in which I was exploring schools, there were only four or five that were ones I had my sights on. I can say that I was aware of HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities], certainly in my own backyard, Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland]. So I had an aunt, the aunt that became a psychiatrist, but I knew for a host of reasons in terms of just the, my family dynamics, that staying in Baltimore for college would be the, would be ultimately detrimental for me. I would not be able to soar. I would just get caught up in family stuff and really not soar. And so I knew that it was important for me to, to go away to school. So Morgan wasn't an option, nor was [John] Hopkins [University, Baltimore, Maryland], none of the schools in Baltimore.
Story_ID: 626623
Speaker 1: And as for thinking about other colleges like HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities], I have to say that, you know, I had heard of schools like Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] and Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], but given my perception of--and I say primarily, girls who aspired and were claiming those schools, there was for me was a cultural divide by a socio-economic class that said that's not something that you would necessarily fit into. So I just looked at sort of majority institutions, again based on competitiveness. And the schools that I was interested in were University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology [Cambridge, Massachusetts], University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], those three. For reasons in terms of the major and their competitiveness. Those were the three that made sense. And that was affirmed by my college counselors and what they knew of one having had students go to at least two of them, they had yet to have anyone but MIT. I know my counselors --so I was invited to spend a weekend at MIT for students, again, based on potential National Merit finalists. And I fell in love with the place. And I said, this is a place where there're people like me, and I know I could do well. My host was a woman, Lorna Giles who I became reconnected with when I was in graduate school at MIT when she came back to that area. And I absolutely loved the place and said this is a place that I feel at home with the people who are here. But I think it will be the best place for me when I go to graduate school, not undergraduate. And the other factors for me were--two other factors, one geography. So, you know, my mother's circumstances financially were a struggle, and, and, you know, she doesn't even begin to share the depth of that. So I knew that if I wanted my family to share the college experience that I was gonna embark on, being geographically reasonable was important. So Philadelphia, two hours away. There's a possibility that they could take a train or a bus to get to visit. Boston would have been near impossible. Chicago would have been near impossible. The second factor which cemented University of Pennsylvania for me, so now it had the science and the geography as being good pieces, was the fact that it was a liberal arts Ivy institution. So I still had a strong interest in German and other things. And so I actually had toyed with the idea of maybe being a dual major, maybe language as a second major. And so I didn't really wanna go to an all-engineering science institution for undergraduate. So that's how I made my selection in terms of places to apply to. It was very analytical, but I got affirmation by talking to counselors, and particularly, Mrs. Kaufman in terms of were these--did these seem reasonable? I know from within my family, I had some push-back from my, I know my aunt who ultimately became a psychiatrist, was a little concerned. She was the one who had gone to Morgan [State University] because she thought that I wasn't playing it safe, that this was really stretching outside of what our family had, anyone had ever done in the family. And what was gonna be my back up. These were, you know, this was unknown territory. But as my mother said, me being hard headed, I didn't listen to anyone, (laughter) went straight ahead doing what I was gonna do anyway. And it worked out.
Story_ID: 626624
Speaker 1: Now, did you graduate with--I know you graduated with honors from, you know, Western [High School, Baltimore, Maryland], but what--were there any specific things you wanna talk about in terms of graduation?
Speaker 2: So I graduated number six in my class, six. And I got several honors. So for the top ten graduating--and I'm not sure if it's all Baltimore City Public Schools. There was a Peabody Award, and I still have the medal for that to share. So that I was quite proud. And I got an award, the award in languages, German, and in chemistry, that I can recall from then (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, from high school, that's all that I can remember, yeah, so at least, I guess, and we went to kindergarten, you know, when you start talking about your education forty-something years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, at any rate, and so you did graduate with honors and (unclear), so you go off to University of Pennsylvania here in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and what was--how did you like Penn?
Speaker 2: I loved it immensely. And so I had a, sort of a good opening in terms of coming to Penn because I was selected--I had a full scholarship coming to Penn and I also had, they had just started a program called the Benjamin Franklin Scholars, which I think it was in its second year. And it was their intent to create a program of scholars to try to attract some of the most promising talent from the country to, you know, to make sure that they could attract top students. And so I was a Benjamin Franklin Scholar going to Penn. That gave me access to honors classes at Penn. So my first two years at Penn in some of the entry courses, like the English or the seminar and my chemistry, which might have been maybe a hundred or so typical for, you know, a large institution like Penn, it was twenty to thirty students. And so I also had a general honors--I graduated with general honors fulfilling that requirement from Penn because I came through as a Benjamin Franklin Scholar. And it was everything I had imagined college to be. I had sort of broad exposure to people who came from a variety of different circumstances from other countries, other places in the United States. So I enjoyed it immensely. I didn't have strong, a huge cohort of people in science. But because we had access to the university and I was able to do research from the day I started, it fulfilled my dream. And I had to do a work study, so I went to a chemistry faculty member and asked if I could do my work study, working in the laboratory with a graduate student, and Dr. Thornton said, yes. And so from that moment, from the first day at Penn, I was in the laboratory in some type of research setting, in addition to the normal coursework. And so, and, again, it was sort of that affirmation that, yes, this is the community that you've aspired to, and you're being nurtured as part of that community. I became--there weren't a lot of undergraduates doing research at that time, so I had some strong connections with chemistry graduate students and pretty soon became acquainted with the, just the difficulty of, particularly at that time in '73 [1973] of what it was gonna be like in terms of a career in chemistry, if you're going into either industry or academics. It was tough times. And so I think I got a real-world grounding very early on. So I didn't have any illusions about how easy or difficult it would be. But I was gonna stand my grand no matter what 'cause I remember one graduate student telling me, you know, he was working at a parish, 'cause--after getting his Ph.D. because he couldn't get a job. He said, "get out now before you even get started" because the job prospects are pretty, pretty gloomy. And, but as I said, my overall experience at Penn was excellent. I had lots of rich research environment experiences and a quality education.
Story_ID: 626625
Speaker 1: Now, what did you work on as a lab assistant (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, I had several research projects. So I was sort of a rolling stone, if you will. I didn't work in the same laboratory for all three and a half years I was there at Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. I thought it was important to get a sampling of different research experience. So for the first year, I worked with an organic chemist, but she was also doing some enzymology. She was making molecules that would be inhibitors for an enzyme. And this was exactly the area that I was interested in. So I did that for the first year, and then I came back to Baltimore [Maryland] that summer, and I worked as a telephone operator, as I had done during high school. But in the second year, I wanted to expose myself to another science which might lead to a summer position. So I then worked for, in the Department of Engineering for the then, Dean of the Department of Biochemical Engineering, and I worked with a graduate student doing fermentations. They were using cells and breaking them up to make single-cell protein. So they were interested in converting biomass to something more useful, which was a theme that, at the time, you know, probably didn't make a lot of sense to me, and it's only, you know, twenty or thirty years later that I realize that these were some of the pioneers in doing some biochemical engineering work that became very important and also as a theme in my own research career. And in that group, working with Dr. Humphrey, it was Arthur Humphrey's group, I became exposed to more of the dynamics of working in a large research group where they have retreats, regular seminars. It was more of a community, and I got exposed to that. And so that was of interest. Then I had two additional research experiences which were more singular in terms of, I was the dynamic--I was the only undergraduate in the organization. So the next was with Dr. Brittan Chance. He was a world-renowned spectroscopist. He also I think had won--I don't know if he, he was sailor. I'm not sure I he had won a cup, but he was a sailor. He was also known as a sailor. He was also very well known as a sailor. And that was a very interesting experience 'cause I was--he didn't even have graduate students. He only had post-docs in his laboratory. And I just worked independently. I worked under a post-doc, Jerry [Jeremy] Smith and just learned how to work on my own. And what was interesting in that experience was that I really didn't know what I was doing. I mean, and I will own that to this day. I mean I did spectroscopy and I could talk about the fundamental principles. They were doing some very basic work in trying to develop support of a theory of electron transport in cell membranes. And so I understood exactly what they were trying to get at, but exactly how my research connected to what they were trying to support in terms of the theory was very vague to me at that time. But I got a grounding in terms of how, sort of the mechanisms of doing fluorescence spectroscopy, and again, that whole experience in Dr. Chance's lab, I think speaks to my sort of fearlessness in sort of going and working independently without having much of guidance and mentorship, even if it didn't prove to be ultimately fruitful. I think I would have flourished more had I had someone--cause Brittan Chance certainly wasn't gonna play the role. He would come in occasionally. He worked sort of odd hours and asked me how things were going. But he was like a god. And, you know, just to, you know, sort of indulge this undergraduate working in his laboratory and, you know, wrote me a very nice reference, obviously, for graduate school, but I think I would have flourished more had I had someone who was more engaging one-on-one. But he was a very hands-off, sort of aloof person.

Speaker 1: The last research person is someone I really must mention. The last research experience I did was over the summer of my last year at Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. So this was 1976 and through December when I left Penn. And that was in the laboratory of Dr. Phoebe Leboy. She--
Speaker 2: Phoebe--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: That's--
Speaker 1: That's P-H-O-E-B-E. And her last name is LeBoy, L-E-B-O-Y. She was one of a couple of full professors who were women in the sciences. So at the time, she was the second woman faculty member that I encountered. My first was--who's now a friend, Dr. Maven Juliea (ph.), whom I had for two courses of chemistry at, during my time at Penn. But Phoebe was in the medical--she was in the veterinarian school--the dental school, I'm sorry. She was in the dental school. She was a professor of biochemistry. And I decided to do a research, my senior research with her, I think at the recommendation of someone, and I don't know who. But one, I thought this would be a tremendous opportunity to finally work with a woman, you know, representing, you know, a part of my experience, which at Penn was largely male, definitely white and male. I remember my P-Chem [physical chemistry] class, which was maybe a little atypical, but not too atypical of many of my chemistry classes, particularly, the advanced one, that P-Chem class had about ninety students. There were four women. I was the only woman of color--I was the only person of color, period. There were four women out of ninety. So I took advantage, I spoke to Phoebe. She, too, she had a very small research group. She had a couple of graduate students, and occasional undergraduates doing research. And she was doing work in biochemistry. So that was part of the reason for doing research for her. The thing that was memorable, so she was more, you know, her group was small, so I was more intimately connected with, you know, her actually being the tutor-teacher in terms of technique and going through results. It was definitely a more intimate, you know, relationship in terms of my research and her guiding it. But what was most important about my relationship with Phoebe was at the end. So when she was talking to me about, you know, which graduate schools am I applying to. So in early September, and again, MIT was on the trajectory, and I had the three that I was interested in, she was coaching me just to make sure that I had all my ducks lined up and was quite prepared. Well, who are you, you know, getting for your letters of reference, you know, because she was one of the, she was very politically astute. She was known to be very much a spokesperson for women's issues and to be outspoken on the lack thereof in terms of women progression and coming into the pipeline and just institutional development at Penn, you know, in the '70s [1970s]. And I remember her saying, she said, are you gonna ask Brittan Chance, and I said, well, you know, I mean, again, I was fairly, I would say somewhat shy, and I thought well, you know, he's, you know, he's Brittan Chance, and, you know, I thought, you know, I could live without, you know, using his letter, you know, in terms of supporting my application to graduate school. She, again, sort of bringing me out and said, "No, you know, you must," you know. And, again, it's this notion of trying to educate me that if you've, you've gotta use the resources and the names that you come in contact with because she had a very firm understanding of what it'd take to get to the next step. And so I know that, based on her encouraging me, I did get, you know, Dr. Brittan Chance to write me a letter--
Story_ID: 626627
Speaker 1: But the things that still ring in my ears today were her [Dr. Phoebe Leboy] last words to me when we had our final interview. So by this point, I'm finishing up my, my work in terms of writing that ultimately became my first paper and publication with Phoebe. And she's asking me about going on to--two things. So, I had gotten into MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and so, and then I was also, because I was graduating early, a semester early, I actually could have graduated the year before. But I stayed on to finish at MIT that next semester. So I had the next nine months, and I went on to work in industry before starting at MIT. So she asked me two questions. One, why are you going to industry to work, you know, you could do an internship here and work in my laboratory as an assistant or, or, you know, anywhere at Penn. So that was question one. The second question, she was very concerned about, she said to me, she said, "Sharon, you're, you know, you're extremely bright and intelligent, but I really worry about whether or not you're gonna make it through MIT" because, she says, "That's not all it takes, particularly going to graduate school. And particularly for someone who's black and is a woman." She says, "It's gonna take more than that, and I'm not sure you have the, you know, really the, sort of political, sort of awareness of what it's gonna take to survive that environment." And I'm sure I listened to her with polite respect, but really not having much of a clue as to the reality of what she was talking about, not to say that I didn't have my encounters at Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] with a sense that people perceived me as "other" and had a low trajectory of what I could achieve. But largely, it was still alien in terms of my overall experience at Penn. And still to this day, I quote the importance of her saying those to me, those words to me because when you, you know, when I did encounter the first or "What's this?", you know, at MIT, not that it had anything to do with color, but just seeing that things had a lot more to do with who you know and power and politics, I was able to go back to those words and realize this is what she was talking about. And, again, the beginning, the ability to begin to decouple things that happen from necessarily being associated with me particularly, but just a system and trying to find ways to work around them. So she was very important, and she died last year. She had ALS [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis], and I feel quite privileged that she had asked me in 2011 to be part of her Festschrift which is a very common thing in science, to honor a professor upon some momentous age that he or she has achieved, 60 or 70, and I was one of the speakers in that festschrift, that was held in February, 2011 to honor Phoebe.
Speaker 2: Now, a festchrift is--can you spell that for us, for those who are, will watch this?
Speaker 1: F-E-S-T-S-C-H-R-I-F-T.
Speaker 2: Okay, it's normally like a book or a (unclear) activity--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It usually ends up, right--
Speaker 2: --an activity, with a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --that will lead to a book. In this case, it, in this case, it's unlikely that it's gonna lead to a, that it led to a book, but they, you know, that's what it was called as a, sort of a prelude to what would have, normally, as you say, been compiled into a book for that. But on that occasion, when there was a series of talks of her former students coming back from all over the world actually, I was the only--was I the only industrial person? I think I may have been the only industrial person in that community.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, alright, so that was just recently. So you stayed in contact with her--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --over the years.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yeah.
Speaker 2: She's played a major role?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 626628
Speaker 1: Now, someone that the office identified was a fellow named Allen McDermott. Did you work with him at all?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't work with him. What Allen McDermott did for me was, so in that last semester at Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], at the same time that, you know, I'm having this conversation with Phoebe [Leboy] in my last semester at Penn, doing my senior research. Allen McDermott, I took my last chemistry course at Penn, was Advanced Inorganic Chemistry. And Dr. Allen McDermott was teaching that course. And my typical, particularly, you know, in these chemistry courses, they're fairly small. I usually sat at the front of the class. And so I sat usually in that first row or second row. And he set me on fire again with inorganic chemistry, which, you know, largely, at that point, I was on a trajectory, organic, biochemistry. But, you know, he made inorganic chemistry accessible to my mind again. He was only in that classroom for probably less than a month, and this is when he did his sabbatical. He went to Japan. He was replaced by Larry Sneddon, who I know fairly well, who's another professor at Penn. But it was Dr. McDermott's infectious teaching that brought, again, the love of inorganic. So, again, it just took me out of just the particular branch of chemistry I was in and brought me to a broader joy of the period table, if you will, rather than just carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, which is what you typically think of as being part of what is organic. And that, I think, was important, his infectious zeal in teach, opened me up again, and I think that opening was important because I think it poised me well for who I ultimately chose for my adviser in graduate school.
Story_ID: 626629
Speaker 1: So you went to graduate school at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], right? And you started in 1976?
Speaker 2: 1977 [1977].
Speaker 1: '77 [1977]. Okay. Alright, and, now, there was a note in the outline about green chemistry. Was this the time of green chemistry? Not then?
Speaker 2: No, un-un.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, so shelve that until the time (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter). No.
Speaker 1: Alright, so, okay, so MIT. So you went straight through to Master's and Ph.D., right, you didn't stop?
Speaker 2: In chemistry, there's no Master's unless it's--let me say, in the U.S., generally, at most major institutions, grant Ph.D.s in chemistry, Master's is terminal. So there's not an interim step. You're going for a PhD or you're not. In other countries, that may be different. Certainly, in engineering sciences it's different, but in chemistry, yeah. So it's, yeah, and sometimes people may get a Master's and go to a different institution. But if you, if you're getting it at the institution you start at, it's, there's not an interim.
Speaker 1: Okay, so at MIT, now, was the environment, I mean, you chose it because it was--what was it, again, you--
Speaker 2: That's what I wanted. I mean, yeah, the other, the other option would have been  [University of California at] Berkeley [Berkeley, California]. And I also looked at University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], but I wanted MIT 'cause I, you know, had that recollection from undergrad--you know, when I was looking at undergraduate institutions. And then I also wanted the breadth, I wanted to have a place that had the strength broadly in chemistry and other sciences, particularly in chemistry so that I would have, you know, options to choose from.
Story_ID: 626630
Speaker 1: Now your adviser was George Whitesides?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And tell us something about him?
Speaker 2: What I know is that I had no intention whatsoever of working for George Whitesides (laughter) going to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. And this is why. So Dr. Art [Arthur] Humphrey, the person who was, I had done the research, in his group, I had done research in biochemical science and engineering. He was a dean. He was a father in biotechnology, biochemical engineering and well known. And he was intimately connected with lots of people, and I remember him saying to me, Sharon when you go to graduate school, if you're going to MIT, you absolutely must work for this young, hotshot, and he described attributes of this person in terms of the, I guess his mannerisms, and the way (unclear) to do, I'm thinking like, this sounds like--I have a more descriptive word for it, but this sounds like someone that is absolutely counter to what appeals to me. And so just based on--and, again, I think the kind of language that, if I can think of Art Humphrey, he was probably using language that describes someone who was just very intense and driven. But it wasn't very complimentary, whatever those words that he used. And so I said, absolutely not, this sounds definitely not the kind of person who'll appeal to me. So independent of his science, George Whitesides was definitely not part of the pool I was seeking. I had a pretty strong notion of who I wanted to work with when I went to MIT based on their area of science. I was interested in looking at uncovering mechanisms of action in biological enzymatic reactions. And it was really only one person doing that work, and it was Chris [Christopher] Walsh, who was a classically trained organic chemist, and he did exquisite work. And all I can say is that I was very disappointed when I went to talk with Chris in the area that he, that I was interested in, in working with him, he was closing down. I remember him saying that, you know, his brightest student, he didn't think there was much being done in that area. And the others areas that he was looking at, those problems weren't of interest to me. So here it was October and most of the other students coming into the chemistry department had chosen their adviser. And I was at a loss. And so I had to rethink my whole, you know, game here because in chemistry, it's, you know, and even--especially at a place, at MIT, it's all about getting, you know, into the lab, getting your research adviser and getting, you know, your research going. So I had to open my search again and start talking with other people. There were certainly one or two faculty members who would have been prohibitive because they absolutely were not accepting women. And it was known. You could openly discriminate then. It was, that was, that was a given. So I, George was on that short list, and so I talked to George. And all I can say is that George made molecules sexy. He sold me instantly, but the most important thing that made me open to even entertaining the kinds of problems that George was describing that, you know, were of interest, that could be interesting with me was that my mind had already been opened by having that course in advanced inorganic. So the metals part, so a good component of George Whitesides' research was using metals. He did organic metallic chemistry. So metals were central to one part of his research. And so had I not had that course with Allen McDermott and particularly, with Allen McDermott, you know, being a part of that and his, you know, way of looking at--through metals as an entree to the key to life, I don't think I might have been as won over by the particular problems that George, you know, laid open. But who knows? I mean George could sell, I mean he--just an extraordinary chemist. So that's how I ended up in George Whitesides' laboratory. And I absolutely have no regrets.
Story_ID: 626631
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about the area of chemistry that you focused on. I know it has a lot to do with di-- diphosphate--
Speaker 2: So I had, I guess, if you will, I had two major research problems. So there were two sections. So what you're referring to in terms of the disphos--the bisphosphene ligands was the first early body of work where we were, I was synthesizing molecules that would go into the active site of an enzyme. And so this connects to that first research problem that I was working on at University of Pennsylvania, where I was doing organic synthesis with a graduate student who was making some active site reagents. What George wanted to do was to make some phosphene ligands that would bind to a metal--so these phosphene ligands bind to metals, and they normally do a certain type of chemistry. So they--in this case, we were looking at a simple model. We were taking a molecule that was an alkene and hydrogenating it to making an alkane, and what he wanted to do was to ask, if you put this small molecule in to the interior of a protein and enzyme--so this is a much bigger macromolecule, could that enzyme change the environment for the chemistry that you're doing? This is the hydrogenation of that metal. So the metal was the thing that's really doing the work in helping the reaction of hydrogen with the alkene to make a different product. Could the environment of that protein help you make more of one of two different products? So in this reaction, you can make a left-handed molecule and right-handed molecule. And almost everything we take in terms of our, for pharmaceutical purposes, the handedness, if you will, of those molecules, is essential. And so learning how to do that, what we call in chemistry asymmetric synthesis to make a chiral or a handed molecule is very important. So we wanted to find a new way of taking advantage of biology to see if we could more efficiently make those, a certain handed molecule that could be a starting point for making something important, like a pharmaceutical or etc. So that, I spent about a year and a half, not quite two years--I would say about a year and a half doing work in that area. I was building on a body of work from a previous graduate student who had done some work in this area, and I went off in a different direction. And I would say that our results were modest. They weren't--it, the hypothesis which we were exploring was something that was not going to be general. And so I decided to stop doing that work, and that's when I moved to do work where I used enzymes and organic synthesis to make carbohydrates. So that was the second area of my research, and it actually was the, sort of the nucleus of my thesis. That was the major part of my thesis, where we were asking the questions, could you use enzymes, which are biological catalysts. They're found in all of us, and then all living things, could you take them outside of their normal context and put them in a traditional medium that you're gonna do organic chemistry in and use them to do a specific chemical reaction to make a molecule that would be difficult to make by traditional chemistry? So we wanted to sort of borrow things from the biological community to make molecules in a way that could potentially have a more environment benefit if we were successful. So that might be sort of the early origins of doing some of my work in, what you call green chemistry, but it certain, at that era, was not called green chemistry. That language didn't emerge in the chemical vocabulary in terms of the chemical community until the '90s [1990s]. So that was, you know, fifteen or twenty years down the road. But some of the fundamental ways of thinking sort of were seeded in me back during my graduate school era. And, and at that time, it was, I think, more largely classified sort of via chemical engineering, enzymes and organic synthesis, I mean it was more specific in terms of the tools we were using rather than thinking about the larger context and the environment that we would be impacting. I think that was a big sea change in terms of how you think about your science, looking--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --beyond what you're doing to what you're impacting.
Story_ID: 626632
Speaker 1: Even the motto of DuPont, I think in the '60s [1960s] was "Better living through chemistry".
Speaker 2: Right, better--
Speaker 1: And people thought of like the nylons and Teflon's and--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --poly whatever--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --as all being, anything that, you know, chemistry was making us a better world. And very little thought about what was gonna happen to these chemicals.
Speaker 2: Right, that's right, "better things for better living through chemistry", yep.
Speaker 1: Everything from naugahyde to, you name it.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, so, but it was starting to seep in when you were in grad school? People were starting to talk about green chemistry more?
Speaker 2: Not--I think, two things. So, certainly the, this notion and concern and trying to come up with catalysts that were more efficient. So being able to do the work of chemistry in a way that it was more efficient certainly became a prominent concern because when I started in chemistry at Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], 1973, was the peak of the energy crisis. You know, there were stickers in our dorm throughout every room in Penn, "Do it in the dark". So a consciousness about conservation was certainly present. A consciousness about being more environmentally, a better environmental steward was there. All of the terminology that we hear that are common now, like green chemistry, didn't emerge until later. But I think some of the seeds of some of the basic principles certainly started. And I think a lot of them began in the, in the early '70s, starting with the crisis that, you know, there were a number of, of crisis from Love Canal, I mean, you know, you think some environmental things.
Speaker 1: And black out in the City of Newark [New Jersey]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Love Canal or the plant in, the nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, that was there in '72 [1972], right, when it shut down the, what's that, "Three Mile--
Speaker 2: Three Mile Island.
Speaker 1: --Island, yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't remember which year, but I think it was, yeah, 'cause I think I was in graduate school when that happened, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and in Russia, the Chernobyl event. That was, wasn't that in the '70s [1970s] too, late '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the date for that, whether it was the late '70s [1970s] or early '80s [1980s], but yeah, I think you're still in the right era. So, yeah, that--there's certain a conscientiousness about that, and I think for me, in a, and that continued, not necessarily--so I had already, I think I mentioned as a college, as a high school student, the, one of the clubs I belonged to was (Mary PERG?). So again, it had environmental interests. So we were very, you know, as high school students, concerned in terms of being advocates for, for that. So that had been a part of my interests in terms of being thoughtful about how I used my science.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you earned your Ph.D. in 1981--
Speaker 2: That's when I fulfilled all the requirements. I was conferred with a degree, officially, February of '82 [1982], but, yes, I finished in '81 [1981], and I went to Bell Laboratories the next weekend (laughter).
Story_ID: 626633
Speaker 1: Now, how did the Bell Labs, did they recruit you from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yes, they did, but I should say, MIT left me a little--there was a big question in terms of what I wanted to do post-MIT. I definitely wanted to be a researcher in science. There's no if, and's or but's, but the question is, which community? I had come into MIT with the expectation of becoming an academic. And the first year at MIT, I think gave me pause because of the people I saw emulating that role did not model what I thought was what I wanted to be. And industry also at the time didn't necessarily have an appeal. So I had the experience when I did that nine-month experience at Procter and Gamble [Cincinnati, Ohio], that one could do basic research in industry. So I knew that that was possible, but I still had an initial notion that I would be an academic. So what I thought I really wanted to do was to take two years of a quasi-sabbatical and go into the Peace Corps. So I had applied for the Peace Corps. I was turned down, and so then I had to figure out what to do. And I was interested in one of two things. I did apply for jobs in industry, but I also applied for post-doctoral fellowships, including one at Bell Laboratories. And I was recruited at Bell. I didn't sign up for Bell Laboratories initially because I actually didn't have much of an interest in going to Bell Laboratories. But my bay mate, and a bay mate meant the physical, the person I physically shared my section of the laboratory was a man by the name of Ralph Nuzzo who's a faculty member, a very high faculty member at University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois]. Ralph sat just a few feet from me for three years, and he went to Bell Labs. And he told the person that was recruiting to look me up. So I ultimately had an offer from Bell Labs. I had an offer from a number of places, and I chose to go to Bell instead of going to DuPont Central Research because I had an offer from Central Research. When George [Whitestones] was talking to those of us on the brink, you know, the brink of going to work, finishing up your thesis--and the previous year he asked, "What do you want? What do you wanna do?" And I said, what I really want at this point is, I'd like DuPont Central Research. I mean DuPont was still in the chemical industry, the "primo" in terms of chemical industry in the United States and also its research department. And so I had an offer from DuPont Central Research, and I chose not to accept that. It was a tough choice and instead I decided to go to Bell Labs and to think about it as a post-doctoral position, to maybe look at that opportunity for the three years and do research in polymer or material science as a way to get an exposure to an area that I knew that I had an interest in and wanted to put together with my interest in protein chemistry. So that's how I chose to go to Bell Laboratories. One, because I had a notion that it wasn't gonna be permanent, and I wanted to learn something about the science. And I think a part of it was the sense of--because I still was somewhat let down by not getting into the Peace Corp because I still wasn't firmly certain that an industrial career was what I wanted to do. So, and it was daunting. I was the first Ph.D. chemist of color to join that cohort in Area 10 that I was in. There had been others that had been hired, but not in that particular area that I was in. And there were some pretty prominent people there. Shirley Jackson was there. She was, you know, a black woman physicist, and I had heard of Shirley from the time I was at MIT. So it was pretty daunting. The place definitely, you know, you felt the history, and the, you know, just the vibrancy of, you know, the expectations in terms of being in telecommunications and, you know, being on top of so many things, you know, the new technology--
Story_ID: 626634
Speaker 1: A lot of people see scientists as working these people in long coats, that don't care about the growth of their hair or anything, in a, working in an isolated laboratory--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --you know, with bubbling beakers and that sort of thing. And but you said that you liked to work collaboratively on a team on projects and always have.
Speaker 2: And it's generally essential for science. I mean that's one of the notions I try to disabuse on young people when I used to come in contact with them more often when they would say, "oh, I'm not interested in science. I think I wanna go into a career in medicine rather than graduate school because I like to work with people." And I'm thinking, "well, science is very social." So let me just reframe what you need to think about, not that you won't have social interactions, but it's how you wanna impact, you know, what you do, whether you want that, rewards in terms of having a person who you see as a patient rather than having the outcome of what you do five or ten years out. But whether it was at Bell Laboratories or at DuPont, and, you know, science is generally a social enterprise. And I think there's a, a lot of myth has grown out about, sort of the lone ranger scientist doing his or her work in the laboratory and communicating their eureka (laughter), you know, in isolation, or just saying it and somebody magically hears it. It's, it's hugely dependent, it always has been dependent on, you know, some type of social dynamic. I think the whole structure of teams now is certainly a huge part of it, more so than it was twenty or thirty years ago in the past. But there were certainly times when it was. You think of the Manhattan Project, and all of those. Those were hugely team associated. So, yeah, yeah, the interactions in working with other people is, collaboration is essential.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So Bell [Laboratories] is seen by many to be the quintessential collaborative experience in science?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Or it used to be, at any rate.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 626635
Speaker 1: Did you participate in any of the diversity programs at Bell [Laboratories] when you were there?
Speaker 2: In, to the extent, so they had a program that always brought top students who had fellowships throughout this, you know, for summer programs, and I mentored one of those students. I had a student in my laboratory, Jennifer--gosh, I can't remember her last name right now, but she's, she's been a physician. So she's probably, you know, fairly mature in her career because I, she was probably only five years younger than I was at the time. So, so to the extent, in terms of working with young people who came through, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. And were the women organized at Bell Labs too?
Speaker 2: Yes, very much so. The women were the ones, and it may have been some of the black scientists too, but it was the women who very specifically told me as soon as I arrived, get your laboratory locked because there have been evidence of sabotage and they were very clear about coaching to make sure that, you know, work wouldn't be compromised and formed networks. And so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, that's, what's you're saying, this is especially important for women at Bell Labs in those days to lock their laboratory?
Speaker 2: (Unclear) At that time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: How long that existed, whether it was just peculiar to that culture in chemistry, I don't know, but there weren't many, but, you know, it would be interesting to talk to someone who came ten years later. But it was a striking contrast to coming to the experimental station at DuPont where, you know, you didn't have locked laboratories. It was a safety violation and I didn't even keep my office locked, so.
Story_ID: 626636
Speaker 1: In '84 [1984], you went over to DuPont, right?
Speaker 2: [Nodding yes].
Speaker 1: And how did that, you said that you didn't intend to stay at Bell [Laboratories] forever?
Speaker 2: I didn't intend, and then--so, 'cause there were two things. One, it was, I would say I didn't flourish in terms of coming to problems that Bell supported and was interested in growing. It was very clear, and my director made it very clear, he was not interested in any biological molecules. So, and I was not inspired by the kinds of problems I was working on principally, which was doing mechanisms of degradation of polymers like polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride. These were molecules that were part of the wire and cable industry, which at the time, Bell had a very strong interest in making sure that these molecules stayed forever. It was a monopoly, unlike the current model where you change--there's a lot of competition, and you change your phone set regularly. There they wanted the infrastructure to be preserved and long lived. But I became--what it did for me though, and this is where I flourished personally as a scientist at Bell, as an entree to my journey at DuPont was discerning what were important questions and problems to solve. And it was there that I became very interested at the interface between synthetic polymers and biological molecules and started to think about exploring, taking the tools that I was becoming adept at, at Bell Laboratories and beginning to apply them and think about and develop questions and ways to probe them using these tools, but looking at the interface. And so I became more confident of the importance and relevance of these questions, and then said, okay, now, I've got a sense of the important questions that I think that are relevant for the world, for some big issues. Now, I need to find the right context or community that would support these kind of questions, who could take these questions and then maybe with the outcome of what I'm doing in these, in this work, put them to good use. And so then I started looking for companies that had either potential interests in medical devices, a broad--even some potential pharmaceutical companies where they were looking at encapsulating drugs. And so ultimately, I got an offer from DuPont again and became part of a group that looked at the interface between polymers and biological molecules. And so that's how I came to the experimental station. But had I not had the experience at Bell, I don't think--those three years were important for my scientific maturation and also gave me a grounding in how to think about tools to approach polymer science that I didn't have exposure to in graduate school.
Story_ID: 626637
Speaker 1: This is the research track that you take at DuPont. How did it--we have some standard questions about that, but, you know, how did this effect, I guess, the average person, your research at DuPont?
Speaker 2: When you look at overall?
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: My time at DuPont?
Speaker 1: Well, I know there're specific things, but--
Speaker 2: So how would it affect the average person? So in, so the half of my work that has been in the area of medical devices, it would impact the average person in that some part of your lifetime, you, through surgery, you come in contact with the material that, that gets inserted into your body, even if it's temporarily. It might be a catheter, a urinary catheter. For some people it's permanent. It could be a valve, a orthopedic device. The outcome of the research we were doing, which was try to define what makes something biocompatible, that is compatible with living systems. So it is extraordinarily important, and the average person could confront it as I said from, in ways that are, might be temporary if, you know, in their connection with the medical community or maybe even permanent. The other part of my research that I--again, it's about half, 50 percent, 50 percent in both types of research, is in the area--if you wanna call it green chemistry, bio-catalysis. It has lots of different names from a very particular type of science to green chemistry, thinking about the overall outcomes, if you will, in the sense that the aim of that research and the value for the average citizen is that a scientific community, we're trying very hard to think about our resources that we believe and have knowledge, data that suggests they're limited, their resource lim--we're resource limited in certain areas. So the goals of that work are to try to minimize the use of resources that are diminishing, particularly petroleum, and to find ways of using something that is renewable so that we can replace very easily and not, you know, put a drain on some precious resources, but make the same articles that the consumer demands. The other part of that work is that we're trying to make it in ways that it doesn't put a burden on our water and our air in terms of dirtying those and use of those resources which are also very precious. And so the consumer benefit is that they can enjoy articles that they seem to demand, but hopefully, the costs to society for us to make these things has been minimized.
Story_ID: 626638
Speaker 1: You worked on, sucrose, I think in the late '80s [1980s]. Was there, is that you, is that your (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So that goes back to the MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] work--
Speaker 1: It goes back to--okay.
Speaker 2: So that was actually in the late '70s [1970s]. So that was, that work, using enzymes for organic synthesis, so we were--I was making carbohydrates disaccharide like sucrose or trehalose as a model for, it's just a model reaction to answer the question, could you use enzymes to make molecules that traditional organic chemistry makes by a very, very complex set of reactions? And so that was the whole point of that work. It as a model set of reactions.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and then you worked on vein replacement materials.
Speaker 2: That was the first, probably the second major project that I worked on at DuPont. So we had a collaboration with the Tufts New England Medical Center to develop--this was in the context trying to find a vein, a small vein replacement, to find materials that are biocompatible because the ones that were the gold standard would become clogged with blood as blood was flowing through and clot. And so we were trying to find materials that were more biocompatible.
Speaker 1: Okay, and these are for small veins?
Speaker 2: Small veins and typically the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So these are tiny (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: These are tiny. So these are less than six millimeters, so about this size, that opening, and the type of patient who typically would need blood vessel replacement tend to be those who are diabetic. They fall into that category where their peripheral or, you know, outlying blood vessels in their limbs, outer limbs, particularly their lower legs, they tend to have complications.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you filed ten--
Speaker 2: [Sneeze] Excuse me.
Speaker 1: --patents between '91 [1991] and 2008, right?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: You don't know (laughter), okay.
Speaker 2: Sorry (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, we do in the office, I guess, so apparently we have--well, we don't have 'em all listed, but one was for biocompatible polyurethanes by treatment with polyoxazoline--
Speaker 2: Oxazoline, yeah, oxazoline--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And, now, this is for vascular grafts or--
Speaker 2: Yes, and that's just another--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --that's a more technical word or substitution for, what you use as artificial veins, yeah, vasograph is the same word.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. And now, these materials, are these the pioneering materials used or are these materials still being used?
Speaker 2: These materials are not being--so these were experimental, and we had a potential candidate for materials that we wanted to then go into potential trials, pre-clinical trials. But at the time, the company terminated the program. So the potential outcome of this, we'll never know because it never went to the step of being tried in humans. It was a business decision that after seven years, even though we had all indications that it was technically successful, the company decided not to go into the area of non-traditional medical molecules. We had a joint venture with Merck to form the DuPont-Merck Pharmaceutical Company, and they only wanted to support molecules that were the traditional small molecule, not polymers. So that's why they chose to terminate that program.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And that happens in science, particularly in industry, so, my first heartbreak (simultaneous)--
Story_ID: 626639
Speaker 1: And you also worked on antimicrobial materials.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, so these are materials where, upon which microbes don't grow, for instance (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The intent is to try to discourage microbes from adhering to them and then also from growing. And the context there, I mean people--and this is something any consumer could relate to, from the point of, for example, carpet we're standing on here, which if you're, especially in more humid environments, water and contamination, microbes, you get things growing. And so we were looking for ways to assure that we could minimize microbes even being, having an affinity or, you know, an attraction to our materials, clothing. You think bathing suits, you know, that are damp, hanging out often have mildew. And so--
Speaker 1: Or running, materials that people use to run in, track and field.
Speaker 2: Yeah, absolutely, absolutely--
Speaker 1: Gym shoes--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah, all the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, a lot of consumer goods, yeah. So that was the motivation from the department that supported that, the business that supported that interests, that work. That was our fibers department. So these were fibrous materials that were constructed, that DuPont sold into markets which made clothing and articles like, like carpets.
Speaker 1: Okay, and carpets get a pretty, a bad reputation amongst home people now. They talk about how germy carpets can get and the fibers in 'em, and the dust particles they hold and, you know, are carpets better than people think they are now or are they just as bad?
Speaker 2: You know, I can't speak in earnest because I, you know, I haven't (unclear)--(simultaneous)--the area--
Speaker 1: Yes (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --but I do know that, that, you know, a lot of the people in the fibers area, some of the scientists try to get around, try to minimize that problem by putting coatings on materials that make it hard for microbes to grab onto. So they try technical, these are some technical ways of trying to solve the problem. But I still think it's still a problem. One of the areas that is an area that connects with that medical device area in terms of antimicrobial, is that I had mentioned catheter, indwelling urinary catheters. At least the numbers are about 20 percent of patients going in with those indwelling catheters, get an infection. So again, that's another area where there's a material which attracts microbes. And so that's another context in which we want to have materials that don't attract microbes as much or if they do, that you have some mechanisms to try to discourage their growth or inhibit their growth.
Story_ID: 626640
Speaker 1: I have a note here about amphi-- amphiphilic helices--
Speaker 2: Amphiphilic helices, yeah, these were the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Helices, right.
Speaker 2: Right. These were a type of molecule that, that were antimicrobial, that is, they killed microbes, various different types of microbes, but this particular class of microbes formed a certain shape, if they were in the right environment. And so they formed a helix, so it's like a coil. You think of like a coil for a spring. So they formed a coil and they're called amphiphilic because along--so the coil, let's pretend the coil is like going in this direction. On one side of the coil, they have a charge that attracts it to surfaces. It's got, they have a positive charge, and on the other side of the coil, they have like a greasy part of the molecule that's hanging off. And it's, this particular shape, this amphiphilic helix is a theme that happens often in molecules that disrupt the exterior of microbes. And so I looked at studying this particular class of molecule and putting them on material surfaces to see if I anchor them on the top of a material that could become a carpet or a piece of clothing, if that would disrupt a microbe if it came in contact with it.
Speaker 1: And did it work?
Speaker 2: Yes, it did, and--
Speaker 1: Okay, you're--
Speaker 2: And what was very gratifying was that that work was inspired by a class of molecules that was discovered by a scientist out of the, at the time he was at the NIH [National Institutes of Health], Michael Zasloff, and his work inspired me. He found, it was, just an anecdote. He was doing some work and found that frog excreted a molecule which ultimately he called magainins, he then went off to form a pharmaceutical company, actually, outside of here in Philadelphia. And I met him for the first time. So he inspired me, he actually inspired the one patent which I'm the sole author on, and I met him for the first time three weeks ago at a Gordon Research Conference on antimicrobial peptides. And I had a poster to talk about my work--these Gordon conferences are fairly small and intimate. You have scientists coming from all over the world. And he came over--and I was dying to meet him. So this was like the second day of the conference 'cause he sat, like he was sort of the grandfather of this whole area. He was sitting in the front row of the lecture hall, and I, you know, knew that at some point during the conference, I would have to go over and introduce myself and just to acknowledge how important his discovery, you know, was an inspiration to me and my science at that particular part of my science. And in standing with my poster, he came up to me and hugged me and acknowledged how my patent had caught the attention of, caught his attention and other people in his company and some funders because, you know, it represented, you know, something they didn't think, at least conceptually, was possible. And so it was just a great affirmation for me, I mean to have, you know, a giant in the field, you know, make that connection--
Speaker 1: Indeed, for you both.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, yeah, so it was--
Speaker 1: And actually, you know, patent something and prove something that he did was useful where--
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --where it hadn't been proven before-- I mean, hadn't been thought--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yes, yeah, yeah. So that was, you know, even though I've long moved away from that particular science, I mean that was in '90 [1990], it was in the early '90s [1990s], '92 [1992] to '96 [1996], I think for me were the formative part of my work in that area. I sort of consulted loosely to a group that started up at DuPont in that area, sort of 2000, 2005. So it was just a, for me, just wonderful to have that affirmation. So, yeah.
Story_ID: 626641
Speaker 1: Especially, you know, sort of in an industry and by and large were not in the public view, not in, you know, it's rare that someone gets exposure outside of the corporation that you're working on 'cause largely, for most corporations, someone doing corporate research, your research isn't published, and just for a whole host of reasons, you know, you're not known or recognized outside of that community.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, you developed, and this is--oh, it's the same thing, but material that's used against fungal, skin infections too, right? Is that true?
Speaker 1: Not that I'm aware of. So (laughter), I'm not sure what context this is described.
Speaker 2: Okay, and we'll move on, but in 1995, now, DuPont, I guess like Bell Labs [Laboratories] is involved in mentoring programs as well, right, and you were involved in something called Project SEED [Summer Educational Experience for the Disadvantaged]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, so DuPont has always supported my being a mentor there, but that work is actually funded through the American Chemical Society. So I submit a grant request through the American Chemical Society for Project Seed, which is summer employment for economically disadvantaged students. And this was the brainchild of several people in the American Chemical Society coming out of 1968, you know, the riots and asking, "What can we do to, to ensure better opportunities?" And the focus is to ensure that students coming from economically disadvantaged families have an opportunity to go to college and thinking that an experience in a laboratory setting would be just a good entree to open their eyes to something different. And that might motivate them to go into college. We aren't necessarily trying to expand the pipeline for people to go into chemistry. That would be a great outcome, but it was really just to go to college. So I've been a mentor for over twelve, at least twelve summers. And I've had, I think ten different students. And that's just been a wonderful, wonderful experience.
Story_ID: 626642
Speaker 1: One thing that I noted on the outline was something called the 3G Process. So tell us about that.
Speaker 2: So the 3G Process, and this was my first experience in a real team, if you will, because everything I've dis--well, I--let me now take it back, take that back. I mean it, the vasograph program was a team also, but this was a big team. The 3G Program, and 3G was just our shorthand for one-three propane diol which was the molecule which was the object of our attention. And the intent was to do the first industrial demonstration that you could use biotechnology to develop a way to use a renewable resource coming from the waste of a crop and ultimately, that waste is in the form a sugar and make a monomer, a molecule like one-three propane diol or 3G which is a key starting material to make a new material platform. It is a new material that can make fabric in the same family as polyester but has different properties. It's a little bit more stretchable than your conventional polyester. And so that was the vision to see if we could come up with a new material that, at the end of the day, if we did our job in making 3G by this bio-process, this biological route, starting with waste from a crop, we could now introduce to the consumer, material that, again, had that benefit in that it uses less of our precious resources of petroleum or oil which is the starting material for a lot of the drugs in commerce that we use. So that was, it was about a ten year association with that program, and it was a wonderful program in a number of respects. It was a program that was a joint research collaboration. So we collaborated from the very beginning with a small biotech company on the West Coast, Jenin Corp, and the irony is that two years ago, DuPont bought Danisco-Jenin Corp so those same individuals whom I collaborated with and who ended up, some of, very close to, are now part of the DuPont family. So, so that's what the 3G program sought to achieve. And it is now a commercial process. It's been a commercial process. The commercial factory is in Loudon, Tennessee, and they've been operating commercially since 2000--I think it's start-up was late 2006. So it's been over six years.
Story_ID: 626643
Speaker 1: Now you became active in the American Chemical Society in the late '90s [1990s], I mean, I don't know when you started becoming active, but you became a leader, I guess, in the late '90s [1990s]?
Speaker 2: Yes, so locally, so I've been active in the American Chemical Society in different capacities since, actually since Bell Labs [Laboratories]. So at Bell Labs I got involved in the Metro-New York, New Jersey, chemist committee--Women Chemists Committee. And then when I came to DuPont I became active, just doing, taking on small projects for the local American Chemical Society, the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] section where I was involved either in National Chemistry Week and outreach or their regional meetings and then slowly assumed greater responsibility. I've had great mentors who encourage me to take greater responsibility and became chair of the section in the early 2000. I think I was chair-elect 2002, then chair, 2003. But in the '90's [1990s] I actually took on some responsibility in national governance for the American Chemical Society. So I've had a number of rolls and it has been a real tangible testament to the fact that the science community is really tiny, and that--tiny and intimate, you know, your connections span all over the chemical enterprise. So I've enjoyed that affirmation of working with chemists from a variety--and chemical engineers from a variety of contexts and communities and a variety of different projects and just feel like, you know, that these are just part of my extended family.
Speaker 1: Okay, were you a part of NOBCChE?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So with NOBCCnE, the NOBCChE--
Speaker 1: That's the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --locally, I can say my association, from--so my first exposure to NOBCChE, the National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers, came in my third year at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. So they were having a meeting in Chicago [Illinois], and several of us--there were only three in the department, so Renault Verrett, me and Joe [Joseph] Francisco who was behind me. So we were in three years--it seemed as if MIT was on a track. There was one black person each year, requested department to support us to go to NOBCChE. And it was in Chicago. And that was an eye-opening experience. I remember still very clearly, you know, to be in the company of a large density of, of African American scientists of note who were, many of whom were in--the founders were all principally in academic institutions.
Speaker 1: When you were growing up, did you know about people like Percy Julian and others--
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Did you have any black chemical heroes as a youth or--
Speaker 2: I pretty much didn't get, you know, exposure to neither black nor women scientists, you know, during my, during my youth. You know, the first woman scientist I even became aware of was through one of my friends--my mother's friends at church, Mr. Adams, gave my mother a book that he, after his wife died. It was on Marie Curie, but other than that, I didn't really have any, you know, models. I mean I knew of, you know, obviously, that George Washington Carver, but in terms of Percy Julian--the irony is that the Julian's are very prominent in the Baltimore area because the branch of his family that became physicians, they, you know, they were prominent in Baltimore. So my mother certainly knew of that branch, but the connection to Percy Julian, the chemist, didn't happen for me until later.
Speaker 1: Okay, so NOBCChE, you're involved in NOBCChE, and--
Speaker 2: And, so when I came--excuse me, to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], the Delaware Valley chapter was very, very active. So we set up Saturday school. We had science competitions. So, and it was right, sort of at that formative part of my, you know, youth in terms of, in my thirties and so having the energy and doing a lot of sort of one-on-one or one with large student connections. And as a community, we would also connect socially and just support each other, for those of us who were dispersed in industries and academics, you know, throughout the area. And so that was my initial association with NOBCChE in terms of earnest, sort of volunteer service.
Story_ID: 626644
Speaker 1: Do you wanna talk about the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] Award in 2003?
Speaker 2: Well, that was a combination of--so, again, it was a large team, and so the acknowledgement for the--and this was before it actually reached commercialization, but as an acknowledgement of the accomplishment of DuPont in--and Jenin Corp in that achievement of that vision, the EPA had been sponsoring a Presidential Green Challenge Award. And so they have, I think, five different categories. And so the DuPont Jenin Corp team won the 2003 Green Chemistry Challenge Award, Presidential Green Challenge Award, I think for innovative processes. I'm not quite sure which category. And that was just a wonderful, sort of external acknowledgement of the, you know, of the significance of that accomplishment. So, we had representatives and as many as we could come to the National Academy of Sciences that day for receiving the award, along with the other awardees. And what I, at least for me, which was valuable about that award, in contrast to the other awardees which were either singular or tiny groups of people is that our award had diversity in terms of people of color and gender that the other teams didn't. And I think to me just, you know, there's a message there in terms of, sort of from a diversity point of view in terms of what you can accomplish, something big if you bring to it, you know, all of the intelligence and diversity that you can to something, so.
Story_ID: 626645
Speaker 1: I have a note here that says something about DuPont and the U.S. government creating a biorefinery. Is that--
Speaker 2: So the Loudon plant is a biorefinery, if you will, where they're making three-- one-three propane diol or bio-3G. So, but you said, and the U.S. government?
Speaker 1: Yes, that's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, then that alludes to, that alludes to something else, so, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so that's probably outside of my, my area. So there was cooperative work, the U.S. government sponsoring DuPont in this work of cellulosic ethanol and so that came after the 3G effort for me, and I wasn't involved in that. So that may be what that alludes to.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it says DuPont and the United States Department of Energy National Renewable Energy Laboratory--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yep, ENREL, yep, that's the cellulosics.
Speaker 1: --for the Joint Research, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that's not, I was not involved in that at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. Two thousand and four [2004], your research focused on environmentally friendly processes to manufacture biological feedstock's, right? Is that--
Speaker 2: We were taking feedstock, so we were taking renewable feedstocks to make, again, the same thing as with the 3G, but we were making a new class of molecules that could go into the electronics industry. That was, it was just a different audience, if you will. So it's the same theme, different reaction, but a different customer. So and that particular one that you're talking about, I was making aromatic molecules that potentially could be the starting material for, for photoresist for the electronic industry, and DuPont had an electronic department. So we, part of sort of a general theme here is that one of the things we're trying to do is to demonstrate that this whole notion of, you know, if you wanna use the simple word, Green Chemistry or a different way of approaching how to make molecules, can be applied in a variety of different areas from making materials for fuel, which is what, what you were just describing and an effort I wasn't involved in to new materials, whether it's for clothing and carpet, like the 3G or electronics which is that other new project that I got involved in in 2004 aromatics.
Story_ID: 626646
Speaker 1: Now, 2006, you won the, NOBCChE's [National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers] Henry Hill Award. And what was--tell us who Henry Hill was and what, what's the, significance of that award is?
Speaker 2: So, Henry Hill and the connection, the fact that my name gets associated to Henry Hill just brought me great joy. And I spoke of that in my address in that Henry Hill was the first president of color for the American Chemical Society. Henry Hill also got his doctorate from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. He was president of the ACS [American Chemical Society] during the time I was in graduate school. But more importantly, and the reason he is honored and there is a Henry Hill Award sponsored by the American Chemical Society, by NOBCCE, well, I mean I'm sure NOBCCE has a different motivation but by the American Chemical Society and by the Northeast section, the Northeastern Section of the American Chemical Society is that he was involved in a committee at the American Chemical Society which ultimately generated a set of professional guidelines for, for chemists in terms of the--there's one for academic. There's the academic professional guidelines. And then there's the other professional guidelines for those who are in industry and government and our code of ethics. And he was part of that committee on the committee of ethics and professional affairs that I was a member of at council and on a particular subcommittee that had the responsibility for making sure that our professional guidelines and the code of ethics was continually being upgraded to meet, you know, newer standards. And the fact that Henry Hill was important in advocating for those guidelines, you know, mean a lot to me tremendously. He, you know, again, it speaks to someone who had, like my mother, the kind of sort of moral, ethical compass, a straight rod-edness (ph.), and a vision of, you know, being able to articulate a clear vision of behavior and standards that we should all adhere to. So why I was chosen for that award, maybe it had to do with service in other capacities.
Story_ID: 626647
Speaker 1: During this period of time, there's nothing but awards. There's the Science Spectrum Magazine Award and there's the 3G team wins the ACS [American Heroes in Science Award] in 2007; 2008, you win the NOBCChE [National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers] Percy Julian Award, and so when you actually look back on everything you've done to this point in, as a professional chemists, what today would you say is your legacy as a chemist?
Speaker 2: For me, I would say quite honestly, it's the fact that I listened to the call, and I stayed true to it and just stayed steady on the path. You know, I feel very strongly that I am not one who has, you know, garnered any particular, you know, world-shattering, you know, individual achievement. But that as time and opportunity given to me to take advantage of an openness to go into institutions that had been denied to people of my race in particular, and certainly even my gender being discouraged, that, you know, I think I honored that sense that, you know, this is who I am. This is who I should be, and to just stay true to the course and to enjoy it. And so the honors that I've gotten, it's still hard for me to, to accept that it's deserved. But from the, from the sense of just one who embodies a sense of this is where I should be, this is, you know, I think--I feel most proud of that. You know, there've been, I know, times when I've seen colleagues or people who I felt should earnestly be in my place, but for whatever reason, they chose to get off track and do something different for whatever reason. You know, I think, you know, I take this great pride in that I've stayed true to what I feel is what got me attracted in the very beginning, is that a sense that clarity of vision comes in seeing the molecules, you know, in the middle of the day, at the end of the day, at the beginning of the morning. And this is what I should be doing. And sharing that joy with colleagues, with young people and what I hope most by my infusion of sort of a rightness for what I'm doing and where I'm doing it, is that that will just help them discern whatever it is they should be. And it's not for, certainly not for money. It's not for honor. It's really because this is what I think I'm supposed to be doing and that I hope that the joy and, you know, comes out, just emerges that I'm enjoying what I do.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's a long ways look ahead, rather than a micro-look. I mean even though you're, you deal with micro, or with molecular structures, you're looking out ahead at, I guess--well, I shouldn't try to summarize what you said.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But that's what I get out of it, that you're looking way ahead. And by doing that, you're able to hit these milestones.
Story_ID: 626648
Speaker 1: Now, what advice would you offer for young people wanna be chemists today?
Speaker 2: To one, try to get exposure very early, to--if you're interested in becoming a researcher with laboratory as your setting, to really try to test that as early as possible. If you can get experience as an undergraduate, you know, do so. You know, even if you're in a small institution and the faculty don't have access to research, there are many programs that either offered through alliances with other major institutions or summer programs, because I really think the immersion, so that they can actually test and get feedback and answers to, does this really fit for me, because I think it's important that students, no matter what they're interested in, to sort of try on their expectation of what it is they think they wanna do, to really see if it fits 'em. So I think that's really important because laboratory science is a really, it's a, it's a specially unique environment. It's demanding and in a way that's, that is unique. You don't have a lot of latitude in your undergraduate experience if you're going into laboratory science or even engineering, as far as the course offerings and what's to be done. So I would just encourage just early experience and exposure and talking to people who are in various different types of communities because too often I've heard people make generalizations about how good something is or how bad something is, based on one archetype, but there is no single archetype. Industry is as diverse as colleges are, and I think it's just very important that they just try to meet with as many different people and get a sense as to how different they are and where they might fit into the whole divide. The other thing I think I would say to students is that, don't hesitate to, to reach out to someone, even if you don't know them. I mean the access that young people have in terms of communications and you don't have to write the long letter to someone. Now, they can, you know, they can send an email to introduce themselves. And not to be intimidated by someone's title because by reaching out, you honor who they are by, you know, by saying, you know, you'd like to talk to them. And so that is something that I would--it shouldn't be a point of intimidation. And more often than not, most people are very generous with their time or at least resources. If they don't, they can share, recommend someone else to do that. And I think that's something I would also encourage students to do too, to network. When I do have students come into my laboratory for the summer, I make sure I introduce them to as many different people who've come to science or whatever they do in very different journeys 'cause that's the only way they're gonna be educated and come to terms with the fact that there's no singular way to get somewhere. There's a diverse, there're a whole host of diverse ways of getting there 'cause I think that will serve to affirm to that student that, I don't have to--you know, it's not so narrow a walk. I think coming into science, there are some certain things that you must have in order to be assured that you have lots of options. And I think that's very clear, particularly, coming in through the secondary educational system, which is where I think a lot of people of color get disconnected by not having that science-math preparedness. But after that, I think you've got a lot of latitude for how you get into the doors. And so I wanna communicate that also.

Speaker 1: You said earlier, you know, when you were at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], you--you pretty much decided you would go into private industry rather than--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: As a default because I knew at the point I--academics did not look appealing, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, what was it about academics that kind of turned you off?
Speaker 2: What I can say is that the--what I saw of the faculty, chemistry at MIT, they didn't model what I thought would be the way I could see myself as a professor. If I had been in a different institution, with a different set of people, it would have been a very different game. And I can say that that--you know, so there was a sense of sort of these were the super, these were superstars, and I didn't see myself as a superstar. And it was just very clear that this was not how I wanted to model, you know, my career, trajectory. I can say though that that question of whether academics or corporations wasn't still answered for me. I mean as I said very clearly, I wanted to go to the Peace Corp. I wanted time to think things out. And so about ten years later, I decided I--that question was still, you know, at the back of my mind. And I decided ten years later to try for small schools. I, you know, I contacted, you know, George [Whitesides]--I would see him regularly anyway. But I said, "I'm gonna try." This was '92 [1992], '92 [1992]. And so he was very clear on what he wanted. He wanted ten research proposals so he can vet and make, you know, 'cause he says "You're gonna need this as a suite of things to go out." So I did that. I had a couple of interests, and actually a verbal offer from an institution that was, that had a master's program. And at the end of the day, when I looked at the requirements for what would be required for me in that environment, I said, I, this--I would not be happy. The classroom teaching part of it was far too, for me, onerous. And I had already had classroom teaching experience in college settings. I had been an adjunct [professor] at Delaware State [University, Dover, Delaware] and at University of Delaware [Newark, Delaware]. And I was not interested. The laboratory is my setting, and so I decided that, at that point that I had the job that best suited me. I was in the right community.

Speaker 1: We always ask people that if they look back on everything they've done to this point, is there any major change they would make or fix?
Speaker 2: The only thing that--yeah, I guess there are two. So let me start at Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. Because I was, I was working two or three jobs to make ends meet. I mean I had my scholarship--you know, it paid for my tuition, but all the incidentals. So I, I worked all the time. I wish I had taken out more aid money or grant or scholarship--not scholarship, but loan money. And I would have extended my time at Penn to be the full four years and taken other fun courses that I enjoyed, like in history, particularly, history and languages. So that's one, and so when I see or talk to people who try to rush things--and part of my rushing was a sense of urgency to try to help my family. You know, I mean I had three younger siblings behind me. You know, and I knew my mother [Inez Penn Haynie Dodson], you know, it was kind of tough for my mother. I said, my first semester at Penn, my mother was unemployed. So, you know, I wanted to try to be the success and get on. In retrospect, that six months, that year, it, you know, in a long life, that means nothing. And so that's one regret. The second regret was there was, there were two occasions where I almost left Du Pont for different reasons. One, I was heavily wooed by a start-up company to be their seventh principal, and this was in the context of the medical device company--work that I was doing. I, if I hadn't been in love (laughter), and if the person that I was in love with hadn't live south of here, because the opportunity was north, I would have been gone in a heartbeat. And it was an extraordinary opportunity, and it was like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. And I still say that. People say, I mean they say "That's not the right answer, Sharon." I said, "I picked wrong" (laughter). But I say, I picked wrong. But those are the only two regrets, but the long and short of it, I've had, you know, what came after in my tenure at Du Pont has just been absolutely marvelous. So I don't have any regrets about that, but I sure would like to try the other, wish I could have a parallel path where I could, you know, you know, a different, you know, a different chance to try something different and see how that would have ended 'cause that would have been fabulous. I know within two years that company grew to about two hundred and fifty employees. So it would have been just a very different opportunity. But, so those are, those are the only, only two things I would, you know--the one is something I say to all young people. You know, don't try to rush things. This is a very unique, particularly undergraduate, it's such a very unique time in life. Don't try to accelerate it. If you can, that extra year, you know, even if you are bearing some burden financially, you know, in the long scheme of things, if there are things that, you know, you enjoy in college, you know, it's a wonderful opportunity to do that.
Story_ID: 626651
Speaker 1: This is a non-chemistry question. There may be some chemistry in it, but what--we always ask this, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy (laughter). That's loaded. The preparedness in science and math. I mean over and over, I can't--and the fact that here in 2013, I still confront--no different than thirty or forty years ago, when I talk to a young student who's aspiring to become a doctor and I ask what are the math and science you've taken. And it's really the math that's a killer. And they're not on a trajectory to get to calculus. You know, it's almost a foregone conclusion in terms of the real--you know, how realistic their aspirations are. So the failure of, of a real keen sense of what it takes to be prepared because I know there can be competitiveness, but you've got to have the preparation. It's the preparedness so that you can use the tools and the intellect that we have. That causes me great distress.
Story_ID: 626652
Speaker 1: Now, do you have children?
Speaker 2: I have no children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm the great aunt (laughter).
Speaker 1: So did you ever get married or--
Speaker 2: No, I never got married either. Yeah, that, see that's why, when I say that I chose wrong, that, that didn't end up as I had expected it to. So, that relationship where I wanted really to take that start-up job, but I was, I had every expectation to be married. So, yeah, so I've never been married, and I've never had children.
Speaker 1: Now, did your grandfather [William Penn] get a chance to see you get your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't, but the month before he died, that October, I was on a little break at Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. He died Thanksgiving Day, 1974. It was my second year at Penn. He was laying in his bed. He was in a nursing home at that time. My mother could no longer manage him in her home so he was in a nursing home for the last two years of his life. When I came to visit, he says, "Sharon, you're still at that college, aren't you?" And I said, yes. And so he knew that, you know, I was on my way.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, that's good. And your mother's [Inez Penn Haynie Dodson] still alive? Is she--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yes, my mom is still very much alive, yeah.
Speaker 1: Both your parents, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep, they're both alive, yeah.
Speaker 1: And your brothers and sisters--did your brother who liked to study with you, did he--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Michael's the entrepreneur, yeah. He's, he's doing a lot of different things. But he's primarily been in the hospitality industry. His last job where he was employed by someone else was two years ago, where he was a VP [vice president] for operations of a boutique hotel in Baltimore [Maryland], and he's garnered all kinds of awards from the hospitality industry, citizens' groups and community groups in Baltimore. He is your, just exemplary, all-around, great citizen. But he stays out of the political arena, although I have a great picture with him shaking hands with [President] Bill Clinton, but he is, he's very much politics. He's an advisor for the mayor in Baltimore, and is in all kinds of Maryland state as well as Baltimore City, you know, know it. My mother took him for his, to celebrate his fifty-fifth birthday at--well, he took her, (laughter) to the Capital Grill in Baltimore. And she said, all the grand poobas stopped by to, to honor my brother. So, and he has five kids. So, he's been a king of a different way. He's got kids ranging from thirty to sixteen. And he's got two grandchildren, two grandsons. So.
Speaker 1: And the others, any other siblings that--
Speaker 2: So my sister, Michelle, has, she has been an entree--Michael's been an entrepreneur in the past. He's trying to establish his own companies now for the past two years. My sister has been sort of marketing, small marketing for most of her adult life. And she has two grown children, my niece, who will graduate from medical school next--in two months and my nephew is working as a public, as parent liaison for the school system in Virginia Beach [Virginia]. My youngest brother just has one. So it's five, two and one, yeah, and he is in Norfolk, doing outreach--no, he's, I'm sorry. He's in North Carolina, and he has one son who's about to graduate, and--from high school, who's interested in engineering. He's the first--he's one of two who's been interested in science. And that brother, Keith, is doing outreach work, working in a rehab [rehabilitation] facility with, particularly with women and women who have children. So, and then my two other siblings, Aisha and--Aisha is a physician in Houston [Texas], and Kesi is a lawyer, and she's right now looking at doing different work. She was real estate law in Fort Myers [Florida]. And now she's looking to do something very different. So she's trying to figure out what she wants to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And neither of them have any kids at this point.
Story_ID: 626653
Speaker 1: Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered? I think the most important thing for me is bringing others along. You know, there's this little anecdote, as I shared at the George Washington Carver Science Fair to a group of students last week, that I don't care so much about what, you know, I leave, but who I bring along. And it comes from this little anecdote I heard of St. Peter and someone coming to the gates, the Pearly Gates, asking for admission, showing their long CV [curriculum vitae], this is what I've done for the world. And St. Peter said, that's all great, but who have you brought with you? And at the end of the day, that's what I'd like to, sort of clarity for, you know, in terms of, you know, who I brought along, you know, whether it's, you know, young people in science or, you know, it's really more to be supportive and making sure and do as much to pull, cajole, push others into being their full potential, not so much for, for what I've done.
Story_ID: 626654
Speaker 1: Okay, this is, this gives a sense of my sister's entrepreneurial. This was in Daytona Beach, 'Tea by the Sea' was the name of her little business, and that's me on the left with my sister, Michelle, on the right. And my mother and I had gone down there to celebrate my oldest nephew, Wesley's, sixteenth birthday. It was a surprise visit. And so this was, how many years ago? Six years ago.
Speaker 2: And she goes by Michelle--
Speaker 1: She goes by Michelle now.
Speaker 2: What's her last name?
Speaker 1: Madison, Michelle Madison.
Speaker 2: Alright.
Speaker 1: This, ready? Should I start or wait?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, this picture is just a collection. I'm not gonna describe all the people, but these are facilitators of leadership courses for the American Chemical Society [ACS]. And, again, it just is a reminder for me, I am connected to a broad range of people from ACS staff to faculty, to people from the various parts of the American Chemical Society who sometimes do a singular thing, but we all come from different ways of doing it. And these are just fun people to work with?
Speaker 2: About what year is it?
Speaker 1: This is this year, this is January, 2013.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: This picture, I think, given the age of my sister, is 1961. So that's me on the left, and my sister, Michelle, in the middle, and my brother, Michael, on the right, looking at her. This is in the courtyard in the projects in Baltimore, Maryland.
Speaker 1: That's the [Edgar Allan] Poe projects?
Speaker 2: P-O-E.
Speaker 1: Okay. I bet there are a lot of puns about that.
Speaker 2: Yes, there are (laughter).
Speaker 1: I'm not sure what day, this is in the 1990s. That's me on the left at NOBCChE [National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers] meeting, and I believe it was in the West Coast, and on the right is Professor Wes [Irvin Wesley] Elliot who was a professor of chemistry at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me in Germany, 1963, in a Bavarian dress that I always loved because I have that same goofy smile and (laughter) holding my head the same way.
Speaker 1: This is just a picture that it reminds me fondly of one of dozens of trips I've taken during the summer with my nephews. We were in Virginia at a camp, and this is four of the nephews, and actually, all four nephews and one grand-nephew in there. So if you need to note them, they are, Michael, Jr. at the far left, grand-nephew, Karan and next to him, Keith, Jr., in front of me, and then Aaron in a headlock with the oldest nephew, Wesley.
Speaker 2: So, these are two photos on the left, I think about the same time, 1961, so that's me on the left, my little sister, Michelle, in front of my father who's in the Army uniform, and my brother, Michael on the right. It's definitely in front of our unit at the Poe Homes projects, and to the right is my parents' marriage, their wedding date. I can't see who's on the left or right of them, but my mother [Inez Penn Haynie Dodson] is in the middle, to the left of my father [William Henry Haynie Jr.]. And that's 1955, in June.
Speaker 1: This is my mother on the left, Inez Dodson, with Mary Virginia Orna on the right, and this was--Mary Virginia has been the head of our chemistry study tours. And so this was at a meeting in California last year.
Speaker 2: I do visit family in the Caribbean a lot, and these are two cousins, Eric Wood and Ms. Fairlane with my mother to the right.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's an old picture of me and my youngest brother, Keith and me to the right in front of a home that I renovated in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], an old home. That's probably in the mid-'80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: It's kind of stuck in that--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, just keep it there. This is just my--my third-grade class in Munich, Germany, Ms. Pippin was the teacher.
Speaker 2: This was me talking to one of my colleagues, Zelleka Getahun. I think we were in her laboratory at University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: This was a photo of my father. I'm sure it's probably as a private into the Army. I think it was his first year, involved in the U.S. Army.
Speaker 2: What's his name?
Speaker 1: William Henry Haynie, Jr.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This was our passport photo leaving Germany, 1965. To the left is my brother, Michael. In front of me is my youngest brother, Keith, and then my sister to the far right.
Speaker 2: This is day of commencement from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. It's my father talking to me, with my gown and my--at MIT, 1982.
Speaker 1: This is me on the evening of the award dinner for the Percy Julian Award at NOBCChE [National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers] meeting. Actually, it was here in Philadelphia. And I'm on the left and on the right is Keisha McDowell who was actually one of the sponsors for the award. She's a young chemical engineer at Du Pont.
Speaker 2: This is my dear granny or granddaddy, William Penn, and this is his Port of Entry passport into the United States, dated 1981--no, I'm sorry, 1918, is the date of this photo. Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's the year my daddy was born.
Speaker 2: Really, oh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1918.
Speaker 2: This was a picture from the celebration of my fiftieth birthday in 2005, select members of my family surrounding me.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's it right now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
