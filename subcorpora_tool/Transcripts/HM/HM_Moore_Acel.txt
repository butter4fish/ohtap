The videographer is Matthew Hickey, and the interviewer is [HistoryMaker] Paul Brock.  Mr. Moore, can we begin by asking you to give us your full name and spell each one of those, first name, middle and last?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My first name is Acel, A-C-E-L.  The last name is Moore, M-double O-R-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And no middle initial?
Speaker 2: No.  No middle initial.
Speaker 1: All right.  And I'm going to ask you, where were you born?
Speaker 2: I was born in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], October 5th, 1940.
Story_ID: 296044
Speaker 1: And I'm going to now ask you five simple People magazine questions.  And they are meant to stimulate your brain cells.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food.  Oh, I don't know.  I have many favorites.  I have, in my forty-three year professional career, I've never been late for a meal.  I've been late for many a thing, but eating is not one of them.  You know, I have many favorites, and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I mean, I like the--I was born in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  Some people call it up north, I refer to it as up south.  My mother [Hura Harrington Moore] and father [Jerry Acel Moore] are southerners.  And my mother, who was a major influence in terms of the diet, was from North Carolina.  My father, by the way, is from Atlanta [Georgia] originally.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, so I like the--you know, and grew up eating the traditional Southern dishes and North Carolina barbeque is still a favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother made that.  For desserts, you know, the deep dish apple pie and peach pie.  The cobblers were very good.  And I still love that.
Speaker 1: You like them all.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: And these answers can be--remain very simple.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, I like various shades of blue, and I've gotten older, I can appreciate all the colors of the rainbow.
Speaker 1: All right.  Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know.  Let's see.  My favorite time of year, I guess, would be spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Anywhere there's a warm climate and during the winter months.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).  And, finally, your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: My favorite phrase or saying.  I mean, I'm repeating the question, and, you know, I use words a lot and I don't know if I really have a favorite.  I say--there's a couple of metaphors that I use a lot, and one of them is about my hometown, Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I often have been accused of saying that, there're only two kinds of people in the world, those who are from Philadelphia and those who wish they were from Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).  And now just one more just to start stimulating the brain cells.  Where are we located today?
Speaker 2: We're in Atlanta in an historical section of this historic city, an area which the black community in this city, at a time when segregation was the law of this state and the nation, essentially, and a place where great leaders from this city become national--became national figures.  My father grew up not too far from here.  I guess they call it the Black Bottom [Atlanta, Georgia] and--
Speaker 1: I'm going to get into that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 1: --in just a few moments.  Just one more question.  And give us today's date.
Speaker 2: Today is August 5th, 2005.
Story_ID: 296045
Speaker 1: Now, we're going to go back a little bit prior to your birth.  What is the earliest you can recite--well, first of all, let me ask you:  give us your mother's name.
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Hura Mae, H-U-R-A, M-A-E.  And her maiden name was Harrington.  And she married my father, Acel J. Moore.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was Hura Mae Harrington Moore.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Hamlet, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, do you know the date or approximately?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She was born in 1913.
Speaker 1: You know the month?
Speaker 2: November.  November--
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: --I think it was the 12th.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I'm not certain.
Speaker 1: Good enough.  Okay.  November 12th, 1913.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Might--you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's go back and try to trace her family.  Just from memory or--not from memory, but just from hearing your mother tell you about it, how far back can you trace your family on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Well, I can go back to--and I haven't formally done--traced them, but I know that her mother died, was a victim in the 19--epidemic, the flu pandemic, which killed thousands of people across this country.  And my maternal grandmother died in that pandemic in Hamlet, and she was the mother of seven.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, my maternal grandmother, and her name was Harrington.  She married--and her maiden--my maternal grandmother's maiden name was Gordan, and she married--
Speaker 1: The family--what--do you know what her first name was?
Speaker 2: My maternal grandmother's first name, I think, was Olivia.  I'm not sure now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have to check.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I never met her or saw her,--
Speaker 1: And Warden [sic. Gordan], spell that for us.  Her last--her maiden name.
Speaker 2: Her maiden name was Gordan, G-O-R-D-A-N.  Gordan.
Speaker 1: Oh, Gordan.  Right.  Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: G-O-R-D-O-N.  Gordon.  G-O-R-D--G, Gordan.  G-O--
Speaker 1: G-O-R-D-A-N.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Okay.  And she had seven children.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your mother, of course, was one of them.
Speaker 2: One of them, yes.  There were--let me make sure I got that right.  There were--it was six.  There were four--she had--my mother had four brothers and one sister, so it's six.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that makes up the seven children.  The six siblings.
Speaker 2: Well, no.  My mother had one sister and she had four brothers.  So that makes six.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Okay.  Okay.  So there're six children.  Okay.  And can you remember much about your grandfather on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Mr. Harrington, he was highly respected.  I think that he--
Speaker 1: What was his full name?
Speaker 2: I need to get back to--that's what I needed to do--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --when I--
Speaker 1: Not a problem.
Speaker 2: And he died before I was born.  But he was a twin, and I'm a twin.  So twins run in my family.  And we're not identical.  I don't have an identical twin.  My grandfather was not--didn't have an identical twin.  I have a first cousin who has twins, so that kind of runs in the family.  I never, never met my paternal grandfather [Jerry A. Moore] or grandmother [Agnes Moses Moore].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were both deceased when I was born.
Speaker 1: When you were born?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 296046
Speaker 1: Are there any childhood memories that your mother [Hura Harrington Moore] might have that she related to you?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  Her father was respected and--
Speaker 1: Do you know what his business was?
Speaker 2: No.  But I know he--I believed he served on the school board in the black--you know, it was segregated school system then, so that--and I feel remiss in not doing the research.  And I earlier memory--I have some--I do have some history of that, that my uncle, my mother's brother had done.
Speaker 1: We will--we'll get to it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The--oh, I was asking about, do you remember your mother's siblings?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  All of them.  One of them is still alive.  The youngest--her youngest--the youngest child of that family, Alfred Harrington, is still alive and still very well.  When I became ill, he's way in his age and all, but he came to visit me in the hospital.  And I just feel--and it made me feel that my mother is still reaching out to me through him.  And we're a very close family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he came to visit me, and I talk to him often.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm going to, before both of us leave here, I mean, I'm going to sit down and talk to him and get more detail and record the history of mother's side of the family.  And I have still a lot of cousins who live in North Carolina, some of whom I have never, never met on my mother's side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they were--the Harrington men were men who were very proud and who distinguished themselves in what they did.
Speaker 1: Let's name them, and then you can tell me which ones you remember.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There's Alfred Harrington, who's the youngest.
Speaker 2: Alfred, he was the youngest.  Alfred Harrington was a union official in the [U.S.] Postal Service in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  He was the president of a local post office union in Philadelphia and a very active member of the labor movement there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And retired from the Postal Service.  His next oldest brother Robert Harrington, who lived most of his life after he left his native North Carolina in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And worked as both a cook, and he held two jobs. He never married.  He was a bachelor all of his life, but he was a--he worked for the telephone company in D.C.  It's called the Washington Potomac [Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company; Verizon Washington, D.C. Inc., Washington, D.C.]--I don't know if it's still called that now, but it--
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  No.  It's the same.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's now Verizon, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Verizon.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of Washington.
Speaker 2: And then his--and then the oldest of the--and then there was another brother, Curtis Harrington, Uncle Curtis.  He lived in Philadelphia a lot, and he was--he also worked for the Postal Service and retired.  And he died I guess when he was about fifty-six of cancer.  But he was--both Alfred and Curtis Harrington, my mother's two brothers, served in World War II [WWII].  And Curtis Harrington was, you know, significantly highly decorated during World War II.  He was a sergeant in the [U.S.] Army.  He was a member of what they called the Red Ball Express, and he saw a lot of combat and was decorated with valor and bronze stars--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and was a significant member of the U.S. Army during that conflict.  Now, the oldest brother, James Pickett Harrington, also lived in Washington, D.C., and he went to one of the historically black colleges [HBCUs] in North Carolina, the one that I think is going there.  But he got a--you know, he came out of--he was good athlete.  He played basketball and he got an, I think, an associate's degree, a two-year degree out of that school.  And during the [Great] Depression when he was a college graduate and a young man, the only job he could get was as a janitor for the telephone company in Washington, D.C.  He and his brother both worked as porters (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 296047
Speaker 1: My uncle, we called him Pick, you know, James [Pickett] Harrington, when he retired from the telephone company [Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company; Verizon Washington, D.C. Inc., Washington, D.C.], probably forty-something years after that, he was just under a vice president.  He was a second or third level manager for the Potomac Telephone Company in Washington [D.C.]; in fact, managed the building where he had, at one point, managed the building, the same building where he was a janitor at.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: He was the manager of that building.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they were--all of the Harrington men were very proud men, and they were men among men and they distinguished themselves whatever they did.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And certainly my Uncle Pick was--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --a legend in [Washington] D.C. in the telephone company.  And he mentored many other younger men.  Now, the older people, you know, some are gone now, but even when--the generation out at Hamlet [North Carolina], if they're still at the telephone company, they would know who he is.
Speaker 2: Right.  Let me go back to your mother [Hura Harrington Moore]--
Speaker 1: Olivia--I mean, no.  And my mother's--Bruce, my aunt; she had a sister named--had the name Bruce [Harrington]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --who was named after my grandmother's brother, he's her uncle.  Bruce--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, you say she had a sister--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Her name was Bruce.
Speaker 2: --and--
Speaker 1: We called her (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh, that's right.  Great.  And two girls.
Speaker 1: My mother.  There were two.  My mother and Bruce.  And Brucie.
Speaker 2: Right.  Okay.
Speaker 1: And we called her Aunt Bruce.
Speaker 2: B--is that spelled (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) B-R--yeah.  B-R-U-C-E.  And she was named after her mother [Olivia Gordan Harrington].  My maternal grandmother named her after her brother, really, 'cause she has a brother.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: An uncle who I knew, a grand uncle by the name of Bruce Gordan (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: Same as the actor.
Speaker 2: Right.  Now, the--and all--everyone grew up in Hamlet, North Carolina?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Hamlet.  But they came to--they migrated--
Speaker 2: Washington and Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 1: Yeah--and the North during that period--
Speaker 2: Now, did Aunt Bruce also (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) before the, yeah, in the '20s [1920s]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In the '20s [1920s] they migrated.  My mother was about maybe nine years old when she--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --or ten when she came to Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, did Aunt Bruce come to Philadelphia (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: --or D.C.?
Speaker 1: Came also--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and then some come to Washington and some came to Philadelphia.
Story_ID: 296048
Speaker 1: Now, let's go to your mother [Hura Harrington Moore].  What as her childhood like?  I mean, she went to school some place, of course.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And, you know, because their mother [Olivia Gordan Harrington] died and my Uncle Alfred [Harrington] never really knew his mother, 'cause she was a baby when--he was an infant when she died from that flu pandemic--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and so, the Harrington family took the boys, and the father's family took the boys.  And the girls went to live with the Gordans, the aunts; her--my grandmother's sisters.  And so, they would get together every summer, the boys and the girls would.  But during the school year, they--their family split up, the males and females, and--I'm sorry--
Speaker 1: But the Gordans lived in Hamlet [North Carolina], right?  Or did they live in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] or how did that go?
Speaker 2: No.  The Gordans, I mean, they were in North Carolina for a while--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I mean, you know, after their mother died.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And then later--
Speaker 1: Your mother, did she go with the boys or did she stay with the Harringtons?
Speaker 2: Well, she went to Philadelphia with the Gordans.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Of course, Bruce Gordan, her uncle, who was a stevedore, a longshoreman, he moved up--I guess, first he moved up, I guess, to Newport News [Virginia] and then they moved up to Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was--
Speaker 1: Stevedore--go on.
Speaker 2: A stevedore, but he was the paternal influence of the two, to the whole family--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --on both sides, I mean.  And, of course, the Harringtons--you know, he died too before his sons were fully adults.  And so--you know, so the mother's family, the Gordans, had influence on all of them.
Speaker 1: Now, when Bruce Gordan moved to, you said Norfolk [Virginia] and then--
Speaker 2: Newport News and then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Newport News.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, obviously looking for work.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The '30s [1930s] were very, very tough.  And then he moved from there to Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And his two nieces with another sister moved to Philadelphia, too.  They follow him, and he was sort of like their father.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: And sort of the clan leader.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The clan leader.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he worked all during the [Great] Depression.  He was a stevedore, and he was, you know, a tough man.  I mean, he was a strong, tough--and then to be a stevedore, you had to be physically fit and tough, and he was a fighter.  And he, in that union--later, they formed a union there.  But the longshoremen's union [International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union] in Philadelphia and Wilmington [Delaware] were the only two that have been historically run by black men.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Okay.
Speaker 2: All of the others are run by other immigrants.  And these southern black men, many of them are from North Carolina and Virginia, came to where they emerged and they remain in control of that union 'til today.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Both in Wilmington and in Philadelphia.  My uncle--
Speaker 1: Bruce Gordan?
Speaker 2: Bruce Gordan.  As a--before the union got really started, but he was a manager, as a foreman--he was a manager, you know--and men--but he--I'm not sure if he ever joined the union, but he retired as a foreman.  And I learned later when I was boy, you know, he would come to visit my mother at her house, that when men in the neighborhood knew that we were--I was a nephew of Mr. Gordan, I mean, I got all kinds of respect.  I didn't even understand why, 'cause some of the men worked on the yard, and they were not going to offend the--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --foreman guy because they wouldn't get any work, I mean (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: But, (unclear) a kid, that kind of stature.
Speaker 1: Right.  Did we identify that stevedore union, the name of it?
Speaker 2: The union, no.  But I can get that for you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's fine.
Speaker 2: I mean, even Lucien [E.] Blackwell, who was a local elected official in Philadelphia and a state representative and a U.S. congressman, had been president of that union.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Of that same union, you know, I mean.  So that--and that is very unique.  The Philadelphia Longshoremen's Union has always been run by black men.  And that doesn't exist in any other place.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Whether it's New Orleans [Louisiana], New York [New York], San Francisco [California].  But Wilmington and Philadelphia.
Story_ID: 296049
Speaker 1: We're going to come back to make sure we expand on that, because Uncle Bruce Gordan sounds like a very, very important figure in your life.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But I want to follow your mother [Hura Harrington Moore].  When Bruce Gordan went to Newport News [Virginia], your mother went with him.
Speaker 2: Now, I don't know if she actually moved to Newport News.  I think she may have stayed in--
Speaker 1: Hamlet [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: --in North Carolina.  Either Hamlet--I think they went to Rocky Mount [North Carolina], which is where another sister of her mother [Olivia Gordan Harrington], aunt.  And they had a restaurant and they cooked.  And my mother knew how to cook and so did my Aunt Brucie [Bruce Harrington], 'cause, the aunt they stayed with ran a restaurant.
Speaker 1: In Rocky Mount?
Speaker 2: In Rocky Mount.  Yeah.  And so, my mother was an excellent cook.  And even though she was very young when she got--she may have been eleven or twelve when she came, but she learned how to cook from her aunt, you know.  And they knew how to.  And her sister, who was a little older, Aunt Bruce, and she was--so when I was a boy, I mean, when people--barbeque to me was chopped pork.  You know, I mean--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --ribs were just spare ribs.  That wasn't barbeque.  I mean (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: If you're from North Carolina, you understand that.  My mother would make spare ribs, and she would--but when she made barbeque, the meat from the ribs would be chopped and spiced and, you know, cooked, you know.  And I didn't realize it until later that what people call barbeque ribs was not really barbeque, you know, if you're from North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Right.  But I know North Carolina barbeque.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's supposed to be very, very unique.  Let me go back to when your mother was a young girl.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And she was growing up.  She goes through this tragedy of losing both parents.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Her mother initially and then later her father.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, back, I think that--I don't know exactly what the date was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that she lost her father.
Speaker 1: Now she's a young girl and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, she was raised as--which is a tradition of southern families, the black families.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The families, you know, are--oh, yes.  I mean, that's not an unusual circumstance for black families.  I mean, the aunts and the uncles become the parents--
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: --when that happen, when kids or children are orphaned by deaths.  And, you know, it doesn't happen that often today.
Speaker 1: Is it--are there any stories that your mother may have related to you of what life for her was like during that period right her parents died, and--
Speaker 2: Well, she--and I have to get the name of my aunt, Aunt Dool [ph.] Aunt Dool.  That was her nickname, but her mother is another one of her mother's sisters.  You know, it was a woman that she loved like a mother.  And another aunt, you know.  I mean, they embraced them.  They were very close.  And her mother's sister treated her as if that she was, you know, their own daughter, you know, and her brothers as if they were their own sons.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So they--the sense of loss is not the same today, I don't think, when--I mean, after the grief, I mean--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because the children were embraced by the siblings of their parents.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So that--and as far as my--the young--her youngest brother [Alfred Harrington], I mean, he knew nobody else as his mother except his aunt, his mother's sister.  And she was his mother (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause he truly had no memory of his mother.
Story_ID: 296050
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Hura Harrington Moore] relate any stories about what--
Speaker 2: Oh, she related stories to us and she talked in particular about her uncle, who was sort of like her father, Bruce Gordan.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I knew that they lived in the South, and that they worked very hard, and the men worked hard, and that her father was a tough disciplinarian and those boys respected him, and they also respected their mother's [Olivia Gordan Harrington] brother, too, Bruce Gordan.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he--when he said something, they jumped, you know.  He was a very active male, a boy, you know, who were--both, Curtis [Harrington]--and they were football players, and they played--participated in sports.  But when the male--I mean, it was kind of a male-dominated culture.  And--but, you know--but as I understood it, though, the women really ran things.  The aunts (laughter).  Yeah.  I mean, I had a sense of that, too.
Speaker 1: Why did you have a sense of it?  Was there a particular story?
Speaker 2: Well, based on what my mother said, and based on what my uncles would say, you know, when they would--and the aunts were always talked about more than the men except--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --for the one, Uncle Bruce, on my mother's side of the family.  But they were very proud people.  And the men stood up.  And I know the uncles, when they were looking for work, in the '30s [1930s] when they became--when they finished school and were out looking for work, they--and it was a depression [Great Depression], it was very difficult.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And my two uncles who had moved to Washington [D.C.] often repeated the story.
Speaker 1: And just go ahead and the sentence and then--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  About them looking for work and seeing a job ad for a shoeshine boy or man--
Story_ID: 296051
Speaker 1: You were just going to tell us about that uncle.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The both of them, they saw a--either two of them or three of them, Curtis [Harrington] also moved to Washington [D.C.], too.  Curtis Harrington--Alfred Harrington was still living with his aunt, and he was--he's younger.  So he was still in school.  But Robert [Harrington], James [Pickett Harrington] and Curtis Harrington, the oldest boys, they were trying to make it in Washington, D.C.  They wanted to move up south, and [Washington] D.C., that's where they made the money, so they figured that that's where you can earn the most money.  And that was a perception and a logic that a lot of the people followed to immigrate to Washington.
Speaker 1: Right.  The road to success.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But anyway, they saw this ad in the paper about this job for a shoeshine boy, and they were living in the southwest--on the southeast.  And so they walked up to the third alphabet on Georgia Avenue and 7th Street from where they lived to answer the ad about a shoeshine boy in a barbershop.  I believe it was two of them.  And when they walked in, there was a--and this was in a white neighborhood at the time; we're now talking about 1931, '32 [1932], you know, '33 [1933].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And when they walked in, they applied for the job, and they were told "Niggers, are y'all crazy?" (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And they were treated with total disrespect and loathing by the guy who owned the barbershop.  And there were other men in the shop waiting for--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they starting laughing at them.  And then they had to grab my Uncle Curtis, 'cause he was gonna punch the man in his mouth for something, anyway.  And James, my Uncle Pick grabbed him and they said, "Look, man," he says, "I want to punch him, too," he said, "But we can't win this one."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He wasn't talking about the physical thing, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They would have you locked up and probably beaten.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Anyway, so they got out of there.
Speaker 1: The culture was going to whip them.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  So they got out of there.  And they walked back.  And when they went up there, there was not a--it was in the winter, you know; it wasn't in the summer in the--you know.  It was--but that kind of told the story, not only of the [Great] Depression, but of segregation--
Speaker 1: In the nation's capital.
Speaker 2: --in the nation's capital (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It was a southern town.  It certainly was.  And remained so up until the '60s [1960s], up until my time.  But, they both later found work.  And my uncle later found work at the--as a porter and the telephone company [Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company; Verizon Washington, D.C. Inc., Washington, D.C.] later on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They endured that kind of--as all the generation did--that kind of discrimination. Not only--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Not only in D.C. and the South, but also when they moved up south to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: They found out that the discrimination still existed.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  It was still the same.  You know, I mean, they went to segregated schools, and so did I.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The primary school I went to in Philadelphia was segregated.  I mean, it was an all-black family and no white students in there, although we lived in a neighborhood with white families in the same block.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But they went to another public school that was all white.
Speaker 1: I went through the same experience.
Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 1: Going back to your mother [Hura Harrington Moore] now, she mainly (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother was a gentle woman who stayed home and raised her kids, although she worked when--from time to time when it need to be.  My father [Jerry Acel Moore]--
Speaker 1: Now, she--are we talking about back in North Carolina or Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: No, no, in Philadelphia when she became an adult.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's go back to North Carolina (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because she was working at a restaurant--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with another aunt.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  For another aunt.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And do you know what motivated her to leave North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Well, the aunt who she was staying with--but, I mean, during the period of--there was a period of significant migration in the '20s [1920s], which--from blacks moving from the South up north--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --for better opportunities.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Better jobs and less discrimination.  And it was a different kind of discrimination up there.  It wasn't absent, but--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --certainly they had more opportunities for work.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so they moved some time in the '20s [1920s] during that big period of migration [Great Migration] of southern blacks to the North.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Did that aunt who she was working with in the restaurant move with her?
Speaker 2: She moved too.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Okay.  Do you remember the year she came to Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: It had to been before 1930.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Good enough.
Speaker 2: In the '20s [1920s].
Speaker 1: All right.

My mother moved to South Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] with her uncle [Bruce Gordan] and aunt and then--I don't know how they met, but they met, and I guess she must have went to a school in South Philadelphia, 'cause she must have briefly must have went to the same school in South Philadelphia.  But--and--
Speaker 1: If you can't remember--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, I can't remember it.
Speaker 1: --you know, we'll fill in a lot of it.  They--do you have an idea about a date when they got married?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  The date would have been 1935 [sic. 1932], I guess.

Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Thirty-four [1934], yes.  So they got married, I guess, maybe in '32 [1932].  I'm pretty sure that's correct, '32 [1932].

Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 296057
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you're in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  Okay.  Now, let's go into some of your earliest memories of you as a young child.

Speaker 1: You don't remember the address?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1927 Manton Street.  1927 Manton Street.
Speaker 1: M-A-N (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) M-A-N-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I have a very good memory of my father [Jerry Acel Moore] taking my brother [Michael Moore] and I and lifting us up, my mother [Hura Harrington Moore], to see President Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Who, just before he died, came to visit Philadelphia.  And the motorcade went--not (gestures)--in the neighborhood where we lived, and I had to (unclear), "The president is here." (Gestures)  My father--you know, that's what--I have that memory of that and being (gestures)--see this car going by with the open car, and my father, I'm on his shoulders.  And I would have been about, like, five years old when this was--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: My mother had my brother, my father had me.  And then, you know, they'd take turns (unclear).  I have memories of--
Speaker 1: You would have actually been around two, I think.
Speaker 2: In '45 [1945]?  No.  I was born in 1940.
Speaker 1: Oh, '40 [1940].  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Roosevelt, I was thinking--he was reelected in '42 [1942], and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it was just before he died.  He--we saw him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He came--I don't know what the visit was--. But he came to Philadelphia.  Philadelphia was a major industry. They produced a lot of the goods for war [World War II, WWII] and everything, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so, he came here.  And the Democratic congressman from Philadelphia invited him, by the name of Barrett, Bill Barrett [William A. Barrett].  We lived in that district, so Philadelphia was--
Speaker 1: He came through there.
Speaker 2: It was then--was a Republican; locally, it was still a Republican town.  But the South Philadelphia and this congressman, you know, it was very important for Roosevelt.  So he came and to visit this city.  And my father, I had that very vivid memory of that.
Story_ID: 296058
Speaker 1: The only other thing that I remember from the war [World War II, WWII] was the air raid sirens and the blackouts at night, which were frightening to, to little boys, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And the air raid warden knocking on the door, you know.  I have very vivid memories of that.  And also, looking at headlines and hearing my parents [Jerry Acel Moore and Hura Harrington Moore] and my grandmother [Agnes Moses Moore], who lived with us, my father's mother, lived with us, 'cause she was divorced from my grandfather [Jerry A. Moore] at that point, and hearing them talking about the war.  And they read--they all read, and they read a lot.  They read papers and there were times during the day in which the people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --father would come home and it was meeting time.  And you could hear the rustling of newspapers, and read every evening.  I have very vivid memories of that.  I have very vivid memories of our heating.  We had a coal burning furnace and stove.  And my father would--when they would shovel coal in the furnace and stoke the ashes--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, on trash day he would take the ashes out of the bottom of the stove and put them out for the city to pick up the ashes--
Speaker 2: Ashes.  Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: And, you know, and they were days before air conditioning.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And we had a refrigerator, although most of the people in my--had iceboxes.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).  And you had a refrigerator.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  My father--
Speaker 2: So you were living in the lap of luxury (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) My father was a skilled tradesman.  He was an electrician, a marine electrician.  And because of Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] and maybe I later found because of--A. Philip Randolph, who was going to have a demonstration during the war about discrimination. (Unclear) Roosevelt, you know.  And anybody who could pass the civil service exam for any position were hired regardless of your race.  And my father, who had trained as an electrician in the public school and had gotten an apprenticeship with a master black electrician, he passed the test.  And so he was a man with three kids who was--1941 when the war started, I guess he was in his thirties, you know.  And he got a job at the naval shipyard [Philadelphia Naval Shipyard] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  They built ships and he wired some of the great battleships of the country, you know (unclear)--
Speaker 2: And Philadelphia was a city just beginning to develop a conscious--a racial conscious.
Speaker 1: Well, no.  It wasn't.  I mean, I'm saying that the federal government (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right.
Speaker 1: --passed--I mean, Roosevelt by executive order said that, if you pass the test, whether you lived in Virginia or in Newport News [Virginia], if you pass the electrician's test, you could, during that war, you worked as an electrician.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You were black or white.  That was a federal policy.
Speaker 2: Fair Employment Practices [Fair Employment Practice Committee].
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But it was--and that was initiated because of--he felt Randolph was going to have a demonstration.  The first walk on Washington [D.C.] had occurred during the war.  And for him--and he agreed not to do it then, because they were going to hire black men and women.  You know, my grandmother worked as a seamstress in the [U.S.] Army quartermaster depot during the war.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And sewing, making uniforms.  But that was because of the policy of--and, of course, it was a need for--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --women and for being workers.  But blacks would have been discriminated against in there.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Manpower needs overrode--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And I mean, plus, that executive order that allowed people, if you passed the exam, you could work--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --regardless of race.
Story_ID: 296059
Speaker 1: Now, your uncle Robert [Harrington], I think, was a--Curtis [Harrington] was, during World War II [WWII], in--a part of the Red Ball Express--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and highly decorated.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And Alfred [Harrington] served in the [U.S.] Army, the youngest one.  He was drafted, but he was never sent overseas.  But he was in, I think, stationed in Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--not Robert, but Curtis.  Curtis and Alfred went to the service, and Curtis was the one who was the decorated soldier.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And Alfred was overseas--I mean (pause)--you know, he stayed in Florida.  He stayed in the states during the war.
Speaker 1: Curtis did, but Rob--
Speaker 2: No, no.  Curtis--Robert didn't go in--Robert and James [Pickett Harrington] were not--didn't serve.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Curtis and Alfred were the ones who served.
Speaker 1: All right.  But--
Speaker 2: Curtis was the decorated one, and Alfred was the one who was assigned in the states.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, on my father's [Jerry Acel Moore] side, my father's uncle was in the Army.  And my father's uncle, Cebron; Cebron Moore from Atlanta [Georgia].  Cebron, C--and I think it's, C-E--
Speaker 1: S-E-A--or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) S--or C-E-B-R-O-N.  Cebron Moore--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was in the Army.
Speaker 1: Let's go back to Curtis for a hot minute.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And did Uncle Curtis ever relate any stories of what it was like--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  He did.  I mean, you know, he--now, he was one of my favorite uncles.  I mean, he would--he was a very--he was--I call him a man's man.  I mean, he was a--dressed well, and he spoke well, he--
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of his stories--
Speaker 2: About the war?
Speaker 1: --that he--about--that he may have related to you about the war?
Speaker 2: Well, he--yeah.  I mean, he--I mean, he said that--he talked about--he said, "I hope this never happens to you."  He said the smell of death has never left him.  The stench of that and the bodies being stacked on the roadside, you know.  You driving by them, you know what I mean.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And the bombs going off, and he said it was hell.  That's what he told me.  He said, "War is hell and I've seen hell.  I've been through hell, and hell has a smell."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he told me that.  And when I joined the Army, I enjoyed the Army.  He was the one who took me to the place where I was going to be shipped off from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and talked to me at length.  He said, "I want you to remember this.  Being in the Army is not a democracy, so you got to take orders and you got to be tough, and you got to be a man and stand up to that."  And, I mean, he was the guy that gave me advice about the service.  Not only did that--I wasn't the only nephew.  He had a whole lot of--all of his nephews.  We have a--I have a history of both sides of the family serving in the [U.S.] military.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My--on my mom--
Speaker 1: We'll get pictures of those.
Story_ID: 296060
Speaker 1: Let me ask you, though, but here we are at the end of '45 [1945], Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] is dead, your uncles are returning--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --from the war [World War II, WWII].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're still pretty much of a young person.  You're--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I'm a kid.  So, yeah.
Speaker 1: --really--you're a kid.  Elementary school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Any outstanding stories from growing up as a six, seven year old?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  I mean, I get--you know, I wasn't--my father [Jerry Acel Moore] bought my brother [Michael Moore] and I, when we were seven, instruments, a trumpet and a trombone.  And, you know, my brother liked the trombone, and I went to the trumpet--he liked it a slide.  I wanted it too, but I took the trumpet because it also reminded me of a bugle.  There was an American Legion post nearby, and they had the drum and bugle corps, you know.  Well, I had a trumpet, you know.  And so I--and we--you know, and I went to--I lived in a community in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in which was the oldest community in the city.  I mean, South Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] is nearest to the city, it's where black--our black ancestors, during the 18th century had settled, in South Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Richard Allen and the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church, and Mother Church [Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] is within walking distance, you know, from my uncle and aunt, they lived at 7th [Street] and Lombard [Street], and 6th [Street] and Lombard [Street].  And I was a boy, I went to probably one of the oldest Baptist churches in America.  It's the First African Baptist Church of Pennsylvania [First African Baptist Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], but it was founded no more than fifteen years after Mother Bethel.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And a lot of history about that the--they were buried in gravesites that were moved because of the expressway or something.  It was very historical.  It was founded after they were digging up the burials of the old church, of the old Mother Baptist Church, so that a lot of the town (unclear) of black elite lived in the neighborhood that I lived in.  And, you know, lawyers and doctors, and educational school teachers.  And because we were segregated, I mean, if you were a laborer or a working class or if you--you also lived in that same neighborhood.  So there were role models and people--I mean, that was segregation, both in the South and North kept communities together that way.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I certainly experienced that.  There were men who dug ditches living, you know, within a block or two of people who had doctorate degrees.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And who were physicians and who were dentists and lawyers.
Story_ID: 296061
Speaker 1: Now, you were going to tell us a little bit more about your uncles and going out to Coney Island [New York, New York] and so forth.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My family was close to me in this regard.  My mother's [Hura Harrington Moore] family was very close to me.  I knew all of her siblings, her aunt--I mean her sister [Bruce Harrington] and my uncles--brother.  And on my father's [Jerry Acel Moore] side, he had a sister, Elizabeth Moore, and she came to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] too and lived there.  So we were close in that regard.  And I--and they had influence in my life.  I mean, the men, you know, my uncle, my mother's brothers certainly influenced me; my grandfather [Jerry A. Moore], he was a very sophisticated, quiet man who was a bookkeeper and had a bookkeeper's persona and attitude.  You know what I mean?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he was very distinguished.  He was always well dressed and well kept, and that was an influence.
Speaker 1: Tell us--let's go through each one.  Now, how--what kind of influence?  How would you describe it?
Speaker 2: Oh, with my uncles, I mean, how to be a man.  I mean, you know, that's significant, of course.  And my father too.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But, I mean, but you had other people who would reinforce that--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, being a man, being responsible for your family, earning an income, and trying to get an education.  My [paternal] grandmother [Agnes Moses Moore] would read to us.  I mean, she went to school, college, when she was in Atlanta [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and certainly her sisters did; so that was something that influenced me.  I knew the stories of Booker T. Washington and Frederick Douglass.  They would talk about things like that.  They would talk about the politics of the day.  I knew about the political movements of the time, and discussions during the dinner table between my father and my mother, and also his mother.  And they would talk about those issues.  I knew about the major newsmakers of the time.  I mean, the Democratic [National] Convention was held in Philadelphia when Harry Truman [President Harry S. Truman] was president and when--and I remember emphatically when Hubert Humphrey gave that speech in the 1948 Democratic Convention.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He gave the first civil rights speech.  My father talked about that, and we heard it on the radio.  So that those were certainly--and how that related to the black community.  And so, I was aware of those things.  I was also aware of the history of the South and what happened, and the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK].  And my father told me when I was a little boy, he said, "Never allow any white man to call you a boy when you become a man."  And I remember him emphatically--some insurance man came to me--when people buy those insurance policies?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And you come every week, and you--
Speaker 1: Pay pennies.
Speaker 2: Pay pennies and nickels, and some guy called him a boy, and he said, "You get out of here."  He said, "I'm not a boy and don't you ever," he said, "You can't ever come back to my house."  He said, "My name--I'm Mr. Moore to you."  And I will never forget that.  And you get angry.
Speaker 1: So they were role models for you standing up as a man--
Speaker 2: Oh, certainly.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --In a segregated system.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Yes.  Yes, they were.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And reading some things--and we read all of them.  I mean, I would--when I was a boy, I would read two daily major or white newspapers every day, plus I would read the Baltimore [Baltimore Afro-American; Afro-American Newspapers]--
Speaker 1: Afro.
Speaker 2: Afro-American and also The Philadelphia Tribune and we'd also get--we had another black newsweekly in Philadelphia, the Independent [The Philadelphia Independent].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Independent Tribune [sic. The Philadelphia Independent].  And the Pittsburgh--we'd get the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier] every week, and read and read the issues about the--about history and things.  So, I mean, I was very familiar with all of those things and kept abreast, and was it was affecting, you know, the work I did in school, in elementary and in junior high school.  I--my father was very much a political junkie and one who--everybody voted in my family, and they would talk about not being able to vote if they were still in the South or even in Atlanta [Georgia] or in North Carolina, and how important that was.
Speaker 1: It seems to run true through all of these very successful journalists that we've interviewed.  There was a lot of reading culture in the home--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and in their neighborhood and so forth.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We read--you know, and we'd get, you know, Ebony and Jet.  And the other one before Jet, it was called--that was done by the Johnson publication [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois].  What was it called, the Negro something?  Who was that?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  The Negro Digest [Black World].
Speaker 2: Digest.  We'd get that.  And, of course, I read comic books, too.  I read a lot of things.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 296062
Speaker 1: And when I was born, radio was the dominant medium, and I was fourteen before we got our first television.  And I was eight when we got our first telephone.  Of course, I remember when we would get a phone call from somebody, usually it be something negative or bad, somebody died down South or somebody was come to visit you.  Somebody, a boy or somebody from the neighborhood would come from the drugstore to our house and say, "You got a telephone call there," you know.  My father [Jerry Acel Moore] would give the guy a little tip to do that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And people would do that.  We used walk about a half a block away to the drugstore to use the pay telephone.  And whenever we--my father used the telephone, and he would, you know, put a nickel in it.  And the other way we communicated from people in the South, it was through Western Union.  The guy would come on a bicycle and deliver a Western Union message from somebody in the South, and not always bring somebody was dying or died, but also just to communicate, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But saying, "We're coming to visit you.  Is that all right?"  Or something like that, and you would send them nothing back, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So that was very much a factor in--.  I was born with just prior to the baby, the first baby boomer generation; just prior to that.  And so, I think they called us Silent Generation.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Right.
Speaker 1: That's what that generation I was born in.  And I was on the tail end of that.
Story_ID: 296063
Speaker 1: There was also something else influencing the culture in your neighborhood [South Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and that was influential, very talented people who were becoming nationally recognized that had no other place to live.  And so all--everybody lived in that same neighborhood, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I mean--
Speaker 1: You had famous people living in your neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Marian Anderson.  In my elementary school, the one photograph that I never--always remember was that of Marian Anderson when she was a really young woman, probably still a girl.  And she--and the house she lived in was, like, maybe five blocks or six blocks from where I--the house I lived in--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --at the most.  And only two blocks from--she was right around the corner from my aunt.  And she went to--
Speaker 1: You remember seeing her?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I remember seeing her.  I remember seeing--and Union Baptist Church [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was the church that she grew up in, and which was down the street from where my aunt lived.  And, her uncle--Marian Anderson's uncle was probably the most infamous policeman in this city.  And the police department was segregated then, too.  You had to--he had a black squad called the Anderson Squad.  He was a nice guy, Dick Anderson.
Speaker 1: Dick Anderson.
Speaker 2: Who was Marian's big uncle, who was a tough cop, boy.  And so I had--you know, so we had all those connections in terms of people--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and a lot--some of the finest musicians.  I remember the Heath Brothers, they lived right across--the next block from me.  Percy [Heath] and Albert ["Tootie" Heath] and Heath--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and--and there was jazz greats, who played with all the great jazz musicians.  So I had an influence of--from the great musicians from those guys, I mean.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And some of my contemporaries we had became professional musicians.  Charlie Earland [Charles Earland], who was an organist, who died prematurely.  He and I the same age.  He died about eight or nine years ago.  But there were many, many fine musicians in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and I was able to--and I saw Lee Morgan and Miles Davis play in the same concert--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and they dueled each other.  And my--
Speaker 1: You were there to witness it?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I was there watching, because I was in a combo myself as a high schooler [at Overbrook High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], you know, in the grant--the combo that I played in, we went to see this at a place called Town Hall [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We saw--and I always often said that, you know, Lee Morgan, who didn't play with music, he played--he was like, you know, you could hear him better (unclear), but everybody thought he was winning until Miles took the muter off (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: He said, "Lee Morgan, I muted him.  He shouldn't have done it."  (Unclear).  But then when Miles took the muter off, he blew him away, you know.  But we guys were--we just would laugh about that.
Story_ID: 296064
Speaker 1: Now, what was it like growing up with a twin brother, your brother Michael [Moore]?
Speaker 2: Michael and I were--we dressed alike.  My mother [Hura Harrington Moore] kept--until we reached puberty, we were dressed alike and everything, you know.  And then, what happened was that, I--maybe I got that, I shot--I got taller than him.  And so when we were twelve--thirteen, then I was--I became taller than my brother, you know what I mean.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so, and we didn't want to dress alike anymore anyway, so that was good, you know.  My brother and I, we wanted to be individuals, you know.  But we both--he played trumpet and I played trombone.  We had our middle school, we played today.  We'd have recitals, both of us.  I really loved music and really was--so I pursued music until I was--until I left high school [Overbrook High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  I mean, and I played professionally, and I was an all-state musician in both--in elementary and junior high and senior high school, and we played any kind of music, played in marching bands and parades all over the city, and kind of gave me the cultural exposure and diversity that has had an impact on my life.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I think that it instilled in me to be self confident.  If you know you practiced at what you do, and you play, and so that has enabled me to perform and act out as a journalist because of that experience.  And so, that--no, I did not become a professional musician.  I chose not to, but I had a interest, and that enabled me to be confident in myself and believe in myself in what I was going to do.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And what I pursued.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  The--now, you're growing up, you and your brother, and all of a sudden you're shooting ahead.  What year are we in now?  We (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Talking about '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fifty-two [1952]--'53 [1953].  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: It was in junior high school.
Story_ID: 296065
Speaker 1: You remember anything about any particular teachers, any teachers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I do.  Yeah.  There were these--
Speaker 1: --that you--
Speaker 2: --Mr. Adger, in elementary school.  And he's not too--you know, he lives in the same neighborhood, now.  He had--
Speaker 1: Spell Adger.
Speaker 2: A-D-G-E-R.  Adger--was a significant influence on me and encouraged me to--and another guy by the name of Jones [ph.], and two male teachers who--you know, I was in--I guess I had a high I.Q. and I was in the special classes in elementary school.  And in junior high school, there was a white female teacher.  The first time I ever had a white teacher.  She was in music.  She led the orchestra and (cough) I auditioned for the orchestra, and I played a piece that--and I was confused about, 'cause I--and when I played it, she began to cry.  I thought I had displeased her 'cause tears were coming out of her eye, you know what I mean.  So, but she--I later found out that she was a--she loved the song and it was one of her favorite ones that I hit the high C or the C and it's a song that has two names, a melody that everybody's familiar with.  It's an English name, but it's called 'Danny Boy.'  But there's another name to that song, I mean, and I'll think of that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there is a note for a trumpet player when (singing), "Dah, dah, dah, dee."  You know, it's--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, it's so--he had to hit it and I hit it without faltering in the--so I said, I thought I had flunked the test (laughter).
Speaker 1: You were not only a trumpet player, you were fairly talented.
Speaker 2: Oh, fairly talented.  But not--I mean, I knew the guys who had a natural--and I had some natural talent, but I mean, he had these professional, these guys who were later great professionals, go around me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was intimidated by that, you know what I mean.  And some the other guys would hear me, they'd laugh, but they would try to encourage me, too.  But--and I had guys who---there was another trumpet player on my block who became a professional, and Albert ["Tootie"] Heath, the drummer, Tootie.  I mean, they were older than me, but--
Speaker 1: Became well known?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Nationally known?
Speaker 2: Nationally and internationally known.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know the Heath Brothers?
Speaker 1: Oh, right.  Right.
Speaker 2: MJQ [Modern Jazz Quartet], and all the others--those guys all lived in my neighborhood [South Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: They're older than me.  But they--and--
Speaker 1: Did you perform with them sometimes?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I never did that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was just--nah, I mean, I--you know, I mean, was able to make the all-city orchestra when I was in junior high school and in high school [Overbrook High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And I was first chair in two instruments, the trumpet and French horn.  And I--the French horn was a very difficult instrument.  And I--that satisfied me.  I knew that if I really wanted to be a professional, at least in order to study music, I would have to study and practice even more than I did.  I had a good year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, but it served the purpose for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, the fact that I could be the first chair and I could get the all-city, that gave me confidence to do other things, too.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: You know that--you know.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: And--so it--and if you look at my yearbook in high school, and the prediction for the future me that I would be in Birdland [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I mean, me and four other guys who were musicians, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That was the prediction, that--
Speaker 1: So they recognized there was a lot of talent?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  A lot of people who still haven't seen me since--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and they want to know if I still--, "Are you still playing that trumpet?"
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Even today I run into somebody.
Story_ID: 296066
Speaker 1: Now, you're in high school, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  And I ran track, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In junior high.  Junior high and high school, I--
Speaker 1: So you were athletic, running track?
Speaker 2: Somewhat, yeah.  And I played baseball.  I played sandlot ball.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I tried to play basketball.  I wasn't good at it.  When I was in the [U.S.] Army, I played more basketball I did when I was--I played in the church league in the YW--YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] league for the church that I went to.  And I felt that I wasn't good enough to get on the junior high school team.  And the high school team, I didn't even--when I was in high school, my contemporaries were Wali Jones, Wayne Hightower, Ralph Hayward (laughter), all of whom made the NBA [National Basketball Association].
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I went to the same high school that Wilt [Chamberlain] went to, although he wasn't--he was gone when I got there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I didn't meet him while I was there.  And so, all the great athletes--
Speaker 1: Went to--
Speaker 2: --basketball--went to--
Speaker 1: What high school?
Speaker 2: Overbrook High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Overbrook High.
Speaker 2: And when I later traveled, when I was in the Army, whenever people, white or black, say, "You're from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]," they would either mention Wilt Chamberlin or they would mention a seafood restaurant in Philadelphia that still exists, Bookbinder's [Old Original Bookbinder's, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Bookbinder's.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Bookbinder's.  "You ever been to Bookbinder's?"  And I had one guy who was, "I betcha you gonna tell me you went to the same high school that Wilt Chamberlin did," you know, 'cause a lot of people who were from Philadelphia to say that, they didn't.  I did.  I mean--
Speaker 1: Right.  You were one of the real ones.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Any particular teachers there at Overbrook that particularly influenced you, and did you start leaning toward wanting to become a journalist in high school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, that's inaccurate.  No.  I ain't never--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --never thought of journalism--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as a career pursuit, until I--
Speaker 1: What did you think of as a career pursuit?
Speaker 2: Well, I thought about being a musician.  I wanted to be a lawyer, I thought.  I thought I was going to college.  I didn't go to college.  I didn't take a pre-college--courses.  I did take--I took business courses, and I was steered the wrong way.  I should have been, 'cause I was in the excelled program in junior high school.  I mean, I was in the academic program--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and I was kind of talked out of it by a counselor at Overbrook you know, and most of--
Speaker 1: And that's happened an awful lot.  Can you remember any particular experience where a guidance counselor was--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  When I first got there, I mean, they said, "Oh, you're a musician, you're all-city, and that's wonderful."  And I said, "Well, I want to take a look at that thing, I want to go to--."  "Well, you know, you only got a C in algebra the last time.  And you may not want to do that."  And I said, "What did you say to me?"  And I said, "Well, my I.Q. was,"--I done forgot.  I knew it at the time.  I knew it was like in the 120.  I don't know what it was.  I mean, it was high.  I mean, I don't know exactly what the number was, but I knew it was being--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I had nothing to do with the I.Q.  It clearly has to do with you having shown that, you know, that you're disciplined enough to do this.  That's what was said to me.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: And I should have--to hell with you, you know, man.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I didn't even tell my mother [Hura Harrington Moore] or father [Jerry Acel Moore].  They wanted me to do that.
Speaker 1: Were these principally white guidance counselors that--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --'cause Overbrook, I know, was integrated, but I didn't know what the ratio--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  It was the most highly academic school in the city.  It was integrated.  It mainly--it was a major--it was--a lot of the Jewish community went there.  They were major and they still lived in the city.  They lived in that community.  And the school, when I went there, was about maybe thirty percent black and it was seventy percent white.  And, by the way, Wilt Chamberlain was an excellent student.  He was an academic--
Speaker 1: And something we never hear.
Speaker 2: --an A student who scored--he had the highest--he was the first and only black to get the--it was called the Sigma-something award, given to the student who has the highest average over the three years they were in the high school.  And he had that.  He was brilliant.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: He was a great athlete, and a phenomenal athlete, but he was also well read, and he studied and had a discipline--I mean, he was bright.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, that was--you know, you never hear that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But he clearly was, you know.
Speaker 1: I'm glad you're bringing it out.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 296067
Speaker 1: There comes the time now you're about to graduate.  You and Michael [Moore] are about to graduate.
Speaker 2: My brother goes to a vocational school.  He had more of an inclination to want to work with his hands, and my father [Jerry Acel Moore] was an electrician.  And my brother, you know, goes--when he finishes school he goes to a junior college and gets an associate's degree in electronics and everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Becomes an electronics wiz and technician.  And I joined the [U.S.] Army a year after playing--I was a professional musician for a year and then I joined the service.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You--so when you graduated from high school [Overbrook High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], you found work--
Speaker 2: I was still--
Speaker 1: --as a professional?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  Not a lot of work, but I worked with this--I--and that was when I earned money.  I did that.  I mean, I was with this combo, and we'd get these jobs.  And we still had a lot of--this was before the drug culture and this stuff, you know, so you had drugs.  I mean, it was not a major factor in the (unclear) plan.  I was the youngest member of the group.  The guys were all grown men, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I was seventeen, eighteen and--when I played with these guys.  And we would play on weekends in different clubs and bars around the city.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I know I wasn't gonna make a living--I was living with my parents.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So I wasn't going to be able to get an apartment on my own based on my musicianship.  So I joined the Army because, like I--you know, I had some other options.  I could have worked a lot of jobs then, but I wanted to go to the Army and I wanted to travel, and I wanted to be tough, you know, I was a male.  My uncles [Curtis Harrington and Alfred Harrington] and everything had served in the service, both sides of the family.  And I had cousins who were in the [U.S.] Navy.  And my other---you know, and I had two cousins who were in the Korean War, and they had came out, so they--you know, so I had this military was--and my uncle Curt [Curtis Harrington] would always talk to me about the Army.
Speaker 1: Hold it (background noise).  (Pause).
Speaker 2: You know, when I got the--you know, the thing about going to college from the service, so I went in.  And I, you know, I mean I scored very well on the tests to get in, and became an Army medic.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you go down to Fort Sam Houston [San Antonio, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Sam Houston, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then we were stationed in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What year are we in now?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-nine [1959].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I become regular Army, I joined.  Fort Jackson [South Carolina], then go to Fort Sam, and then get sent to Alaska for two years and while I'm up there, did my--and it's a two-year enlistment.  You know, my enlistment gets extended a year because of that Berlin Crisis, when that--when Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was in, and I don't serve the extension, but I got--I had a four-year (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: --rather than three years.  So, and when I leave Alaska, I get sent to Fort Lesley J. McNair in Washington, D.C., which was just a beautiful assignment, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: (Cough) And during that time, I mean, I became well read and studied.  And I took courses.  I took the toughest college English preparatory courses the Army gave and passed it.  And when I passed it, the company commander said that many of the officers flunked this test.  Said, "You passed it."  Said, "You really like the language and you can write."  And that's what he said, so I'm saying that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They announced that to the whole company that I had passed one of the toughest English courses that was given and--but I read a lot.  I took modern American literature course, and I read all of the--and I had read before on my own, but I mean, you know, I, you know, read, you know, the standard college literature that you get with major literature arts.  And I read all the books, the great books, including 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X' [Malcolm X and Alex Haley], and some of the black books that were in--and I was with men who were into reading, you know and the medical group.  And, you know, you had a lot of guys who were--even though they were enlisted, they were pharmacists and, you know, dentists, who were going to go to medical school when they got out.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And we worked with the physicians.  And so, it was a very intellectually stimulating atmosphere I had, and physically stimulating, too, because I was in Alaska and I learned how to ski cross country, and I played on the basketball team for my unit.  I boxed a guy from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] who was--by the name of Dominic Pentamale [ph.]. He was calling himself my Italian brother.  But he had been a professional boxer, man.  He was--and he showed me some moves and punched me out--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --but I used to work out on the heavy bag and stuff.
Story_ID: 296068
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did a lot of physical things when I was in, too.  But I also studied the whole time I was in, read.  Did a lot of self-reading.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Were these mail order courses or college mail order courses?
Speaker 1: Well, one of--two of them were.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, yeah.  And then I was--I did some on my own, just started reading.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And read everything.  Books.  I mean, I read everything about religion, and I read the Karl Marx doctrine.  I read about Buddhism.  I read, you know, Taoism.  I mean, anything that came to mind, you know, and about Christianity and about what the differences is between Episcopalian and the Catholic.  I mean, I would go to the libraries a lot of time.  You know, actually--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --you have a lot of time to do that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's true.
Speaker 1: And so, I was both intellectually and physically at my peak during that time.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: So after doing all of this, you come up to a point where you're going to be discharged or--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And I thought about enlisting.  And--
Speaker 2: What was your rank at that time?
Speaker 1: I was only a corporal, but they were going to make me a buck sergeant if I reenlisted.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They were going to make me right away, and I was an E4, you know, a specialist.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they were going to make me a sergeant.  And I decided no, I want to come out and maybe get a job and work my way to the school and try to shoot for the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944].  Now, I didn't--and I had an interest in art, too.  'Cause when I was in junior high school and--I was in special art, in that I had, you know, I was learning how to draw and paint.  But it conflicted with my track and music, and art confidence--.  Some days I'm supposed to be in special art after the, you know, you're in there after school.  I had to--I'd be practicing for track meet.  And another time, the orchestra would be practicing.  So the art teacher said, "Listen, you gonna have to make up your mind.  You either going to do music and track, but you can't do--or art and track or art--you can't do art, music and track."

And so I gave up the pursuit of art at that point.

A night job and I was going to enroll in school--and so, at the Inquirer in the newsroom.  And within three months after being in that situation, I decided this is what I was meant to do, and I wanted to do that.
