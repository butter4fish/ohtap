Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask. They are sort of a warm up. And they only require a short answer. The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Favorite food, I would say ribeye at Ruth's Chris, steak [Ruth's Chris Steak House] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.

Speaker 2: "I was young, but now I'm old, and I've never seen the righteous forsaken or a seed begging for bread" [Psalm 37:25].
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, did you start to say something else after golf? I'm, I might have cut you off--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, no, that's good.
Speaker 1: Okay. You said Nassau for golf, and then I, I'm afraid I might have cut you but, all right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: No, no, no, that's good enough.
Story_ID: 673749
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask you about your family history. I'm going to ask you about your mother's side of the family, and your father's [Benjamin Spencer] side, but we'll start with your mother's side. Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name, Hannah Jane Spencer [Hannah Ellerbe Spencer], H-A-N-N-A-H, J-A-N-E, S-P-E-N-C-E-R.
Speaker 1: All right. And what was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Ellerbe, E-L-L-E-R-B-E.
Speaker 1: All right. And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born March 22, 1917 and in Florence County, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: All right. Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family? How far back can you trace them, and were they always in South Carolina as far as you know or--
Speaker 2: I can't go back very far. My, my grandmother, her name was Alease, A-L-E-A-S-E, Brown [Alease Brown Ellerbe] was her maiden name, and then Ellerbe. And they, as far as I know, they were always from South Carolina. She had one brother that I knew, my uncle Robert [ph.], who lived to be ninety something years old. But beyond that, my grandmother used to talk about, a little about her mother, but I have a very vague recollection of, of that.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, is there, are there any stories about that side of the family--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Not that I'm aware of. They're all, they were farmers, my grandmother. And I, the best I can understand, her parents were farmers as well, settled in the same area. It's a place called Savannah Grove [South Carolina]. It's a little bit outside of the city, if you want to call it that, of Florence, South Carolina, but it's in Florence County.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Is Florence near to Savannah [Georgia] or Charleston [South Carolina] or--
Speaker 2: No, no. Florence is like, two hours and some change, away from Charleston. And, of course, Savannah is a little bit, maybe twenty-five miles down the road from Charleston, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, is it more than Columbia [South Carolina] and--
Speaker 2: It's an hour and a half from Columbia.
Speaker 1: Going--
Speaker 2: You'd be going west on I-20 [Interstate 20], if you go from Florence to Columbia, and then stay on that same road, you'd get to Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay. So, more the interior of South Carolina and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's, it's about fifty minutes from Myrtle Beach [South Carolina], just near the coast.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, okay. So, now did your mother have a chance to finish school or--
Speaker 2: Well, my mother had eleven grades of school. The high school [Brockington High School, Timmonsville, South Carolina] that she went to terminated at eleven grades, so she graduated from high school, but it was only eleven, eleven grades.
Speaker 1: This is common. Do you have a suspicion as to why that's true--the black high schools only go to eleven grades?
Speaker 2: I, I don't know what that was about. She talked over the years about her graduation. She did very well in high school. My, my--both my parents, extremely bright people--native intelligence. And my mother, in her community, she was the one where people brought problems with social security and taxes, 'cause she could read, and was very able in, in that area. So, it was only eleven grades, but she got a lot out of those eleven grades.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've always suspected that, that's a reason for public school, blacks, public school in the South only going to eleven grades, you know, since the superintendent was a white, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --school district.
Speaker 2: There must have been some reason because they were, the other schools are, had twelve grades. I, I don't know, but, as I said, my mother managed to get a pretty decent education out of those eleven grades.
Speaker 1: So, did she, what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: A number of things--she was a cook, she worked as a domestic. She worked in a factory. And, for as long I could remember, she sold cosmetics on the side. I, I mean, again, she was gifted at that. She sold, at one time, Lucky Heart Cosmetics. And, and she would sell these things on a consignment, and she would go in the neighborhoods that other people wouldn't go into, you know. So, she'd get--delivered the cosmetics, and then when payday came, she'd go by and collect, and we got involved in that, you know. Later, when I got able to drive, I would go around and, again, a salesperson, hustler, she really (laughter) kept it going.
Story_ID: 673750
Speaker 1: All right. Let me go to your father's side. Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: It's Benjamin [Benjamin Spencer], B-E-N-J-A-M-I-N, no middle initial, Spencer, S-P-E-N-C-E-R.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born May 15, 20--uh (shakes head), 1915.
Speaker 1: Okay. In the same area or--
Speaker 2: He was born in Darlington, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay. Is that close by?
Speaker 2: That's ten miles from Florence [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. Now, what can you tell us about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Again, I can't go very far past my, my grandparents. My father's father's name was Levi Spencer. And, again, he was a farmer, deacon in the church, where my father subsequently became a deacon, and much beloved by his grand--I have just a tremendous memory, fond memories of my father's father. He was an awesome grandfather. And he, his wife, her name was Essie James Spencer [Essie Spencer]. And she, she died when I was much younger, so I don't have a very much of a recollection of her, except from what I've heard. And her family, the James family, is also related to my mother's [Hannah Ellerbe Spencer] family, the Ellerbe family. So I, when I go to the--they call it the Brown-James reunion, I have cousins from both sides of my family attending that, that reunion.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now, your father became a mechanic, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And did, so did he, he finished eleven grades as well--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Oh, he didn't?
Speaker 2: My father had five grades of formal education--just five. He got this certificate allowing him to be a master mechanic. I used to see this in my house. He had it--I was very proud of it. While he was in the [U.S.] military, yeah, he served in the military, rose to the rank of master sergeant, and but he learned his skill.
Story_ID: 673751
Speaker 1: So, he served in World War--
Speaker 2: World War II [WWII].
Speaker 1: --World War II, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: He would have been an older man in World War II, I guess, born in 19--well--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, not really.
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, the, not, yeah, that's about the right age, yeah, 1915. So, when did he serve overseas?
Speaker 2: He served overseas in the Rhineland over in, what is, I guess, now Germany, but, yeah, he served--I discovered this--it's, it's typical of, I think, his generation. He never talked about it at all. When my father [Benjamin Spencer] passed several years after that, I was cleaning out a trunk, and I found his discharge papers--won the Bronze Star [Bronze Star Medal], amazing.
Speaker 1: The Bronze Star is like, for valor--
Speaker 2: For valor, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, he's engaged, actually engaged in combat.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Never said a mumbling word about it.
Speaker 1: So, was he assigned to the Quartermaster Corps [U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps] or to the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, I, the best I can put it together, that it was a trucking unit when they came under attack, and they responded.
Speaker 1: I wonder if he was involved in the famous Red Ball Express.
Speaker 2: It may have been. I don't, I don't know, but I, I, think it was a trucking unit, and I believe that's what it was about.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know how many black trucking units they had, but the famous Red Ball Express was one that receives the notoriety and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and did some incredible things over there. They even made a TV show about it--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, 'Red Ball Express.' [sic. 'Roll Out'] So, okay. So, he was, so he never did discuss what he did to win the Bronze Star?
Speaker 2: He, he never discussed winning it. I had no--if I hadn't seen this piece of paper with, along with his discharge papers, I never would have known.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, he had passed before you had a chance to ask him about it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, he, he, he died, he died.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, is, so did he operate as an auto mechanic in town or--
Speaker 2: Yes, he worked for a company that did auto repair and bodywork. And, of course, on the weekends, he was the mechanic for the community, you know how that is. So the people would come to him and, and he worked on the cars.
Story_ID: 673752
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't really know the particulars. I, I understand that they, they met at church. I know that's all I ever got out of it, but I, I don't know the, the details of how they--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --got together.
Speaker 1: So, when you think about their personalities and their talents, their interests, what they look like, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Boy, that's a tough one. I, I think I look like my father [Benjamin Spencer] the most. But my mother [Hannah Ellerbe Spencer] had such a profound impact on me as, as, I guess, as most mothers do. But these were two extraordinary people, in my opinion, and my mother, especially--I mean, she kept everything together. Like I said, she was a kind of a community activist, outspoken, tough. And both my parents did, from day one, I don't know where it came from, they had a deep belief in the power of education. We--you went to school. That was your job, and your job was to do it well. And so, yeah, when you start out with five grades of education, and all of your children get college and professional degrees, you did something right.
Story_ID: 673753
Speaker 1: So, now do you have siblings?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. And can you name them all, and tell us a little something about them, and tell us where you fit in the lineup.
Speaker 2: Okay. I have my older sister [Gladys Spencer], who is about, it's, she's five years older than I am--1944, she was born. And she was an excellent student in school. She's a, a nurse, an R.N. [registered nurse], she lives in New Mexico. And because of the age difference between her and the rest of the kids, she was kind of the junior mother (laughter). She took care of us 'cause my parents [Benjamin Spencer and Hannah Ellerbe Spencer] were, almost always two jobs, so there was a lot of times when she was the one looking after us. So, we all, you know, look at her with a certain reverence because of, of that situation. And then, I came along. Well, let me stop right there. I had a brother [Benjamin Spencer, Jr.] who was born, I believe, in 1946, and died in early youth, early 19--1948. You know, how it was in those days, some kind of infection or something, but my mother talked about that. He died, and then I came along. And then, my brother [Eugene Spencer] was born in 1951, and he, he's an, an executive with a state agency in South Carolina. And then, my sister [Betty Spencer Connor], she's an accountant, M.B.A., finance type. And then, there were three first cousins who grew up in my home and, and I, and we're like brothers. We, that's, I mean, that's how I would refer to them. And one of those cousins, the older one, died at age sixty-one, diabetes, but he was a minister of music at a big church up in New York, and also in the insurance business--a, a college graduate. And then, my brother, Lee [Spencer's cousin, James Ellerbe], he went into the plastering business in Detroit [Michigan], had his own business, did very well. He's retired on the golf course down in South Carolina now. And then, Will [Spencer's cousin, Willie Jones], he worked in Baltimore [Maryland]--again, retired back in South Carolina. So, those, that's the core family.
Story_ID: 673754
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Well, I was, I was thinking about that, probably back to four, or three and a half in there, because I--my mother [Hannah Ellerbe Spencer] taught me to read very early on at, at least four years old. And, and I, so I got into that very, very early. And she went out of her way to provide reading material, you know, bought the encyclopedias. There was a dictionary, some Christian novels, and books of poetry, and those kind of things. And, and I, I got into that, and she was very proud of the fact that I was, I was good at this reading and reciting, and so on. She'd have her little club meetings, missionary circle, or whatever, and they'd, they'd call me in the living room and said, "Well, read this." And, you know, they'd be so proud, said, "Look at that boy, he can really, really read," you know. And, when you think back on it, it's the beginning of something. And the same thing in church, you know, being able to stand up and, and recite the poems, and so on. And they made a big deal out of it, and, of course, that encouraged me.
Story_ID: 673755
Speaker 1: Now, you're from--Florence [South Carolina] is in, what they--what they call the Pee Dee region (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The Pee Dee region, right.
Speaker 1: And the Pee Dee River, right?
Speaker 2: There're two, yeah, the Great Pee Dee [Great Pee Dee River] and the Little Pee Dee [Little Pee Dee River]. They had two rivers that run through it.
Speaker 1: Okay. And spelled like P-E-E, D-E-E?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And this is, this is named for a group of Native Americans [Peedee], right, that live there. Is that true?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's true.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So, what, so did, were you raised in the actual city of Florence, or on the outskirts of--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, no, it was--my, my house was in the, in the town of Florence. My grandmother [maternal grandmother, Alease Brown Ellerbe] had a farm, and I said a couple of uncles that was just outside. And I spent a lot of time, a lot of time on those farms.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So, can you kind of describe the neighborhood you grew up in?
Speaker 2: The neighborhood I grew up in, I would, I would describe it as a, a lower middle class. My home was a cinder block. My father [Benjamin Spencer] built it himself and then, it's expanded over the years. I think it started out with two bedrooms. He built another one and another bathroom on. But, you know, it was a neighborhood where people went to church. They didn't have much and not a lot of educated folks at all. You'd have to go, you know, a little distance away to get to the educated people in my town.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, so, in terms of the demographics of it, I mean, did black folks have a name for their community, or was there more than one community of black people?
Speaker 2: No, they, it, it was directional. In, in my town, if you meet somebody from Florence, they want to know whether you lived in west Florence, or north Florence, east Florence, or south Florence. South Florence was where the white people live. And part of east Florence was, a little part was black, and then, there was the white side. North Florence and west Florence were predominantly black. And so, we had, they had one black elementary school, North Vista [North Vista Elementary School, Florence, South Carolina], on the north side. They had Carver Elementary [Carver Elementary School; Carver Elementary STEAM Magnet School, Florence, South Carolina] on my side. And, you know, we had these little rivalries and so on, but, yeah, that's how it was, it was laid out. And anybody who's ever lived in Florence, I guarantee you, they, when you say west Florence, then they think of a neighborhood, a particular place and a particular people, so, right.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you lived on the west side of Florence?
Speaker 2: I lived in west Florence.
Speaker 1: West Florence, okay. And, all right, and was there a main street in your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: My neighborhood, yeah, I would say the street I lived on--Chase [Street] was the primary street and it intersected with Sumter [Street] and Darlington [Street]. Those were the, the two or three main streets there.
Speaker 1: Okay. I take it that Darlington went to Darlington [South Carolina] (laughter).
Speaker 2: Not really (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Unclear), is there something (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You can get to Darlington through that way, but the, this funny thing is you go the other way, away from Darlington Street to get to Highway 52 [U.S. Route 52], which takes you to Darlington.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 673756
Speaker 1: So was it--I mean, what was some the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Okay. Well, you know, when you, when I think about my growing up times, especially the early years, it's always positive. Even, even though, you know, we were poor, and even though it was what I call American apartheid, which, obviously, left some scars, and I'm sure we'll talk about that at some point. But for us kids growing up, it was idyllic. I mean, you know, you have a, a very good temperature. I mean, all year around, you can be outside. My grandmother's [maternal grandmother, Alease Brown Ellerbe] farm was like adventureland. She had all kinds of fruit and food that she would grow, and had a big pond that we swam in. I mean, it, it was, you know, kind of an idyllic existence, even in the middle of all the things that are going around, going on around you. So, my recollection of those days, very positive. In my neighborhood [in Florence, South Carolina], I knew everybody on all the blocks around me, all the kids, and the community was very supportive of me. And they, they would discipline you if they had to. I remember I, I walked past the lady's house on the corner, Mrs. Cooper [ph.]. She was sitting on the porch, and I didn't see her, so I walked by. When I got home, she called my mother [Hannah Ellerbe Spencer], said, "That boy walked by, and didn't speak to me." Oh, my mother was, she says, "You just march right back down," and I was like, "I'm so sorry, Mrs. Cooper." But, yeah, that's the kind of thing that, that went on all the time. And at the same time, a couple of blocks away, there was a, what, we used to call a juke joint (laughter), where, you know, the people would go on the weekends and drink and dance, and of course, we weren't allowed to go anywhere near it, but it was there.
Story_ID: 673757
Speaker 1: What was the name of your school when you started school? What was the name of it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Carver, Carver Elementary [Carver Elementary School; Carver Elementary STEAM Magnet School, Florence, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Carver, okay (pause). The one thing I noticed is I'm going to my father's home in Kentucky. It's a little town. It was at the--the white side of town was paved, and the black side wasn't. Is, is that true there?
Speaker 2: Yeah. It, it was clearly a major difference. They had sidewalks, you know, the things that we, we just did not have. And, and, you know, this, this brings to mind an, an incident. When, when I was just a kid, they used to have a Christmas parade, you know, around about this time of year. And this was annual, every year, and it, it went down--I believe the street was Evans Street. And so, to, to get a real understanding of how perverse this segregated world was--all of the black people would be on the north side of the street, and the white people would be on the south side. And this, and the parade would come along, right, and they, you know, the floats and the bands and so on. But the thing I remember, Santa is always the last one. He's on this little sleigh float and so on. And he used to take this peppermint candy, the little red and white peppermint candies, and toss them to the, to the crowd, to the kids, but only on the white side. I mean it--I, I tell you, this is the kind of thing that you just cannot forget.
Speaker 1: That's cold, yeah. So and, and, you know, black people bought into all this culture, just like, you know, Santa Claus and all that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, really, your thing was, stay away from that, don't, you know, don't cause any problem. Right. And I, I just, of course, I never had an opportunity to discuss it, my, with my father [Benjamin Spencer]. He died so early, but, you know, it must have been just a huge burden. You know, you, you go to the Tastee Freez. You got go around to the little window to get a hamburger--my god. I, I know it had, it had to take a toll on folks, had to.
Speaker 1: So, did you have much opportunity or need to go to the white side of town when you were growing up--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: When I was much younger, no. As I got older, say around eleven or twelve, I started going to the country club [Florence Country Club, Florence, South Carolina] to caddy. Right. And so, in order to get to the country club, we had to walk from our side of town over to, through the white community to the country club. And there would be four or five young guys making this trek. And we would go early because the way it worked is they had caddy lists. And the earlier you got there, you'd get the--be at the top of this list, which was important because if you're there early, and you're number one on the list, you get to go out twice, morning and the afternoon, so you can make more money. So, we'd get up at 4:30 in the morning--really. You just--and walk over there. And, invariably, I mean, this got to be a joke over the years. You know, some local police officer would stop us, "Where are you boys going?" The same place we were going last Saturday, right. But, yeah, that, that was interesting. It was, you know, we were out of place. You're, you're not supposed to be over there. And much later in my life, when I was appointed to this job, a fellow, he was a major or lieutenant colonel in the, in the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps]. He was here locally, and he saw in the paper that I was in Florence [South Carolina]. This was a white guy. So, he came by in my office and, you know, I met him, and we talked and chit chat, so he asked me about Timrod Park [Florence, South Carolina] (laughter), right. And I had, I had to explain to him, you know, I know Timrod Park. I, I, but we never played in that park because we were--and he goes there, and he says, "Oh, my god, I didn't even think about that." Yeah, so their life was very different from ours.
Story_ID: 673758
Speaker 1: I, when I--early on in my tenure in this job, had a case out of Richmond County, Virginia. And they were challenging this at large system where they selected the board, the county Board of Supervisors. So, they had a majority black county, but they, through the at large system, they managed to keep the blacks in a minority on the board. So, I hear this case and, eventually, ruled for the plaintiffs. And they eventually take over the Board of Supervisors. So, years later, a couple of years, maybe two or three years, I get invited to a church down there to, to speak, so I go down and speak. And one of the deacons of the church, I--of course I didn't know this before I went, had been one of the plaintiffs in that case. So, he, he came up to me, he said, "Judge, you got a few minutes before we go back to Richmond [Virginia]?" I was like, "Sure, sure." He said, "Well, get in the car." We get in the car, and we drove down to this road. And he turns in, and he's driving down the road. And on one side of the road, they have electricity and running water. On the other side, they do not, and I can't, I don't have to tell you what the difference was. On the same road, I, I was just completely amazed at that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, your tax money in action.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Everybody's being taxed the same.
Speaker 1: Everybody's being taxed the same.
Story_ID: 673759
Speaker 1: So you're growing up in--I was asking you about going, when you got older, you'd go downtown more. You were caddying, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah. And I would go downtown more--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --and you got to walk through the white side of town, and what was the name of the country club? Do you remember?
Speaker 2: It was the Florence Country Club [Florence, South Carolina]. It's still there, as a matter of fact. They have the Country Club of South Carolina [Florence, South Carolia]. That's right outside of Florence [South Carolina]. But, yeah, it's still there.
Speaker 1: So, I take it--all the caddies are black. Is that true?
Speaker 2: Yes, for the most part. Every now and then, especially if we had special stuff, tournaments, some of the young white kids would, would caddy. Of course, they wouldn't come to the caddy shack and hang out with us, but that was a different deal, but, yeah, for the most part. And some of these guys were older. It was, again, a, a learning experience being a caddy. I mean, with these older guys--I mean, you know, you, you had to be tough. You had to learn how to stand up for yourself. (Laughter) We had a guy--I mean, he was just a tough, tough dude. And so, my brother and I, we're young, young kids, and like I say, maybe twelve and ten, or whatever. So, we go, and get the preferred spot on the list, one and two, because we got up early, right. So, this guy comes, strikes our name out, right--just, he's just going to take the spot. And, you know, we, we couldn't let that go, you know. So, we told the golf pro, and he set it straight. So, this guy is like, he said, "Yeah, well, he's going to beat us up, right (laughter)?" Yeah. Well, so, my brother and I, we took, you know, a proactive (laughter) stance about this, you know. You know, I--we contacted our older brothers who came out, and we dealt with this guy. And then, we had--never had another, another problem. I mean, like you say, you, you learn how to operate in the world--the bad stuff and the good stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, did you have instructions about how to deal with white people in those kind of situations as a caddy?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely. In, in terms of your, your life and your impact, the impact didn't, from being involved with them. The first thing is try to avoid any contact with them at all. Of course, when I was growing up, they'd, they'd say, "Just stay away from those people." You know, just, which, for the most part, we did. I mean, it was--our life was separate that way. And then, as you get older, for instance, you know, the same thing, like driving your car. Once you get a driver's license, how to behave if you get stopped. All of that stuff started years ago. And my mother [Hannah Ellerbe Spencer] said, you, you do this, and you don't do that. Yeah, there, there was a group of instructions that I think had been around for a long time about how to survive if you have to interact.

Speaker 1: Did you know of any of your peers that got in trouble for doing the wrong thing?
Speaker 2: I don't know about my peers, but there were--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I mean, not a crime, but just behaving the wrong way, or--?
Speaker 2: Well, there, there were instances where people got in trouble.
Speaker 1: Or any stories, I guess, not just your peers, but any stories that you know of.
Speaker 2: All right, well, all right. There was--one of my, my friends, who got in a fight at the movie theatre, with a white kid. And he was taking tickets. And, of course, the, you know, the black people had to sit up in the balcony, and the white people downstairs. So, he's taking the tickets, and so everybody is pushing in. And so, this fellow gave him his ticket, took a few steps in. And the guy grabbed him by the shoulder, you know, "Give me your ticket." He said, "I just gave you the ticket." Which he had, I mean, but, but with all these people coming in, I don't know, maybe the guy missed it or something. So, he just, you know, he just tried to walk on into the theatre, and the guy grabbed him. And a, a fight broke out, right, and of course, he was the one that got in trouble. Went to court--and eventually, his mother sent him out of town. You know, this is one of the things they used to do. The judge said, well, this, this kid can't be around here, so they, you know, sent him off to an aunt or something. And he stayed away for a year and came back. Yeah, that happened.
Speaker 1: Now, this is a regular thing, you know, kids being sent away-
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --'cause of an altercation?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, you know, if you got in certain, certain kinds of trouble, you had to leave. I mean, so you need--usually it would be going north. In this case, he, the kid went to Atlanta [Georgia].
Story_ID: 673761
Speaker 1: Now, let me go back, I, I skipped over grade school and all that. You started grade school at Carver [Carver Elementary School; Carver Elementary STEAM Magnet School, Florence, South Carolina], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what size school was that? Was it a fairly--
Speaker 2: It went to the sixth grade, and there were at least two classes in each grade. And I think one or two had three classes. So, I mean, like it's just the whole west side of town, town. And all the, all the black kids, you know, again, at the time, I thought it was just a huge complex. I drive by there now, and it looks so tiny, you know, a little tiny place. It's no longer a school, but I, wow, but--
Speaker 1: Did you have a separate classroom for each grade or several class rooms for each grade?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, it had, like in the third grade, one of the third grade teachers was a relative of mine. So they, they put me in the other lady's class, and I was not happy about that. She, she was very stern and had a reputation for being very stern. And so, we go to lunch early in the week, the first week. And she's like, a commando at lunch, and, "You got to drink your milk." I've got an allergy--I, I mean, I, to this day, of lactose. I don't drink milk.
Speaker 1: Lactose intolerance?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, I don't drink milk. And she insisted, "Boy, you know, you better drink your milk." And I, because I drank the milk and threw up, right. And, of course, my mother [Hannah Ellerbe Spencer] came down to the school, raising complete hell. And they put me in the other class where the teacher was my relative. It's a good day (laughter).
Speaker 1: There you go, yeah. Yeah, it's, hm, all right. So, now, did you like school?
Speaker 2: Loved school. And, like I said, I, I've always been a reader. And so, when I got to first grade, you know, right away, I think it was me and one other girl were a reading group. So we, you know, I was just way ahead. It makes a huge difference. And so, I, I enjoyed it. They, they gave me a chance to read and be engaged in the academic exercise. I always liked school.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, you were, you came with the tools already--you could already read, so.
Speaker 2: Ex- that's right.
Story_ID: 673762
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite subjects or teachers in school?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I liked all of my teachers, save one. I, I had a wonderful teacher in the first grade because she, you know, she tried to encourage the reading. She was just thrilled by the fact that, you know, we could read at the level that we did. And then, the little girl who was in the reading group with me, her mother was the second grade teacher, who I loved. She was just a real, real sweetheart of a person--again encouraged me. She would bring books from home, you know, "So take a look and see if you can read this." You know, and I'd, if I couldn't understand a word, I got the dictionary, so, I'm hearing it. So they, they really were very, very helpful to me in elementary school [Carver Elementary School; Carver Elementary STEAM Magnet School, Florence, South Carolina]. I, I had a fifth grade teacher that was a very bad teacher, but other than that, everybody else was, was fine. And the fifth grade teacher--let's see, how should I put this? She had a color and class bias. This is a black woman, but it, it was ridiculous.
Speaker 1: Now, is she light herself or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, a very fair skinned. But, I, I tell you--but again, motivated me in a different way because I, I'll give you this story because it's interesting. And I've used it as an illustration in a sermon. You know, one, she gave us this exercise, typical, you know, write a few pages about what it is that you want to do when you grow up, right. And so, I wrote my little paper, and I said I wanted to be, go to college, major in physical education, and be a teacher and a coach, you know, 'cause I liked athletics and so on. And so, everybody had to stand up and read their little paper. So, when I finished reading my paper, and she says, "Boy, you need to be practical, you know, to think about joining the [U.S.] Army or getting a job. You know, nobody in your family ever went to college. And nobody in your neighborhood," you, you know. And then, she said, "You, you have about as much chance of going to college as I have of being Miss America." Now, that, that--this is a nine year old child. I will never, ever forget that. But, of course, in my head, I'm thinking, I'm going to college--if it's the last thing I do, I'm going to college.
Speaker 1: This is 1960, right? You're in the fifth grade. You're about ten, right--(simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: Yeah in, in the fifth grade, yeah.
Speaker 1: Ten years old, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Ten years old, so '59 [1959], somewhere around, yeah.
Story_ID: 673763
Speaker 1: So this is when, this is when Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] and Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] are running for president and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: I mean, '60 [1960], the space program is big--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --did you all have a TV set?
Speaker 2: Not initially, no, no. It was a while back. I don't--probably a couple of years after that before you have television.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right. So, did you get newspapers at home and magazines and stuff like that?
Speaker 2: We got the, the Florence Morning News at home. My mother [Hannah Ellerbe Spencer] would sometime bring these magazines that were older from the places where she worked. Again, to me, it was like manna from Heaven. I mean, what she brought home, yeah, a Life magazine or whatever--I just thought, "Oh, man, this is terrific." And I, I would just sit and look at the pictures and read those magazines--yeah, again, encouraging.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, did you have any role models, you know, like in the--I guess, around you, I mean, through the media, or anything that, you know, that any black people doing anything, or--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, I'll say it this way. My, my wife [Spencer's second wife, Margaret Spencer] always laughs at me about this 'cause I, I've got a huge Jet magazine collection (laughter). I mean, I mean, I just saved them over the years. I got suitcases full of Jet magazine. But, again, I love that magazine. Because I, when I got it--they used to have it at the barber shop, you know, and I worked a deal with a barber. I was like, "Okay, you know, when this stuff gets, you know, too old, like, you know, you don't want to put it out here, can I take a couple?" He said, "Sure, sure." So, I would, I was always reading Jet magazine. And then, the, the power of that is seeing your people do stuff. Same thing with Ebony. It was an extraordinary phenomenon and extraordinarily important. I don't know whether, you know, history will record that, but I, I absolutely believe those two magazines were very important to us. It was important to me to be able to see somebody who looked like me doing great things. And I didn't get that from any other place. Of course, when I had the high school, I had some teachers, who went outside the book, and taught some real African American history. So, that was, that was good.
Story_ID: 673764
Speaker 1: You know, I can't, I'm trying to think of somebody else. Well, if we're thinking about a mentor, somebody that I looked at, and thought, "Wow, this is somebody I'd like to be like." When I was, I guess I was around eleven, this was in the seventh grade, my mother [Hannah Ellerbe Spencer], just out of the blue one day, she said to me, "You're coming with me today." This is a school day. All right, "Where are we going?" So, I get in the car with her, and she drives over to Charleston [South Carolina]. And we get there, and we go to the federal courthouse [Charleston Federal Courthouse] in Charleston. I walk in there, and I'm looking around this place that's got, you know, all the wood paneled walls, this really impressive building. So, we go in, and it turns out, there's a court case going on. I don't know what it was about, but it, my mother referred to the lawyer as our lawyer. So, it had something to do with civil rights or something. So there was a, a black lawyer in the courtroom. And he had this big, booming voice that filled up the courtroom. Tall and handsome. And, boy, you know, I listened to him. And so, we're driving back. I was like, "Who, who is this man?" She said, "Oh, that's our lawyer. That's Matthew Perry [Matthew J. Perry]." Right and I said, "Well," you know my next question is, "what does a lawyer do?" (Laughter) And my mother says, "Well, they help people." So, I, you know, I sit there for a few minutes as we're riding along the road. And I say to her, "Well, that sounds like a pretty good job, right?" And she said, "Oh, yeah, that's a great job, and you get to wear a shirt and tie to work every day." So, I, you know, that, that struck me. And, of course, years later when Matthew Perry became one of my colleagues, I told him that story. I said, "Matthew, you never know what kind of impression you're making, and on whom." Yeah, we got to be good friends. And he's--was, just one of the greatest people I've ever known, absolutely. But, yeah, he had quite an impact on me.
Speaker 2: Yeah, to think your mother had thought to do that though.
Speaker 1: I can't--isn't that amazing?
Speaker 2: That's great.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's a really great story, yeah. So she was really looking ahead at your future and your potential for doing, yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, yeah, my mother is an extraordinary woman, and no question about it.
Story_ID: 673765
Speaker 1: The Civil Rights Movement, by 1962, is really starting to cook with--Freedom Riders, sit ins in North Carolina and other places. Did you, did you kind of keep up? Now, you all didn't have a TV at that point. Did you keep up with it, though, through Jet and other--
Speaker 2: Yeah. I, I kept up with it. And, and, we--they had, you know, protests in my home town. And my older sister [Gladys Spencer] was involved. They, you know, the kids going down to try to desegregate the five and dime, the lunch counters, all this stuff.
Speaker 1: Were they, did anybody get hurt or--
Speaker 2: Nobody got hurt. They got detained. But, yeah, it was, you know, that whole thing was bubbling up all around. And I was very much aware of it.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, is your older sister in college by that time?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, she was, she--let's see, she (unclear). Yeah, she was. It must have been her first or second year.
Speaker 1: And where was she in school?
Speaker 2: She went to South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University].
Speaker 1: Okay, in Orangeburg [South Carolina].
Speaker 2: In Orangeburg.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. You know, they really had some intense struggles in Orangeburg, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, right, there, yeah, so that, that stuff was all around. Of course, '63 [1963] was a mega year in terms of the Civil Rights Movement. I remember a number of things that happened. But the, the big thing, for me anyway, was in September of '63 [1963] when the little girls were killed in the bombing in Birmingham, [Alabama]. And we did have a television. I remember this because we come home from church. And everybody, you know, they change out of using church clothes. And I go in, and my mother [Hannah Ellerbe Spencer] is sitting there crying. She said, "They killed those children in Birmingham." Hm (shakes head), I'll never forget it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was--it--now, did you--were you aware of the March on Washington--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --just the month before?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I was aware of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Anybody go from, from Florence [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of. Not that I know of.
Story_ID: 673766
Speaker 1: I know the church had a tremendous influence on you.
Speaker 2: Tremendous.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: It was Center, C-E-N-T-E-R, Baptist Church [Center Baptist Church, Florence, South Carolina]. And the reason it had this name, it was kind of on the line between Darlington County [South Carolina] and Florence County [South Carolina]. It's right there, and my, my people on my father's side were founders of the church. They helped build the church, so my [paternal] grandfather [Levi Spencer] was chairman of the deacon board. And my--his first cousin eventually was chairman of the deacon board when I came along. My father [Benjamin Spencer] was on that board, as well as a couple of other of my uncles over time. My mother [Hannah Ellerbe Spencer] was very active in the church, you know, a missionary, choir, and all of that. And so, we had to go to church. I mean, we did Sunday school, and Wednesday nights, and Tuesday nights (laughter), junior choir, you know. But it was really good for me in terms of development.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. And what was the name of your reverend?
Speaker 2: The first one that I recall was named McCoy, Reverend McCoy [ph.]. Then, Reverend Samuel [ph.], his last name was Samuel, he came along. And I, I preferred him. He was a, he was a--uneducated, but gifted. And he really had a way of telling the, the stories in his sermon. I used to sit there, you could just see what he's talking about. And he had two young daughters who were--I think, one was my age, and one was a couple of years older, so we were friends. So, I, I really enjoyed him--a really, really good guy. Again, he was very encouraging to me--I, I cannot tell you. I used to, you know, my brothers and I, we had a little group. We sang gospel. We sang the other stuff, too, but, you know, they would give us a platform for that. And then, when I went off to school--oh, man, you, you would, you would think that I was going to be pope some place, or something, because they, they just lifted me up and said, "Oh, he's going to college." And they gave me money for books, you know. It was just a terrific group of people.
Story_ID: 673767
Speaker 1: Now, after Carver Elementary [Carver Elementary School; Carver Elementary STEAM Magnet School, Florence, South Carolina], you move on to the high school. Now, what was the high school--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, no, after Carver Elementary, I went to Wilson Junior High--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay I'm sorry--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --which was seventh, eighth, and ninth grade, kind of different.
Speaker 1: Wilson Junior High School [Florence, South Carolina], okay. I hate to think it's named after Woodrow Wilson [President Thomas Woodrow Wilson] but--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I have no idea who the Wilson is (laughter), I don't in fact it prob--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Some of the, you know, I ask about the name of these schools sometimes 'cause some of them are named for really important black people who are now forgotten in history--
Speaker 2: Right, right, I know.
Speaker 1: --who actually built that school or established it way back then. It was Carver, of course, George Washington Carver, I imagine. And then, Wilson Junior High School. So, in junior high, you know, now, is it, this is really like, yeah, this is when you made the trip to the courthouse, right, around when you were in junior high.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, the seventh grade was when I made that trip.
Speaker 1: Right, right. So, how is, you--I mean, are you like, I suppose you're considered a leader in the school?
Speaker 2: In the school, I would say yes, you know, they had the track system then. So, you know, you're seven one, or seven A, B, C, whatever. And so they put all the, the smart kids, as they've identified them, into the top tray. And so, I was in that class. And I was always, you know, one of the better students, and everybody knew it, so, in that sense. And I, and when we went to junior high, the kids came from east Florence [South Carolina], north Florence, and west Florence, from their various elementary schools to that one school. And that was a little different, you know, when you first get there. And I guess, one of my gifts is getting along with people, so I got along with the folks from the other spots. And so, yeah, to some extent, I would say, I was a leader.
Story_ID: 673768
Speaker 1: And then, high school is--
Speaker 2: Is Wilson Senior High School [Wilson High School, Florence, South Carolina] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Wilson Senior okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a completely different location. And that was tenth, eleventh and twelfth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. It's kind of weird because, you know, usually ninth grade is a freshman year at the high school. But it was your last year. You're the big man on campus. We had, we played, you know, JV [junior varsity] kind of basketball, and so forth. And we started learning a band instrument if you want, you know. You're in seventh grade, you start learning a band instrument. And by the time you get into high school, you can play on their band, and so on. So, there, you know, we were kind of a feeder program.
Speaker 1: So, did you play an instrument?
Speaker 2: I played saxophone.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the fellow who was my band instructor, his name was Leon Harvey. He went to Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University] here in Petersburg [Virginia]--quite a, quite a character. And he--his instrument was the saxophone. And so, yeah, that's when I learned, you know, to read music and play an instrument.
Speaker 1: Okay. And did you play on the basketball team?
Speaker 2: I played on the basketball team.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, what position did you play?
Speaker 2: I was a shooting guard at, and I played a little bit of point later on, but I, I was basically a shooting guard.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. It was a pretty good team. You, now you all played the other black schools in the region, right? That's what you're--
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah. And that would, and mostly, you know, the funny thing is most of these schools are--no longer exist. But, again, when I meet a person of a certain age from South Carolina, I know they're, if they're from Sumter [South Carolina], they went to Lincoln [Lincoln High School], right. If they're from Orangeburg [South Carolina], they went to Wilkinson [Orangeburg-Wilkinson High School]. From Florence [South Carolina], they went to Wilson, right. Hartsville [South Carolina], Butler [Butler High School], every town basically had one big black high school. In Columbia [South Carolina], it was Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington High School] and C.A. Johnson [C.A. Johnson High School]. And we, we played all of the big schools. We were a four A, you know, the highest level of school because of the size. So, we played everybody, and there's some, some big rivalries, so it, it was good days.
Speaker 1: How did you all do at Wilson Senior High School?
Speaker 2: We were very good in athletics. I mean, 'cause of the size of the school and the, the number of kids feeding into it, we were very good. We played good football, played good basketball, track, everything. We're, you know, a top school when it came to athletics.
Story_ID: 673769
Speaker 1: So, in senior high school now [Wilson Senior High School; Wilson High School, Florence, South Carolina]. So, did you play in the band then in senior high school, too?
Speaker 2: No, didn't play in the band--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because of athletics, but, you know, I kept up. Like I said, we--my brothers and I had a little, a little group. My brother, Nat [ph.], could sing; brother, Lee [Spencer's adopted brother, James Ellerbe], excellent singer. We could all sing a little bit. My brother, Bernard [Eugene Spencer], he majored in music. He plays all the instruments. So, we, you know, this, again, we, this is a money-making exercise. We would, you know, play the secular stuff on Friday and Saturday, and then you do the church thing on Sunday, you know, a little, little group we had. So, that's how I kept up with the music. I--when I was, took senior status, I decided, well, you know, I needed to do something to keep my, my brain occupied here. So, I, I started taking some piano lessons. And I've really enjoyed that. I mean, it was, it was good to get the brain back working with the music so.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, what style of music did you play in those days? What was the popular stuff you played in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, you know, the old, in the, in the '60s [1960s], early '60s [1960s], especially rhythm and blues, the old doo-wops, and that kind of stuff. Yeah, we, we played all of that. And then, of course, on the, on the church side, we pretty much mimicked the soul stars with Sam Cooke, you know, 'Oh, Mary Don't You Weep,' and those kind of things. I, I idolized Sam Cooke--I think he's the greatest singer who ever lived. I mean, the guy's range was incredible--the tone of his voice. It really is tragic that he died so young--man, what a tremendous talent, yeah. And so, that, he was one of my favorites.
Story_ID: 673770
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were just lamenting the early death of Sam Cooke, who was shot in a--by a motel operator in Los Angeles [California], right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right so senseless and so, it's tragic when, when talent like that.  I, I have a theory if, you know, if, if God blesses you with a gift and, and when you see that gift, when you're exposed to that gift, you know, like Kathleen Battle singin' an, an opera, it, it touches you at the core.  These kind of things really get to you because it's a gift from God, it's a gift from God.
Speaker 1: Yeah during those days, his song 'A Change Gon' Come,' [sic. 'A Change Is Gonna Come'] was really popular in the Civil Rights Movement--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --and people caught on to that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: And I still think one of the greatest songs ever written.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, okay.  So, so you all singing in--well, you're singing for parties and stuff or did you have a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, you do, do a little, little clubs, little joints.  We would go in and do a little set.
Speaker 1: In the regional scope or did you just--
Speaker 2: We were, we would go around South Carolina.  I don't think we ever left the state, maybe eastern North Carolina, down there in Ellerbe, yeah.  But, yeah, kind of be in our, our region, we would do our thing and so, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, those are days when people are playing 45s [45 rpm records], right?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My sister had a big collection of 45s.  In South Carolina, we have yard parties, you know, instead of, you know, like some place there, the basement, the whatever.  But they had the party in the backyard.  They set up the lights, set up the record player, and people would dance on the ground and, yeah, that--those were, those were the days.
Story_ID: 673771
Speaker 1: Now, by the time you were a senior in high school [Wilson Senior High School; Wilson High School, Florence, South Carolina], did you, were you, did you run for class office or anything like that or--
Speaker 2: No, no, I, I did not.  I'm trying to think who our class president was.  I can't remember, but I, it's probably just like I did in college.  I, you know, I was involved in the campaigns, you know, I, trying to run the thing, and help somebody get elected.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it was generally, did you generally think then, you were going to college?  I'm sure your mother [Hannah Ellerbe Spencer] was pushing you then--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, at that point, I, I thought for certain I would, would go to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then, had you, how did you choose the school that you finally--so, you went to Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: I went to Clark, yeah.
Speaker 1: But how did you go?  Was it a teacher or your mother or who?
Speaker 2: Well, no, it was, it was money that made the choice for me.  I want- I wanted to go to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] in the worst possible way.  One of my--my counselor, who I had a lot of respect for there, was a minister at the biggest church in town who had gone to Morehouse.  His wife was a, a Spelman graduate [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And they all, you know, talked about this place, like it was, you know, really a great thing.  And, of course, I researched it.  I read about it, and I thought, yeah, that's, that's the place for me.  So, of course, I was admitted, but they only gave me a full tuition scholarship, you know, and that wasn't enough.  I mean, my, my parents couldn't, my mother could not afford to, to pay the rest of it.  So, Clark came through with a full scholarship--I mean, you know, covered everything.  So, that was that, you know.  I, I had to do what was rational, and so I went, and I don't regret it at all--not at all.  I sent my, one of my sons to Morehouse.  But I had a terrific time at Clark.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, and you said that you, now, when graduation came, did you have a role during graduation that you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: From high school?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: I, yeah, I was a student speaker and, you know.
Speaker 1: Were you the valedictorian?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's a big deal, so I just want to make sure that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 673772
Speaker 1: And this is a, a atmosphere, and I don't know how bad it was, but you alluded to the teacher in the fifth grade that, that tried to put you down, by saying you could never attain this 'cause nobody else in your family had ever attained it, you all weren't college material and that sort of thing--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but was that when you were in high school [Wilson Senior High School; Wilson High School, Florence, South Carolina], did you encounter that kind of thing at all?
Speaker 2: Not really, not really, because, you know, one says, you start to grow up, you're involved in athletics, and academics and the, the programs at the school, you know, people start to measure you differently.  And plus, as time went on, you know, black became in (laughter), you know.  You know, when people used to make jokes, and that kind of stuff, but it kind of flipped the--a little bit there.  And as I say, I--and not much of an issue there at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, yeah.
Speaker 1: You got two things going--the color thing was also like, like economic status--
Speaker 2: Right, right, yeah, the class thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: And they're often linked.
Speaker 2: Now, that's true.
Speaker 1: Not necessarily--
Speaker 2: Not necessarily, but they're often like, and the class thing was, was doggedly stubborn because, and you know, it, it's just a little bit of this now, you know, what I call the Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.] set (laughter).  You know, when I was growing up, you know, the, the doctors' kids or, you know, or the teachers' kids, where they have a birthday party, you know, we, we wouldn't get in- invited because, you know, it was a different class of people.  And so, and, coincidentally, sometimes they'd, they tended to be the, the fairer-skinned people, but not all the time.  But, yeah, and as a little kid, that's hard to deal with, you know, you know, why are all the kids are going to the doctor's house for a party, and certain kids don't get invited?  But, you know, as you get older, again, that, that changes a little bit, but there was always this, this kind of class thing.  And I, I don't know why it is that when people are oppressed, they sometimes fight over bones.  You know, it, it doesn't make any sense.  And it doesn't, it's not the kids, it's what, you know, I am now friends with some of these kids.  For instance, there's a fellow--I'm in the guardsmen [National Association of Guardsmen, Inc.] with him in the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] with him.  And when we hook up, you know, the guy is from Florence [South Carolina], but he, his father was a dentist.  I mean, you know, never the twain would meet, when we were in the town, but now, you know, we're good friends--a good guy.  It wasn't about him.  It was this whole thing that came down through the, the parents, I suppose.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that through the--I guess, through the culture of the country where--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --we were brought to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: --I guess, I mean--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: All people have class.  They have standards all over the world in different ways.  They sort each other out--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but that's, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I used to--
Speaker 1: So I just wondered what the--
Story_ID: 673773
Speaker 1: So, you were valedictorian [at Wilson Senior High School; Wilson High School, Florence, South Carolina], which is a really a big deal.  And so, you, you're off to Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  And you said the church [Center Baptist Church, Florence, South Carolina] gave you a big send off and, you know.
Speaker 2: They gave me a huge send off, and in big and small ways, the stuff that I can never, ever forget.  I mean, just--to give you an example, I had a lady, who was one of the mothers of the church.  I'd known her all my life, and she called me by my middle name.  She, she says, "Randolph [HistoryMaker James R. Spencer], come here a minute."  I said, "Yes, ma'am."  This is after church, so I go over to talk to her.  And this little lady, she's got on the white uniform, and all of that.  And she grabbed my hand, and put a twenty dollar bill in it, you know, you're going off to school, she said, "I, I just want to help you out a little bit."
Speaker 1: Twenty dollars is like a hundred dollars today (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: That's also a lot of money.
Speaker 1: You know and, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in 1967--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --that was a lot of money.
Speaker 2: But this is how, you know, they, what they thought of me, how they identified with me, you know, my victory would be their victory.  Yeah, I, I can never thank them enough.
Story_ID: 673774
Speaker 1: So, Clark University [sic. Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Georgia, Atlanta].  Now, did you work over the summer?  I imagine you did but--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I worked every summer (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Every summer, I, I worked, and now let, you know, we've jumped over something that I can't jump over.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father [Benjamin Spencer] died two days after my fifteenth birthday, the 27th of March.  And that was a major, major event in my life's progression because if my father had lived, he, of course, was the breadwinner, major breadwinner in the house.  In all likelihood, I would have gone to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  We would have been able to handle it.  But with my father's death, all of us had to step up, you know, and contribute to the household finances, and so on.  And I had to be responsible, you know.  I always said that was the end of my childhood, and it came suddenly.  My, my father--we, it was a Sunday.  We went to church, we get in the car to come home, and for the first time in my entire life, my father says to my mother, "Hannah [Hannah Ellerbe Spencer], you drive."  And we were all quiet--just stunned by that.  I mean, you know, in those days, a man just doesn't do that.  I mean, you, you just--he'd always drove the car, but she drove home from church.  And we walk in the house, and as soon as we get inside the house, he steps in the bedroom, falls to the floor, right.  My mother is screaming, and I'm on the phone trying to get the ambulance to come.  And it, it was traumatic.  And, of course, and he died right there at age fifty.  Well, he was forty-nine.  In May, he would have been fifty.
Speaker 1: It was a heart attack?
Speaker 2: A heart attack, right.  And that was a, that was a tough, tough deal.  We, we struggled.  So, I just wanted to, to put that on the record.  I had two wonderful parents, but my father's death is definitely one of the low points.
Story_ID: 673775
Speaker 1: Did you caddy, and that sort of thing during the summer, or what did you, what did you do?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  The summer before I was, I did caddy on the weekends, but I, my, my main job was working at the Sky View Drive-In [Florence, South Carolina].  And that was one of these places, you know, where the cars can drive in, and they get the, their food in their cars.  It was a terrific job because of the tips.  Oh, my god, I highly coveted it (laughter), you know.  I mean, really, I was so happy to get this job, and you try to keep it, boy, once you get it.  It was, you know, it was difficult in the sense that you got to deal with the public.  And it's, that's always tough, you know, drunk white guys on a Saturday night, you know, this kind of thing, but you make your adjustments.
Speaker 1: So, did you take the tickets and sell them tickets, or what did you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, no, what happens is when one of these drive-in restaurants, they come up, they order through a little, little mic.
Speaker 1: Oh, this is a drive-in, right.
Speaker 2: Yes, a drive-in--
Speaker 1: That's a drive-in.  I'm thinking of a movie drive-in.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, drive-in restaurant.
Speaker 1: Okay, drive-in restaurant.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they come in, and they take the order and stuff.  And then we come to the car, hook their tray onto the window, you know, and pass out the beer or, whatever the heck it is and, and they would pay us.  And we'd make tips.  You know, there was a base salary, which was practically nothing, two bucks a night, or whatever it was.  But it was the tips, especially on Friday and Saturday night--just wonderful.  So, that was, that was one of my jobs.  Later on, I got a, I had a job at the La-Z-Boy [La-Z-Boy Incorporated] chair factory (laughter).  Again, it was a great job because it--I worked from three to eleven, and we always did overtime.  So, I'd get home, like at two o'clock in the morning, and so on, but it, it paid well.  I bought my first car with working that whole summer.
Speaker 1: Working for La-Z-Boy--
Speaker 2: A La-Z-Boy chair factory, yeah.  It's funny.  At the end of the summer, I--this is my, after my freshman year.  The, the guy, who's the supervisor, offered me the job permanently.  He says, "You know, you're a good worker, when, you know--." I said, "Naw, I'm going back to school."  "Are you sure you want to do that?"  I said, "Are you kidding?" (Laughter) C'mon, yeah.
Speaker 1: And perception is something, wherever you're from I guess.
Story_ID: 673776
Speaker 1: Now at Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] now, who, who were some of the students and teachers and personalities that stand out at Clark?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.  In terms of the, the teachers, our administration, the very first, first person that comes to mind is the president of the university.  He had a girl's name.  His name was Vivian, Vivian Henderson [Vivian Wilson Henderson].  And, but he is an economist, extraordinarily bright fellow, and he, he proved to be huge in my development there at the school.  He's just a really good guy, and especially, if you're a good student.  There was nothing that he wouldn't do for you.  He, he helped me in terms of graduate school--we talked about, you know.  He says, "You know, Spencer [HistoryMaker James R. Spencer], Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or Yale [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut], nothing less."  That's (laughter) what he told me.  He--I said, "Well, what about, you know, I need the--." He said, "No, no, no, I don't even want to hear it.  You, you've got to go to one of these schools, to law school." And so on--so, I applied, and got in.  But he was the one who encouraged me along the way, a really, really good guy.  And plus, he had patience with us because, you know, during that time, that whole Black Power movement.  And, you know, I'm walking around with my dashiki and little fists around there and--
Speaker 1: So did you really had a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, yeah, oh, absolutely, you know, the big Afro, and talking trash (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, who influenced you or who in the media--I mean, in those days, it was Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] was big--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And people were reading Eldridge Cleaver.
Speaker 2: I did all of that, and that was, you know, that was that era.  And I kind of saw myself as the minister of communication (laughter) 'cause I was, like I said, I, I went back to speak--I think it was in 1991 or something.  And the lady who was head of the honors program, she introduced me.  She said to the students, she says, "You see all this gray hair.  This boy's responsible for half of it" (laughter). 'Cause I used to give the administration hell, you know--one day we took over the administration, but you know all those things--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, was there a student organization?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what was it called, do you remember?
Speaker 2: It was just the, the student union and, and we were young and full of ourselves, and so on--
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this is interesting though.  These are cultural changes and borne out of some realizations.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, some realizations.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what actually irked you about the school and when, when you look back on it was it legitimate, you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well, some of it was legitimate, but one of my big things was that I had been blessed in my high school [Wilson Senior High School; Wilson High School, Florence, South Carolina] to have some teachers who, as I said, went off script.  And when I, I got to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right, you did now--oh, let's, let's talk about that for just a second before we even get you to college.
Story_ID: 673777
Speaker 1: You're already in it, but we'll go rewind that back, 'cause that's unusual to have teachers in those days who would--who talk about black history and culture.
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: So, who was, who were they, and what are they talking about?
Speaker 2: Oh, I can tell you exactly.  There was a woman--her name was Mattie Lou Person [ph.].  She was my homeroom teacher and English teacher in the seventh grade [at Wilson Junior High School, Florence, South Carolina].  And then, I look up, and she's over at the senior high school [Wilson Senior High School; Wilson High School, Florence, South Carolina], and she was my homeroom teacher.  And she taught English literature over at the senior high school.  And for reasons that I'll never know, she took a liking to me.  When I was in the seventh grade, she was so hard on everybody.  She was--I mean, if you finished her class, you knew how to write.  I mean, she just did not play.  And so, I was, when I came into the seventh grade, I was very, very shy and withdrawn.  I, I mean, I would--I'd, I'd rather just sit and say nothing, even though I knew all the answers when, you know, but I, I didn't want to, you know, be out front.  And she must have recognized my issue, so she calls me up to her desk after class one day, and said to me, she handed me this--a poem.  She said, "Spencer [HistoryMaker James R. Spencer], and next week, I want you to recite this poem for us."  And I was just terri- I was like, what have I done to this woman?  Why is she doing this to me?  So, I, you know, I just worried over this thing, and got, so anyway, I, I did the poem.  She said, "That was great.  Now, we're going to try this one next week."  And she kept doing that over and over again until I got comfortable with it.  And so, this is how--the kind of teacher she was.  So, in senior high school, she would say, "Has anybody heard of, Imhotep?" "Why--no."  This is the real father of medicine, right, and she starts talking about this stuff.  I'm like, wow, I never even--I mean, I had no, no idea.  She, obviously, had studied some place and knew an awful lot about our history, our real history.  And so, that's when--
Speaker 1: Did she introduce you to any books since you were--that weren't part of the normal cir--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Not, not any books, but she would hand out stuff that she'd printed out from books.  And so, that, that was the beginning.  And, of course, once I got to Atlanta [Georgia] with the, the vast libraries there, I was able to kind of track down some of this stuff.  And so, that, that was one of our gripes at Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] about, you know, you guys are still teaching us this Western crap (laughter).
Story_ID: 673778
Speaker 1: Now, did you know the, [HistoryMaker] Vincent Harding and the people over at the Center for the Black World [sic.], in Atlanta [Georgia]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I met him.  I didn't know him well, but I, I did meet him.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay--Institute of the Black World [Atlanta, Georgia], IBW (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Right, Institute of the Black World, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], and there were quite a few of them there--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And they had some, some big time intellects around, around the center there, and I, I enjoyed that whole time.  The education was great.  My, my major, political science and economics, I, I spent a lot of time at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  It was ironic because, you know, each one of the schools has kind of their thing.  And theirs was, one of the things was the political science, so I took all those courses over there.  Three of the guys I spent a lot of time with over in those classes went to Harvard to law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] with me as well.  So, yeah, it's, it was good, good time for me.
Speaker 1: So you had a lot of exposure to Morehouse anyway.  At this point--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1: So, did you meet the president of Morehouse, Benjamin Mays?
Speaker 2: I, I did.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: I met him.  I, I met him and Martin King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] in October of 1967.  Yeah, we, when I saw we, there were four guys--all of us from South Carolina from, not just South Carolina--three from Florence [South Carolina], one from Greenville [South Carolina].  And we were walking across Morehouse's campus.  And one of the guys was a Morehouse student, and the other three were Clark students, but we all knew each other.  So, we run into Dr. Mays and Dr. King.  You know, and, of course, we're like, as we're stopped, and we talked to them, you know.  And Dr. King is like, you know, "What are you guys studying?" And that kind of thing?  Let me tell you--my very first impression of him was how small he was.  He was just a, you know, I'm 6'2", Steve Koff [ph.] from Greenville is 6'6", he played basketball.  You know, we, we towered over him.  You know, I don't know, you watch him on TV, he seemed like a big personality and stuff, but if he was over 5'7", I'd be stretching it.  He was a, a really short guy.
Speaker 1: 'Cause Benjamin Mays is fairly tall.
Speaker 2: Mays, Mays was tall, Mays was tall.  And, you know, and he walked with all of his height, yeah.  But, yeah, I, I won't ever forget that.  You know, he gave us a little pep talk.  He said, he'd, he'd made the joke, he said, "Oh, you boys are South Carolina," he said, "I'm surprised Strom Thurmond let you all out of the state." You know, like that.  And, and so, it was, it was just, you know, amazing just, we just ran into them on the campus.  And, of course, I was there for his funeral, which was one of the big events of all time.
Speaker 1: Right, right, that was just in sixty--
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968].
Speaker 1: Sixty-eight [1968], yeah, and you're like a sophomore.  Is that right?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So, yeah, that, yeah, that's interesting, you bump into Dr. King.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you ever hear a presentation by Dr. Mays?
Speaker 2: Hear what?
Speaker 1: A presentation by Dr. Mays?
Speaker 2: I, I heard him speak, yeah, over at the chapel a couple of times, yeah.  Yeah, again, extraordinarily gifted speaker and preacher--no question about it.
Story_ID: 673779
Speaker 1: Now in the summer of '67 [1967], you worked with [HistoryMaker] Marian Wright Edelman, right?
Speaker 2: It was the summer of '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Sixty-nine [1969], okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, got the wrong date on here.  But, okay.  So, now she was a veteran of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].  And she was in a process of founding the Children's Defense Fund, right?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  She had a public interest law firm, then called the Washington Research Project, which eventually morphed into the Children's Defense Fund.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she had some lawyers there with her, and there were six of us interns that summer.  And in order to become an intern that, this is, this is kind of funny because they had a competition.  They had a, a class that you had to take, and you had to be one of the top six students to get this intern- internship.  And, of course, I was bound and determined that I, I am going to be one of these interns.  But the, the six students did not include a, a fellow who's from Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], who eventually went because one of the, the girls decided to do something else.  So, he moved up from seventh to sixth (laughter).  And we had a wonderful time.  It was one of the best summers of our lives.  Marian, again, very encouraging, very helpful, and she took me around, introduced me to Ted Kennedy [Edward M. Kennedy], and all these other folks.  You know, just with her, ever--shadowing her, going to talk to politicians or lawyers or whatever.  It was an amazing experience.  And my first plane ride from Atlanta [Georgia] to Washington, D.C.  In fact, I think, except for two of the women, the rest of us, it was our first plane ride.  Yeah, it, it was an exciting time.  We had a really good time.  Out of that crew, I see, Mike [ph.], E.T. [ph.], three of us became lawyers, two Ph.Ds.  The other fellow died early.  But yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That's something, okay.
Story_ID: 673780
Speaker 1: All right.  So, this is the summer of '69 [1969], and so you were in school [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], two, two more years did--now who are some of the professors that you remember in school that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, the head of my department, his name was Edward Sweat [Edward F. Sweat], Dr. Sweat.  He was an old school, erudite kind of fellow.  He, he was funny (laughter).  He, he refused to write a recommendation for me because he said, "You waste your mind in law school."  He says, "Are you serious?"  He says, "They--you're better than that" (laughter).  That's what he said, that's what he said to me.  I said, "Well, Dr. Sweat--." He says, "Not--I won't do it, I won't do it.  You should go get a Ph.D., and do some good in this life" (laughter).  So, 'cause I got recommendations from other folks, but he, he stuck to it, but he said, "I'm not doing it."  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, waste your mind--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And so (laughter), that was his attitude about lawyers, yeah, Dr. Sweat.   He was a, but he was, you know.  Again, I took a couple of classes from him.   He was an excellent professor.  Dr. Brantley [ph.] was there, again, very helpful to me.  He was in my fraternity one time when my, my brother's college finances got a little tough.  I had to contribute some of the money that I made during the summer to him to get him back in school.  So, that left me thin.  And Dr. Brantley heard about it, went out to our graduate chapter there in Atlanta [Georgia], and came back, and gave me money.  I mean, as people helped me, so many people helped me along the way, but I'll never forget him.  He's a terrific guy as well.  There was Dr. McGirt [Paul McGirt].  He taught French and (laughter), French, French was really my Waterloo.  I don't, I don't know what it was, but I, you know, I only made three grades, grades less than A in, in school, in college, and, and those were French.  French one and two and three (laughter) and I, and I was struggling to get those, the B or B plus that I got out of that class, man.  But Dr. McGirt was the French teacher and because I, you know, I had to really, really work hard to, to make those grades.  I came to appreciate Dr. McGirt.  The fourth semester of French, I had a conflict.  I couldn't sign up for Dr. McGirt's class, so I had to go across to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] to take the last semester of French.  I made an A plus (laughter).  The, the woman who was there, she says, "Oh, my god." You know, what happens is if, when you struggle at something, when you really work hard, this stuff gets into you.  You don't recognize it.  It's, it's like, athletics.  When you're, you're pushing those muscles day after day, they're getting stronger and better.  And I got in that class, and I thought it was the simplest thing ever.  I said, "Okay."  He was doing something for me, a discipline of mind that I didn't even recognize, so as I was struggling trying to, trying to get through it.  But, yeah, I, I appreciate those, those Bs as much as I do the A's that I made in school 'cause I, I really had to put in some work for those bad boys.
Story_ID: 673781
Speaker 1: All right.  Yeah, you said there was another professor [at Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] you wanted to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, James Hefner [James A. Hefner].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a young economics professor.  Of course, he came to be quite an expert in labor economics, and was later president of Jackson State University [Jackson, Mississippi], and Tennessee State University [Nashville, Tennessee].  But he was my economics mentor and, again, he saw something in me, and was very, very helpful to me.  And, and I had the privilege of being his friend as well.  We were in the Boule [Sigmi Pi Phi Fraternity] together and some other groups.  And, of course, he was in my, my fraternity, too, as a matter of fact.
Speaker 1: Just, so what fraternity were you in?
Speaker 2: Omega Psi Phi [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you hadn't mentioned that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So, yeah, he, he was definitely a person that I, I looked up to.  I love his, his discipline.  He, he really stayed on the case and on the job.  And, really, you know, academic pursuits, if you, if you master the, the ability to be disciplined, that is to find a, a, like in law school, I--you find a schedule, and you work it religiously day after day.  The results will always come.  And most people break down in that.  They, you know, "I'll do something else today, or I'll do--." You have to be disciplined in your mind and spirit to really achieve the kind of success that you're looking for.  I work with my kids.  That's one of the things I just push, you know, don't be like everybody else, you know, stay laser focused on what you really want.
Story_ID: 673782
Speaker 1: All right, tell us about Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Now, you, so Dr. Henderson [Vivian Wilson Henderson] was, you said, was one of the people that encouraged you to go to Harvard, set your sights high and, so how did that, so, you just applied and got in or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Like I said, Dr. Henderson was very, very helpful and encouraging and, and, and it's good because, you know, the, the woman who was supposed to be my guidance counselor, helping me with this whole process, she was discouraging to, well, you know, "It's, it's, that's just reaching awfully high."  I'm like, I said, "Well, I got test scores, I got good grades.  What--I mean, why, why not?"  And so, I mean, I, you know, I applied to Emory [Emory University School of Law, Atlanta, Georgia], University of South Carolina [University of South Carolina School of Law, Columbia, South Carolina].  I got, I meant, I got in everywhere I applied.  But the thing with Harvard and Yale [Yale Law School, New Haven Connecticut], you can imagine.  What year was this--'71 [1971]?
Speaker 1: Seventy-one [1971], right.
Speaker 2: Anyway, Harvard had $100 application fee.  I mean, that's to me, was--it might as well had been a million (laughter), right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, you know, I sent a little letter, said, "I don't, I don't have $100.  Would you please waive the fee?"  And, of course, they immediately--yes, we made--we waive the fee.  So, my application was received.  And, shortly thereafter, you know, I got a letter saying I'd been admitted.  Then, I was waiting on Yale.  I, in fact, I was leaning toward Yale because of Marian [HistoryMaker Marian Wright Edelman], you know, Marian had gone to Yale.  And one of my fraternity brothers from South Carolina, who's two years ahead of me, was at Yale.  So, I said--and they had smaller classes and stuff so I--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a much smaller law--about maybe the, a fifth of the size--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in terms of class size of Harvard.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, I had, you know, I'm, I'm waiting on them, waiting, waiting.  And then, the first thing I got from them--they put me on the waiting list.  I was frankly insulted by that (laughter).  I was like, "Whoa, man."  So at that, now, okay, I'm going to Harvard, so I made up my mind.  And then, of course, a few weeks later, I got admitted to Yale, but it was too late then.  I, I decided I'm going, I'm going to Harvard, so that's how that happened.
Story_ID: 673783
Speaker 1: Now, when you entered Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], I think it was like a big class, one of the biggest classes of African Americans, is that true--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, there was, you know, the total class size was six hundred.  They divided it into four sections, but there were sixty plus black students, and that was a huge, a huge class.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, and everyone had seen 'The Paper Chase' and the opening day of Harvard Law School--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --and everybody look for each other--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: So, was it like, a shark tank or something or was it more or was it easier than that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No.  It was--the first year is a tough year.  It's very, very competitive.  You know, my son [A. Benjamin Spencer] went there.  They've changed now.  It's kind of mellowed a little bit, but, you know, the, the first year grades make or break you.  I mean, everybody knows that.  And so, you know, you just have to knuckle down.  The, the big problem was we had, like six courses.  There's a little seminar that you take where you learn how to write memos and briefs, and that kind of stuff.  But there were six core courses.  And they'd had like, practice exams in the middle of the year, but not really.  So, it really, everything depended on those exams at the end of the year.  And it's a lot of pressure, you know, six, three or four hour exams, determine everything.  So, you have to really stay true to your process, and that's when discipline comes in.  I--and I had a process.  I mean, in class, how I prepared for it.  My exercise, I, I played basketball every (laughter), day after class.  Immediately after class, I was at basketball.  I'd do an hour, an hour and a half, playing basketball, and then, a dinner.  And then my, my schedule of preparation for the next day.  And for the whole year, I mean, that's, that's what I did.  And, and that, that paid off.  I mean, at the end of the year, I got good grades and after, you know, after the first year, you know, it's really a glide.  It's, things got easier.  First year is tough.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, you're, after class, you played basketball, had dinner, then you had a study schedule?
Speaker 2: I had a study schedule, which took me to, usually around midnight.  I mean, and I, you know, I may take a break for a drink of water of something.  But basically, I was, if I'm preparing for contracts, I do my reading for contracts, read the cases, brief the cases, and so on, and then, move to the next subject, you know.  And however long it took to make sure I was ready for the next day.  And the way it works, you know, this, the method that they used, the case method, they ask you the questions.  And then, you know, the questions get more and more difficult.  Then you answer the question, they'll ask you another question, right? This whole Socratic Method thing.  And if you were unprepared, you know, again, I can't imagine why anybody would be unprepared.  But if you were unprepared, they had chairs on the back walls.  You couldn't sit in it--'cause in the, the way the classrooms are set up, that kind of theatre style, and the professor would have your name with the chair.  I mean, you'd be identified, you know, "Mr. Spencer [HistoryMaker James R. Spencer], could you tell us what's going on with this case?"  So, if you're unprepared, you sat in the back.  They were called back benchers, and people actually did that.  I mean, everybody would know (laughter) that you were not prepared that day.  And I, and it was, I, I said, it will never happen to me.  I--there is no way that I will go in a classroom, and sit in the back, and tell the world I'm unprepared for class today.
Speaker 1: So, back benchers weren't--wouldn't be called on--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They would not be called on.
Speaker 1: --'cause they, they were obviously unprepared--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --because it was clear they're obviously not prepared.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was just, I was aghast at the whole thought.  I--there's just no way.  So, I was pushed by fear and everything else.  I am not going to be unprepared, so it worked out for me.
Story_ID: 673784
Speaker 1: So, who were some of the students, some of the students that were there with, with you, and who were some of the like--well, let's start with students first.  Then we'll talk about the professors.
Speaker 2: Let's see.  Some of the students--
Speaker 1: Usually always some notable people that--
Speaker 2: I am trying to, you know, notable people.  I don't know if I can think about is something notable in my class.  There, there were, you know, there are people who have done extremely well.  I mean, there was--one guy became the governor of Louisiana.  One guy became the governor of Mississippi.  You know, there, there are people who are political.  Congressman, Chuck Schumer was in my class, the senator from New York.  Let me know, when at Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], there's kinda, you know, we don't consider that exceptional (laughter).  They've done well, everybody's done well.  And then, you have, there are people at the school and, for instance, what's the fellow who's the chair at American Express [American Express Company]?  Oh, man, his name is escaping me--Ken, oh, jeez
Speaker 1: I know who you're talking--Chenault [Kenneth Chenault].
Speaker 2: Yeah, Chenault, yeah, yeah.  He, he wasn't in my class, but he was there at the same time that I was.  And there were some guys who were doing J.D., M.B.As., [HistoryMaker] Peter Bynoe, they, they bought the Denver Broncos and not, not the Broncos, the basketball team--
Speaker 1: The Nuggets [Denver Nuggets]--
Speaker 2: The Nuggets, right.  And, you know, they said, people do, tend to do very, very well.  Lots of judges and politicians, and so on.  And, you know, most of my friends went into, went into law firms, became partners at big firms, and did very well.  The guys from Atlanta [Georgia], a couple of them went into politics, but most of them were firm lawyers, too.  Yeah, so, we, we, you know, we all did all right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, what about the professors?  Did you have a favorite--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right
Speaker 1: I know--well, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Well, I can think of two.  Arthur Miller [Arthur R. Miller] taught civil procedure--brilliant guy.  Wright-Miller ['Federal Practice and Procedure,' Charles Wright and Arthur R. Miller] was at the time, and still is the text.  They wrote with Charles Alan [Charles Alan Wright], who's out of the University of Texas [University of Texas School of Law, Austin, Texas].  And so, I really enjoyed his class.  He is a powerful intellect.  He had the, the humor, and I, I looked forward to going to his class.  And I, and I did well in there.  And so, years later, my son [A. Benjamin Spencer] went to Harvard, also had Miller as his instructor, and, again, did very well.  So, I guess a couple years ago, I read the--an article where he was quoting my son's law review [Harvard Law Review] articles, right?  So, I, I sent him a note, you know, talking about what a world we live in, whoever would thought that I sat in his class, my son sat in the class, and now, he's quoting in his article some of my son's stuff.  And my son's an expert in civil procedure.  He's a law professor at the University of Virginia [University of Virginia School of Law, Charlottesville, Virginia].  So, he's had a, you know, kind of an impact on the family.  And there was a constitutional law professor, Paul Freund [Paul A. Freund].  He's now deceased.  But he, he reached out to me, and asked to be his research assistant, which is a, you know, it's a big deal.  And, again, he wrote the text.  He's a big, big time guy in constitutional law, and he was a, a mentor.  He was a very, a very nice guy.  The best part of working for him was just sitting and talking to him, giving me insight about the law, and what was going to happen in, in the career to come.  So, those are, those are the two people who had quite an effect on me.
Story_ID: 673785
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you clerk for any judges?
Speaker 2: I, I did not.  And, again, it's a, it's almost a cultural thing.  I didn't know anything about clerking.  I had no idea.  Professor Freund [Paul A. Freund] said to me one day--I'm, you know, sitting in his office.  I just turned over a memo.  He says, "Well, who are you clerking for next year?"  I was like, "What are you talking about?" (Laughter) I, I--nobody ever said a word to me about being a law clerk.  Of course, now is, you know, they've got a process available.  They've got somebody on the faculties responsible for helping you get stuff.  Nobody said a one word to me about being a law clerk.  And I think it would have a very good thing, a very good thing 'cause I, I think it's very helpful, I know, to the young lawyers that I brought through.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, that, I would have thought there would have been just something that, yeah, 'cause I've never been to law school, but I thought that it was something everybody expected to do, you know.
Speaker 2: Not for me--I didn't know anything about it.  And I've talked to some other black students who expressed the same notion.  I mean, I guess if you're from that world if you're, but for me, well, I, I had no idea.
Speaker 1: So, what kind of work did you do in the, you know, when you were there [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?  I mean, other than go to school, did you have a position--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You mean, outside job or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, or internships or anything else like that?
Speaker 2: No.  I mean, the first year, I, I got a job.  And, of course, they tell you not to get a job, but when you need a job, you need a job.  So, I got this job as a kind of a night watchman at an office building type deal, which turned out to be perfect because all I had to do was, you know, every hour, go around and punch these little clocks to make sure everything was okay in it.  And everything was always okay.  And then, the rest of the time, I could, I could study.  So, that, that was a good job.  Let's see--one summer I was a counselor in kind of a pre-law program, did that.  I enjoyed that, and then, another summer, I, I worked at a law firm.  And then, I worked at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society [Atlanta Legal Aid Society, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia].  And all that was good and I, you know, enjoyed those things.  And they, they help you try to understand what it is that you might want to do when you're finished.  I figured out early on, I didn't want to work in a big law firm.  I did that in the summer and I didn't like it, I didn't like it at all, so.
Speaker 1: But the Atlanta Legal Aid Society, you liked that, I take it, 'cause you, okay--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I did, I mean, you got a lot of responsibility early.  I, I had a lot of fun doing that.  I had, you know, a [U.S.] military obligation I knew I was going to have to deal with then so--
Story_ID: 673786
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, you were in an ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] in college at Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  So, all right, yeah, you go to the, the [U.S.] Army, I guess, right? Was it the Army--(simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, did, did the Army.  And I, again, I, I think I was--I am--I don't think, I know, I'm one of the most blessed people in the world.  I, I had to ask for, and get, what's called excess leave to go to law school.  And, of course, the war was going on at the time and--
Speaker 1: Vietnam [Vietnam War], yeah--
Speaker 2: Right.  And so, you know, everybody said, "Well, you can ask, but there's no chance they're going to give you that."  So, I, you know, I send this letter off to the Pentagon [Arlington, Virginia], you know, I've been admitted to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I'd like to go, and I'll take care of my obligation later on and stuff.  And, sure enough, I got a letter a few weeks later, said, you know, your request has been granted.  I mean, it was amazing, yeah, so, so I did, you know.  And, and by the time I, you know, when I finish law school, I could transfer to the JAG branch [Judge Advocate General's Corps], again.  Talk about being blessed, you know, in order to be transferred to the JAG branch, you had to be admitted to the bar, right.  So, normally, the process is you graduate from law school in May or June.  You take the bar in July.  You get your results in October.  That's, that's how it normally works.  That wouldn't work for me because, by then, I'd be off to wherever (laughter) in another branch.  So, and so, I'm considering this.  I'm like, boy, I am going to get tied up, and not be able to transfer over to the JAG branch.  And when, out of the blue, one of the guys I work with at the Atlanta Legal Aid [Atlanta Legal Aid Society, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia] during the summer, he called me, he says, "Are you going to take the bar in February?"  I said, "I haven't graduated yet."  He said, "Well, it doesn't matter.  You can do it in Georgia.  You can take the bar before you graduate.  They won't certify until you have graduated, but you can take it in February."  I got two weeks' notice.  Again, at the time, I thought it was a curse, but it's a blessing because I didn't have time to get worried, or scared, or I spent $1,500 on a bar prep (laughter).  I just took it.  I just went down without any preparation, and took the bar exam, and miracle of miracles, I passed.  And I got my results, like in May.  So, I transferred branches, and the rest is history.  That, again, my God has been very, very good to me.
Story_ID: 673787
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were ready, so you had to go to, what they call the Judge Advocate General school [The Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and School]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --right at--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Charlottesville [Virginia], right.
Speaker 1: Charlottesville, okay--
Speaker 2: Its over at UVA [University of Virginia] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --in 1975?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you were an honor grad?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, okay, so, now, you're able to deal with the cases in the [U.S.] military, court martial cases and that sort of thing--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, right, yeah, you're, you know, trained in budget procurement, civil affairs, criminal law, all kinds of areas over at the school.  And, again, it was good.  I enjoyed my time over in Charlottesville.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you never had to go to Vietnam in the JAG Corps [Judge Advocate General's Corps] or anything like that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --no, no Vietnam service.
Speaker 1: All right, and you served until what--'78 [1978]?
Speaker 2: In, in the active JAG, yeah, but I was in the reserves [U.S. Army Reserve] until I went on the bench.  So, I had sixteen years of active and reserve service.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So, you were active from '75 [1975] to '78 [1978] and then, the rest were reserve?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So, any stories from those days?
Speaker 2: From the--oh, man (laughter), there were more stories than you can shake a stick at--from the JAG days?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Nah, again, it was very, very good.  I, I went, first of all, to Fort Dix, New Jersey.  And so, I, I get there, and get into the JAG office.  As they do, they did in those days, the new folk, they assign me to the defense shop, defending guys in, in criminal cases.  And at that time, the structure of a JAG office would be the staff judge advocate at the top, deputy staff judge advocate, the, the chief of justice, usually a major by rank, and then, the captains who would be trial lawyers, trial counsel, which is a prosecutor or defense lawyers.  And so, everybody had the same boss.  I mean, you could see how that's not a good system.  You, your--the prosecutors and the defense lawyers work for the same guy.  That's not, but, and so, I go in.  I have, I was talking to the SJA [staff judge advocate].  My recollection was four cases, but he said he was five.  He--this is the guy who was the boss.  I talked to him after, many years later, but, anyway, I won four straight cases.  My recollection is four.  I won the cases.  So, I came in after the fourth victory, and there was a note on my desk, telling me to go over to the prosecutor side.  They just (laughter)--I was too good to be a defense lawyer (laughter) in their minds.  So, they sent me over to the prosecutor's side, so I was a prosecutor for a while.  And I, I've always enjoyed the trial work.  It's, it's, it really is my thing.  And so, very quickly, I moved up in that office, became the chief of justice.  I was a captain, but I was sitting in the major spot.  So, I, I enjoyed that to no end.  I did spend a year in Germany trying to undo (laughter) the system that I described to you earlier.  Somebody finally realized that, that didn't make any sense for the prosecutors and the defense lawyers to be in the same shop.  So, they had decided they wanted to set up an independent defense corps, right, another shop completely independent.  And so, they started that in Germany, and I went to Germany to do that, to set up the defense shop.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 673788
Speaker 1: So, you were there for a year.  It's during the, in, and you were in--where, where in Germany, in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Wurzburg--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Germany, yeah.  And it, that was a good experience.  It's, it's kind of, you know, I didn't have my family and that's, it was tough, you know, being away from your folks for a while.  But the good thing about it--boy, I got to see all of Europe.  You get on the train, and go anywhere you want to go.  It was a, it was interesting.  I got to practice my French (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, were you married by then?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when did you get married, and how did you meet your wife?
Speaker 2: Well, I've been married twice.  So, I'll tell you about my current wife [Margaret Spencer].  I, I met her in 1978.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we, we met, we were both working at the U.S. attorney's office and that, you know, blossomed.  And we got married in eighty- '82 [1982].  But, yeah, my first wife, we were together at Fort Dix [New Jersey].  We met in, in school.  And so, I was in Germany and, and she was the principal of the elementary school at Fort Dix, and stayed at Fort Dix.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, did you have children by your first wife and--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have three kids--one by my second wife.
Story_ID: 673789
Speaker 1: So when you come back in 1978.  You're, you work as an assistant attorney general for the District of Columbia, right?
Speaker 2: Assistant United States attorney, not attorney general.
Speaker 1: Okay.  They got it wrong here.  I'm sorry, assistant U.S. attorney--that make more sense.  All right.  So, what was going on in--this is Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: This is, so what was going on in D.C. in those days?  And when I hear, I see, here's a note that you were the first African American assigned to the major crime division of the U.S. attorney's office.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, it was a, it was a great time.  It was an exciting time to be in D.C. to be a young lawyer.  There are probably, at that time, 165 thereabouts assistant U.S. attorneys.  And there may have been ten to fourteen African Americans, and these were highly coveted jobs.  I--you cannot imagine the competition just to get the job.  And then, when you got into the job, they had a kind of a developmental pattern and you're in misdemeanor trials, the appellate division, felony one, felony two's, rather, and then, felony one's, and that, and the, the different, different thing about Washington, D.C. is the local court, Superior Court [Superior Court of the District of Columbia] is a federal court, 'cause of Washington, D.C.  But they also have the federal side, right, which is the--across the street.  So, they start you out in Superior Court and, you know, it's--you may be there forever.  I mean, it's--that's could be where you are.  But I, I went in and started working and, and I quickly got up to trying felonies, and because I had experience when I came there.  So, Chuck Ruff [Charles Ruff] was the United States attorney, not the one that hired me.  That was Earl Si- Silbert [Earl J. Silbert].  But Chuck Ruff was U.S. attorney when I was trying these felonies.  And he came in the courtroom, and he saw me trying a case.  He called me up.  He says, "I want you to come on over to major crimes over in federal court." Unheard of for somebody at my age and time in the office.  I was like, "Great."  So, I, I went over there--we, you know, all the case, Abscan [ph.] all the big cases you ever heard of, come out of this division.  We did big time investigations, and I got to be right in the middle of that.  I tried a lot of big cases, newsworthy stuff, you know, your name gets to be known--that kind of thing.  We--my wife [Spencer's second wife, Margaret Spencer] and I--and she's from this area.  We're not happy with the traffic in D.C.  The final straw, I think, I don't know if you remember this.  There was a Florida, Florida Air [sic. Air Florida] crash on the 14th Street Bridge.  It was in a snowstorm--it was a big, big deal.  Well, and a couple of people on the bridge were killed when the plane went down, and it went down in the Potomac [River].  Well, my wife and I were a couple of cars away trying to get home in that snow when that plane went down, right.  We, we left the office at three o'clock in the afternoon.  We got home, like at two a.m. in the morning, a, a day I'll never forget.  You know, I keep turning the car on to get warm, and you turn it off to, to maintain the gas.  It was, it was a traumatic day for us.  So, the next day, my wife says, "I don't want to be here."  I, she says, "I, I don't like this D.C. thing.  We need to think of something else."  And, and that's when we thought about Richmond [Virginia].  We went to Charleston [South Carolina].  We went to Charlotte [North Carolina].  We went to a couple of places, looked around, so on a weekend.  But because she was from this area, we decided on Richmond so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So.
Speaker 1: This is 19--
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-three [1983], I came, and I, basically, got a job as U.S., at the U.S. attorney's office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia].  She got a job in the attorney general's office and, and, you know, we, we started from there so, it's been good.
Story_ID: 673790
Speaker 1: All right, 1983, you moved to Richmond [Virginia].  You're assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, what are some of the highlights of that position?
Speaker 2: Well, when I came to Richmond, obviously, I was a very, very experienced federal prosecutor.  I tried just about any case you could imagine--big cases.  And so, when I came to Richmond, it was very different.  It was--first of all, smaller, slower.  They, I didn't think were as aggressive as we were in, in the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.] in running our investigations, and so on.  So, I came in, you know, I was used to doing things one way, and I kept doing them that way.  And, as a result, the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] agents, and the DA [District Attorney] agents, and the other folks, they gravitated toward me because they knew if they brought a case to me, I would take it, and become the bulldog, and run with it.  And so that, I, I started, once again, getting the bigger cases.  And I've always loved trying cases.  It, it's a real drama, and it's a, it's a gift to be able to handle everything that goes on in a trial.  I enjoy that.  And so, things were going along like that.  As I said, I had probably four or five--I mean, mega cases, the kind of things where everybody is talking about it day after days on the front page of the newspaper, and so on.  So, in this smaller pond, my name became very well known.  And I, I, to this day, believe that's one of the reasons why I ended up getting appointment to this job because let's face it, in order to be appointed United States district court judge, you got to either know a U.S. senator, or he's got to know you.  There's no other way.  They, they have to make that nomination, that request to the president.  And so, that's what happened with me.  You know, John, John Warner called me up and asked me, would I come see him?  And I thought, what does he want to talk to me about?  And so, I get up there, and then I find out.  He said, "Look, I've been following you, and we are all impressed," and all of that.  "I'd like for you to do this."  And I was like, wow, and, of course, I'm thirty-six years old.  I, I'm thinking, wow, this is, you know, I, I really kind of--
Speaker 1: This is not, this is shortly after you--well, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's only three years after I, yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --eighty-five [1985], yeah, yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --three years after I got here, right.  And as I said, I'm a very young person.
Story_ID: 673791
Speaker 1: I have a note here that you were also at Howard University School of Divinity [Washington, D.C.], same period of time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, right, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: So, okay.
Speaker 2: So, yeah, I just really, yeah, I think, then, I was, yeah, part of that time, I was driving back,  and, you know, I'd go on the weekends and evenings to Howard to, so it was a hectic time.  But I, I did not see this, this appointment coming.  I, I didn't--
Speaker 1: Now, how did you get involved with the divinity school?  How did you decide to pursue that?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I became, you know, I was always religious, and I, I am religious.  I became involved with the church that my wife [Spencer's second wife, Margaret Spencer] attended up in Arlington [Virginia].  I just loved the church, loved the people, you know, and once again, the people are always calling on me for speaking, and that kind of thing, which I did.  And so, at some point, I, you know, I, I felt like I had a call to the ministry, and so, I believe, you know, like anything else, you need to be trained.  So, I, I went over to the school.  So, that's, that's what that was about, but I, I kept practicing law the whole time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well, Howard divinity school is one of the, you know, notable divinity schools in the black community--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and who was there when you--
Speaker 2: Lawrence Jones [Lawrence N. Jones] was the dean, a big, big supporter of mine.  He was, he's a great guy--he, he really was.  I was so impressed with him, down to earth, and just like Dr. Henderson [Vivian Wilson Henderson], he'd, he'd find the student that you think is, you know, capable of doing something.  He, he was right there trying to push me along, so he was, Dean Jones was outstanding.  My--the professor that I remember the most, Cain Felder.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Cain Hope Felder, right.
Speaker 2: Yep, also a South Carolinian by the way.  We're very proud of our, our history, but he taught New Testament in Greek.  And I took the Greek from him, and it was, it was funny in a way because we started out with probably--I don't know, sixteen, seventeen students in the class.  I believe six finished (laughter).  I mean, Greek is nothing to play with, believe me, but anyway, I, I enjoyed his class.  Again, the discipline of mine, he's an extraordinary intellect.  He really is a wonderful guy, but is, he's so smart.  I admire his intellect.  And I won the Greek prize, you know, for the, for the highest grade in the Greek class, and I was very proud of that.  I--the--what they give you is a copy of the New Testament in Greek, which I have at home.  Yeah, and, and it's helpful, you know, the Bible, like anything else, is a translation, right.  And so, it's always good to go back to the, to the base language, so that you can have your own understanding.  I, I'll give you a very good example of this.  The word kai, K-A-I, in Greek, can be translated as "and" or "but"--right.  Now, if you have a sentence, like the Queen of Sheba was black, but calmly, versus black and calmly, right, like a beautiful versus--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --you get the difference?  Yeah.  So, you have to--
Speaker 1: One implies that black is a--
Speaker 2: It's an exceptional thing.
Speaker 1: Exceptional thing, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --that she's beautiful.  And the other, it inquires that this is the description.
Speaker 1: --just a description, black and calmly, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  Stevie Wonder had a song, 'Living for the City.'  He made that mistake.  It says Minnies black, but she is sho 'nuff pretty.  Right?  I said, if I ever get to talk to Stevie, I'm going to say, you made one mistake in your career (laughter).  You, you used the wrong conjunction.
Story_ID: 673792
Speaker 1: So you finished Howard divinity school [Howard University School of Divinity, Washington, D.C.] in '85 [1985].
Speaker 2: Eighty-five [1985].
Speaker 1: And then the very next year, or the same year, I don't know, was it the same year--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It was, it was the next year that I got, got into the job.
Speaker 1: You were appointed federal judge by Senator John Warner of Virginia right?
Speaker 2: Well, the appointment comes from the president, Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan], but John Warner made the nomination or the recommendation (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Nomination--recommendation, okay, all right, all right.  So, wow you're thirty-six years old, and you're a, not only a judge, but a federal judge, so--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, that's, and it is, it's awesome.  And as I say, I'm a blessed individual, man.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how did, now, right in town here, now the seat that you--well, the seat that you filled was vacated by John MacKenzie [John Ashton MacKenzie], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what was he, how was he disposed toward the, you know, service?  I mean, I, you know, I, I know you were one of the first black--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I was the first.  Yeah, see, what happened was, yeah, I was to replace John MacKenzie.  He was sitting in the Norfolk [Virginia] division of my court [U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]--see, we have four divisions, Norfolk, Newport News [Virginia], Richmond [Virginia], and Alexandria [Virginia].  So, he was in Norfolk, and that's where I was going to go.  I--my wife [Spencer's second wife, Margaret Spencer] and I, excuse me, went down to--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION).
Speaker 2: My wife and I went down to Norfolk looking for a place to live, and looking at schools, you know, the whole deal.  And then, suddenly, one of the judges here in Richmond died, Dortch Warriner [David Dortch Warriner].  He was fifty-seven, fifty-eight years old, and had a heart attack and died.  And so, I took his spot here in Richmond.  I never went to, to Norfolk.  So, that's how I ended up here in Richmond.  It's a, you know, it's a--Dortch Warriner, the judge who died, I was talking to him after I got nominated.  And he says, you know, it's like, you know, almost like being struck by lightning--it, (laughter), to become a federal judge.  I mean, it's a, you know, it just doesn't happen every day.  So I, I was very blessed, and I appreciate John Warner, who had the courage to make the recommendation, and stick with it.  He--I rank him very high as a politician, one of the few folks in that business that I've got a lot of respect for because, you know, we shook hands on it.  You know, he says, you know, "If you can hang tough, I can hang tough."  We shook, and he did.
Story_ID: 673793
Speaker 1: It was not easy.  You know, a lot of folk, you know, were upset with him because I was not an identifiable Republican, you know.  And, and a lot of time, they looked at this job as a patronage kind of thing, and, and I didn't fit in that category.  I got a lot of criticism from the congressmen down there in the Tidewater area [Virginia], not happy with the fact that it was me.  There were folk who were not happy with my age--too young, you know, that kind of thing.  So, you know, it was a lot of stress along the way.  And a lesser man would have, might have pulled out.  John Warner hung in there because he gave me his word, and he did.  So, I, I'll forever respect him for that.  And, you know, all I needed was an opportunity and--
Speaker 2: Now, did he give you like a reason for why he chose you 'cause all those other way, all those other factors you mentioned, are pressure points--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, well--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --political insider, a guy that's the son or grandson of somebody, or somebody's nephew--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, I'll, I'll tell you what I know, what I know about it.  There had been a, an effort to get an African American on this bench [U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia], right?  The, the black bar, they had meetings with the senators, with the governor.  They interfaced with the majority bar.  There had been efforts, and one fellow under Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] was going through the process, ran into tax problems, right.  Then, there was another fellow, who's a politician, that had been considered.  And there were issues that didn't work out for him.  So, they, but there was still this pressure, and [HistoryMaker] Elaine Jones, who, as you know, was head of the NAACP Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.].  She was very active in that process as well.  And so, they--and I say, they--the black bar, they came to me, and asked me would I be interested in doing it?  And, of course, I pointed out to them all of the negatives.  I said, "Look, I'm too young.  I mean, I, I just can't imagine that somebody my age--I'm, I'm not, I wasn't born in Virginia.  You know, I'm, I'm new to Richmond [Virginia]," you know, all these things.  And, and they'll like, "Well, you know, this can work to your advantage because you haven't made enemies, you know, you're young, but your experience level is, is very high.  You've done a lot of things that people who have been around for twenty-five years haven't done."  I told you, I tried mega cases.  And so, I said--"Well, hey," if, I, I, first, I suggested a couple of other people.  And they're all like, "Well, you know, they got issues."  One of the things about being young in the process, I hadn't time, had time to develop issues, right (laughter)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No baggage yet.
Speaker 1: I, yeah, I didn't have.  So, I said, okay.  I mean, you know, I'll do it.  And, then, subsequently, I, I got the call.  So, I think a part of it was the pressure that was being put on that caused them to turn to me.  And, and I'm, I'm grateful for being in the right place at the right time.
Story_ID: 673794
Speaker 1: Now, Oliver Hill [HistoryMaker Oliver W. Hill], the, the great--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --advocate for, during the days of desegregation, he, he lived here in Richmond [Virginia] and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How did he feel about what did, what did he?  Do you know him--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He--I did know him, and he, he loved every minute of it.  I spoke to him.  In fact, he made a trip by to see me specially.  And he said, I just want to know, you know, we're talking like you and I are talking about my background, and so on.  We had a long talk.  And Mr. Hill was an awesome, awesome individual.  I, oh, my god, do I respect him.  I got to know him very, very well.  We were, again, in the same fraternity [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity], in the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] together.  And he had a place of honor at my installation.  He came up when I was introduced to the judiciary committee [United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary].  In fact, I had the--Doug Wilder [HistoryMaker L. Douglas Wilder], Strom Thurmond and John Warner introduce me to the judiciary committee.  Now, that's, that's a feat in itself, but, yeah, he was very supportive and very happy that it finally happened.
Story_ID: 673795
Speaker 1: So, how did you feel at the, at the onset of this?  Did you--I mean, you're going to be a judge.  Now, you've been on the other side, as a--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Oh, no, I, I was, I was really looking forward to it.  You know, my challenge was the civil side of the docket.  I had, I had no concern about the, the criminal side.  I mean, I was completely able to handle that without any problem.  But I had tried a couple of civil cases, but that was not my, my area of expertise.  And the civil side of this job is the big part of it.  I mean, it's--I would say, eighty percent civil, seventy five percent civil like that, and the civil is complex.  We're talking patent, trademark, you know, these are specific fields of endeavor that people take years to understand and, and know.  So, I had to really get into that.  And my very first time on the bench, my very first case, the very day I walked out, and the newspapers were there.  They took note of it, right.  It was a patent case, a patent case.  But, like anything else, you can learn.  And so, you know, by the middle part of my tenure, I'm considered one of the experts in the area of intellectual property.  So, we got a hold of it.  It's been good for me 'cause I'm a lifelong learner.  I love to read.  I, I write and, and speak well, always have, and so, that's, that's what a judge does.  I mean, you know, you write to explain your holdings or findings in cases.  And you run the courtroom.  It's, it's a--I, I've enjoyed it.  It's been the best possible job for me.  I can't imagine anything better.
Story_ID: 673796
Speaker 1: What was that first patent case?  Can you tell us?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.  I can't think of the name of it.  It was, it was a Japanese company versus a California company.  I can't, I can't--it is escaping me now.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  I know, later, much later on, you were involved in a high profile Research in Motion [BlackBerry Limited] patent case [NTP, Inc. v. Research in Motion, Ltd., 2005].
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it was a, at the time, probably the biggest patent case in, in the history of America, and it was an important case.  You know, Research In Motion, RIM, the Canadian company was sued by the fellow [Thomas J. Campana, Jr.] who was the inventor of this particular technology.  And, of course, the Blackberry, at the time, was a major deal.  Everybody (laughter), including all the congressmen, every U.S. senator, everybody had a Blackberry.  So, there was a lot of concern from, on the political side, from the population about whether or not I was going to grant an injunction and, and shut Blackberry down.  We had a trial, a very long trial, very involved and complicated--lots of drama.
Speaker 1: Now, what did they claim that, what part of the Blackberry device did they claim ownership of--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, it, it, the, the function, which pushed an SM message [short message service]--I mean, it's hard to explain, but it, it pushed this SM message to the other side.  That technology, which created the ability to do that, in its simplest form, and the, the jury found that this guy had definitely invented that, and that they were infringing on his patent.  So, then, the question becomes what you do about it--the damages and injunctive relief.  Now, as I tried the entire time, I tried to get the parties to settle because it just made sense.  If you're the Blackberry company, you know, you were, got a $10 billon business, and your name is the identity of the business.  It's like Xerox [Xerox Corporation].  When you, when you are running the deal, you need to make all the money that you can while you can.  So, pay this guy off.  Let, and, and, believe me, he would have taken five or ten million dollars and run away.  However, they wanted to fight.  They just, they just insisted on fighting and so, we went to trial.  They lost at trial, you know, they got new lawyers and went on appeal.  They lost again, right.
Story_ID: 673797
Speaker 1: And so, ultimately, it's back to me to decide the, the damages [in NTP, Inc. v. Research in Motion, Ltd., 2005].  And so, so, you have the--it's interesting, the psychology of these things.  Now, like I said, they were fight, fight, fight--that was their whole attitude.  So, I told them, like on a Tuesday, I believe it was, I said, "I'm going to issue an opinion on Friday afternoon."  And I told them, "I've already written the opinion.  I will let it go on Friday."  So, they called back on Wednesday.  They're all up in New York--said, "We're talking, can you hold off?"  "No, no, four o'clock on Friday, this opinion goes out, and it is what it is."  They call me Friday morning, "Please give us more time."  "No, you're not going to get any more time."  And so, at about one or two o'clock. I got word that they'd settled--almost a billion dollars (laughter).  Yeah.  And so, I never had to--nobody knows to this day whether they was going to be enjoined or not.  So, I don't even tell people what the result would have been, but the fact is they settled for a whole lot of money, and they kept on making the Blackberry, so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Blackberry is not using--
Speaker 1: I know.  Yeah, that's, you know, your time window is short, no matter what the product is, sooner or later, something else better, bigger, you know, will come along, so you need to, and they had a long run, but anyway.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think, the president [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] had a Blackberry when he started.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, yeah, Blackberry is not what they used to be.  But those guys who own that company--I think one owns the Detroit Red Wings [sic.] and, you know, they did all right.
Speaker 2: And what were, any other cases that stand out to you that--
Speaker 1: I don't know.  I, you know, I've had a lot of, a lot of really big cases.  I guess, the very last one I had was a case, a criminal case against the former Governor McDonnell [Bob McDonnell].
Speaker 2: Oh McConnell, Bob McConnell [sic.]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That's probably the--yeah, the last high profile case I had.  That was a tough case, as they all are at that level of news scrutiny and so on, but, eventually, it worked its way through the system.
Speaker 2: What--he had some gifts or something that he, when he--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was taking gifts and, again, it was a little bit complicated than that, but that was the gist of it.  The whole thing was unfortunate 'cause I, you know, I think all the--everybody involved are decent people.  People do things, you just never know.
Story_ID: 673798
Speaker 1: But I think I read that you, you tried to make sure that, that black folks were represented in juries and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, no, that was--
Speaker 1: Which common practice around here is not to have black jurors--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That was one of the things early on, or a number of things that I tried to correct.  And I think I have, to some extent.  We increased the, the diversity of the pool, you know, where you're looking to, you know, voter registration rolls, but also motor registration rolls, right.  You involve more people in your, in your pool.  And so, you get more diversity, and that has certainly happened over time.  And, of course, I was chief judge, and so I had the power to do a lot of things like that to get some, some equity in the system.  And I, I think we've done a real good job.  I, I had a problem with the diversity in, in employment in the court houses in my district.  You know, when I first came in, to show how bad it was, you know, I had a, one of the things that I did, I would bring kids in, to speak to them, you know, elementary school kids or high school kids, or whatever.  So, I, one day, I had a third grade class, eight years old.  You know, they take them around to the Marshal's office [U.S. Marshals Service], and show them the whole process and fingerprints and, you know, all these other things.  And they enjoy a little tour and some, and then, they come back, and I talk to them.  So, they came back to my courtroom, and I give them a little spill.  And so, then one little boy held up his hand.  I said, "Yes, sir?"  He stood up, he said, "Well, can black people work up in here?"  You're talking to me.
Speaker 1: You're in here already but--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.  But they've gone around to the clerk's office, and probation, and the marshals.  And at that time, when I was, I came in this, when I was in the U.S. attorney's office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia], it was just me.  There were two probation officers.  There were two marshals, and that was it.  Hundreds of employees and so, when he said that to me, I said, "That'll never happen again."  So, the way I dealt with that, I wasn't even chief yet.  I called all of the unit heads in, head of probation, marshal.  I told them, "Look," I said, "I'm going to be grading you annually, and what I think of your, what you're doing.  And primary among the criteria for this grade is how diverse is your employee list."  And I told them all that.  Well, it worked (laughter) because within no time, you know, the marshal would come by and said, "We've got a new guy in today, you know, and here's John Smith."  And the probation says, "Yeah, we've got two new people in, and here they are."  Yeah, you know, it, it takes a little bit of pressure 'cause, you know, it's not that people are, are evil in their heart.  It's just that it's easier to do what you've always done.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And it's easier to find people who are similar to you, right.  So this, it, it takes a little bit of push, a little bit of pressure, but it has worked and I think it's a great thing.  We have a very diverse workforce and I'm very proud of that.
Story_ID: 673799
Speaker 1: Now, you became a chief judge in 2004, right?
Speaker 2: Two thousand four [2004].
Speaker 1: And you were fifty-five.  So, how did this take place and was that as big a surprise as when you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no.  Being chief is, you have to be the senior active judge--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --right, who's less than sixty-five years old.  And so, I knew my time was coming.  And, and it was, it's a good time.  And it's a good time 'cause you, you get that, put, kind of put your, your fingerprints on a lot of things.  And I made substantial changes where I wanted to, and made sure that maybe some of the people who get overlooked, got recognized.  The--we had an African American chief probation, first time, you know.  So, you get to do, do some good, so, and I enjoyed my time as chief.  It was, yeah, a little hectic 'cause you, and I'd go up to Richmond [Virginia], to Alexandria [Virginia] down in Norfolk [Virginia].  And I, I had an office in each division.  But it worked, it worked for me.
Story_ID: 673800
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was going to ask you about the Kemba Smith case--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --which took place down here in the Tidewater area [Virginia].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean in the--
Speaker 2: Well, this is the factual background.  She, she was the girlfriend of a drug dealer, right, and he was a pretty good sized drug dealer.  And, of course, during the investigation, she was identified as his girlfriend.  And there were some times that she ferried the drugs from one place to another, which put her in the conspiracy.  And when they finally, you know, arrested everybody, brought all the people in, and she was brought in as well.  I think she had a child by this drug dealer.  And so, unfortunately for her, the case was handled in, in Norfolk [Virginia].  And the judge who handled her case was in his eighties.  And he gave her a sentence, which I don't think anybody in their rational mind would think is fair.  I believe it was twenty-four years, I believe that was the sentence.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think about it.  If I remember correctly, the circumstances were that she was a student at Hampton [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], had met this fellow at a party or someplace.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And they, and she was afraid after he started courting her, she was afraid to--he threatened her actually, stay with him or else--
Speaker 2: Well, I, I'm, there may be that, yeah, that may be some of that but--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I, I don't know about--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --about that kind of glean on it.  But the fact was she was, indeed, guilty of being involved in the conspiracy 'cause it, it only takes one thing.  And she did multiple things, but the, the basic deal is the sentence was way too harsh--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --way too harsh.  I mean, unbelievable.  So, you know, it went through the system.  And she, there she is in jail stuck with a twenty-four year sentence.  And then, some people started, you know, trying to do something to help her, and I certainly was on board on that.  I, I mean, I just thought it was an unfair sentence.  And I did what I could in the background on, on that issue.  I was really happy that she got some relief, but there are a whole lot of folks, who got sentences like hers over the years, who are just now getting relief.  They're getting relief through the political process.  We've had three--I think, believe it's now three, what we call crack reduction rules come through, where people got their sentences reduced, reduced, reduced because they were out of line when they, when they first came along.  The, the beginning of the problem is that of fifty grams of crack cocaine, which you can, you can hold right, like that (gestures) required a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years in jail, period, right?  And you can have five kilos of powdered cocaine, and get a lesser sentence.  I mean, it, it was out, completely out of whack, and of course--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So do you think, that it suggests to many that it's a, that this penalty is tailor made for the black community.
Speaker 2: Well, I can't see reading it any other way.  I mean, what, in order to have crack cocaine, you must first have powder cocaine.  It's a product, and they cook it down, it's a product of cocaine.  So, why would it be treated differently?  You know, it--crack was rampant in the black community, and I'm sure that was, you know, again, some of the thinking when they put the laws together.  That's why now, many years later, and everybody is seeing that this was out of whack.  And it shouldn't have happened like that.  I mean, they, they should have been treated the same.
Story_ID: 673801
Speaker 1: I think, as recently as about two or three months ago, H.R. Haldeman [sic.] said that the, so the war on drugs is really a war on black people, and left people really--
Speaker 2: It doesn't surprise me.  I wasn't in the room, but it seems to me, I can tell you this much.  In my opinion, the war on drugs has been a dismal failure.  I mean, it just doesn't work.  You can't imprison your way to, to a resolution of that problem.
Speaker 1: Now you came in, that was on a federal scene, just as--I guess, pretty much just as crack became like a big problem in Washington, D.C., and on the East Coast.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it was a huge deal when I was there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know they didn't get to Chicago [Illinois] until about 1990, '91 [1991].  It was funny 'cause I can hear the stories about it on the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, it was in D.C.
Speaker 1: --on the radio and stuff, but in D.C., it was like a war zone.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Their whole neighborhood span, where they, they would set up the cars to the entrance to a housing project.  And, you know, you couldn't get in there unless you were somebody that they recognized.  And they would sell the crack cocaine all day, every day.  And some of the drug dealers who started, you know, as, as street guys became huge.  Rayful Edmonds [sic. Rayful Edmond] and Dump Truck Smitty [James Edwood Smith] and guys like that, you know, they, they got to a, a gigantic level.  Of course, they all ended up with, you know, life without patrol eventually.  But they, they were ride--riding high early on there in the D.C. area.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so at any rate, so this was, yeah.  So, at what point, or what juncture does the federal government get involved in these kinds of cases?  Is it, when they cross state lines or what's the--?
Speaker 2: You know, what happened, now, what happened with crack, because it was identified as a major, major issue in urban areas, the, and some of the violence that is associated with the, the crack trade, sort of spilling over into the, the suburbs, and [U.S.] Congress got involved in it.  And, and so, they started passing laws, and increasing penalties, but with a distribution of cocaine or any, any con- control substance, it doesn't have to cross the lines.  And you can, if you do it, that is, you know, sell drugs or transport them, it's a federal offense.
Speaker 1: What's the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it can be, it's a state offense--
Speaker 1: So that's a federal offense on its (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --as well as a federal offense, but the feds can, can take it if they want to.  And, usually, the determining factor is how big the group is, how, how large the supplies they're dealing with.  You know, if it's a small scale thing, the state may take it.  But then, again, in some places, the federal government decided, we're just going to take all these things to the hoop, you know, give everybody a ten year mandatory minimum.  Maybe they'll stop the problems.  So, of course, it didn't, but yeah, and so, it, it's a federal jurisdiction right off the bat.  They're crimes that just apply to that.
Story_ID: 673802
Speaker 1: As a federal judge, do you come in contact with anything in regards to the Black Lives Matter movement?  And I, and I mean police brutality at the local level and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: No, I mean, of course, I've had cases where there have been allegations of excessive force by police officers.  And that's, unfortunately, pretty standard.  I mean, I've seen those over the years.  Cases are very hard to make and there, for a number of reasons.  First of all, the law is difficult for plaintiffs.  There's a, a legal construct called qualified immunity, that is, they want to make sure that you know, you don't do a hindsight thing.  You have to look at this perceptively from the officer's point of view.  And if you take that view, the, the person is entitled to qualified immunity.  And qualified immunity allows the, the judge to end the case before it even gets to a jury.  If you establish qualified immunity, then the jury doesn't even get to, to deal with it.  Then, if the case, if you beat that barrier, which is a, this is a high wall to get over, but if you do get past qualified immunity, then you have the jury to deal with and, as we know, culturally speaking, they are not prone to fine against a police officer.  You know, they, they give the police officer the benefit of every doubt.  He is the steward of their security, and so, it's only the outrageous--I mean, really outrageous cases that make it to a jury, and even and manage to get a jury verdict.  And even then, it's, it's rare.  I haven't seen too many actually make it through.  And there have been a couple where I thought it's clearly excessive force, but the jury didn't agree with me.

Speaker 1: Now, in 2014, you assumed the rank of senior judge.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, what does that--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah--
Speaker 1: --mean you take less cases or--
Speaker 2: --yeah.  What that means is you're over sixty-five, and have been on the bench for more than ten years, you can take senior status.  If you take senior status, you have the choice of doing nothing, zero all the way up to 100 percent if you want.  We have a couple of senior judges who are, you know, still working at a full time rate.  What I did, I cut back to 50 percent on civil at first, then 50 percent completely, then I stopped doing all civil.  So now, I'm just, I'm probably going to stop, stop sitting completely. You know, I've had thirty years in the job, so it's time, time to do something else.  And so, you know, you can be an active senior judge, or inactive senior judge.  You can retire altogether, resign your commission, and do something else.  So, yeah, I'm, I'm leaving in, going to figure out exactly what--I have tons of opportunities.  Everybody's reaching out to me, want to do this, and want to do that.  But, you know, after thirty years, I want to do what I do, so, just, we will see.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have any trepidation about the fact that the administration is changing, and that you woke up, we're going to have, I mean a whole, I mean there may not--I don't know if what kind of person will be nominated these days with the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, see, it, there really doesn't affect me because when I take, took senior status, then they, they nominate and appoint my replacement, so that's already been done.
Speaker 1: A fulltime, okay, all right, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my replacement is Judge Lauck [M. Hannah Lauck] who is here on my court [United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia].  And she clerked for me, so we're, you know, we're close.  I'm, I'm very thrilled that, that she's the person who's replacing me.  Now, if you're about to take senior as some of my colleagues are, one of my colleagues has said to me, you know, he says, I, I can't go now.  I'll have to wait another four years to see 'cause he doesn't want to be replaced by the, by the new administration.  But, you know, you--we, we've lived through these things before.  I mean, we'll, we'll see how it works itself out.
Story_ID: 673804
Speaker 1: Do you have a judicial philosophy?
Speaker 2: Judicial philosophy (laughter)--I don't know that I have a judicial philosophy.  I--judicial philosophy, well, on the criminal side, in violent crime, I think I have been pretty tough when it comes to sentencing folk in that arena.  You know, you make a choice, you, you bring harm to other people.  And I mean, not just physical, but sometime in the fiscal sense.  And these folk, who run a Ponzi scheme and, you know, take $300 million from the people who've been trying to put their life savings away, and live their senior years out, and you steal their money from them.  You know, it might be a white collar crime to somebody, but to me, it's a crime, period, and you should be punished.  And I don't, I don't, I don't hesitate to do that.  We have a drug court program here to help people involved in minor drugs because they're drug users.  I'm all for that, you know, give people a chance to get off drugs, and become constructive members of society.  So, I, I guess I'm--my philosophy threads through this and goes, goes both ways.  On the civil side, I believe that corporations have an obligation to be of fair and good members of their community.  And if not, they need to be punished, and the people who run the corporations need to be punished.  That's one of my things, you know, a corporation gets zapped to, with a criminal charge, you know, they get a $10 million fine.  Well, I mean, that's just doing business.  That's not, to me, that's never been good enough.  The way you change a very bad corporate behavior, it's a deal with the executives.  And that's just one of my things.  I think they need to be called to justice.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a, does religion and the work of a judge intersect at any point?
Speaker 2: You know--
Speaker 1: --since you're a reverend?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it does, you know.  It's the whole idea of being fair and just and, you know, sometimes there's a need for, for mercy and grace.  I see that, and I tried to apply that when it's appropriate.  And there are other times when it's appropriate for, for justice to be the primary reason for sentencing or punishing somebody.  But I, I always try to keep in mind, and no matter how bad the person is who's standing in front of me, that it's a human being.  You know, they've got family, they've got folks who care about them.  I try to treat everybody with respect.  I mean, and I mean, everybody, you know, until you've demonstrated that you can't be trusted with that respect.  I, I believe in doing that.  I insist on that in my courtroom by the way.  I mean, I, I don't, for instance, of course, everybody knows it now, the lawyers don't do it.  When I first started, you know, the lawyer was an older lawyer, usually would say, witnesses on the stand, you know, a black man or a black female, and call them by the first name.  "Well, Lucy, would you tell us this?"  And I, I correct them, you know, "Mrs. Smith, and don't do that."  And, of course over time, everybody had said, they, they know the things that irritate you.  And so, it's, it's, it's good to try to bring fairness and justice to the situation.  And I think I've tried to do that.
Story_ID: 673805
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there anything major that you would do differently if you go, could go back--
Speaker 2: Aw, jeez.
Speaker 1: --to South Carolina and do it all over again--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Naw.  Well, everything I, I tease my law clerks all the time.  When things get tough, you know, I always say, you know, I should have gone to med school [medical school] (laughter).  But, but this is my, this is my mother's [Hannah Ellerbe Spencer] thing, right, this is her dream for me.  She really wanted me to, to do medicine.  And, and that's where I was heading.  And I, and I have the facility for science and, and math.  And so, you know, when I first got to school, that's what I was going to do.
Speaker 1: At Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I didn't realize that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you didn't say anything about it--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: No, no, yeah, I, I, you know, I took organic chemistry, made an A--Dr., Dr. Spriggs [Alfred R. Spriggs].  Yeah--no, I, that's what I was thinking.  And, and, frankly, it was this trip to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and, and [HistoryMaker] Marian Wright Edelman that flipped this for me on that.  I, I was so impressed and, and I thought, you know, the, the reach that the law has--I, I said, well, boy, you know, this, this might be the way to go.  And I--so, I changed up.  Yeah, yeah, I took, I took the MCAT--92 percentile.  I, I could have gone, but I, I, you know, I made a different choice.  But my mother was not happy with that until she came, when I had my investiture.  And she says, "Well, I guess I'll give up that doctor thing now" (laughter).  But two of my kids [Kristi Spencer Lee and Stephen Spencer] are doctors, so it, it works itself up.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think a lot of, well, you know, the literature is ripe with, with mothers, immigrant mothers and poor mothers, you know, scrubbing floors so their sons can be a doctor.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It's always a doctor.  It's never to be a lawyer--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, she, she was very clear about it.  Yeah, she thought that would be great.  And, of course, I would have been a doctor during the time before managed care, you know, when you could gain tremendous wealth as a physician.  Anyway, one of my friends, who started out before managed care, is, now he's a cardiologist in Arkansas.  He says, "Man, I used to get $10,000 for this procedure."  He says, "Now, I get maybe twelve hundred." Right, because in the--that's all they're paying.  That's all the insurance will pay.  The money has not gone.  It's gone away from the doctors.  And--
Speaker 1: To management, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, to the, to the administrators, to the insurance companies.  The money went somewhere else.  So, anyway--
Speaker 1: Now M.B.A. is worth more than that.
Speaker 2: That's the absolute truth.  And Marian said that recently.  One of my buddies, John Thomas [John Charles Thomas], I was telling you that you should interview.  He, he was up at Monticello [Charlottesville, Virginia] for some Jefferson Foundation [Thomas Jefferson Foundation, Inc., Charlottesville, Virginia] thing.  And Marian was there getting an award and he spoke to her and, and mentioned my name.  He says, she says, "Well, you tell him I would have sent him to, for an M.B.A.," (laughter), "instead of a J.D. nowadays."
Story_ID: 673806
Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, what do you consider to be your greatest accomplishment?
Speaker 2: Greatest accomplishment--well, it's not in the realm of my profession or my career.  My greatest accomplishment, I, I raised three children, who are good people, solid as a rock.  They are grounded.  Academically, they excelled, made me proud at every step of the way.  My children are awesome.  I, I mean, and I can't even begin to tell you how proud I am of what's happened with them.  My, my daughter [Kristi Spencer Lee], valedictorian of her high school class, she went to Duke University [Durham, North Carolina], did very well, then to Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] to medical school where she was second in her class, Alpha Omega [Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society], the honor society, just topnotch, chief resident when she did her training.  My middle son [A. Benjamin Spencer] went to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], valedictorian of his high school class, valedictorian at Morehouse class, went to Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] where he was editor of the law review [Harvard Law Review].  My youngest son [Stephen Spencer], same deal, magna cum laude, Virginia Tech [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia], Meharry medical school [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  They have just--and I, you know, I go to every little honor ceremony.  And all my kids were athletic, so I got to, you know, see my sons play football or basketball or tennis, run track, you know.  That's the stuff that matters to me.  And now, we have grandkids, same thing, little kids playing golf, or he's playing.  The ten year-old is playing football, yeah.  This is what make life worth living, really, you know, it's--I've had a job, a good job, a job that's important and significant, but it's just a small part of my life.
Story_ID: 673807
Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, of course, one immediate concern is our participation in the political process.  My concern is that, that this, the result of this recent election will have the opposite effect from what it should have, that people will be become hopeless and frustrated, and so on, and, and opt out of the process.  I have always thought that if, if, you know, by some divine miracle, we could have 100 percent universal participation, the world would be so different.  It, it, if, if you think about it for a second, only 50 percent, and that's, I mean, that's high, only 50 percent of eligible voters register.  Only, that's only half of the people actually registered to be in the process.  And then, when turnout time comes, 50 percent of those who registered is a high turnout.  If, if 50 percent of those who registered voted, right, so what does that mean?  That means that 25 percent of those eligible are the ones who, who determine everything.  It's a small percentage of folks.  And if, and if you would somehow get people to get out and vote, I, I, it's per- perplexing to me when you think about all that we did for that right.  All of the people who struggled, then suffered, and died, so that we could have the opportunity to vote.  Think of all the stress that they were under just, just walking into a, a county courthouse and saying, "I want to register." When all we had to do is just walk in the door.  I, I, it's befuddling to be.  And I'm sure that some of our ancestors roll in their grave when they think of people just sitting at home, and not vote.  And I vote--I don't care if they're electing a dog catcher.  I will get up in the morning and go cast my vote, just to honor those people who did what they did, so that we could have the privilege.  So, that's, that's my biggest concern 'cause that's, that is what matters.  That's how you change the process.  You know, I've, I read this book recently, 'Showdown' ['Showdown: Thurgood Marshall and the Supreme Court Nomination That Changed America,' Wil Haygood] it's about Thurgood Marshall's appointment, and very interesting to me.  But, you know, some, some vicious local sheriffs and the, and the things that they did to people who were just trying to vote.  And my buddy and I read the book at the same time.  We were talking about it.  And what it demonstrates, though, is that it really wasn't about race.  It was about power.  See, if you were a, you know, you're a high school graduate, graduate, and you get elected sheriff, or constitutional officer in a county, you get paid fairly well for that region.  You get to hire four, five or six, ten people, sometimes your family, right?  It's your livelihood.  This is everything to you.  And if you live in a county, like Lowndes County, Mississippi, 80 percent black.  Well, if the black people vote, I'm out, I'm finished.  That's why they're so vicious.  It's about the power.  They want to keep the power.  Nobody ever wants to give it up.  Boy, and some of the things that you see that people do, you say, how can I--one human being do that to another?  Well, you let power get involved in it.  And you'll see what inhumanity to, to man can be.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I, I, I just want to make sure that anybody who sees this interview understands that the two most important people in my life--mother [Hannah Ellerbe Spencer] and father [Benjamin Spencer], they did everything for me.
Story_ID: 673808
Speaker 1: The last question is similar to legacy, I guess, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Remembered (laughter), as a, a great father and, you know, a good husband, a loving, caring person, who tried to do the best he could for his fellowman.  I gave a day's labor for a day's pay.  And I hope I made my, my family, especially my mother [Hannah Ellerbe Spencer] and father [Benjamin Spencer], proud.  I hope I made my, my state and my country proud.  And I say state, you know, some people say, well, jeez, man, South Carolina was such a tough place.  It was totally segregated, and you had all these difficulties there, but I always say South Carolina is like my Babylon and my Zion.  I mean, it's my beloved home.  It was the place of my captivity, but it is, indeed, the place of my birth and breeding, and I will always love it.

Speaker 1: All right.  This is a photograph of myself, my wife, and Doug Wilder [HistoryMaker L. Douglas Wilder].  I believe we were going into the governor's mansion [Executive Mansion, Richmond, Virginia] for a party.
Speaker 2: All right.  This one goes way, way back.  This is the staff at the U.S. attorney's office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia] in Richmond, Virginia.  There are--let's see, one, two, three--five or six lawyers and the rest, support staff.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: This was immediately after John MacKenzie's portrait unveiling ceremony in Norfolk, Virginia.  The judges there are Judge Kellam [Richard Boykin Kellam] to the far, to the far left, Judge Doumar [Robert G. Doumar], and myself, Judge Clarke [Joseph Calvitt Clarke Jr.], then Judge MacKenzie [John Ashton MacKenzie] immediately to the right of the picture, Judge Bryan [Albert Vickers Bryan Jr.], and Judge Hoffman [Matthew Edward Hoffman].
Speaker 1: This, I believe, was my sixtieth birthday party.  To the far left is my son-in-law, Dana [Dana Lee].  Then, the tall guy there is my middle son, Ben [A. Benjamin Spencer], his wife in front of him, Marlette [Marlette Spencer].  There I am, standing behind my daughter, Kristi [Kristi Spencer Lee].  There's my wife, Margaret [Spencer's second wife, Margaret Spencer].  And Stephen [Stephen Spencer], over to the right, my younger son.
Speaker 2: This is my son, Stephen's graduation from Meharry medical school [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  My wife and I were there and very proud, obviously.
Speaker 1: This is, to the left, my son, Ben.  The infant in the picture is his son, James [ph.], who's named after me.  And, of course, I'm there.  And then, that's my son, Stephen.
Speaker 2: This is my wife, Margaret, with our youngest child, Stephen.
Speaker 1: This, my three grandchildren, my daughter's three children.  To the left is Madison [Madison Lee], she's the oldest.  She's now a sophomore at the University of Maryland [University of Maryland, College Park, College Park, Maryland] honors program.  Shelby [ph.] in the middle, she's a seventeen year old senior in high school.  And Ellis [ph.], he's a thirteen year old--I believe he's in the eighth grade.
Speaker 2: This is my daughter and her husband, Dana.  And my daughter is a physician, her husband is a physician as well.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I think, did we shoot this one--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think--well, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Now, we're doing okay.
Speaker 2: All right, yeah.  Again, these are my two sons.  To the left is Stephen.  This picture was taken after a football game at the Collegiate School [Richmond, Virginia].  I forgot the team we were playing, but Stephen had a tremendous game.  He was all-state and all-prep in football.
