Speaker 2: August 26th, 1949, St. Louis, Missouri.
Speaker 1: Okay. How would you label or describe your profession today at this moment?
Speaker 2: As a, that's an interesting question. My formal title is director of the African Presidential Archives and Research Center at Boston University, the founding director. And in that capacity I have an administrative role, which is to manage the program flow of the center and it also entails raising money to support the programmatic initiatives of the center and then to also think strategically about the areas in which we develop program. Now I'd say adjunct or kind of complimentary or inferred set of responsibilities is, is bringing people together to think creatively about Africa.

Speaker 1: We have four or five what we call light People magazine type questions to add a little of your personality to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure.
Speaker 1: --to the interview and to give the people who look at it another sense of your personality. What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: I, I like, I like, I like my mother-in-law's [Mildred Boutin Prothrow] Louisiana gumbo--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and, and orange juice, fresh squeezed orange juice.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: In Bos- well it--see it, it has a lot to do with geography. I mean in Boston [Massachusetts] it's as with most folks it's probably fall. If it's Johannesburg, South Africa, it's February through April--through May. If it's Paris [France], it's sounds--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --cliche-ish but April in Paris is really as nice as the, the song underscores and if it's June, July, August Tanzania, Dar es Salaam [Tanzania].
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm good. Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Well that's debatable.--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --I mean while my wife [HistoryMaker Deborah Prothrow-Stith] accuses me of having a closet full of gray suits and I try to explain this issue of nuance, she would probably say my favorite color is gray, and actually it's brown.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Do you have a favorite saying or phrase that you use on a daily basis?
Speaker 2: Well not on a daily basis, but it really is a life reference point. It's Latin: dominus provideus, the Lord does provide.
Story_ID: 289865
Speaker 1: As I mentioned earlier, we would like to begin the interview by having you tell us about your family and your family history. We would like to start by having you tell us about your mother, her name and where she was born, where she grew up, her background?
Speaker 2: Her maiden name is Thompson, first name Dorothy, the oldest of two children, born to Mary Louise Thompson and Rudolph Thompson. Her father and mother were separated at a rather early age so she and her brother were principally raised by her mother--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --in St. Louis, Missouri.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Your mother is still living?
Speaker 2: Mother is still living.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Tell me a little bit about her growing up years, her background?
Speaker 2: She grew up in a part of the city called The Ville [St. Louis, Missouri] which is one of the, the kind of historic--historically stable areas of the African American community in St. Louis, Missouri, a strong institutional infrastructure, the--which is also where my grandmother grew up. She went to Sumner High School, Charles Sumner High School [St. Louis, Missouri]. Almost every black community particularly those that were north of the Mason Dixon Line had a Sumner high school for, for the African American student population. My grandmother grew up in St. Louis. She went to Sumner High School and actually the guy [George] Brantley who became principal of Sumner High School during my grandmother's senior year, was also the principal at Sumner High School when my mother attended school and had we not moved out of The Ville and I had gone to Sumner High School, he retired at the end of what would have been my freshman year. So it was that kind of community where you had a lot of the stability in that regard. While St. Louis geographically is Midwest--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --like most of the cities on the Mississippi River it's more southern in terms of culture and Ethos. So St. Louis is much more like Memphis [Tennessee] or New Orleans [Louisiana] than it is like Kansas City [Missouri], which is on the opposite ends of the state. And so it was segregated in the same way that most southern cities in the United States was. Then there's as I said The Ville was that historically black enclave within the city and there was Sumner High School and Turner Elementary School [St. Louis, Missouri] which is where I went to elementary school and teachers at the school went to our churches and many of them were former classmates. I remember what--the enforcer, the teacher who was the enforcer at our elementary school, Mr. Williams [ph.], was a classmate of my mother's in high school.  So if you got called to his office and he pulled out his paddle and gave you some strokes, you, you, you took the--you sucked it up, you took the strokes and you, you definitely didn't go home and, and tell on him because the assumption would be at home was well what'd you do?  And if he felt the need to touch you up, then you probably needed touching up and if he touched you up, I probably need to touch you up too. So it was that kind of community. So you know that, that was you know St., St. Louis, Missouri.
Story_ID: 289866
Speaker 1: How do you spell Ville [The Ville, St. Louis, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: It, it--V-I-L-L-E.
Speaker 1: V-I-L-L-E oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Which is also another interesting like New Orleans [Louisiana] you know I mean Missouri was a part of the Louisiana Purchase so it's, it's got a lot of French roots as well so you know those pronunciations you find in you know throughout.
Speaker 1: Just as an aside you mentioned Turner Middle School [sic. Turner Elementary School, St. Louis, Missouri]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that was named after the grandfather [Dr. Charles Henry Turner] of Chuck Turner [HistoryMaker Charles "Chuck" Turner].
Speaker 2: Ah.
Speaker 1: And Chuck we're going to be interviewing Friday this week.
Speaker 2: Ah.
Speaker 1: I'll tell you about that later. I notice that you said your mother [Dorothy Thompson Stith] on the question of your mother is retired, what was her occupation?
Speaker 2: She--well I'll tell you I mean, it's interesting I mean again you're kind of growing up during the, the period of Jim Crow when educational as well as professional opportunities were really kind of limited. My mother reinvented herself several times. All of which became possible as we continued to push the barriers back relative to the--in terms of Civil Rights Movement. She did everything from working--she worked as a waitress. She worked as a, a department store sales clerk, once that door opened up. When the Models Cities [Model Cities] programs came along, there were opportunities to do skills training. She trained as a draftsman and did that for a while and eventually went back to school to become a nurse.
Story_ID: 289867
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father [Charles Stith]? His name and where he was born and grew up and a little bit about his background.
Speaker 2: He was born in, in Mississippi and no I take that back, no, no. He was born on my grandmother's [Pearl Stith] side, my paternal grandmother's side, they were from Mississippi. He was born in Indiana and my grandmother-- paternal grandmother and grandfather, met in Mississippi, moved to Indiana, left Indiana because as you know most folks don't know I mean Indiana is a birth place of the Klan [Klu Klux Klan, KKK]. So it wasn't actually the most comfortable of venues for black people. And they left you know to head north and stopped in St. Louis [Missouri]. He was an only child. My grandfather died not long after he was born so he was raised by his mother and given how soon after he was born and my grandfather died, just kind of explains why he was an only child and my grandmother never remarried. But it's kind of ironic because on my paternal grandfather's side, I think he was an only child but on my paternal grandmother's side, she was one of about fourteen kids. It was a bunch of them, and many of them moved to St. Louis as, as well. My grandmother lived on the, the south side of town which was a historically a part of the black community. It, it was a poor section of the black community than The Ville [St. Louis, Missouri] where my mother [Dorothy Thompson Stith] and grandmother [Mary Thompson] you know her, her family grew up.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. You mentioned in your questionnaire stepfather Johnny Butler.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah. How is he your stepfather?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he and my--my mother and father were divorced when I was preschool age and she subsequently married Johnny Butler.  My brother, James [Butler], is a product of that marriage and he and I grew up together and matter of fact, Johnny just died a year ago so that'd be 2004.  I preached his funeral.
Story_ID: 289868
Speaker 1: As you were growing up, did your mother [Dorothy Thompson Stith] share with you family history, song, stories about her parents [Mary Thompson and Rudolph Thompson] and about the past?
Speaker 2: Well you know interestingly no, not in the sense that as a community we began to talk about family post 'Roots[: The Saga of an American Family]' by Alex Haley. I mean at, at in a real sense we were in the moment in terms of living and experiencing family. You know there were several points where we lived with my grandmother and at the points that we weren't living with my grandmother, I was--we lived close enough that it was never more than a fifteen minute walk from her house so to have to you know well you know it's not like today you know where you know we become so mobile as a society that you got grandparents not to mention aunts and uncles who were miles you know thousands of miles away. I mean then, I mean the family was, was, was there. It was no need to talk about family because you were talking to family on a, on a regular basis. My paternal grandmother lived in as I said the area of the city--the, the south of part lower south St. Louis [Missouri] and even though she and my fa- my father [Charles Stith]--my mother and my father been divorced for years, my mother and my paternal grandmother had an excellent relationship and during the summers we would go and my brother [James Butler] and I would go and spend the summer with my paternal grandmother. I mean so and then as a result of that you know the folks on her side of the family we got to, to know. As a matter of fact for a while her mother lived with her. She, she was a primary caregiver for her mother and her mother died in the 19--in the mid-'50s [1950s] in the mid-'50s [1950s] and when she died, she was eighty something years old. You know so coming out of Mississippi she was born on a plantation.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm. Her name, her name?
Speaker 2: Pearl [Stith]--
Speaker 1: Pearl, okay.
Speaker 2: --was my maternal [sic. paternal] grandmother's name. My maternal--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --grandmother's name was Pearl.  Her, her mother's name was Ida [ph.].
Speaker 1: That's your great-grandmother then?
Speaker 2: My great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Did she ever tell you about her past? Did she share anything with you?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I was, I was--when she was growing--when I was growing up--when she was growing up--when I was growing up I mean you know I was a kid. You know I was more interested in playing, you know I mean so you know any great discussions, which I mean now--I mean I consider myself a history buff.  I love, I love history. You know and obviously if I were of the mind then that I am now, I would have had some very long and extended (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well I had this--I have this same story.
Speaker 2: -conversations.
Speaker 1: I have, I have the same story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: When I was young. Never thought to ask.
Speaker 2: Never thought to ask.
Speaker 1: And then nobody told me.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So I been scrambling for the last thirty years trying to get it all back together.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 289869
Speaker 1: What is your very earliest memory of growing up? How far back can you go in memory and what can you tell me (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I can, I can remember going to, I can remember moments from the nursery school that I attended which would have had to put me in the neighborhood of three or four. I remember kindergarten. My kindergarten teacher I had two--it's interesting. I had two kindergarten teachers, one was an old white woman and the other was this really fine black woman. And while I'm using the adjective fine now but that's from a perspective of a fifty, fifty-five year old man but you know as a kid, I thought she was a very strikingly beautiful woman. I remember that. I remember in kindergarten we had this raffle or it was some sort of event and whatever kid sold the most raffle tickets or something like that, was the king of the school. And so as a kindergartner my mother [Dorothy Thompson Stith] helped sell the most tickets so I was the king of Toussaint L'Ouverture, elementary school [Turner Elementary School, St. Louis, Missouri]. So, I, I remember my royal lineage, and well it's pretty far back, and then I mean from that point on I mean there been a lot of things that you know I remember.
Story_ID: 289870
Speaker 1: In elementary school [Turner Elementary School, St. Louis, Missouri] what do you remember about those years? What kind of a student were you as an elementary?
Speaker 2: I was an excellent student and I always took great pride in being a boy's boy. You know I roughhoused. You know we'd do things. This is back in the day. You know particularly down where my [paternal] grandmother [Pearl Stith] lived on the south side which as I said was a, a much poorer part of the city [St. Louis, Missouri]. The junk wagons used to come down the alley, horse drawn, horse drawn junk wagons, and you know we'd run and hop on the back of the back of the junk wagon. There were coal sheds out in the backyard. We thought nothing of running across the roof of one coal shed and, and jumping to another coal shed. As a matter of fact, one of my good friends Henry [ph.] leapt when he should have leaped and came up a little short and broke his leg. But I took, took pride in you know athletics but also my academic work. I enjoyed--I was always very curious intellectually and I also enjoyed the validation and I also remember that during most of my elementary school career 'til sixth grade, the young woman, because you pretty much stayed in the same classes as you proceed through, the young woman who was my primary competitor academically, I actually wonder whatever happened to her, was a girl by the name of Debra Shepherd [ph.]. And it was always nip and tuck and, and, in every area.
Speaker 1: Who was your best subject? What was your favorite subject that you liked to work at as an elementary schooler or was it did you like all of them?
Speaker 2: I mean it was I mean it was pretty much straightforward, you know. I mean you, you spend most of the time in the same class. Now I do remember this very interesting thing in--I do--the other thing I remember about elementary school in particular, is the extent to which the faculty cared about the students. It's a very interesting story. My fourth grade teacher was a woman by the name of Ms. Brooks [ph.]. And she was considered you know by our standards as mean. She wasn't, she wasn't you know allurish [ph.] or nasty, she was just what we call now--what I call now strict. And even the tough guys, you know we had tough guys back then too, even the tough guys gave her, her props you know. When you were in her class partner it was the straight and narrow. Fourth grade, I saw her, I literally, literally bumped into her on the street in Atlanta, Georgia, in front of the Hyatt Regency [Atlanta, Georgia] as a seminary student [at Gammon Theological Seminary, Atlanta, Georgia]. And I said, "Ms. Brooks," and she looked me straight in the eye and she said, "Stith [HistoryMaker Reverend Charles Richard Stith]?" And she said it with the same kind of authority. I felt like I was in the fourth grade again. But I mentioned to her that I was in seminary and a little about what she said you know I'm not surprised at all you know. I knew you know even as a student at that early age that you had leadership potential and that you're cultivating that potential. I'm not surprised at all and I want you to know that I expect great things of you. You know it was that kind of validation, that kind of caring, that kind of environment of nurture, that level of connection that a teacher I had in the fourth grade would have no problem recalling who I was a decade and a half later. So I remember that. I remember that about growing up in St. Louis, Missouri and The Ville [St. Louis, Missouri].
Story_ID: 289871
Speaker 1: You know we didn't think about it as, as being you know particularly difficult times from a financial perspective I mean 'cause everybody was in the same relative status. But you know I tell some of these stories and my kids [Percy Stith and Mary Stith] look at me and they snicker. But you know look I, I remember kids growing up and you know families were running short on, on money and kids ate mayonnaise sandwiches, you know mayonnaise, you know bread and mayonnaise nothing else but the mayonnaise buddy. Sugar sandwiches you know, you have a hot dog and you fry it and didn't have anything else but jelly, so you put jelly on the hot dog. And people shared that kind of stuff, you know and thought nonetheless of somebody because they were in that situation it was just, it was you know you've heard of a hundred and one people say this, you know we were poor but we didn't know we were poor.  You know it was, that was just the way it was.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you know I, I, I remember you know things of that sort, but you know overall I remember you know there was a, a strong sense of values, a strong sense of expectation, relative to what we were going to have to become. You know a constant litany when we were in school and our school was clean. It was clean. You could eat off the floor at Turner Elementary School [St. Louis, Missouri]. We had second class books. You know I mean the books that we had were clearly with the names of white kids from further over in south St. Louis [Missouri] and Germantown [Baden, St. Louis, Missouri], and The Hill [St. Louis, Missouri] and, and those sections of the city.
Speaker 2: Was Turner your elementary school or your middle school?
Speaker 1: Both.
Speaker 2: It was both? Okay.
Speaker 1: By the time I got ready to go to middle school it became a middle school.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: So I did--
Speaker 2: All right, okay.
Speaker 1: --I did every, I did first grade through eighth grade at Turner.
Story_ID: 289872
Speaker 1: Any time along that route from grade one to grade eight did you have a notion or some feelings about what you wanted to do in a career as an adult? Did you have any ideas at that at that point?
Speaker 2: Not really but, but, but with this caveat I was, I was groomed to lead. I cannot remember a period in my life where I was not encouraged to provide leadership and validated for it you know. Whether it was given a recitation at--in, in the school [Turner Elementary School, St. Louis, Missouri] being the, the king of the school as a, as a kindergartner. When I was in the eighth grade I was elected president of the student body. In high school [Soldan High School; Soldan International Studies High School, St. Louis, Missouri] I was the president of a club [the egotists] that we--social club that we started. One of the most popular clubs in the city by the way, not just the high school I attended. Yeah I was on the student council. I was a, a reader at my church, president of the youth group. I mean that was a constant that, that kind of translucent thread throughout.  My mother [Dorothy Thompson Stith] reminded me at, at points when I seemed to stray a bit you know that it's unacceptable.
Story_ID: 289873
Speaker 1: Before we leave your family life, were there any special family events that took place on a yearly basis, special holidays within your family that you especially remember?
Speaker 2: Well I'm going to tell you what I remember. More than, more than any annual events that sort of stuff I remember Sunday was a big day for us in, in two regards. One that going to church was always central to our family life. And I actually made mention to this in a sermon once that I preached out at West Angeles Church [of God in Christ] out in L.A [Los Angeles, California]. That growing up even high school [Soldan High School; Soldan International Studies High School, St. Louis, Missouri] I didn't have a curfew. But it was this provision. My mother [Dorothy Thompson Stith] was very clear as long as I lived in her house I had to go to church on Sunday morning. And it wasn't just going to church on Sunday morning, I couldn't go to church and sleep. I had to be in church, I mean in it, and so you know it became apparent to me after a few times that it was only so late I could stay out on Saturday night and still function on Sunday morning. But a part of the Sunday thing was dinner at my paternal grandmother's [Pearl Stith] house. You know some Sundays I grew up going to the Methodist church. We moved out actually it was central west end, we also used to go to a Presbyterian church [West Presbyterian Church, St. Louis, Missouri] 'cause it was close. And that was--some defining stuff happened in that context, but my grandmother was Baptist. She went to Pilgrim Rest--[Christ] Pilgrim Rest Missionary Baptist Church [St. Louis, Missouri]. So and they were in church longer than the Methodist of course, so we had ample time. My grandmother would get up and she'd start Sunday dinner before church. And then we'd go to church, they go to church. The summers when we stayed we'd obviously go to church, but during the year we'd go to church, we can go home, change clothes, then get to her house and then she'd be out of church by them and wrapping up dinner, but you know on special Sundays we'd have meat or some sort. But I remember this about Sunday; my grandmother knew a hundred different ways to fix chicken. She could do everything to a dead chicken but bring it back to life, brother. So every Sunday was great dinner at her, her house.  I mean despite the fact that every Sunday it'd be some form--chicken in some form or fashion and sweet potatoes and rolls and she could do a thing with biscuits, which I also preached about that was special. So you know it is, it was a lot like the stuff that you see in some of these movies, you know where folks would come by you know some Sundays the preacher and his family would come by, and it was, it was Thanksgiving, Jesus feast, the family reunion, everything all rolled into one every week.
Story_ID: 289874
Speaker 1: Oh good, you answered my next question which was about family and church, but let me ask you in addition to the formal services, what over church activities were you involved in?
Speaker 2: I was, I was president of the youth group in the church and then when I was twenty and we were--that's we were out in the central--what's now called the Central West End [St. Louis, Missouri], just the West End then, we moved out in that part of the city. I was involved at West Presbyterian Church [St. Louis, Missouri] because that was a couple of blocks from where we were and they had kind of an extensive portfolio programs and one of which was a short term missions project to build churches in Kenya, and honestly it was--I was in high school [Soldan High School; Soldan International Studies High School, St. Louis, Missouri]--I'd finished high school, I was in college [St. Louis Community College, St. Louis, Missouri], wasn't particularly interested in doing it. I--at that time it had gone over as Omega, Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. I had a job, part time job selling women shoes in the shoe salon at Stix Baer and Fuller [St. Louis, Missouri], was really good at it and made some nice change.
Speaker 1: This was during your high school years?
Speaker 2: This is college.
Speaker 1: College? Okay.
Speaker 2: And then you know was getting ready for the summer to, to hang and this opportunity to go to Kenya to do this short term missions project came up on the radar screen and I didn't wanna go and you know my mother [Dorothy Thompson Stith] you know went from soft persuasion and when that wasn't working she started leaning on me heavier, and then still heavier. And I finally decided I was gonna go to Kenya just to get away from her. And it was a, it was a life changing experience in, in many regards. One, we flew from Boston [Massachusetts] to New York [New York]. This was the first I'd been on an airplane. And then we went from New York to Le Havre, France by boat. It was a ship you know by ocean liner standards, a small ship. It was eight, nine hundred people. But most of which were students and majority of students were white. It was a sizable number of black students, some from the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] area. And we had nine-day trip and it was the first time that I encountered whites in that kind of way. As--you know we just hanging, no political agenda and it was a nine-day party, I had fun. I, I and I to this day I don't recall having in one sustained period that much fun. It was a nine-day party. And then we flew from Le Havre to, to Nairobi [Kenya] and then started this experience over several months and it was actually why--while we were in Kenya very near the southern border where Mount Kilimanjaro [Tanzania] was in view and at night after we finished our day's work, I'd lay out in the fields at, at night and just look up at the, the sky, the southern hemisphere and watch the shooting stars and it was while I was there that two things which stayed with me during that experience and later had profound implications. One it was while I was there that I decided to enter the ministry. And the other is that I often wondered many nights what life was like on the other side of that mountain called Kilimanjaro. Little did I know that thirty years later I would be on the other side of that mountain as a United States ambassador to the United Republic of Tanzania.
Story_ID: 289875
Speaker 1: You in college [St. Louis Community College, St. Louis, Missouri], you go to Kenya, let me just back up quickly, briefly to your high school [Soldan High School; Soldan International Studies High School, St. Louis, Missouri] years. What do you remember about your high school years? What high school did you go to?
Speaker 2: Well let me back up a little further--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --'cause I mean one of the seminal events before high school, my eighth grade year [at Turner Elementary School, St. Louis, Missouri], I had just gotten elected president of the student body, hung around school celebrating. Left school, was walking home and a, a friend of mine called me into the alley and he was with another fella whom I knew, didn't have much association with and the other fella had a pistol, a .38 caliber handgun and they wanted to show me a pistol and I said you know you guys you don't wanna play with guns, people can get hurt. And this fella raised the gun, point blank as close to me as I am to you and said it's not loaded, pulled the trigger and shot me in the chest. And I was in the hospital for, for a while. And one of the things that I remember in addition to the, you know the significant pain that I felt, is that night at the hospital it was actually a couple of things happened at the hospital that were pretty striking. One was retrospectively kind of humorous. When we got in the hospital, I was bleeding rather profusely. And they attempted to apply some pressure to stop the bleeding but the doctor was quite emphatic, we need to rush him up to x-ray to see you know to what extent there is internal bleeding, of if there is organ damage and the guy wheeling me up to the, to the operating room, young brother, along the way this sister walked past worked in the hospital, she had on some kind of uniform, and he started talking to her. And we stopping, I'm in the hall, I'm bleeding, this guy is trying to hit on this chick and I finally said, "Excuse me brother, can you take me upstairs?" He said, "Oh, excuse me. Let me run him upstairs and I'll be right back." Now retrospectively, you know I've always had the chuckle at that I thought about it, but thank God I was you know conscious, I mean 'cause I could have died. The second thing was much more substantive and it was, it was literally hearing the doctor tell my mother [Dorothy Thompson Stith] that he was not certain that I would make it through the night, that the bullet came one sixteenth of an inch to my heart and was deflected just barely by a rib in my chest, went in the front came out the back. And it you know I mean you would think in one sense something like that would be you know an epiphany and you know, you know this thirteen year old kid, it wasn't quite that dramatic but I do recall as I said the pain, a lot of the, the, the humorous note and then more seriously this conversation between my mother and the doctor, but also that I recall you know a point of hearing him say that I might not make it through the night, feeling rather peaceful, facing the prospect of, of, of death. And you know maybe within the context of what I've come to be as a preacher and you know thinking about life you know outside the boundaries of the temple was probably to some extent informed by that experience.
Story_ID: 289876
Speaker 1: High school was a blast. Matter of fact too much so. Back in the day we gave out--they gave out, they gave out academic letters and I got one my first semester and then my second semester I almost flunked out of high school. And interestingly a couple of weeks ago my high school had started this hall of fame of graduates and I was inaugurated into the first class of inductees and I didn't know interestingly. I didn't know that the great actress Virginia Mayo was a graduate of Soldan High School [Soldan International Studies High School, St. Louis, Missouri], which is where I went in St. Louis [Missouri] and, and Tennessee Williams was also a, a Soldan knight. So we were all inducted into the first class but during the induction you know one of the points that I made is that and this is my second year of high school and my home room teacher was a gentleman by the name of Donald T. Thompson [ph.]. And he was also my fourth period geometry teacher. And I'd go to homeroom in the morning and I'd cut his class at fourth period. Dumb. Dumb. But this guy I remember one day by all right he should have flunked me in class. And by all right he really should have flunked me. And if he had flunked me, it would have meant me going to night school and who knows what turn my life would have taken. And I can remember him very clearly saying to me, he said, "You know man I don't what you're going through, I don't know what you're going through," he said, "but I'm not gonna give up on you. And more important than that, you don't need to give up on yourself. You need to get your act together." And he gave me a D minus in geometry, which kept me in school and then I started to get at, at least more serious enough that I, I wasn't looking at the abyss, but man I had a blast in high school. We started this social club called the egotists.
Speaker 2: The ego--
Speaker 1: The egotists.
Speaker 2: How do you spell it?
Speaker 1: E-G-O-T-I-S-T-S.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We were a little stuck on ourselves--
Story_ID: 289877
Speaker 1: It was one of the most popular clubs [the egotists] in, in the entire city [St. Louis, Missouri]. I mean we gave--and that was another whole interesting set of lessons. I mean one of the things I remember the first party we gave, we charged something like two bucks, you know two dollars and fifty cents, and I can't--maybe five bucks and we rented this hall, this function room in this very small hotel. And we got the hype, we got the hype and, and so many people turned out for the party that, and the room was so packed that you, you had to slow dance on the fast records. I mean it was, it was that packed. The room was so hot this was back when the sisters were hot combing their--it was, everybody had a afro because the heat, the heat it just drew everybody's hair up. The heat got so bad that it broke the, it over heated the, the equipment of the disk jockey. And of course we thought this was an absolute disaster you know and people were going awe man this is horrible we want our money back and we. Well you know see us about the money back then, but, but we were all despondent and then we figured that what we would do is rent a bigger hall and instead of giving people their money back, we'd give another party and we told people who came to the first party we'd give you a discount. And you know we were on pins and needles. We sold tickets. We sold out in a week. We went and printed some more tickets, got a bigger hall, sold out in two weeks. Lesson, people like to be where the crowd is. Never forgot it.  People like to be where the crowd is.  So high school was a ball.  It was a ball.
Speaker 2: Would you spell the name of your high school so we have it on record?
Speaker 1: Sure. S-O-L-D-A-N, Soldan [Soldan High School; Soldan International Studies High School, St. Louis Missouri].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 918 Union Boulevard. We had some great football teams. I ran track one year in high school. I ran, which is the other thing I remember about high school that, the graduation ceremony, the pits. It's long, the person who spoke was long-winded you know and all I'm thinking while this guy is yapping can he please shut up I wanna get my diploma and go hang out and when I walked up to the principal, he handed me the folder, that's after sitting there in St. Louis [Missouri], this is St. Louis summer man, June, hot, school is not air conditioned. Sitting there a couple hours. They finally, my name is at the back of the alphabet. I'm sitting back, I get the folder, open it up and there's a note inside the folder that until I turn my track equipment in I don't get my diploma. I remember that from high school, but you know honestly, high school was a blast. I had fun. I had fun. I, I, I underachieved in high school and continued that undistinguished record my first two years of college [St. Louis Community College, St. Louis, Missouri] and then came the experience in Kenya. I took some time out of college and then when I went back--
Story_ID: 289878
Speaker 1: Tell us where you went to college and what year did you start?
Speaker 2: I wound up starting out in the junior college system [Junior College District of St. Louis] in St. Louis [Missouri] in '67 [1967], and again I mean the, the impetus to getting a 2.5 [grade point average] one semester is I needed a 2.5 to go over Omega Psi Phi Fraternity so I focused enough to get a 2.5, and you know after it was fun. I had--
Speaker 1: How long were you at the junior college?
Speaker 2: A couple year years.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. And then you went on to--
Speaker 2: Then I took a year out, out of school, part of that time I spent in Kenya on this short term mission's project and then when I came back it was me, new and improved. I went to Baker University [Baldwin City, Kansas], as I said I decided I want to go into ministry.  A friend of mine suggested that I have a conversation with the dean, the president dean of Saint Paul School of Theology in Kansas City [sic. Overland Park, Kansas] and I went to talk to him about working on my undergraduate degree and my professional degree, the seminary degree, which is a master's degree concurrently. And the guy said well you know you got too many hours to make up. But why don't you think about going to school at Baker University, which is in Baldwin City, Kansas. They've got a great classics department. Charles Dowdner [ph.] who was head of the classics department was one of the great scholars. They offered Greek, biblical Greek, which would serve well you know in, in seminary. He called over, I met with the president of the university, offered me an absolutely unbelievable package to go to school there and that's where I finished interestingly. I was participating in a conference on the ministry at Saint Paul where I met the dean [sic. president, Dr. Major J. Jones] of the seminary that I eventually wound up going to because I didn't go to school in Kansas City [Kansas], Saint Paul. I wound up going to there's a denominational theological center [Interdenominational Theological Center] in Atlanta, Georgia.--
Speaker 1: Um-hm. So you were at Baker University four years?
Speaker 2: Two.
Speaker 1: Two years?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you got a degree in?
Speaker 2: Double major, English and sociology and in two years--and I, and I really think I mean the end of the day the thing that got me into graduate school at Harvard [Harvard Divinity School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] was my, my college transcript. I got one my last two years of college, I made one B and then maybe my first two years of college, I had like two Bs. The difference between the first two years, the last two years, the first two years those two Bs were the highest grades I got and the last two years, the one B I got was the lowest grade I received. One B and all A's, the last two years of school.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Okay.
Speaker 2: And the guy when I went to interview for graduate school at Harvard said that, "I wanna talk about this, I've never seen anything like this in my life."
Story_ID: 289879
Speaker 1: Baker University [Baldwin City, Kansas], what was the next step? Where'd you go from there?
Speaker 2: From there to Atlanta, Georgia. I met as I said I was at this conference on the ministry and I was speaking on role and responsibility of the church and this movement of social change that this country was still in, in the midst of and there's a guy there by the name--who was attending Dr. Major J. Jones, as the president, dean of Gammon Theological Seminary [Atlanta, Georgia], which is one of the constituent schools. The Interdenominational Theological Center [Atlanta, Georgia], ITC, is a consortium of historically black seminaries. Gammon which is United Methodist, Johnson C. Smith [Theological Seminary, Atlanta, Georgia], which is Presbyterian, Turner [Theological Seminary, Atlanta, Georgia] which was A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal], Charles Mason [Charles H. Mason Theological Seminary, Atlanta, Georgia], which was Church of God in Christ. These is--there's seven schools which came together and he walked up to me after the presentation he said you know we're giving this consol- conference on ministry down at Gammon where we're trying to interest students in coming to school in Atlanta and I'd like you to come down, check out the school and make a presentation much like you've done here. And I said well you know Doc, Dr. Jones I appreciate the invitation, but I pretty much decided that I'm gonna go to school here at Saint Paul [St. Paul School of Theology, Overland Park, Kansas]. He said that's no problem. Said that's no problem. Said we'll send you a ticket you know, provide you a little honorarium for your, your remarks. Let's just--and that was his expression, come on down, come on down. And I did. And it was history. I--we were there, the conference lasted four days and out of that experience I got folks now who are friends and have been for over thirty years that I met that in those four days, and after the four days we all gathered together as we were preparing to depart the campus, some folks drove, some had caught the bus, some came--had come by plane. And we went around and folks said what are you gonna do? And you know I started around, I'm coming back. What are you gonna do? I'm coming back. What are you gonna do? And it felt right and I--"Okay Stith [HistoryMaker Reverend Charles Richard Stith] what are you gonna do?" I'm coming back (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I wanna place this--
Story_ID: 289880
Speaker 1: I'm coming back (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I wanna place this point in your life within the Civil Rights Movement, where were we now, we talking about late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 1: Early '70s [1970s], early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And this is that point in the movement where you got--it's, it's interesting, it's, it's a confluence of things coming together and a clash of certain things coming together. You know you got issues of black power and the church of black power versus you know the Kingian philosophy of nonviolence, then tensions therein. You've got you know people like Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] and [H.] Rap Brown [Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin] and Huey P. Newton competing you know for that leadership space with people like Martin King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], well at this time Martin was dead, but you know you still had Andy [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] around and Jesse [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] and you know the Atlanta [Georgia] crew. You had the, the political stuff, you know starting to take place during this period.
Speaker 2: Now were you directly involved in any specific civil rights activity in Atlanta or otherwise?
Speaker 1: Yeah. My--I mean as long as I--
Speaker 2: Give me a few examples of the things you were directly involved with.
Speaker 1: A part of, we were a part of in St. Louis [Missouri] as a kid, we--these were protests organized by former congressman William Clay [HistoryMaker William Clay, Sr.] picketing the Jefferson Bank [Jefferson Bank and Trust, St. Louis Missouri] because they refuse to hire black people and I remember my mother [Dorothy Thompson Stith] taking me down to participate in, in the picket lines. I remember when we integrated the Fox Theatre [Fabulous Fox Theatre, St. Louis, Missouri] and the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and Urban League organizing a group of us kids. This was the first time I ever went to the movie theater with a shirt and tie and, and a suit on, you know 'cause I mean back in, in those days--matter of fact my wife [HistoryMaker Deborah Prothrow-Stith] was joking with the little fella young brother at the movie, we went to the movie on Saturday morning at eleven o'clock in the morning man it's fourteen dollars to go to the movie and my wife said you know I can remember when we'd go to the movie theater for a quarter and when they went up to thirty-five cents we were mad and the little boy couldn't stop laughing. It's, it's the funniest thing he had heard all day. 'Cause thirty-five cents, there's nothing you can buy at the movie theater for thirty-five cents today. I think toilet tissue cost more than thirty-five cents. But, you know from, from that Kansas City [Kansas] when I was in Kansas City, I was president of the black student union there [Baker University, Baldwin City, Kansas]. You know we locked the trustees up, chained the doors in protest because there weren't enough black faculty and black students.  As a matter of fact many years later when the university called and asked me deliver the baccalaureate address and that they wanted to bestow university honors on me. I was quite taken back because when I was a student there, I think that if you had--there were eight hundred--eight hundred and eighty students, if you had taken a poll of the eight hundred and eighty students and, and indicated--asked them to indicate twenty years later who among the eight hundred and eighty they thought would be invited back to receive university honors? I probably would have been eight hundred and eighty-first on the list. And so I said to, to the president at the time, I said you know you know he said when he raised this I was quiet. He said, "Hello are you--Reverend are you there?" I said, "Yeah," I mean I said, but I'm I'm not often speechless, but I'm speechless you know, and I said, "well maybe I can tell the kids look if you lock the trustees up, standing up for some issue maybe one day you can be here too." You know jokingly of course.  He didn't find it too funny.
Story_ID: 289881
Speaker 1: The other thing that I remember from Baker, which became a profound, it's again one of these lessons that I filed. There were eighty black students on campus, eight hundred white students you know math isn't hard to figure out here in terms of how you start to affect stuff from a power perspective, but one of my issues was that you know we're, we're the minority on this campus you know, we don't get the, the proper amount of respect you know our issues aren't considered to the extent that they are and so we really created a climate where folks were more open to change. So we did something that was very sophisticated, very, very sophisticated. We decided school wide the student government, you had people who were elected school wide and then you had people that were elected from each dormitory and what we decided to do was to run two candidates school wide, one for secretary and one for treasurer. Then surreptitiously we then ran one black candidate from each dorm. It was like a scene out of 'Putney Swope' after the election, half the student government was black and we held two of the leadership positions of the council and clearly people realized what had happened they wanted to do a do over but you dang you can't do that. But those students did such an absolutely excellent job that even though after you know next election we couldn't do half everybody kind of peeped that. We still had representation you know disproportionate to our presence on campus and there were a couple of lessons out of that that I carry with me. One is organize, organize, organize and politics is not rocket science, it's arithmetic. Two, that despite race and racism, people respond to authentic leadership.
Story_ID: 289882
Speaker 1: So I left Baker University [Baldwin City, Kansas], went to Atlanta, Georgia, and Atlanta was an epiphany, it was an epiphany. I arrived in Atlanta, Georgia my first day in Atlanta I went to the bank, I opened up a bank account, I went to the physician, I got a checkup, went to the optometrist got my eyes checked prescription for new glasses. Went to Paschal's Restaurant [Atlanta, Georgia] to have chicken sandwich, late lunch, Maynard Jackson, [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett, Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young], Hosea Williams were there. I mean the hoi polloi of Atlanta and then I'm walking back to the seminary [Gammon Theological Seminary, Atlanta, Georgia] this car with four women absolutely gorgeous pull over, they ask me directions to Beckwith Street, it's the only street I knew. (Laughter) There must be a God somewhere; it's the only street I knew. And they--so I said if you let me get in the car, I'll take you 'cause that's where my dormitory was. I took them to Beckwith Street and I said you know what you all really should do in appreciation for this gesture of kindness, is you all ought to take me out to dinner later on tonight. Which they did and I wound up dating one of the women the whole summer. She was a stewardess trainee but on a more serious note, the thing that struck me about Atlanta is that I had done everything essential to living my life and had not one iota of contact with anybody white. And Atlanta was that kind of context which enabled me to make not just an intellectual transition in terms of my capacity as an African American man in America, but it, it, it gave me an experiential basis for appreciating our potential as a people within this context of this country. You know when folks would come to visit; I'd take 'em on a tour of the black community out in southwest and people would gasp at the level of affluence and the communities. You know you had to move, anywhere else you had move to a white community to see houses in that number and the manicured lawns, et cetera--
Story_ID: 289883
Speaker 1: So it was very important and I also while I was in Atlanta [Georgia], I worked on Maynard's [Maynard Jackson] first campaign for mayor and as a result he and I became lifelong friends until his, until his recent death. And Maynard was the first real black mayor in America. The reason I say that with the emphasis on mayor and not on black is because he understood power and he understood if you were gonna run a city you had to control the police and actually Atlanta came close a lot of people don't appreciate this, came close to an out and out race war after Maynard was elected. John [F.] Inman, who was the chief of police at the time, defied Mayor Maynard's authority and, and said that he was not turning over the keys and just like something out like Gary Cooper man out of 'High Noon,' Maynard said I'm coming on Friday at noon and the white city fathers called Inman in and said you know this city is on the verge of something great and we can't blow it over this. And they forced Inman out, forced him out. But it, it is a lesson in power, it was a lesson in integrity, it's a lesson in staying the course and you know while I was there got to know people like [HistoryMaker] John Lewis.  Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] just became again another lifelong friend, somebody's who been with me at every important kind of touch point in my life subsequent to that Coretta Scott King. So Atlanta, Atlanta was, Atlanta was my mecca, Mecca, Medina [Saudi Arabia] and Jerusalem all packaged into one. And you know from political power to understanding our potential power all of these became things. These, these were my bags that I traveled to Boston [Massachusetts] with.
Story_ID: 289884
Speaker 1: When I came to Boston [Massachusetts] as a graduate student at Harvard [Harvard Divinity School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], one of the things I did was to work for the Black Ecumenical Commission [Boston, Massachusetts] and while there was charged with the responsibility helping the commission trying to figure out an agenda for itself within the context of Boston. And at that point the attitude was very much in the political sense that you know African Americans were a minority so what we could do politically was very limited so the thing that we actually did at the commission was an analysis, an updated analysis of the black community and what we discovered was that the population was larger than most folks would think and as was reflected in common conversation and as a result of that the political potential was much greater. And so under the auspices of the Black Ecumenical Commission, we did what I believe is still in terms of low tech it's the most successful voter registration drive we did in Boston 'cause it was that that made the pre--the context for John [D.] O'Bryant getting elected to the school committee and subsequently Jean [McGuire] and then finally Bruce [Bolling] to the [Boston] City Council and quite frankly you know, this push toward district representation, if retrospectively I wished we had a more rigorous debate about it. Even then I felt it was a wrong move because again this is coming out of the Atlanta [Georgia] experience that politics is not about participation, it's about power, it's about power. And, and, and you wanna continue to expand your representation so that it translates into the power to affect an agenda and thus a set of, of, of outcomes. So you know we then kind of got this thing going.
Story_ID: 289885
Speaker 1: I left Harvard [Harvard Divinity School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], was started out at this very small church out in Dorchester [Boston, Massachusetts] at Wesley United Methodist Church [Dorchester, Boston, Massachusetts] out in Lower Mills [Dorchester, Boston, Massachusetts] out by the Walter Baker Chocolate Factory [Walter Baker and Co. Ltd., Dorchester, Boston, Massachusetts]. The bishop put me out there. The community was in transition and the hope and expectation was that I would help galvanize and create a multiracial ministry. I was there eighteen months, and they--
Speaker 2: Were you ordained through Wesley? Or where were you ordained?
Speaker 1: I was ordained, I was ordained as a--there are two ministerial orders in the Methodist church, deacon and I was ordained in Missouri, which was where I grew up my home conference, and then I became an elder, I was ordained an elder, which is the highest ministerial order in the Methodist church here in, in Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was at Wesley for eighteen months and then Union [United Methodist Church, Boston, Massachusetts] church was in a very difficult period, it was a very difficult period--
Speaker 2: What was the name of the church where you went? Union?
Speaker 1: Union. United Methodist Church down in the South End [Boston, Massachusetts], and you know I was I felt I was bright enough full of piss and vinegar you know, feeling my oats, twenty-nine years old. You know as a church that traces its roots back to 1796 huge building, distinguished history. Never would have been a spot where they would have put a twenty-nine year old guy after pastoring eighteen months in a small church except they were desperate and I was too stupid to know any better. And went there and we did some great things. Served at that church for fifteen years (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You certainly put that church on the map in Boston.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. Served fifteen years, fifteen years, longest serving pastor in the history of the church.
Story_ID: 289886
Speaker 1: While I was there a couple of things happened. One in '84 [1984] Jesse [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] made his first run for the presidency and coming out of that experience got to know him a little bit better than I had previously. And we discussed the possibility of going to PUSH [Operation PUSH; Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois] and we hit a bump in the road and primarily the bump being he didn't wanna give up enough authority and my point to him was quite simply, you know if I take over PUSH, I'm guarantee to get all of your enemies, and if I'm lucky I'll get half of your friends and if I don't have enough control to bring people who would gravitate toward my leadership, there's no way for me to succeed in this. We could resolve that issue and people that I begun to talk to around the country about should I do this? If I do it are you with me ba, ba, ba, once the, the, the PUSH thing was no longer on the table, those same folks called me and said look your vision about what we need to be doing on the economic front is on point and with or without PUSH, we need to do it. And so folks coalesced around me and we started organization for a new economy--
Speaker 2: Economy or equality?
Speaker 1: Equality. Well that was the big debate in the very beginning.
Speaker 2: Oh it was?
Speaker 1: The big debate was whether we call the organization for the new economy or organization for a new equality? And we opted for equality.
Speaker 2: Ah you still senior pastor at Union United [Union United Methodist Church, Boston, Massachusetts] when you moved on this (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When we started on it, I was still the senior minister at Union Church.
Speaker 2: Okay. All right.
Speaker 1: And the church was very gracious and good about supporting the organization--
Speaker 2: That's what I wanted to hear, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Very, very gracious about supporting the organization. They provided you know at one point we were doing the space up in my office--suite of offices where I was and it was kind of crowded and congested and actually one of the old timers who used to give me a little bit of a trouble, the little bit of trouble came up into administrative board meeting and said well it's too crowded and congested. He got these people working here, blah, blah, blah. And the administrative board passed almost unanimously. I mean he voted against it, maybe one other person, but about sixty people all voted to give me more space in, in the basement of the church and create a suite of offices for ONE [Organization for a New Equality, Boston, Massachusetts] downstairs.
Story_ID: 289887
Speaker 1: --We did that and then seized on an opportunity here in Boston [Massachusetts], which folks really don't appreciate really how monumental it was and that was to get this community reinvestment thing off the dime. I had developed a relationship with Dick Syron [Richard F. Syron] who was then the chairman of--the president of the Fed [Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Boston, Massachusetts] here in Boston--
Speaker 2: Of the what? Oh the Fed.
Speaker 1: The Fed in Boston and we were starting to put heat on the banks, and there was a news story on discrimination and the bank said well you know that's not you know nobody's really done this study. As a matter fact by this point I met with Greenspan [Alan Greenspan], the chairman of Fed [Federal Reserve System] about this whole issue and his response to it was well you know that's not rational and if banks could make money in the black community, they'd be doing it and I said Mr. Chairman, that's the nature of racism. It is irrational. And so Dick Syron agreed to do the study. And then what the study showed is that when you talk about lending there's something like eight or nine variables, seven of which are relevant. And when you had a black person with exactly the same credit profile as a white person, the white person was five times more likely to get a home mortgage. Well at that point the banks couldn't take issue with it so then the negotiations really started. We worked out what became the first comprehensive community reinvestment agreement in the world. And I say in the world because now in South Africa, they are doing the same stuff there with community reinvestment that we started right here in Boston. It was a five hundred million dollar agreement. Folks said well how'd you come up with five hundred million and the answer to that question is it just sounded like a good number. There's nothing magical about it, wasn't any great analysis, but it was five hundred million. We then got and I tell folks at Ford [Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan] it was the best twenty-five thousand dollars they ever gave. They gave us twenty-five thousand dollars. We convened the meeting at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and brought activist together from around the country to talk about what we had done, codified it and then people started doing investment agreements all around the country. I then sent that template to a friend [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] of mine who at that point was a little known southern governor, small state in Arkansas. He was very fascinated by this whole thing and then we went on to get him elected president and one of the first things he called me on was let's look at trying to revise the regulations governing CRA [Community Reinvestment Act] to reflect what you've been able to do. We did and according to The New York Times--this is several months ago--according to The New York Times since the revision of those regulations driven by the stuff we started here in Boston $1.7 trillion in credit and capital been directed toward low and moderate income communities and communities of color in this country.
Story_ID: 289888
Speaker 1: You know that was ONE [Organization for a New Equality, Boston, Massachusetts] and during Clinton's [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] second term, I, I won't tell you the whole story which is we'll save for another occasion, but I mean the long and short of it is he, he said look I want you to go to Tanzania. I'm serious about this African growth and opportunity initiative. Most folks think it's only South Africa. I need to put several of you all in strategic spots on the continent and given what you know about dealing with undercapitalized communities some of those same principals have got to be relevant to undercapitalized countries. And so he asked me to go to Tanzania and that was the reason why little did we know when he initially asked me to go, that something else more profound would happen, which gave it even more of a providential air, and that being the bombing of the embassy [in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania].
Speaker 2: When he offered you the ambassadorship to Tanzania, I guess maybe just the two of you I don't know, how did you feel about that at that time? How did you feel about that offer?
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: How, how do you remember how you felt personally?
Speaker 1: Well, well, several things. I mean one the initial phone call came and you know my talking to the White House was nothing new or my people in the office by this time I had opened an office matter of fact in Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 2: For ONE organization?
Speaker 1: For ONE. We had an ONE office in Washington, one in Kansas City [Kansas] and quite frankly we're negotiating to open an office out in San Francisco [California]. And actually a couple of friends had said would you submit our our names for a potential ambassadorships during the second term? And I said well that's not on my radar screen 'cause I told Clinton when he got elected that I'd never ask him for anything personally and I never did. Never did. So I submitted their name they called--must have called about they want to talk to you about the ambassadorships. I assume it was the two people that I had set up right? And I'm being playful when I answer the phone, okay so what do you wanna offer me, the Court of Saint James or Paris [France]? And the response came back after a moment of the pregnant silence, both of those are open. So I say okay let's start this conversation over. What is this about? Well the president and Vice President [Al Gore] were talking about folks that they wanted a part of the team to represent this country and your name came up and they wanted to know are you interested in at least having a conversation about it. I had a bishop once who told me always keep your options open. I said yeah let's talk. And then about a week or so later, the president called me at home and you know said look I know you need to think about this but this is why I want you to come and I been talking to Deborah [HistoryMaker Deborah Prothrow-Stith] about it. I mean there were issues relative to her career, there were issues relative to the kids [Percy Stith and Mary Stith]. My mother-in-law [Mildred Boutin Prothrow] was living with us. You know how did she fit into this mix? You know our work with O&E [Organization for a New Equality (ONE)] was going fantastically. As I said we were negotiating in opening office out in San Francisco and so it was, it was, it was a difficult decision and, and I actually the thing that, that, that turned the tide on this at least emotionally for me I was down in Washington at the White House for this apology to the Tuskegee, the, the experiment [Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male], and it's actually a picture, I'm not sure if it's in the office or at home, but there's a picture of me and Al Gore talking to each other and it seems as if it's a part of the ceremony, but the picture was actually snapped at exact moment when he had pulled me to the side and he said you know I want you to know that I'm as hot on you doing this Tanzania thing as the president and we need you to do this.
Story_ID: 289889
Speaker 1: Afterwards I called Deborah [HistoryMaker Deborah Prothrow-Stith] and I said you know the president [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] has asked us to do this. The vice president [Vice President Al Gore] just pigeonholed me in the White House [Washington, D.C.]. I think the conversation we need to have needs to change from not whether we do it, but how do we make this work now. So we did the process was extremely arduous and oh it was murderous. It was, it was--first of all the forms that they give you to fill out are so voluminous and again as a child of the '60s [1960s] this radical, this you know kind of distrust in the government you know. Do I want the government to know this much stuff about me? At least with me volunteering it they probably had files on me any way but do I wanna volunteer this? And the thought of this has literally made my head hurt. I had to set the papers down. I didn't pick them up for a month. And so I finally, I started plowing through, through the papers and we finally got this stuff done and then you had the games that the republicans were playing with all the Clinton's nominees and [Senator] Jesse Helms held up the whole ball of wax and it just a very short antidote. I was in Los Angeles [California] preaching out at West Angeles Church and I've actually subsequently come back and told the story out there and I preached the sermon and afterwards I said to the people at church you know I really would like you all to remember me in your prayers because I now understand this ambassadorial thing in a way that I hadn't before and for me this is not simply a presidential appointment. This is the divine anointment. This is, this is God's work that I'm called to do and I want you to remember me in your prayers and the Jesse Helms and them holding this thing up. After the service is over this woman came up to me and she held my hand and looked me in the eye and she said you know I'm gonna remember you in my prayers because you asked me to but you don't ever need to forget that everything happens in God's time. It might not happen in your time it's gonna happen in God's time. And I smiled gratuitously, and shook her hand and kissed her on the cheek and I didn't think about that any more until my first day in Tanzania when I walked by that bombed out embassy [in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania] and I saw what was left of my office and it struck me that had we moved according to my time, I wouldn't be alive today having this conversation with you and so here was Jesse Helms assuming that he was trying to be a stumbling block and the law was just using him as a stepping stone to enable me to transition into that position and do what I think and by, by all reasonable estimations was a pretty decent job.
Speaker 2: So the bombing was August I believe right?
Speaker 1: That's right 7th of August [August 7, 1998].
Speaker 2: And you arrived what early September?
Speaker 1: My first day in Tanzania was September the 11th, which meant nothing; that date meant nothing at the time but September 11, 1998.
Story_ID: 289890
Speaker 1: What did you accomplish as the ambassador of Tanzania? What are your achievements that you'd like to share with us (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I mean there are several things. I think one we negotiated the first open skies agreement between the United States and an African country while I was there. Secondly, we got Tanzania as a first country on the continent to get to the decision point on debt relief. Those a couple of very tangible things. In addition to that, it was, it just an improvement in the climate of our relationship with Tanzania that affected our bilateral relations in, in the region. One of the things that I got the--our government to understand where we've got to the point of building a new embassy that we could build at--on another part of the embassy row [in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania] and opt for the, the prestige and standing that come with the building and the arena like that or we could use that $50 million and put it our embassy in a part of the city and, and have that help stimulate growth and, and development and we did it, and it's, it's attracted several million dollars' worth of development in the part of town where we wound up locating, locating the embassy. So I mean I would say that those are some of the things and then you know I think the issues around democratization in Tanzania. I think we were helpful and constructive force and ironically some of the most substantive discussions that we had around democratization in Tanzania occurred after the election in 2000. So you know I think, I think we had a pretty good run--
Story_ID: 289891
Speaker 1: --had a pretty good run (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did your family go to Tanzania with you?
Speaker 1: Everybody went. My daughter [Mary Stith] finished her last year of high school at the International School of Tanganyika [Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania].  She still has friends literally all over the world with whom she was in school. Our son, Percy [Stith], took a year off from college and was my unofficial aide at camp. Deborah [HistoryMaker Deborah Prothrow-Stith]--
Speaker 2: And she's a--tell us okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Deborah's a physician, an authority on adolescent violence, former commissioner of public health. It was during her tenure public health commissioner that she introduced this notion to the nation of violence as a public health issue and not simply a criminal justice issue.
Speaker 2: Now she was with the Harvard School of Public Health [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts] at the point you accepted the ambassadorship?
Speaker 1: She was at the Harvard School, which is where she still is.
Speaker 2: Yeah. But she went to Tanzania, what did she do there quickly?
Speaker 1: Well what happened is that we--they worked out, they were very gracious and worked out a deal where she was able to spend a considerable amount of time in Tanzania and she got involved in aide stuff. She was very, very helpful in the, in the early days of the bombing in the aftermath of the bombing you know as we start to do needs assessments with the--and the health infrastructure in, in Tanzania. She was--you know she could speak doctor so she was very, very helpful as we kind of walked through and tried to assess you know their needs because the Tanzanians were overly generous to us in the aftermath of that bombing and they didn't have much in the way of resources or infrastructure, but they, they gave us access to the best that they had as a country, and so a part of our way of saying thank you was to look at ways to help them build up that infrastructure so that if they had some other sort of emergency, God forbid it be another bombing but, but you know, can have you know an air crash. You can--there are any number of things that can happen but to help them beef up their capacity she was very helpful in helping us understand those, those needs. And then my mother-in-law [Mildred Boutin Prothrow] who went with us, was eighty at the time, we were a little concerned about how she'd take to the experience. And at the end of the run, her only issue was why did she have to go? She understood why I needed to leave, but her question was why she had to go?  It was a great experience all the way around I mean, I mean personally, politically, spiritually, just great, it was a great experience.
Story_ID: 289892
Speaker 1: You completed your ambassadorship appointment [to Tanzania] in the year 2001 and you came to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] where you now are the president and director of the African Presidential Archives and Research Center. Tell us about this African--
Speaker 2: Well the idea really, they're kind of two genesis of, of the idea. One the more general in Tanzania there was an issue with trying to get the president of Zanzibar [President Salmin Amour] out of office. He was a really bad actor and one of the sticking points I felt was that the guy didn't have anything to do after he left the office. So this whole notion of how do you continue to keep people like that engaged in a meaningful way after office? There's life after the presidency. There's something that needs to be on the table as we think about you know what you do to advance democratization free market reform on the continent. The other thing was I was here in November of 2000 having lunch with John Silber who was then chancellor of the university. John, I'd known for twenty years, he's somebody that I respected a great deal and with whom you know he and I had a relationship over the years. We got together for lunch down at the Algonquin Club [of Boston, Boston, Massachusetts], dissected the election and then he raised the question, he said you know given what we been doing in Boston [Massachusetts] with African studies, second oldest program in the country, given your perspective as a U.S. ambassador, what kinds of things do you think we need to be paying attention to? And I said to him without missing a beat, that the present period in the history of modern African is as significant as any. The '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s] the quintessential question for leadership on the continent was how did Africans get their countries back? The question in this millennium moving forward is now that Africans have their countries back, how do they make them work. And on the continent there is a generation of leaders that is--has embraced with relish the challenge of answering that question. Now there's a trend toward democratization and free market reform on the continent and a hundred years from now if you wanna understand why some countries on the continent flourished and others floundered it's this period going out for the next thirty years that you wanna look at. He thought it was very interesting idea talk with the president, provost and then he and I talked several weeks after and he said you know if you serious about this, why don't we see if you can make it work here at Boston University? It was a gutsy move on his part and on the part of the administration 'cause clearly something like this given the extent to which Africa is marginalized and denigrated is a risky move.  It's a risky move. Matter of fact the first major article on the center which appeared in the front page of The Wall Street Journal suggested that what we were creating was a retirement home, a rest home, a rest home for retired dictators. So you knew you were gonna take hits like that and you needed an administration that was confident enough and cocky enough to say yeah okay give us your best shot but we know what we're doing and we're gonna make this work.  And so you know what we are endeavoring to do here is to chronicle contemporary trends and developments on the continent and there's some exciting things going on and for us [at the African Presidential Archives and Research Center, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] the proof of the pudding when we got ready to do our first brochure on the continent and we were trying to get pictures and I was saying I wanted to, to get some pictures that you know characterized that, you know Africa as urbane and Africa as modern. And we went to all of these traditional sources where you go for photos like this and what we discovered is if you wanted pictures of elephants and lions man we can get those for days. If you wanted pictures of you know soldiers with machete, we can, we can get those for days. If we wanted pictures of little kids sitting around with bloated bellies and flies flying all out of they nose, we get those for days. But we couldn't get the kind of stuff that we were trying to document so that was another validation of, of what we were trying to do. So you know we started out the folks at Fleet Bank [FleetBoston Financial, Boston, Massachusetts] understood it, they got it, gave us a million dollar grant to see the residency, which was a core program for the center residency program for former African heads of state. And then we've subsequent to that gotten support from the Rockefeller Foundation [New York, New York], Carnegie, Boeing, a number of other entities around the country.
Story_ID: 289893
Speaker 1: --folio of programs (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So in addition to the residential program for the former presidents of African country, what other major, other major programs did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well we do--we develop our own archival of content you know policy documents, major speeches we do twice a year [through the African Presidential Archives and Research Center, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts]. We go over and do videotape and still photography. We visit some of the same places, so over thirty years you know extensively over a thirty year period, you'll be able to see one corner in Dar es Salaam [Tanzania] over thirty years. We do a State of African Leader--State of Africa report. I mean one of the things that I discovered in Tanzania when I was ambassador that if you wanted human rights reports on Africa, you get that from amnesty. If you wanted corruption reports, you'd get that from transparency at Transparency International [Berlin, Germany]. But there was no central location where you can go to get the perspective of the people who are running these countries relative to what they thought. So we decided that we developed this African leaders' State of Africa report where we provide a venue for, for African leadership to talk about what they're trying to accomplish. What are the problems as they see them? What are the opportunities as they see them? What is the vision? And you know the point again being that it's not particularly jazzy on a year-to-year basis, but you mean you think about it a hundred years from now a scholar will be able to come to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] or any of the constituent institutions we relate to to get this report and they'll be able to sit down and they'll be able to pull off the shelf thirty years of the perspective of a leader or a series of leaders about what was going on in their country for a pedagogical perspective, man that's awesome. I mean that is awe- as the kids would say that is off the hook. We do a round table where we pull together former African heads of state to look at policy issues and how they as elders statesman can be helpful. The third one is coming up April the 8th in Johannesburg [South Africa] where we will be looking at a couple of issues. We'll be getting briefed on the Blair commission report on Africa [Commission for Africa report] and we're gonna be looking at Africa's image in the western media.  We'll then come to Boston [Massachusetts] the 12th and 13th of April where we'll look at--we'll, we'll hear from the Corporate Council on Africa [Washington, D.C.] as well as a couple of people from the administration. So that's an element. We also do a collaborative with five other universities. The University of [the] Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, the University of Dar es Salaam [Dar es Salaam, Tanzania], the University of Ghana [Accra, Ghana], Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] and Elizabeth City State University in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, and in that group we do a number of things to facilitate conversation and enable another generation of students and scholars to understand Africa better and to understand U.S. policy vis a vis Africa.
Story_ID: 289894
Speaker 1: Good, I wanted to ask you about the collaboratives with the African universities and Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], that's--I'm glad you brought that up.
Speaker 2: The, the, the idea of the collaborative and it was a part of the initial design is that if African studies is going to evolve particularly as it relates to politics and, and economics, that you've gotta move this next generation of scholars from trying to answer questions that nobody is asking, you know as I said this is a very dynamic period in the history of, of the continent and you got policymakers and political leaders and leaders in the public sector and the private sector who are raising a whole host of questions about what Africa needs to do to facilitate the democratization, what they need to do in order to create more transparent economies and so there's a unique opportunity for scholars to, to get on the cutting edge and to provide some insights, and so this collaborative that we've done with three African universities, two historically black colleges [HBCUs] and Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts], is an attempt to kind of jump start this process of getting scholars to begin to think differently about how they participate in this dynamic change that's taking place on the continent.
Story_ID: 289895
Speaker 1: A few wrap up questions, Ambassador. How do you feel about the way that you've led your life?
Speaker 2: It's been--well I, I think I you know first of all you know I'm, I'm fundamentally a preacher and as MacArthur [General Douglas MacArthur] said you know old like about old soldiers you know old preachers never die they--I don't even think we fade away. You know I, I, I've never attempted to present myself as a, a holy man in the sense of Mahatma Gandhi but I do consider myself a man of hope and I tried to keep faith. I came to appreciate something a long time ago that has served me well and that is as I go about living my life and trying to provide leadership, I think I've been blessed by God to be able to provide that I don't have to try to lead a great movement, I just have to be faithful in the moment. And you know I, I, I think I've, I've think I've done that.  I think I've, I've represented myself well. I've been true to my instincts and my vision and as my mama [Dorothy Thompson Stith] would say I don't think I've embarrassed the family.  At another level, you know I've done things and seen things and been a part of stuff that I just--I couldn't have imagined in terms of the kind of change that we've seen in this country.  I mean you know at a young age being able to work--well at a young age being able to, to help shake the foundations of segregation in St. Louis, Missouri, to being able to get folks at my small college in Kansas [Baker University, Baldwin City, Kansas] to think different about the issue of diversity to working on Maynard's [Maynard Jackson] campaign for mayor in Atlanta [Georgia] and, and see under black leadership, under black leadership one of the most dynamic cities of this century to coming to Boston [Massachusetts] and being a part of the tremendous evolution in this city. The, the physically, politically, spiritually this is a different place than it was thirty years ago and, and to have been a part of that in a meaningful way this is, the community reinvestment stuff you know is it as jazzy as police brutality and that kind of stuff? No. But that we were a part of something that enabled trillions, trillions of dollars to create a whole new generation of, of middle class African Americans and Latinos in this country and other people of color.  It's a great thing to have been, to have been a part of and then what we're trying to do in African now. So I mean and from a professional perspective it's been overwhelming, overwhelmingly positive and productive beyond my imagination at a personal level, it's been a great ride man.  You know I've got a wife [HistoryMaker Deborah Prothrow-Stith] that I respect and adore. I've got two children [Mary Stith and Percy Stith] of whom I couldn't be any more proud, two nephews [Trey Edmonson and Tony Franklin] that we've helped to raise about whom I feel the, the same way. You know except for the cold you know I like Boston.  I mean the winters are starting to wear on me a little bit but you know, you know I'm a, I'm a guy man who, who as I said the first time I flew on an airplane I was twenty years old.  I mean I can remember by the time I--when my--at the age my kids had their passport we used to go out to the airport just to watch planes take off and imagine where they might be going. And I literally fly around the world at least once a year, literally fly around the world at least once a year, and have done so. I've been to, to almost every continent, I've been wherever I wanted to go. I've--you know sat at tables with kings and presidents and tasted the best life has had to offer you know I called my kids the other day. I took them two years ago we went to see Bobby Short and I said you know you gotta see this guy. You gotta see him. He's, he's an icon. He won't be around, and they Bobby who? And we got CDs and we played them and got them ready and they you know to get your kids to go out New Year's Eve, which is a pretty big deal, they loved it. You know to be able to experience a guy like this it's my twenty-first birthday I went to see Ray Charles. It's been a good life man, you know and you know have I had my share of heartache and, and pain and the answer to that is yeah and I mean one of the things--
Speaker 1: Well it's far from over oh yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think about I wish, I wish my brother [James Butler]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, had been alive when I was appointed ambassador to, to Tanzania, he would have loved that.
Story_ID: 289896
Speaker 1: Well, your work is not finished and your life is not over, but let me ask you this, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I think two things. You know this is a point that you know I wasn't a holy man but a man of hope and I was faithful in the moment. As I was challenged to make the most of my life and as I was challenged to make the times in which I lived better.
Story_ID: 289897
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What are your hopes and concerns from this point on for the African American community?
Speaker 2: I, you know I'd like to see us continue to, to move on the trajectory that we're on and, and a part of that means becoming more sophisticated as we do our politics. You know I think the--and, and I have great debates with friends about this all the time. I mean I think you know I kind of knee jerk response to a George Bush [President George Walker Bush]. I think is, it's unhealthy politically. Because at the end of the day again it goes back to this initial lesson that I learned, politics isn't about representation, it's about power, it's about outcomes. And you know George Bush; you know the most we were able to get for HIV Aids [human immunodeficiency virus, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] in Africa under Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] was five hundred million. This guy has put fifteen billion dollars on table. Millennium Challenge Account, $5 billion to help grow nations and economies. In the first term George Bush's, half of George Bush's cabinet was made up of people of color and women, unprecedented in the history of this country. If you're serious about power, you'd look at a way to validate those things that are important to your interest and you still maintain your integrity, it mean you don't, you don't swallow everything. You take issue with the things with which you ought to take issue but you validate the stuff that's important because this is when you know you've arrived when your interest aren't seasonal, and that's where we need to, that's, that's where we need to be. So my aspiration is that we get more sophisticated about how we protect and further our, our interest that we also understand that we--it's a tremendous opportunity in engaging Africa, it's a tremendous opportunity.
Story_ID: 289898
Speaker 1: You know Africa has always been central to the global economy. You know this stuff about we need to get Africa in global, Africa has always been central to global economy, with the slave trade that helped develop the new world and enriched the old world, it was central to the global economy. As a continent it was colonized. It was central to the global economy. Even today essential minerals like coal tan without which would couldn't make computer chips that drive 21st century high tech global economy. Africa is central to the global economy. The issue is whether or not Africa will benefit in a way that is reflective of its contribution. And to the extent that that happens, is going to be correlative to the extent to which African Americans understand the potential that Africa possesses and the extent to which Africans appreciate the potential that African American's represent. African Americans have an aggregate income of close to $650 billion. If that would--if we talked about that as GDP we'd be the ninth largest economy in the world. I would eventually guess, I have not done the research, but I would venture to guess that less than .0001 percent of that $650 million finds its way to Africa in anyway shape, form or fashion, and the continent is happening down there, it's happening. We celebrated my wife's [HistoryMaker Deborah Prothrow-Stith] fiftieth birthday at Ron Gault [HistoryMaker Ronald T. Gault] and his wife, [HistoryMaker] Charlayne Hunter-Gault's, house in Johannesburg [South Africa]. Westcliff [Johannesburg, South Africa], they lived literally a cliff overlooking Johannesburg and a hundred people you know the hoi polloi of South Africa out here. Bands playing, Nelson Mandela and we're doing the toi toi, and we're looking out over Johannesburg and I'm looking at my wife going man it doesn't get any better than this.  It's an exciting time on the continent of Africa. But we still have these images of, of Tarzan, we still have these images of babies with bloated bellies and does some of that stuff exist? The short answer is yes. You know all that wars and rumors of wars the answer to that is yes. But you got countries like these fourteen that we track that are at different points on the spectrum in terms of developing, but its stuff going on. I was in Benin with the president of--Soglo [Nicephore Soglo] a month ago and while he was president, he's the former president now. But while he was president he had this memorial built to the transshipment point of slaves in Cotonou [Benin] was actually Ouidah [Benin], which is about twenty-five kilometers from Cotonou and he built this ark very simple but, but powerful, the, the door of no return. And I walked through that door and it was, it wasn't--both chilling and exhilarating and the thing that struck me is that through 17th century eyes, this must have been an absolutely haunting experience, but through 21st century eyes I walked through that door and I looked to the left and I looked to the right. It was one of the most beautiful expansions of beach I've seen anywhere in the world. And I start to think about all the resorts that could be there and what that could mean in terms of employment opportunities, and what it could mean in terms of wealth creation and what it could mean in terms, just going over and having a, a great old time. It's a lot of potential on the continent and there's an opportunity for us to do well and to do good while doing well by engaging in that regard. So those are some of the things that you know I'd like to see happen and while our mission at the university [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] is pedagogical, I do believe there's an element of, more than an element, but an essential voracity to this biblical notice that the truth will set you free. I believe that the more truth, the more light we can shed on the truth about Africa's story because there's so much bad information and misinformation that the aggregate effect will be transforming.
