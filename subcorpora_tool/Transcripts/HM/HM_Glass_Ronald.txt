Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: That's an interesting spelling of Earle; is there a story behind that?
Speaker 2: That's what Momma [Lethia Gibson Glass] said (laughter).  She did tell me--she told me something about--she told me something about why she put an E on the end of the E-A-R-L-E but I, I don't remember what it was.

Story_ID: 290688
Speaker 1: All right, now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we ask as sort of a warm-up, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: A favorite food?
Speaker 1: I think we were just talking about the fact that (laughter) I'm a little bit partial to frozen yogurt (laughter); I don't know that that's my favorite food, but--you know, I'd, I'd be hard put to say one, but in the interest of time, say grits.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 1: Somewhere in the brown spectrum.
Speaker 2: Okay--a favorite time of the year.
Speaker 1: Spring.
Speaker 2: Okay--a favorite vacation destination.
Speaker 1: South Seas.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 1: Probably not, probably not.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: From the way friends respond to me, if I had a, a--you know, something that I would be known by, or recognized about me, or something like that, it would probably be laughter.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  That's probably right, and from what (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 290689
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and I'm not gonna forget your father [Crump Glass]; I'm gonna ask about his side, too, but we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name, and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Lethia, L-E-T-H-I-A, Mae, M-A-E, Gibson, G-I-B-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is Gibson her maiden name, or--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: It was November the 11th, 1913.
Speaker 1: All right and where was she born?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  My mother was born in Mississippi, but I don't know the exact city--maybe Sardis [Mississippi]--Sardis, Mississippi, perhaps?
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--well, what do you know about your ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace them?  Are there any stories about what your ancestors did?
Speaker 2: I, I can't go very far back; I knew my mother's father [Robert Gibson], but my mother's mother [Lena Gibson] died when she was thirty-eight so I don't, I don't know about her, but I, I met--I met my mother's father.  He was--but I, I, I don't know very much about them.  I don't, I don't know very much about grandparents, period.
Speaker 1: So, you met your grandfather once--
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: --but you--was that in Mississippi (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, not once; I saw him quite a few times.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He lived in Memphis [Tennessee], and as a kid, we used to--but we--I lived in Evansville [Indiana]. I used to visit Memphis a lot, and I would see him there and, you know, spend a little time with him.  I didn't spend a lot of time with him--around him, though, because he, he smelled like Witch hazel 'cause he was (laughter), he was always, you know, he was always doctoring something, you know, so--but he was an interesting funny little man; had the bald head and--.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your mother grow up in Memphis?
Speaker 2: You know what?  I don't think so. I think my mother grew up--I think they grew up in this little town in Mississippi, and then they came to Memphis. Now when they came to Memphis, though I, I, I can't--I, I, I, I don't know; I can't account for that.  You know, my mother might have been born in Memphis, actually.
Speaker 1: With the family roots in Sardis?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, 'cause I know Poppa had a couple of brothers, but when we went to Memphis we, we stayed with my father's sisters, and so--unless--'til--Momma came to Memphis like once during the summer, then we would get connected up with Momma's side of the family; the rest of the time it was with, you know, Daddy's folks.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, are there any stories--before we go to your father's side, are there any stories passed down through your mother's side about life in Mississippi or in Memphis?
Speaker 2: Not a lot, not a lot because my mother--like I said, her mother died when--her mother was like thirty-eight or something like that, so that means that my mother was probably, I don't know, 18, 19, 20 years old--something like that, perhaps, when her, when her mother died.  The only thing I used to hear--my mother used to say that her father, that Poppa--she didn't--my mother did not finish high school because she said in her senior year, Poppa wouldn't pay for her books, or somethin' like that, so in later years when she decided she was going to complete her GED [General Educational Development], that story would come up, you know. But aside from that and, you know, some stories about the other family that Poppa had after he--after my maternal grandmother passed away, then the other family that he raised and had, there would be, you know, these sort of disgusted kind of comments about them (laughter), you know, but other than that, there wasn't a lot of--lot of information.
Story_ID: 290690
Speaker 1: Well, did your mother [Lethia Gibson Glass] talk about growing up, or--.
Speaker 2: She didn't, she didn't--neither did my father [Crump Glass], you know?  It was all about--and I guess I've kind of inherited that from both of them; it's all kind of about right now, you know?
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, they didn't refer to the [Great] Depression or racism in the South, or any of those kinda things?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah; I mean they (laughter)--you know, of course they talked about it, you know, but my mother, my mother never--she didn't really talk about racism so much as--she would simply refer to the fact on occasion, you know; she'd say, "You know, you guys ought to this, you guys ought to that"--in terms of taking advantage of different possibilities, because we didn't have that, you know.  Or (laughter) I remember once I went to--my mother's sister lived in Memphis [Tennessee] and, and, and was a victim of, of crippling arthritis her whole life, and she used to always say that--when we would come to visit there, she would ask us questions about what it was like in Evansville [Indiana], you know, because that was up North to her (laughter).  I mean you'd have--the way she talked about it, I mean it was Canada, you know, "What is it like up there," you know, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And she would say things like, "You know, y'all sure are lucky 'cause these ole--these mean ole white folks down here won't even work us," (laughter), you know.  I mean--so, I, I was aware that there was, there was some consideration (laugher), you know, about, about the, the race relations let's say.
Story_ID: 290691
Speaker 1: --Let's go on over to your daddy's [Crump Glass] side and we'll come back and put 'em both together, but what was your father's full name?  Can you--
Speaker 2: Crump.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: C-R-U-M-P; that got Brock's [HistoryMaker Paul Brock] attention--Paul's attention (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, his first name was Crump?
Speaker 2: Crump.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Crump Allen--Allen, A-L--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's interesting--
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: --the point he just made on the side that, you know, Memphis [Tennessee] is--you got Mayor Crump [E.H. Crump] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's who he was named after.
Speaker 1: He was named after Mayor Crump?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Crump Allen, A-L-L-E-N, I think, or A-N, Allen--I think it's E-N (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Crump Allen, okay.
Speaker 2: Glass, G-L-A-S-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: August 27th; I think he was also 1913, I believe.
Story_ID: 290692
Speaker 1: And well, what do you know about your--the ancestors on your father's [Crump Glass] side?  How far back can you trace those ancestors?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I'm lucky I know him (laugher) on that side (laughter).  You know, I knew my grandmother; her name was Ella Glass.  I think she had a--this is so odd; I'm not sure whether it was--I'm not sure whether it was my maternal or paternal grandmother who had a sister whose, whose name was Crockett [ph.] but, in any event, my father's father was--I think his last name was actually Miller; what his first name was, I don't know.
Speaker 1: It wouldn't be Barney (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's very good (laughter).
Speaker 1: Sorry, sorry about the (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I, but I have to tell you; you know, it's interesting that you say that 'cause Hal [Linden] used to always say that, that I looked exactly like his grandfather, you know, and that (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Hal Linden the--yeah.
Speaker 2: Hal Linden, yeah--that we could have--his grandfather and I could be brothers or something, so--.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): May have been.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  May have been.
Speaker 2: May (laughter)--.
Speaker 1: You know, after five hundred and something of these interviews, I'm--I would not be surprised.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I would not be surprised.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's pretty amazing.  So, anyway, there's--see, my, my father nor his sisters would talk about any of this, so the only way I know any of this is there was a cousin, who's now ninety-one, who lives in, in Miami [Florida], who actually sent me a picture of my daddy's father, who apparently was--had some kind of a big farm or something somewhere down in Mississippi. And apparently, my grandmother worked for--I don't know if it was for him or for his father, and then when the liaison between him and the grandmother was uncovered, he had to ship the grandmother and that--and those people up to Memphis [Tennessee] and they--the other family stayed in Mississippi, so the things that went on with these people were, were pretty covert in terms of--. So, if I'd ask--I had the, the one aunt--I mean Aunt Net [ph.], if you ask her what's goin' on, she'd say, "Dip, dip, dip, dip--mind your own business," you know; it was like the stuff you didn't talk about.  There was some, there was some concern; we had--there was a--there were three girls and a boy in my father's family, and apparently there was another boy whose name was Buddy, who--they lived in one of those shotgun houses that had a little garage or somethin' back--you know, disconnected but back in the back, and apparently in the summertime, he had been put out there and, I don't know, had some kind of a netting or something, you know, covering--taking a nap or something, and they went out when it was time for him to wake up or something; I guess he may have been two or three or something like that, and discovered that he had been smothered. And so, you know, the assumption was that he had been, you know, killed because the neighbor, the neighbors were uncomfortable with the kind of relationship that was producing these kids. And so it, it, it made for a certain kind of isolationism (laughter) in, in that--you know, that Glass part of the, part of the family, so they didn't talk about a lotta stuff.  I guess it didn't feel safe somehow.
Story_ID: 290693
Speaker 1: --Your father [Crump Glass] talk about growing up, and did he grow up in Memphis [Tennessee], I guess?
Speaker 2: He definitely grew up in Memphis, but he didn't--no, he didn't--the only time I saw--. See, my mother [Lethia Gibson Glass] and father separated when I was a year old, so Mom and the kids stayed in Evansville [Indiana], and Daddy went back to Memphis, so the only time I saw Daddy was in the summertime, and by that time he was livin' with another woman and raising another family, so the actual time--the only time I really saw him was Friday night when he got off from work before the money was spent, so I could get that quarter (laughter). That was about, that was about it, you know, for a long time.
Speaker 1: So did you spend every summer in Memphis?
Speaker 2: Largely--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, but again, it was staying with my aunt and her sister; they kind of, you know, they kind of did double-duty--and, and, and the [paternal] grandmother [Ella Glass].  But the story that I'd started to tell before (laughter) about the fact is that my Aunt Net [ph.] lived on one side of town and Thelma [ph.] lived on the other side of town.  Thelma, by the was never Aunt Thelma; it was Thelma because aunt meant she was just a little older than she wanted to be referred to as, you know (laughter), so anyway (laugher), so anyway--and I mean even though, I mean, you know, I was two or three years old or somethin' I mean how, how old did that make her anyway?  But that was her, her thing, so--she died about five years ago at ninety-two, and it was still Thelma; none of that aunt stuff (laughter).  But anyway, they--some kinda way, talking on the phone, they decided that my sister and I were going to leave Aunt Net's house on one side of Memphis and go to visit Thelma on the other side of, of Memphis. And nobody had a car and they couldn't find anybody to do this and that, and so forth, and so we took the bus.  So, when we got to Thelma's house, she asked us how we got there, and we told her that we took the bus and she said, "Well, how did you know where to get off?"--you know, in order to--'cause we were only like--my sister's five years older than I am so we must have been either three and eight, or five and--you know, five and--you know, five and--well, maybe four and nine, or something like that.  So, in any event, she said, "Well, how did you guys get here?"  So we said, "Well, we sat behind the bus driver and told him where we were gonna go and asked him to let us know when to get off."  So, the--I don't know, it's like all the air got sucked out of the room, and Thelma got on the phone and called Aunt Net and, you know, there was all this confusion it seemed like, you know, going on on the phone and so forth and so on.  So, anyway, when we got back home to Aunt Net's house, she threatened to whip us, and the reason was because we had sat behind the bus driver and could have been killed, or could have been, you know, really hurt.  But we hadn't--I mean we just had no idea (laughter), you know, that that was, that that was the, the, the way of the day, so--.
Story_ID: 290694
Speaker 1: Could you describe your parents [Lethia Gibson Glass and Crump Glass] for us, you know? What were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Their what?
Speaker 1: --their personalities.
Speaker 2: Oh, their personalities.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: My mother had a very--she had a very hearty kind of laugh and she was, she was a--she used to sing to herself, you know, all the time, and she was kind of--but she seemed to be--she was--she seemed to be a little shy, you know?  She wasn't--but, you know, she wasn't a--she was a domestic, you know, so she wasn't like a, a highly-educated woman, although she was--people seemed to sort of respect her, you know?  She seemed like she--I guess she kinda carried herself well, and she had beautiful legs, by the way (laughter).  But she was a--she was kind of--it was all about her family, you know, than it was about--than I suppose, you know, raising five kids as a single mom; I suppose it would--it better be about your family, you know?  (Laughter) Or else all is, all is, is pretty well lost.  But she worked, and then she--you know, she was very--she very much wanted her kids to have good educations, you know?  I think she was--she wasn't, she wasn't real social in terms of, you know, belonging to a lot of different kinds of clubs and stuff like that, you know; she went to--she was home and church and--you know, I mean she had a friend or two but she wasn't, she wasn't, you know, overly social, I guess, is the way to say it.  And interestingly enough, I guess my father was kinda like that, too, although my father drank so heavily that he, you know, it kind--I, I, I think that kind of limited the scope of his sociability as well, you know.  I think my father, I think my father was a--my father seemed like a kind--like a, like a--I think my father was kind of--was trapped; I think he felt trapped.
Story_ID: 290695
Speaker 1: I'm the only person, certainly in my immediate family, to have graduated from college so, you know, they had a--the Glasses--I mean the people on my father's [Crump Glass] side, they had a, a very, very strong sense of Glass. I mean it was, it was a, it was a, it was al--it, it was like they wore it like a banner.  What it was based on I have no idea (laughter); I, I mean because--I mean nobody had--nobody had a quarter (laughter), nobody had a quarter, nobody went to school, nobody--but they were just--and I don't know. Again, maybe it had something to do with that, that thing that happened with the little boy--with Buddy, where they, you know--I mean my--Aunt Net [ph.] would say things like, you know, you know, "Come in here and wash--wipe your face, blah, blah, blah.  Glasses don't walk up and down the street like that--lookin' like that."  I don't why not (laughter), you know?  I mean I don't know what they were (laughter)--I don't know what they were on about but, but, but it was very strong.
Speaker 2: And I guess since they didn't talk a lot about (unclear), it's hard to really figure why (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But it was--it had something to do with self-respect; it had something to do with being--representing one's self-wealth, not--. Again, Aunt Net, she used to always talk a--she used to always talk about not being common, you know, and not being--so you're always suppo- especially outside the house (laughter).  Once you went outside the door, you were supposed to be really kinda pulled up and representing, you know, fairly responsibly and well.  Based on what, again I don't know, just some kind--I guess just a personal, a personal kind of--really answerable to one's self. Not so much--here I'm doin' like What's His Name; I'm startin' to weigh again, or get into the stuff that's supposed to happen at the end of the interview, I suppose but, in any event, that's kind of--. So, okay, so my dad, I think, was kinda--he--I think he felt kinda trapped. I think he felt like he--and I don't--again, I don't know why. I don't know if it was because maybe he wasn't very interested in school, I don't know.
Story_ID: 290696
Speaker 1: Now, what did he [Glass' father, Crump Glass] do for a living?
Speaker 2: He worked at [AC] Humko [ACH], which was, I think, a large factory--I think; and that's the only job I know that he had. So he was a factory worker.  But I, I, I don't know whether he felt like he couldn't--you know, as, as far as school was concerned, I don't know, maybe he wasn't very interested, but I don't know why he didn't--I don't know why he didn't do better, I don't know why he didn't try harder--I don't, I don't know, I--but I--you know.  So I didn't know him very well because of the relationship, or the strained kinda re- you know, we lived apart. And then when I--and I was young, you know, so when I would go and visit, that was very restricted also because the aunt that we stayed with, she didn't like the woman that Daddy was raising this other family with (laughter), and so she didn't want us over there, and then, you know, it was all of that.  Again, you know, I mean even as I'm talking here, I, I'm starting to realize that there's a, a, a tremendous sense of protectiveness from these women in my daddy's family, and much of it perhaps related to the incident that happened to their younger brother, to Buddy.
Story_ID: 290697
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wanted to ask you, is there a story about how your parents [Lethia Gibson Glass and Crump Glass] met?  Did they--did either one of 'em talk about how they met?
Speaker 2: I don't recall them talking a lot about how they met, but I do recall--I mean one time years, and years, and years, and years, and years, and years, and years (laughter) after they had been separated--they never did get divorced, but they were separated and--. I mean I was twenty-five anyway, so that means that it was twenty-five years at least, you know (unclear). And my mother was in the kitchen and we were talking about something, and she started to say something about a man, and instead of calling this man's name, she called my daddy's name, and she closed her eyes and tears started to run down her face and she hit the side of the sink and she said, "I don't know why, after all this time, I still call his name."  That is probably one of the most--it's just the most (laughter)--it is an incredible tribute, I suppose, or, or--to the love that she had for him and, and I'm sure contained in all of that are, you know, dashed dreams and hopes and all that stuff, so it was, it was a vet--but it was an incredibly poignant homage, perhaps, to that union that produced me (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, you know, it's always good to think of that as special, you know and--. But do you have any idea of why they split?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it, it had--my father not only was a, was a, a drinker, he was also a womanizer, and so I guess after a while, you know, my mother just kinda felt like, "Well, this isn't gonna change," and--.
Speaker 1: Now, you said you had like four broth- four (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Three brothers and a sister, yeah.
Speaker 1: Three brothers and a sister.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They're all your father's (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so they were together long enough to have five children.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. There were two-and-a-half years between all of them, and then my sister was the last one, and then five years later I came.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they were married a while.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --so my sister remained the baby. I just got to be the youngest (laughter).
Story_ID: 290698
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who do you think you--I know you didn't see that much of your father [Crump Glass], but who do you think you take after?  Or what do you take after--from each?
Speaker 2: Again, this cousin that, you know, that--it's kinda like the historian (laughter) as far as, as family stuff's concerned.  She, she says that I remind her of my daddy a lot.  I can--you know, I can see some of it sometimes.  She said that my, my, my father used to have a really hearty laugh and stuff, kinda like a--but I--but perhaps he and my mother [Lethia Gibson Glass] both did; maybe they just didn't do that together (laughter), I don't know. But in any event, my mother--I think I look like her some, you know?  I mean she was--her complexion was darker than mine, quite a bit, but I think that the shape of my face and some, you know, some of those kinds of things, these extra chins and stuff, I think part of that, you know, comes from my mother.  But my mother--because I was raised by her, you know, primarily, I think that I inherited a lot of my style from her, the--you know, my perception of--sort of my, my worldview as a child, I think I kinda got from her, and how to navigate the world, I think I kinda got from her.
Story_ID: 290699
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: There's one, but it's not very clear, it's not very clear. It was a nightmare and I, I, I can't--it had--I don't know, it had something to do with like an orange and green like crocodile or something. I, I don't know (laughter).  And if you know anything really significant about that, please don't tell anyone (laughter).  That, and I remember--you know, we were--we lived in a federal housing project [in Evansville, Indiana], you know, so--'cause we were on welfare and it was like--it was--. But I mean it didn't seem, it didn't seem bad, but I also knew that it was not, you know, abundant, you know what I mean?  I was aware that it was--anyway, I don't, I don't--I guess I don't--I mean--.
Story_ID: 290700
Speaker 1: I didn't ask you this, but why did your mother [Lethia Gibson Glass] move to Evansville [Indiana] from Memphis [Tennessee]?  I mean is there a reason--were there relatives there already, or--
Speaker 2: No, but--and in a certain kinda way, though, I think that my--I had one aunt who was--the, the aunt who was closest to my father [Crump Glass] in age was very protective and, and spoiling, actually, of my father because her mother had told her to always take care of him, and so she, in taking care of him, I think, spoiled him.  Now, this is partially colored by my mother's, you know, slant on it, but then, as I grew older, it makes sense.  So, I think that--and the reason I say that is I think that my father was having these extramarital relationships that were actually maybe, you know, kinda being supported by my aunt (laughter), and my mother was like, you know, like this, like this lone wolf in the wilderness looking for some--. And so, and so--sort of thought, "Well, look, let's gather our little pride and go to Evansville and start over again," because there, there was also economic opportunity there in terms of--. 'Cause I think they moved there probably in--oh, I don't know, maybe '43 [1943], maybe--'42 [1942], '43'[1943], something like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So they both then--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, they came there as a family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I broke them up (laughter). It was my arrival that just--oh, no, this is too much (laughter).  So, I actually ran my father out of town (laughter). I don't know, but--no, I think that they were seeking a new, a new start, a new hope and, you know it was probably to get away from--away from some of the entanglements that were already in Memphis, and looking for--there were--at the time, there were several factories and, and--so there were economic opportunities there in theory.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So they were getting away from something and to something.
Story_ID: 290701
Speaker 1: Can you describe--now, you lived in a project [in Evansville, Indiana] and, you know, when people hear project now, they think of something really horrible. But it wasn't necessi- I don't know what condition this one was in, but some of 'em, you know talking about the '30s [1930s], and '40s [1940s] are not that bad, and then as--you know, in the beginnings (unclear) are some of the ones they're knocking down now weren't that bad, so what was it like?  What was your neighborhood like when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It, it, it was bad (laughter).  I mean (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There's no doubt about it, huh?
Speaker 2: I mean like it was bad (laughter).  Certainly, there was no privilege there (laughter), you know, there was no advantage there.  The advantage was, was--the advantage was the protection I suppose of the neighborhood to whatever degree that was, that was there.  But, again, it's one of those things, you know what I mean, like in the projects that we lived in, I mean there were rats and roaches and possums (laugher), you know.  I mean there were things, there were things moving around who would (laughter) sometimes encroach on your own territory, you know?  But, again, based on this individual sort of familial kind of standard, our house--our apartment was not overrun with rats and roaches and so forth and so on, although two doors down, I mean it was a party goin' on.
Speaker 1: Now, was this a low-rise project or high-rise?
Speaker 2: Two stories, you know, with a, with a--you know, you kept coal and wood out in a bin, you know, and then you'd go up about four or five steps and there's your first apartment, and then on this side (gestures) going up some more stairs, I don't know, maybe fifteen stairs or something, there'd be another apartment above, and they were made outta cardboard essenti- I mean they were, they were--it was probably--what do you call that?  Drywall--you know, they weren't--so I mean--. So, when I heard about Watts [Los Angeles, California], for example, out here, and they were talking about these projects and things, I mean I expected to see what I had come from.  I mean when I saw Watts, I mean I thought, what the hell are they complaining about?
Speaker 1: You know, we hear this all the time.  I know I thought the same thing when I saw pictures of California palm trees and (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I was like, what, (laughter).
Speaker 1: It's relative, I guess.
Speaker 2: Clearly, clearly.  And, and also, you know, I suppose what it also teaches is that the house or the apartment that you live in, or the kind of car you have, or the kind of clothes you wear, and by extension, the schools that you go to, do not isolate you from an inferior inner life.

Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up [in Evansville, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know. Try as I may, I keep trying to go away from this but I can't.  My mother's [Lethia Gibson Glass] face was so beautiful to me; I just (laughter)--you know, she just--so, so obviously, that's one, one just huge kind of sight for me.  Sounds--I suppose music 'cause I think in, in that--in my household, you know, where people work hard and they, they, they played music, you know--usually like rock and roll kinda music.  I remember eventually, when I was like, I don't know, 11, 12, 13 or somethin' I, I boycotted all that music and decided the only music worthwhile in the house was classical music (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, that's interesting; we have to talk about that when we get there, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And you can about imagine how that went over, too, right (laughter)?
Speaker 1: But around your house there's a lot of--you had older brothers and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and they would play--
Speaker 2: And, and my oldest brother was a real, real jazz fan; he really liked--I mean he liked really heavy jazz, and--
Speaker 1: [John] Coltrane, or something, or, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah; Miles Davis, all that--just really--and, and so consequently, today I, I have--it, it's, it's, it's difficult for me to listen to it because it makes me melancholic. It doesn't uplift me, it makes me moody and kinda dark.  I don't like that feeling.
Speaker 1: The popular music of that era, or the popular black music of that era like that?
Speaker 2: No, I'm talking about the jazz; the kind of, the kind of heavy, deep kind of stuff; it ma- it, it, it doesn't--it, it, it stirs me in a way that I don't, I don't like feeling.  Might have to do with--that's how that impressed me--but anyway, there's sound-wise.  And smells, you know, I mean clearly food.  We also--there was a creek that was behind the apartment that--also dirt--the smell of dirt.  We played a lot of--my buddies and I played a lot of mumblety-peg, so I smelled a lotta dirt (laughter) at various (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's when you just take the knife--the pocketknife and just flip it up in the air and let it drop?
Speaker 2: Right.  And if you mess up, you have like a little, like a little match stick and you get to hit it down in the ground, and the person has to find it with their--face.
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you take it out with your teeth.
Speaker 1: No, I didn't know that (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So I smelled a lotta dirt (laughter), but it was fun.  I also--you know, the fresh, fresh winter smell of walking is really special to me, too.  And the one thing, also I have to say, is Swift Packing Company was within, was within the--I could smell it from where we lived; I could smell (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A packing plant, for those who never lived next to one, smells like--.
Speaker 2: Pigs being slaughtered, being prepared.  So it's, it's pretty--it's pretty pungent (laughter), but it wasn't--the, the good thing about it is that it wasn't constant. I don't know what the--I don't know why, you know, I don't, I don't know what determined when it flared up, but it wasn't constant, that I do know.
Story_ID: 290703
Speaker 1: Tell us about school.  What grade school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Well, I started out at St. John's Elementary School [Newburgh, Indiana]; I went there, I think, kindergarten.
Speaker 1: Is this a Catholic school?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I think that year, which must have been, I don't know, '49 [1949], '50 [1950], maybe, the [Catholic] Diocese of Evansville [Indiana]--the Catholic schools integrated. So St. John's was an all-black school, and we had to drive--ride a bus from home to way across town in order to go to this black school, which my mother [Lethia Gibson Glass] wanted us to go to because, though she was not Catholic, she understood that one could get a better education at Catholic school, so that's why she had us bused to St. John's.
Speaker 1: That must have been expensive though, for her to send you--.
Speaker 2: You know what?  I never got the sense that she--well, you mean to send us to that school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Relatively, I'm sure it, it, it must have been--although--see, I was only there one year, I think, in kindergarten because the desegregation thing happened, and then I started going to St. Anthony's [St. Anthony Catholic School, Evansville, Indiana], which was in walking distance from, from where we lived.
Speaker 1: Okay, now that was (unclear) tuition (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that was an all--that was an all-white school, yeah.
Speaker 1: --the tuition for a Catholic school in one year--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --just go free to public school.  So she really was concerned that you get a good education.
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly, right.  And my sister and my brothers also went to a parochial school.
Story_ID: 290704
Speaker 1: But I loved school.  I was--I mean I, I, I, I don't recall thinking, oh, I'd rather go to school than to be home. I mean I don't recall thinking that (laughter) but, you know, that, that, that, that could have had some element of that in it, and at the same time, I think I also--I was just--I just liked learning and discovering and I liked--because everybody else--there was only--in, in my class [at St. Anthony Catholic School, Evansville, Indiana], I was black, as I remain, and then--and I also had--and there was one other guy in my class who was black, and the rest of the people were white, and so there was a kind of, there was a kind of competitiveness, I suppose, that I enjoyed, that I kind of liked.  It sounds a little bit perverse now, but (laughter), but I think I, I--you know, without--you know, nobody ever had a conversation with me, that I recall, that said, you know, black people are--you know, white people don't think that black people are smart, or that they're clean, or that they're attractive, or that they're, you know, capable and able and competitive and ambitious and--I mean I don't recall anybody sitting me down having a conversation with me about that kinda thing, although that point-of-view is familiar to me as, I don't know, air (laughter), you know?  So, I guess what I'm tryin' to say is that I don't think anybody really taught me that, but I got it.  And so I think that there was a--and some of the--you know, it's like it, it just floated on the air (laughter); you know what I mean?  It was just in the neighborhood; it was just, you know, just a part of something that you just kinda pick up.  So, that combined with this thing from the [paternal] aunts and the mother [Lethia Gibson Glass] and the--oh, the stuff about bein' a Glass and, you know, about, you know, puttin' your best foot forward and (laughter), you know, that kinda thing, I, I guess I kinda picked that up, too.  And so I enjoyed school, I enjoyed being competitive in that, and I suppose there was--you know, I talked about a little perversion a little bit earlier and I, I, I mean I, I think if there was anything perverse about it, I think there was a--I got a kick out of just, just making all of those prejudicial assumptions just stupid.
Story_ID: 290705
Speaker 1: So you were a competitive student.  Were you--how did you rank in the class?  Did you actually--were you actually one of the top students?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject, or--in school?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Anything that was not math or science; anything else was my favorite (laughter).  I really liked, you know, I loved--I had a teacher in the seventh grade [at St. Anthony Catholic School, Evansville, Indiana], by the time I had gotten to the seventh grade, who was--she just--anytime the English language came up I mean as a, as a, as a subject, she was--seemed like just a willing victim of uncontrollable enthusiasm and passion, and she was just like (laughter)--she just loved it and I, I--you know so that diagraming, I used to love to diagram. I mean it was just--it was--you know, I got caught up in that, and I really felt like--so, you know, so I picked up her stuff and I went with it, and (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Maybe this is the wrong time to mention this, but I don't know. I have--the one image of you I have when I think about you as an actor is a scene in 'The Odd Couple', I guess, where you're diagraming a (unclear) in a courtroom (unclear).  Do you remember that scene?
Speaker 2: (Nods head) (laughter).
Speaker 1: And I often wondered if you came up with that, or was it written in the script, or how did--
Speaker 2: No, they did it (laughter).
Speaker 1: They did it?  Okay.  But it seemed so much like the character you're talking about in school.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.  But I--we also had a spelling bee, and Carolyn Schneider [ph.] was the nemesis as far as spelling bees were concerned. And we were down to the last couple of words and I don't re--I think--I don't know; I mean I remember everything else about it so clearly, I--but the exact word I'm not sure--I don't know if was scrupulous or what it was, but in any event, Carolyn guessed at how to spell it, but by the time you got down to the last two contenders in Rose Lawrence's [ph.] class, you had to be able to use the word in a sentence. And because Carolyn was guessing at how to spell it (laughter), she could do that but she couldn't use it in a sentence 'cause she didn't know what it meant. So--anyway, so it was my turn and I did it and I got it and I, you know, was finalist and stuff like that, and this--Rose Lawrence, she looked at me like, like I was just some kind of gold. I mean she just--and she was--had powder all over her hands and stuff from the chalk, you know, and she was hitting her hand against the wall for emphasis, and she just said, "My, my, my, my, my, what a jewel of a boy!"  (Laughter) I mean--
Story_ID: 290706
Speaker 1: --And I think it's fortunate [winning a spelling competition] I, I, I, I didn't--I didn't immediately start going around acting like and assuming that I was indeed a jewel of a boy (laughter). But it did have influence in that it, it awakened, you know, an awareness that, you know, maybe I could be something beyond just ordinary, you know what I mean?
Speaker 2: Now, is this a black teacher [Rose Lawrence (ph.)]?
Speaker 1: No, no, she's white.
Speaker 2: Is it integrated (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Everybody was white.
Speaker 2: --integrated, and you're the only--you and one other guy.
Speaker 1: Me and the other guy, yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.  So, that is quite a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean in, in that--in my class.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that makes it even more dramatic though.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it was--wow (laughter), so--but that was fun, she was fun.
Speaker 2: So this is at St. Anthony's [St. Anthony Catholic School, Evansville, Indiana] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) St. Anthony's, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Any other teachers there make a big impression on you?
Speaker 1: Well, my favorite teacher there was Sister Joseph Ann [ph.]; Sister was a--I found out in later years that--she taught me in the fourth and fifth grades, so that means I was nine and ten years old, and I found out in later years that at the time that I was ten, she was only twenty-seven, if you could--. I mean it, it's--how do you imagine a nun who's twenty-seven?  I mean it just--it's just--it's weird.  But, she was incredibly outstanding because she, for a couple of reasons--many reasons, but in any--but one of the things that was particularly outstanding about her is that she could throw a football pass that could hit you right on the numbers every time, and she could stand and just drain jump shots, you know?  She was--it was amazing because she, she would jump, and every time she would jump, and her rosary would fall and hit the ground but the ball would go through the hoop, you know what I mean?  I mean it was like--.
Speaker 2: Now, did she wear the habit and all that?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, both of these women did.  And so she was--so there, there she is, you know; she's young, she's vivacious, she's athletic, she's--you know, she has a great singing voice, she was--she just had it all, you know; she was the total package it seemed.
Speaker 2: Did you wonder why she was a nun, I guess.
Speaker 1: I did, yeah.  And the great thing about it for me was that it turns out that one of her parents was also a Protestant (laughter), and so--because I was in these Catholic schools and I was Catholic but my parents [Lethia Gibson Glass and Crump Glass] were Protestant it, it just made--it made me okay; it made me, again, feel like I was okay--like I was all right; I didn't have to be, you know, a second-class citizen because I didn't have--because my setup wasn't perfect, you know?
Story_ID: 290707
Speaker 1: I lost contact with her [grade school teacher, Sister Joseph Ann (ph.)] for a really long time, and then I'd say maybe ten years ago or something like that--maybe, I don't know, some, some kinda way, we got back in touch with each other, which was great. And so in 2000, I think it was, the, the [Indiana] Pacers and the [Los Angeles] Lakers were playing in the playoffs at Conseco Fieldhouse [Bankers Life Fieldhouse, Indianapolis, Indiana], so I called her and found out that she was gonna be in town and she wasn't gonna be at the Mother House, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, so what I did was I, I got tickets and I went to Indianapolis [Indiana]. I'd found a (unclear), and I went to Indianapolis, picked her up, took her to see the playoff game between the Pacers and the Lakers, and it was just--it was glorious; I mean (laughter) it was just--it was glorious.  And then driving--after the game--the Lakers won the game, you know, and of course she later was, was driving me back to the hotel and stuff and she was very quiet, you know, and I thought, "Well, this is"--so I didn't say anything either 'cause I didn't know exactly what was going on, you know?  And then just kind of under her breath, just kind of out of nowhere, I heard her kind of say, "Should have won that game," (laughter), you know, so she was really--she's my favorite, no question about it--my favorite.
Story_ID: 290708
Speaker 1: We're getting a picture of what you were like, but how do you think people saw you when you were growing up?  The jewel of a boy is one perception.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's not how they saw me in my neighborhood, I don't think (laughter), or in my house, you know--in my home--I don't think they saw me that way.
Speaker 1: Well, how do things--how do things shape down there, you know, in your household?  Let's start with the household, and then neighborhood.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, you know, I was the youngest of five--five years between me and my sister, and then two and a-half years between everybody else, so--you know, I, I, I think I was kind of a little bother. I mean I think I was kind of like a little pest; I, I mean not a--I mean I think I was kind of like in the way, you know what I mean?  I mean--and I never wanted to be, you know, a baby. I always wanted to be grown, I always wanted to, to, to measure up.  I didn't want anybody to--I didn't wanna give anybody any reasons to--I didn't wanna get on anybody's nerves, you know, 'cause I was already like (laughter)--I was already in the way (laughter), I was already in the way so I didn't wanna compound that. I, I mean I think I was a--I think that influenced a lot about my--about my child--my early childhood, I think, at home, you know, 'cause--you know, when, when, when the ga- my brothers are seven and a half, nine, ten, and twelve, thirteen years old when I'm a baby so, you know, I'm kind of--we can't play ball together, we can't--you know, there's not a lot we can do together. And--so anyway--I don't know; I mean I guess--then, you know, my mother [Lethia Gibson Glass] worked, so my sister had to babysit with me a lot, I guess, you know, so that--you know, and that was a drag (laughter), you know, I mean. So I, I mean I--I didn't feel like--I didn't feel like a gift in any way, you know, but I also didn't feel persecuted and stuff either; I didn't--you know, I mean I was just--.
Speaker 1: So, did you read a lot when you were at home?  I, I would guess you would.
Speaker 2: You know, I don't, I don't recall that. I don't recall that I did and, you know, that reading was the way I occupied myself or something, you know; I don't recall that.
Speaker 1: What did you do the most around the house?  I mean what did you--
Speaker 2: Well, I always had--I, I always had obligations and chores and stuff that I had to do.  I mean I got to play a lot, too out--you know, that mumblety-peg and whatever else, you know?  But--and it seems odd to me now, but the bathroom was my place; that's where I had to--I had to keep the bathroom sparkling, and oddly enough I, I, I got to the place where that was my pride. I, I--you know, I, I was proud of my bathroom being really, really clean.
Speaker 1: Now, later on, you go on to play the black Felix Unger in 'The Odd Couple.'
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Do they know this before they cast you, or--.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Well, this is interesting (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 290709
Speaker 1: Now when did you decide to listen to classical music exclusively?  Now was that in grade school, or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In grade--now, what inspired that?  Now, tell us about this; this is really--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I was--my mother [Lethia Gibson Glass]--the woman that my mother worked for--somehow I got hooked up with somebody through her, who started to teach me German; I started to be tutored in German.  I, I guess--It had to be in the summertime or something. And this woman was from Czechoslovakia [Czech Republic and Slovakia] and she played classical music all the time, and she loaned me some--you know, some classical music which I would listen to and, and, and, and felt very elevated by which was, you know, a different kind of visceral response than the response that I had to 'Roll With Me Henry' ['The Wallflower'] (laughter), you know?  I mean it's just that--I'm not sayin' one's better than the other (laugher); all I'm saying is it was different. And I think probably, appropriately, at that stage in my life, the things that were stirred by the classical music were more appropriately stirred than what was being stirred by 'Roll With Me Henry' (laughter).
Speaker 1: That kinda raises a--you know, there was a article about that--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --it was something I was reading like a Etta James song--it was a Etta James song.  But little kids really didn't think about what that meant, did they--'Roll With Me Henry'--I mean when they would hear those kinda lyrics--or did you (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I began to, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I began to.
Speaker 1: Because I know a lot of things in black music, from the old days--the blues things, and all that rock and roll, I think a lotta kids were singing but they didn't necessarily know what they meant.  You see with kids now, with rapping and they don't know what the rappers are really saying, but they--they can say exactly what they're saying, but they don't know what it really means.  But, that's just an observation.  But you were beginning to figure that out.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was--yeah, it was starting to--you know, because, come on, I mean it was in the projects, so, you know, I mean there were a lot of single moms, you know?  Lots of teenage girls and teenage boys and, you know, it was lots of activity (laughter).
Speaker 1: So it wasn't--so I was the only innocent guy (laughter) that didn't know what--.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Lotta activity, so--you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 290710
Speaker 1: In the neighborhood, now did you--what were things like in the neighborhood [in Evansville, Indiana] for you?
Speaker 2: In the neighborhood, especially in the early part (laughter), well, our family, we were--I think we were, we were, we were the--if not the only family, we were one of two, no more than three families, that had some kids who were being bused to the other side of town to go to Catholic schools [St. John's Elementary School, Newburgh, Indiana]. And, and later on, even walking, you know, to the, to the schools that I--to the parochial schools that, that I went to, although my other siblings were going to other--you know--. Well, we got teased a lot--I did; I got teased a lot about the nuns and the priests and what they were doin' together and what they did with each other and did, did the nuns, did they--were they baldheaded under there and, you know, just all these mythical kinds of things that, that, that made--that portrayed the nuns and priests as, as weird, and therefore, you know, by association, I was weird, too, you know, 'cause I was being influenced and, you know, by these weird people (laughter).  Then, also, you know, I was, I was, I was really good in school and, you know, had a reputation for that, I suppose and, you know, I mean kids, that--you know, that's no big thing to brag about, you know, that's (laughter)--you know, so (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, did you play an instrument or anything in school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Didn't do, okay.
Speaker 2: No.  And I also had a lisp when I was very, very young.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When did it disappear?
Speaker 2: It disappeared (laughter), it disappeared when I left the neighborhood and started goin' to these other schools where these people did not know me, and they started teasing me--that's when it disappeared.  I mean I remember clearly deciding to clench my teeth when the impulse came up.
Speaker 1: How did you talk before?  Can you do it?
Speaker 2: Forta [ph.] (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laugher) You know, that's a--this is a big burden to bear; now, you're a smart kid, you know, and you got a lisp, you like classical music--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That's a--yeah, that sounds--yeah.
Speaker 2: Plus, I, I also--you know, at that time, you know, there was a, there was a, a big struggle going on; it wasn't necessarily talked about very much, but there was a pretty big struggle going on about this--the value of having skin this color, you know; I mean for some people, it was a gift, and for other people--I mean there were kids in my neighborhood who, who, who told me I was shit color; some people said mustard and some people said shit (laughter), you know?
Speaker 1: Depends on what kind of food they ate (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So, you know, I mean there, there were--and then I had--you know--so--.
Speaker 1: So those are the days--you were coming up in the days--I think we were discussing the other day, if a black person, no matter what their color was, if you called 'em black, they'd get upset--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --before they--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --get angry.
Story_ID: 290711
Speaker 1: And I could run really fast, too; I, I mean I, I was--you know, I, I was--I was kinda--I was--you know, in the little neighborhood I mean I was good at marbles, I was good at mumblety-peg, I was good at four square, I was--you know, I was athletic and I was good in stuff, so there was (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did you play baseball and football?
Speaker 1: Oh, eventually yeah, yeah; I played all that stuff, you know?  So, in a certain kinda way, I kind--you know, they say that the, the thing that stands out, you know, it becomes the target for all the (laughter), all the shots.  In a cer- in a, in a number of different ways I kinda stood out, and then I--you know, I've always--you know, my mother [Lethia Gibson Glass] spoke fairly conscientiously, and so I've al- you know, so even though I had a (speaking with a lisp) lisp, I was still (laughter)--I was still very thintheer [ph.] (laughter).
Speaker 2: So they--like they say that you all were trying to be saddity or, or proper (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, all that, all that.
Speaker 2: Now, that was actually an insult, and still is, I hear, in certain situations, to be called being prop- you're trying to be proper.
Speaker 1: Yeah, or as another friend of mine says, "Aww, you tryin' to be all that," (laughter).  Yeah, you know, so--and then, you know, just neat and clean and, you know.
Speaker 2: But you liked being a smart person, didn't you?  I mean the way you describe it, you really liked this.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, you know what?  It's very interesting because in school [St. Anthony Catholic School, Evansville, Indiana], where everybody was white, it was respected, and I also kinda got off on kind of, kind of maybe being able to represent something that was exactly unlike what you thought it was supposed to be like as a black person. But at home, it flipped again because it wasn't so highly respected in the neighborhood (laughter), you know?  So then I had to gather together some other tools to excel in other areas, so--that were-where people were more responsive to.
Story_ID: 290712
Speaker 1: Now, was church a big part of growing up [in Evansville, Indiana] where you--?
Speaker 2: Well, for me it was, yeah, but again, it wasn't the church that everybody else went to 'cause everybody else went to a Baptist church; I went to a Catholic church [St. Anthony Catholic Church, Evansville, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Okay, so your mother [Lethia Gibson Glass] did--did she become a Catholic?
Speaker 2: No, never did.
Speaker 1: Okay, but she sent you to Catholic Church.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you get a lotta responsibilities in the--were you an altar boy and that sorta thing?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Excellent!  (Laughter) Which pissed everybody else off, too; that--you know what I mean?  So I mean everywhere; it was either--you know, I mean (laughter)--you know, so--I've always been, I've always been a kind of a--I guess kind of an outsider, you know?  I mean I can, I can get along, but I'm just not just quite like everybody else it seems, or not quite--always a little bit--I don't know.

Speaker 1: Did you have a lotta friends growing up?
Speaker 2: You know, I had, I had friends, yeah. I mean I had friends, but I was also really aware that a lotta people didn't like me, too, you know?  So I mean I had friends but I was--I wasn't, you know, the most popular kid in the neighborhood either.  As a matter of fact, there was one kid, there was one kid, he was a, a huge bully. His name was Benny, and--Benny and Johnny--they were brothers. They had come up to Evansville [Indiana] from, I don't know, Mississippi or Birmingham [Alabama]--I don't know, somewhere, Ala- somewhere--and moved into the neighborhood and, you know, they were kinda bruiser type, you know, the way they were built--especially Benny.  And Benny and I were about the same age and we lived right across the little dirt thing from each other. But they went to this school--this school that was within walking distance from where we lived over there, and Benny decided that he was gonna, he was gonna kick my butt just on general principles, just because I wasn't--I thought I was all that (laughter).  And I have to tell you, I mean I was terrified, I was terrified.  I must have been all of six maybe?  Probably--no more than seven or eight, I mean, you know, somewhere in there.  So he called me out, you know. I was supposed to--I had to meet him over at (laughter)--. We couldn't do it right there in the--right in the thing because our--you know, our parents would know about it if we did that, so I had to meet him at the schoolyard--Third Avenue schoolyard [Third Avenue School, Evansville, Indiana], which is the Protestant school. Didn't meet at my school, I had to meet him at his school.  But the point, the point is that I was so scared, but at the same time, I also knew that I couldn't punk out and not show up. I mean that would have just been--if I had not shown up, or had not, you know, taken the challenge or something, then I would have--I, I don't know, I, I just would have had no street cred at all (laughter), you know what I mean (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You would have had (unclear) everybody then.
Speaker 2: You know, I mean I--you know--so--but I did have--I don't remember how many, but I, I had at least a friend or two, maybe three, who--you know, they walked behind me as we were walkin' to the yard (laughter), as we were walkin' to the yard. And we got over there and there was a big huge trash can and Benny somehow--I don't know exact--I, I can't remember exactly what happened, but I whipped Benny's butt with that trash can, and I'm sure it was just out of sheer terror.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Did Benny know the trash can was gonna be in the fight?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) If he, if he didn't, he shoulda moved it (laughter) because, you know--so--. But the interesting thing is that once we had that encounter, Benny and I became friends, and so then, you know, I guess that made everybody else in the neighborhood at least, you know, at least say, "Well, you know, he's got some heart anyway"--whatever.  So the intention was not to become this great fighter, but it was, you know, it was to be--to have the freedom to walk up and down the street to the, the (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Respect and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know; I mean some kinda--. But man--oh, the terror, oh, the fear; it's--oh, that's pretty--that's, that's, that was, that was pretty strong, too.  That happened to me at, at St. Anthony's [St. Anthony Catholic School, Evansville, Indiana] too, with all the white kids.  I was--I think I was in the seventh or eighth grade by then--no, I was in the sixth or seventh grade, and I think there were three or four eighth graders who all jumped on me because they were mad because I was, you know, I played baseball and football and stuff, and I guess I--maybe I got, you know, got voted on one of the teams or something that they wanted to be on, or whatever, and stuff. And they jumped me and I twirled a bunch of them (laughter), I twirled a bunch of them around, too.  But again, it's not--I'm not fighter, I mean I'm not a--you know, but I think it was just terror, just terror.  And, and, and somewhere also, the sense that, you know, a Glass needs to stand up.

Speaker 1: Would you care to talk about high school [St. Francis High School (ph.)]--in your own way?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Absolutely--anything you'd like to know (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Of course--well, just tell in your--what you would like to tell us.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) High school, again, you know, was a really intense kind of experience where, again, I, I, I found that I was, you know, really attracted to study, I was really attracted to sports, and I was really good at both of them.
Speaker 1: Now, did you play high school sports on teams, and what was your (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, but mind you, I went to a very small high school; my graduate--my graduating high school class, there were nineteen of us, so I was on the varsity of all the sports (laughter), you know, so I had a great time. I mean it was wonderful.
Speaker 1: A small Catholic school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Special school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We--it was a preparatory school.  And what we used to do is we used to--. I mean for example, we had a--there was a, a local college that every year, we used to have this, this, this contest that was called--it was on picnic day every year, and we would play the team from the college, you know, the high school would play the team from the college and, you know, we kept records and everything, you know. I mean it was mostly all about bragging rights, you know, but we didn't get big trophies and all that kinda thing. But--anyway--I don't know why I'm even getting into this story but, but it--there was a teacher there who was a--who taught Latin and Greek and trigonometry and algebra, and also was the third baseman, so--I mean this guy had like great range, you know?  And I had a, had a lotta respect for that.  So anyway, we're playing this game and this is picnic day, and it's the last inning and the score is tied and I'm in center field and their--the, the bases are loaded and their best hitter is up to bat, and one of my teachers is telling me to get way back--stay way, way, way back 'cause this guy was huge and, and, and it was kinda like out in the, in the suburbs, so there was no fence. So if the ball went over your head, you just had to chase it down.  So, in any event, the guy hits the ball; the ball--it's the highest--it's like it gets lost in the clouds; you can't even, can't even see the ball, so the only thing I can do is just run like a bat outta hell.  I mean I just ran and ran, and I'm running into short center field and I'm lookin' for the ball, and finally the ball comes into view, and I just keep my--I just keep the ball in my sights and I just keep running, running, running, running, running, and I lunge to the ground, make this shoestring catch, roll over, fire the ball into home plate, the guy catches the, the pit--the guy catches the ball, tags the guy out, so we get a chance at the bottom of the ninth to win the game.  So I get a hit, and a couple of other guys get some hits and stuff, you know, so we, we end up--we, we win the game.  So, everybody's tired and--but exhilarated, you know, because we've won, we've got the bragging rights and all this thing.  And this, this teacher who was--who I just had so much respect for because he was so bright and so able in so many different areas--he was kind of an aloof guy, too; he didn't, he didn't do a lot of--he didn't do a lot of complimenting and praising and stuff like that.  But anyway, he walked by us and he, he stopped and turned back and he looked at me, and it felt like it was like twenty seconds or something, and he looked and then he just kinda cocked his hat to the side and he said, "Glass [HistoryMaker Ronald Glass], you were spectacular!"  Now, that's 'bout forty-five, 'bout forty-five years ago, and it feels to me like it was about three minutes ago (laughter). I mean it had that kind of, that kind of impact, that kind of inspiration.  So--and you know, fortunately, I've had those kinds of, those kinds of teachers in my, in my life.
Story_ID: 290715
Speaker 1: Were you the only black student at the school [St. Francis High School (ph.)] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know what?  There were two of us again, yeah, in my class.  Michael Murphy [ph.].
Speaker 1: Now, how did the other guy feel (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Another black name (unclear).  What?
Speaker 1: Well, how did the other guy feel during all this?  Things--you know, there are two black students and--.
Speaker 2: Oh, he was pretty cool. I mean he was on the [baseball] team, you know but, but he was also one of those--you know, he was kind of--you know, it's like he, he was on another realm. He was on another, another--I don't wanna say level, but another sphere (laughter), you know what I mean?  He, he was just--he was different--different expectations, different abilities, you know, it was just different.  But we were friends, I mean we were cool, we were--we had a good time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Football--I used to love 'cause I was fast; I could run, so I was like--before fifty years of cigarettes (laughter).  So, you know (laughter)--but, yeah, I had a good time and I, I loved, you know, college [Evansville College; University of Evansville, Evansville, Indiana], too; I mean I, I just--I didn't (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you have a favorite subject in college--I mean in high school, before we get you to college?
Speaker 2: Probably languages--probably Greek and Latin. I was--I've always really, really liked language a lot, and I think it's because I had a lisp that I had to overcome.
Speaker 1: Had you overcome it by high school?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I, I had overcome it by second grade [at St. Anthony Catholic School, Evansville, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm--okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I didn't know now; I didn't know the frame--the time frame or anything (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (laughter) Oh, yeah, I'm glad you asked; I'm glad we got to clear that up (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So you had already conquered that a long time ago.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, I couldn't--I wouldn't have been able to bear that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that kind of--no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: A Glass?  Are you kidding?
Speaker 1: A Glass does not lisp.
Speaker 2: A Glass with a lisp?  I don't think so (laughter).
Story_ID: 290716
Speaker 1: Well, when you were on the verge of graduating from high school [St. Francis High School (ph.)], did you--what did you project as a--I mean what were you interested in career-wise?
Speaker 2: I always thought I would be a teacher.  You know, I, I think, in black communities anyway, I mean I think the big three were always teacher, lawyer, doctor, you know?  So I think that's what I--I thought--I think I was gonna be a tea- I, I, I thought I'd be a teacher. 'Cause there, there, there's that part of, of that that's just a part of my makeup; it's just a part of my--who I am; it's just a part of who I am.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, where did you go to college?
Speaker 2: The University of Evansville [Evansville College; University of Evansville] in Evansville, Indiana.
Speaker 1: Now this is like--what year is this?
Speaker 2: What year?
Speaker 1: When we start?
Speaker 2: I think I graduated in '63 [1963], so it must have been '59 [1959]?  No, no, no, '63 [1963].  No, I graduated in '68 [1968], so--I graduated from high school in '63 [1963], so I graduated from college in '68 [1968], so it would have been '63 [1963] to '68 [1968]?  Sixty-four [1964] to '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you came outta high school a little bit early then, right--in terms of age, huh (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I was right on time.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But what I did, there was one year between high school and college--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that I sat out, and then I went to college 'cause my--again, Evansville--University of Evansville was kind of a private kind of a school, and so you had to, you had to get in (laughter). So--I mean--and I, I mean I say it this way because I think it's kinda funny but, you know, I mean it had some perhaps not so funny things about it, too, but the white lady that Momma [Lethia Gibson Glass] worked for had to get me in (laughter). Then I could handle it on my own, but she had to open that door.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you stay at home when you went to school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 290717
Speaker 1: How was the University of Evansville [Evansville College; University of Evansville, Evansville, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: It was great, it was great.  I mean I--you know, again, I was in the environment that I loved, which was learning and competing and, you know, at, at--. What was I?  Nineteen, twenty?  I mean the whole world is just like there's so much possibility and so much potential and so much (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, did you--when did you first become interested in drama?  Were there any--I mean in high school [St. Francis High School (ph.)] or in college, were you exposed to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually, it happened in college because of that--I think the first summer before like the rest of the, the, the, the normal school started, I took a--an elective course that was called oral interpretation, and so in that class, the guy who taught that class really liked my voice and asked if I would consider reading for a play that they were gonna do called 'Banners of Steel' [Barrie Stavis]. And this play required a bunch of black people, and all of them--and it wasn't that many black people at the school (laughter). So they went out and got preachers and pimps and all kinds of people to come and (laughter)--you know, come and be in this, come and be in this play, and the requisite was that they be black (laughter), and so--to give the play the authenticity that it needed 'cause it was about slavery and so on.  So, anyway, that's how I got connected to, to doing plays, and I--at that school, what they did at the end of every production, they voted for the person--the cast or crew that they felt had contributed the most to the success of the production, and I won the award for the first play that I was in, and so I thought, "Hmm, hmm!"
Speaker 1: You might have something going here, huh?
Speaker 2: So I--yeah, so I kinda kept associated with that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, did you--were--did you like movies and television when you were growing up a lot?  Did you watch a lot of--?
Speaker 2: I wasn't particularly drawn to it; I mean I don't think we had a tele- I--you know what?  I remember going to somebody's house--I mean going with a little friend or somebody and getting up on somebody's shoulders and peeping over--peeping over a thing like this (gestures) to look at a TV. I, I guess Jack Benny or somebody like that was on the TV, I don't know, but I, I--you know, it wasn't--it, it did not play a large part in my early life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As a matter of fact, I was sure that I would be a stage actor only. I had no--no, I wasn't drawn to the--
Speaker 1: Did you get the (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) television.
Speaker 1: Did you have an opportunity to perform on stage in college?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah; that's how I won the award.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's the Readers Theater, but you didn't get (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: Oh, you--oh, you won the award for--.
Speaker 2: It was a stage play.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't Readers Theater.
Speaker 1: Okay, I got it mixed up; I thought that you were still (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, oh, oh--no, the class, the oral interpretation class.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was Readers Theater, right?
Speaker 2: No, it was a class in interpreting vocally, verbally, orally poems--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, different monologues--whatever, but it was totally separate from the stage production.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay--from the Readers Theater production.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, okay; I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Not a Readers Theater; there is no Readers Theater.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know what--you're stuck on Readers Theater, I don't know why, and if I did it to you, I apologize (laughter), but (laughter)--.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was a full-scale production.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: All right, I'm sorry---
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for some reason, I got in my mind that you all were called into a reading or something, to read about--read for--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 290718
Speaker 1: This is a full-scale production on stage--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --about slavery?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And was it a good play or--(laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was very good, actually.  I think it, it eventually became--when it went to Broadway eventually, it was--. Barrie Stavis wrote it; he--and he changed it, the name of it, from 'Banners of Steel' I think he changed it to 'John Brown's Body' [sic. 'Harpers Ferry,' Barrie Stavis]--I think that was the name of it when it, you know, later on--many years later went to Broadway. But--yeah, it was one of those things where I was like a young slave and my kid and wife had been taken from me and I was, you know, distraught, so I had a lot of energy and I was strong and I had--you know, so I was able to just kind of unleash a lot of just natural stuff.  And then I later on had to go back and start to learn how to execute the craft of acting.  It was just instinct at first.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you won an award for that.  Now, is that like late in college, or--
Speaker 2: No, it was the first play I ever did; it was my first year in college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I stayed in college four years, and during that time, I won three of those awards in four years. And that record still stands at the University of Evansville [Evansville College; University of Evansville, Evansville, Indiana]--forty years later.  But who's counting?  (Laughter) Anyway--yeah, so I did that, and then I left and went to the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis [Minnesota], which was, you know, the best classical theater in the country at the time.
Speaker 1: So that experience in college encouraged you to go on to the Guthrie.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the--without that, I never would have even--
Speaker 1: So, teaching just kind of (laughter)--.
Speaker 2: Oh--yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so what did you get your degree in in Evansville--or did you?
Speaker 2: I had a, a, a, a--my degree was in English lit and drama.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 290719
Speaker 1: All right, so, what happened at the Guthrie [Guthrie Theater, Minneapolis, Minnesota]?
Speaker 2: At the Guthrie--I stayed there four years. Did, you know, many stage plays--.
Speaker 1: This is '68 [1968], you say?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, '68 [1968] to '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you--how did you fare?  I know we talked to--I think it was [HistoryMaker] Janet [Angel] MacLachlan (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Janet was--yeah, she was there the year before me, I think.
Speaker 1: She said she couldn't get enough work (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Parts, mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they paid her well, but she sat around a lot.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Did--what happened to you?
Speaker 2: I didn't have that, that, that problem; I, I did ample work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: However, the reason I left--well, part of the reason I left (laughter)--well, I left because in my last year, all I got offered was, was one part in one play that I did not think I was right for anyway, in John Steinbeck's 'Of Mice and Men,' to play Lennie [Small]--I don't think so.  But the reason I (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's not type-casting (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And it became really clear to me too, 'cause the guy who was the artistic director at the time offered me that only because I had objected to the way he treated the actress who was the leading lady in a couple of the plays. And that leading lady was my girlfriend, was my woman (laugher). And he wasn't, he wasn't giving her the right--so anyway, I had, I had--you know, I suppose, chastised him for that. And the way he retaliated was to give me an offer that I had to refuse (laughter); he got me outta Dodge (laughter).  So--but it was a--you know, it was a great, it was a great experience there for me.
Story_ID: 290720
Speaker 1: Okay, so where did you go after the Guthrie [Guthrie Theater, Minneapolis, Minnesota]?
Speaker 2: I left there and I went to West Springfield, Mass [West Springfield, Massachusetts] and I did a play there called 'Slow Dance on the Killing Ground' [William Hanley], and then I went to New York [New York]. I stayed in New York about six months, and I decided, "You know what? Summer is coming and if I'm gonna be in a park on a bench, it would be better to be in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] than to be in New York."  And I didn't know anything about film or television either, so I thought I'd come out here, so I did--in '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you--how long were you in New York?
Speaker 2: About six months--a little less, probably (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Six months, okay, all right.  So did--were you in any plays in New York?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so--okay, so you thought it was better to come out here and--.
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Story_ID: 290721
Speaker 1: All right, so you came out to Los Angeles [California] in '72 [1972], and--now this is--now, you got a--cast in 'Sanford and Son,' right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: In '72 [1972].  Now, how--tell us about that.  Now, this has gotta be--you just come out here and you get cast in 'Sanford and Son' (laughter).  Well, what happened?  I mean how long were you here before you got that role?
Speaker 2: I came here in June, and I did that job in probably September--end of September.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it wasn't immediate, you know, right?  But you--that's not bad, though.
Speaker 2: No, it's not bad at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--well, how did you feel about getting your first role on television?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's euphoric, you know; it's very exciting, very exciting.  You know, you get to make those calls back home, tell everybody to watch you on TV; they're all excited and (laughter), you know.  I mean it's fun.
Speaker 1: So, when did you--what role did you play in 'Sanford and Son'?
Speaker 2: I played, I played kind of a--he was a card shark. I'll never forget, he had a--and his name was Rooster (laugher). So he had kind of a floppy hat that had a big feather in it--a big rooster feather. I guess that's why they called him Rooster (laughter).  Wasn't a very big part, but it was, it was, it was my debut and it was fun.  I was really excited.
Speaker 1: Now, did you just answer an ad, or did you have an agent or something at this point, or--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But I did an audition, you know, and they gave me the nod.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 290722
Speaker 1: Then what then?  What did you do next [after 'Sanford and Son']?
Speaker 2: Well, a series of things, you know, and then I--but 'Barney [Miller]' came along and I, I did this 'All in the Family.' And 'All in the Family' had a kind of a--kind of Rashomon kind of a theme where I had to play these three different characters seen from the perspective of--one from Archie [Bunker], one from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Edith [Bunker], I guess--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Edith saw the truth, and then Mike [Michael 'Meathead' Stivic] and Gloria [Gloria Bunker-Stivic] saw something else, so--. And then ultimately what happened is the, is the, the guy who produced 'Barney Miller' had seen me on this 'All in the Family,' and--you know, initially, on 'Barney Miller' the character that--the black character on the first pilot they did of 'Barney Miller' was Rod Perry, and what happened was during the downtime, they didn't know whether 'Barney' was going to get picked up or not, and Rod got offered--oh, gosh, I've done it again--a part on--oh, gosh--not 'The A-Team.'  What's the name--the--the squad, the squad.
Speaker 1: 'Mob Squad.'
Speaker 2: No.  You know,
Speaker 1: 'S.W.A.T.'
Speaker 2: 'S.W.A.T.,' thank you.
Speaker 1: 'S.W.A.T.,' okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, 'S.W.A.T.'  So, I'm forever indebted to him that he chose to do 'S.W.A.T.' because then, when 'Barney' got picked up, Danny [Arnold] remembered he'd seen me on 'All in the Family' and he called me in.  'Cause at the time, Danny felt that I was gonna be--he told me I was gonna be playing a character that was somewhere--a cross between Coma and Serpico (laughter) so, you know, I was gonna be doin' a lotta disguises and a lotta stuff, and I was ex--you know, that was great.  But then, what happened was he remembered Gregory Sierra, and he decided that he wanted Gregory to play this character that did all these different disguises and stuff, and so we, we went another way, so I'm also really happy about.
Speaker 1: Okay, now how do they decide on what kind of character you would have on the show?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, they, they had, they had some, you know, some idea, but they also wisely--and I think most people do this with characters who are regulars on shows, they start to observe whoever the actors are that they have, and then they, they, they start to take advantage of and use things about the person that they think are beneficial for the character, so that's what happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, though I never, I never wrote, they used things about me to enhance this, this characterization.
Speaker 1: And that's why I asked if we knew that you had any input into the scripts because they seem so suited for your personality, especially after interviewing now, and I said, "Well, wow (laughter), here's a guy that's cleaning a bathroom obsessively, you know," and in 'Barney Miller,' your character was very concerned about his clothes.
Speaker 2: My brother, my brother--you know, again, we were poor and we didn't have--but my brother also went to, he went to, he went to Mater Dei [Mater Dei High School] in Evansville [Indiana], which was a white parochial school, and there were a few black people there, and one of the things that he used to always do is, and I remember his telling me about this, is that he--his shoes were always shined; he was always--I guess he was being a Glass, I guess (laughter), but he always felt--I mean that was his way of representing, I suppose.  So, so when I got Harris [Detective Ron Harris] on 'Barney Miller', that was my first consideration, you know.  If, if he--he was the only black character--regular in the squad room, he had to be the cleanest, he had to be the sharpest, he had to be the guy that had to represent (laughter).  So, that's how that--that's how that happened.
Story_ID: 290723
Speaker 1: What did your family think about you being on 'Barney Miller'?  This becomes a hit show, it's on every week, you're from Evansville [Indiana], there's not that many big black folks in Evansville doing things out in the world, and here you are every week, you know?  So what do they think?
Speaker 2: They thought I should have a lot of money to share with them (laughter).  That's exactly what they thought (laughter).
Speaker 1: Said, "Man," they said, "Let's call him now," right, (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, they were, they were, they were very happy.  You know, obviously, my mom [Lethia Gibson Glass] was, was very, very happy; she didn't--you know, she didn't, she didn't--my mother didn't give--she, she wasn't--she would say, you know, nice things and stuff like that, but she wasn't an overly--what do you call that?
Speaker 1: Demonstrative, or she didn't (unclear) a lot (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She didn't just go on and on; you know, some people--you know, she, she would say something nice and something sweet and then it was, "Okay, let's move on to the next thing," or whatever, you know?
Speaker 1: Did she--you know, a lot of people say that, but they find out later that their parents--around their friends--their parents' friends, they really (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know what?  See, I, I think my mother was, to some degree--I mean I, I think, I think she expressed her delight that I was successful and that I--she didn't--that she didn't have to worry about me is really, I think, was probably the bigger issue because my mother used to always say she wanted to live to be--to see me become a man because I was the youngest. And so, so I think it was more from that perspective, I think, and that it was also kind of an indication that, that--you know, that I was going to be well, you know.  So, at the same time, I think she was also a bit concerned about--you know, she didn't--I think it would have been very uncomfortable--my mother was not a braggart; she wasn't a bragging kind of person. And so I think that she would have felt like--she would not want to put herself in the position of appearing to gloat with people who had less, or were not experiencing what she was experiencing, you know what I mean?  So she would, she would, she would do it a little bit and then she'd be on to the next thing, you know, "Let's, let's not"--you know--like that, so--.
Story_ID: 290724
Speaker 1: One of my brothers, on the other hand was, you know, perhaps a little more vivid and clear about his reaction to the thing [being cast as Detective Ron Harris on 'Barney Miller']; he told me that I was the only person that he knew who came from shit and came out smelling like a rose (laughter), so I mean that's kind of a double message in there, I think (laughter).  But because he came from the same shit, how mad could I get?  (Laughter) I mean if that was--you know what I mean, so I mean he was, he was, he was, he was, he was being complimentary but, you know, he--it also had a little--something a little sour around the edges of it, seems like to me.  So--.
Speaker 2: There's some pathos in that sort of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --where he (unclear); he kind of lamented the way he grew up, and maybe his approach to some of the things that he was presenting, or for others around him.  And a lot of people in the community [in Evansville, Indiana] had a lot of the same stuff, but he didn't--.
Speaker 1: Well, you know what?  I mean it's, it's, it's interesting; you know, I--it's interesting how, how many people can be happy and delight in your success or progress or victory, and sometimes, you know, you get the sense that your victory reminds them of what they did not do, of the effort that they did not--you know, a lot of times, you know, it's like people, people kind of--you know, you kind of get the feeling that people feel like you've left them behind, or something, you know?  So that it becomes a kind of, you know--joy, sad kind of joyful, painful kind of experience to witness somebody's progress or whatever.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And I think everybody's entitled to that; I don't have any, okay.
Story_ID: 290725
Speaker 1: You came along at a time in Hollywood when a lot of black people were getting on--in regular series and stuff--series like 'The Jeffersons,' and 'Good Times,' and a lot of black series on the air and there had not been so many just maybe five years before.  Had you--when you were coming along, did you follow the Civil Rights Movement and think about what was going on?  Did your people discuss what was going on down South, and some of the news reports and--
Speaker 2: You know, not a lot, not a lot.
Speaker 1: 'Cause Indiana--let me just say that Indiana, too; Southern Indiana--Indiana is a, is a state that is not unlike Mississippi, you know, even though one of your relatives thought that living in Evansville [Indiana] was like being in Canada or something. But in reality, those who know Indiana, know Indiana is probably the roughest of the Midwest states in terms of race relations.
Speaker 2: You get no fight here (laughter) about that.
Speaker 1: It's the only state in the union where a Grand Dragon was elected on the basis of that as governor back in 1820--I mean 1928.  People say now, I mean that live in Gary [Indiana], even, that it's rougher than, you know, any other place they know in the Midwest.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's interesting.  You know, one of the things that I--you know, really highly emotionally charged experiences, in '63 [1963] when John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was assassinated, and then when [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was assassinated, my brother and I were sitting in the living room and it just came out of like nowhere. I mean we had no--and it came on television, and I ju- I remember that I cried like--I guess I cried like what had happened, happened (laughter), you know?  But I mean I was--and I felt that my mother [Lethia Gibson Glass] was, was just, you know, just devastated, just horrified, and so--
Speaker 1: So there was some sense of who he was and what he was doing; I mean you were following on some level.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah; I mean I, I, I--yeah; I mean I, I knew, but I was not a marcher. I wasn't a person who--you know, I didn't go to--I didn't go anywhere; I didn't march, you know?  I didn't--I stayed in school [Evansville College; University of Evansville, Evansville, Indiana], you know what I mean?  That was my--you know, I, I, I've kind of always felt--I tend to be sort of apolitical and, and, and perhaps a-activist maybe, but that does not mean that I don't care, and what I do, I think, is that I--whatever kinds of principles or ideas and so forth that are, that are being dealt with, I personalize and figure out how to represent whichever side of the argument I need to represent personally.  And it--so that, so that it becomes like a personal assignment as opposed to a public announcement of my position, so to say.
Story_ID: 290726
Speaker 1: You came outta college [Evansville College; University of Evansville, Evansville, Indiana] before the Black Student Movement and all that sort of thing really got underway nationwide, and sort of--
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things that was happening, they were starting a, a fraternity at my university that was a black fraternity, and a couple of the guys really, really, really wanted me to join and, you know, become a--I started to say the name of the thing--you'd know it--but, anyway, started (laughter)--wanted me to become a member. And because I was doing plays and I was rehearsing all the time and so forth and so on, I really didn't have time to devote to it. But because of the influence one of the guys had and so forth, I decided to go and do it anyway.  So I, I went, and when I got to the house, the guy who answered, who answered the door when I rang--when I knocked on the door, the guy who opened the door looked at me and said, "What the hell you think you doing?  You think you a white boy or something up in here in these sandals and weak jeans and stuff?"  And I knew at that moment that was the last time they were gonna see me, although I went in like a Glass, and I did what needed to be done. I ate the raw onion and the raw egg and drank the hot water (laughter), you know, and did all the stuff that needed to be done, but I knew that was the last time they'd see me.  So, you know, the issues were present, you know, and it, and it was also the time that I was called up--I had to go for my physical to be drafted to go to Vietnam [Vietnam War].  Whoa! That was pretty deep (laughter), that was pretty deep, you know, to consider what was I gonna do about that, and as things would have it, it turns out that I actually had a duodenal ulcer, and so I, I wasn't, you know, I wasn't drafted.
Story_ID: 290727
Speaker 1: You know, in school [Evansville College; University of Evansville, Evansville, Indiana] I was, I was, I was, I was taught, and I believe, and I still believe, that art has a twofold purpose; the first is to teach, and the second is to entertain so, you know, I've, I've always approached my work in that way, and so I've always felt like in a certain kind of way that though I have, you know, been fortunate to be able to afford people a lot of laughs, and some tears, that from my perspective, I've had the opportunity to fulfill an important function of teaching as well.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And in the process of this show now, 'Barney Miller,' and it was a--it was one of the new sort of wave of comedies that, that, that did some teaching on a level, you know. We had 'All in the Family,' and 'Good Times' was perceived as that by most people, I think, when it started, but I don't know, it's something--I have, you know, different feelings about that one. But 'Barney Miller' had like a certain aspect to it, certain, I guess, aspirations of trying to, you know, pass on something about urban life that wasn't, you know, passed on in most comedies.  Did you have--ever have a opportunity to--I mean did you--how did you feel about the scripts and the role you played as Detective Ron Harris, and did you feel it was a teaching tool--I mean the role itself was a teaching tool?
Speaker 1: Absolutely, you know, because I, I--I have many, many people, especially young men, who have--some of them are not so young now (laughter), who still come up and tell me what a, what an enormous influence I had on them as--when they were kids, when they were young men, you know, in terms of how they've tried to model their conduct and demeanor and behavior and so forth, after this character that I had--have created, which is enormously fulfilling for me. And I was aware that that was--that was part of my intention, you know, was to, to represent in a way that was not really common at that time and, you know, although it was not--initially, it was not the intention of the, of the creators for that character to perform that particular function, they bought it and supported it and, you know, enlarged on it and helped, and all that, so--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you played a character, I guess, we could characterize as having a lot of self-esteem; your character had a lot of self-esteem.
Speaker 1: That's very well said (laughter).
Story_ID: 290728
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I have to kind of reflect on it; I didn't watch a lot of television in those days, but I do remember the show ['Barney Miller'], and the character did have a lot of self-esteem; he was sure of himself, he was particular about how he looked and how he--how things were around him and, you know, he was a--he had a lot of self-esteem, which was a little different from some of the other--he was a comedy, you know, character like all of them were in that, but a little bit different.  And if you look at, you know, some of the other characters in the, in the--on TV in those days--the other black male characters and stuff, he would come off as the only one dignified, I guess you would have to say.
Speaker 2: Danny [Arnold] said that each one of the characters, the regulars, was a facet of his own personality, and the charac- the Harris [Detective Ron Harris] character, he said, was--represented the fullness of the way life should be lived in terms of being, you know, being the (unclear), you know, the guy who, you know what I mean he, he has a lot of, lot of things going on, you know, and is, is--likes the good wine and likes the good cigars, likes the beautiful women and likes the, you know, the successful--you know, loves the, the stock market and loving--writes and plays the music, and goes to the opera and travels and, you know--. I think they did a really funny thing one time (laughter) about--they tried to, they tried to, to uncover my family tree, and they were going back (laughter), and they found out that (laughter)--Harris was so angry; he was so angry and embarrassed because they found out that (laughter) I guess his great, great-grandfather or somebody was a, a Harris from Scotland (laughter), and he does--he--I mean he's like--he says, you know, "There's gotta be a mistake,"  (laughter).  He just wasn't having that, and you know, he wanted to, to be from, I don't know, Kenya, I suppose, or someplace, you know, but he was like--he was just really devastated.  It was funny (laughter).  Aww, why did I say that?  What are we talking about?  Where am I (laughter) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Talking about the character--
Speaker 2: Are we still in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, so I mean he, he--you know, he represented a lot of, a lot of what is good about black males.
Story_ID: 290729
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite episode of 'Barney Miller'?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Not one favorite?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not an episode; I mean 'cause there too many--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One episode would leave too many things out (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or a favorite, a favorite scene; maybe a favorite scene.
Speaker 2: You know, I mean there's several; I mean I--you know, there are lots.  I mean there, there were--Todd Bridges was a little bitty boy, and I had scenes with him that talked about Judge Goody and Judge Meany (laughter), you know, it was fun.  I had a scene with a--with a really nice, nice actor where I, I was telling him about--he was a kid who was selling cars and had lots of money and all these, you know--had access to a lot of things and was making more money than I was making and he, you know, was reminding me of it.  Say, "Well, yeah, well what about you, you know; you ain't got--make the kinda of money that I make?"  (Laughter) And I said to him something like, "You know, you let me tell you something (laughter); you may make a lot of money, but you are--but you are, but you are still nothing until you can sign something with credit" (laughter).  You know, I mean he was like (laughter)--you know, so I mean he had to--so anyway--yeah, I mean there--I had a scene with [HistoryMaker] Roscoe Lee Browne that was really wonderful, I had a scene with [HistoryMaker] Janet [Angel] MacLachlan that I really enjoyed a lot--lots of stuff, you know?  I mean I--and then silly stuff, you know?  Somebody--I think the lights went out or something and so the air-conditioning and all stuff went out and I was sitting over--I'd moved from my desk and was sitting over by the, by the air shaft and had the window up and stuff, and somebody, somebody came by and said, "Whew, man, it's hot in here; it's, it's like whew!  Just sweating!"  Said, "Harris [Detective Ron Harris], you sweating?"  And Harris said something about, "You know how much this shirt cost?"  (Laughter) It's like, you know, "Hey, naw, naw, we don't be sweating--no, no, no, no, no" (laughter).  You know, so I mean there are lots of things that I really--and then there were more serious things, too, at times that I really, you know, was able to feel really, really good about.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The cool character in most circumstances that (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was fun to play, yeah.
Speaker 1: So--now, 'Barney Miller' was on from seventy--
Speaker 2: Seventy-four [1974] to '82 [1982] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Four [1974] to '82 [1982], okay; that's a pretty good run, and it's still being run, you know; they run it in Chicago [Illinois] all--every night, every night now, you know--yeah.  And they have something called MeTV in Chicago; they run a lot of the comedies from the '70s [1970s].
Story_ID: 290730
Speaker 1: Now, you were in lots of other shows, but 'The New Odd Couple' was really an interesting show. It was a black version of 'The Odd Couple' and--so tell us about that, and how was this project brought to you?
Speaker 2: Well, it was--you know, it had a lot of possibility, a lot of potential and everything, and I was told that I, I was hired because I talk so good (laughter). And--but then, you know, different things came up, different things happened, I--you know, and ultimately it just got to the place where, you know, I think that promises were made that were not kept, and so we ended up actually--out of the--I think we did eighteen episodes; eleven or twelve of them were original scripts, and I had been promised that they were going to be updated and that the characters and so forth were going to be updated and, you know, I was real clear about the fact that I didn't--in 1982 I wasn't really excited about, you know, wearing party hats and ribbons--I mean and aprons and--it just wasn't the way I wanted to go (laughter), you know?  And there were, you know, there were--but, if you're gonna stick with these old scripts, then, you know, conflicts would come up and so forth, so eventually, I think--I don't know, you know, whether it was--I don't know.  But that--it fizzled out because of that, I think.
Speaker 1: Yeah, times are changing, I guess, in terms of the--how the characters were conceived.
Speaker 2: But, you know, I mean initially when they talked to me about it, it was like, you know, I was told, "You know what?  It doesn't matter, you know what I mean?  It's 1982; I mean they don't even need to be called, you know, the same names, you know," (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oscar [Madison] and Felix [Unger].
Speaker 2: "It doesn't need to be the same--you know, the important thing is we're gonna update and it's gonna be '82 [1982] and, you know, we're gonna--most important thing is that you've got this, this, you know, persona, and you could be inspiring not only to the black kids, but to all kids, and blah, blah, blah," you know, all that stuff.  And then it kind of fizzled, so--but that happens, you know, it's--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) a business of human beings (laughter).
Story_ID: 290731
Speaker 1: How about 'Mr. Rhodes' in '96 [1996] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Mr. Rhodes'?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That was fun.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was fun.  I actually--it was about, you know, a prep school, which I'm fond of prep schools (laughter), and, and the teacher, the, the head--Mr. [Tom] Rhodes guy was a, was a, a standup comedian who was--he was coming into his own as a, as a standup and so forth and so on. He had really long hair and was kind of a hippie kind of, you know--kind of loose and easy, kind of gangly, kind of guy, and then I played a, a, a teacher there who--like a--who was, you know, steeped in tradition and felt like, you know, you should dress a certain way and you should have a certain kind of demeanor and a certain kind of relationship with the students and so forth and so on, and so it was a perfect, a perfect kind of--kind of match, you know, in terms of our playing off of each other.
Speaker 1: Kind of an ironical situation; that's not--I know ironical is not the correct term, but (laughter) the--of a--here's a black person upholding the standards of white culture, really, for a white teacher who's trying to stretch the boundaries of the--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was fun; it was really fun. And they--you know, the kids were really good and all of that.  But again, you know, I mean I've, I've been a part of--I, I mean, you know, you got used to it after a while, you know?  You're part of these things that start out and you think they have, you know, a lot of potential and that they're gonna go on and on and on and on, and they, for some reason don't, you know.
Story_ID: 290732
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about community involvement.  Now, I hear that you've been--so don't tell us you don't (laughter) do anything in the community 'cause we've heard otherwise.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So, what have you been doing?
Speaker 2: Well, I have a couple of--I don't know how this happened, but I love dance and I love dancers. I, I--you know, I'm really--I'm glad I did not know about it when I was younger because had I known, I'm sure I would have pursued it because I have--I'm--you know, I--a lot of times people--if--especially if I'm around other dancers, a lot of people think I am a dancer. They think that just because of the way I move and stuff like that, but--so anyway, as a result, I, I, I've been on a couple of different dance company boards, you know, to try to--you know, to try to support from that, from that perspective.  And then I--I think the thing I've probably most, for the longest period of time (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What dance companies?  Can you tell us what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, there's one called the ARDC, which is the American Repertory--A-R-D-C, yeah, American Repertory Dance Company--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which was originally conceived--it was going to be a company of dancers who were in their--who were forty.  The company eventually had to wrap--I mean we're still, we're still--we still function, but what the company does has had to kind of change a little bit because they're now like fifty-four (laughter), you know--not as much fun to watch (laughter), you know. So--so anyway, we kind of moved into--you know, moved into other, other, other areas.  And then Ka-Ron [Brown] Lehman--.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Ka-Ron is K-A dash, R-O-N; Lehman is L-E-H-M-A-N; I think it was one M--I mean one N, maybe two, but I think it's one.  She also had a dance company that I was, you know, served on the board for.  And I, I actually am on the board of advisors for the St. Thomas University [Miami Gardens, Florida] down in, in Fort Lauderdale [sic.], as well.
Story_ID: 290733
Speaker 1: The agency that I really have devoted most of my attention to has been this, the Wooten Center [Al Wooten Jr. Heritage Center, Los Angeles, California], which started in--you know, I was--I got involved in 1992 after the, after the, the riots here [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Yeah, L.A. [Los Angeles, California] experienced these huge riots after the Rodney King verdict--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know.  It seemed self-evident that police were whooping the crap out of Rodney King and yet the jury found otherwise--ends up with a big riot.  'Nightline'--I'm just trying to put this all in historical perspective for somebody watching this and one who may be much younger than we are, or maybe a, maybe a child right now.  But, yeah--huge public attention given to these L.A. riots and a lot of violence in Los Angeles then.  So, how did you get (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, there was a woman whose son was killed in a drive-by shooting, and the way she dealt with her grief was to try to save other kids, so I had a friend who was associated with the center who called me and said, "You know"--after the riots, called me and said, "You know, you know, I think you should come down and see what's going on, you know; you might be able to--I think you'll be impressed by what's going on here."  So I did; I went down and it turned out there was a little girl there who was--she was probably seven or eight years old, about this wide (gestures), with feet about this long (gestures), just as flat as pancakes, in a little tutu and a boom box, and danced her soul out for the woman, the founder, who had been to New York [New York] and was coming back--they had a little party for her.  Well, I was just an emotional mess (laughter) because this little girl just--she just reached inside of my--and just took my heart (laughter), you know what I mean?  I mean she was just so--just--she was just wonderful, you know?  And so--you know, I mean I kind of felt like, okay, if this is a place that is nurturing these kinds of kids, then I'll find some kind of way to be a part of it.  One of the things that I don't like to do is teach acting, particularly on the elementary level, so I knew I wasn't gonna come and do little drama classes (laughter), you know; it's just not my--it's not my style, so--but I hung around for a while, I hung around, hung around, hung around and then I finally ended up on the, on the board of directors. And so I've actually chaired that board now for ten, eleven years, so--so, you know, when we first began, I think our budget was somewhere below $50,000 for the year, and we are now above $500,000 a year. So I have--if nothing else, I think I've proven that I can beg (laughter) at least for somebody else (laughter).  I find it a little difficult begging for myself, but for, for kids, you know, I've really been able to, you know, be pretty influential in terms of getting other people to donate money and so forth and so on, so we've started a, you know, an annual golf tournament and now we have another fundraiser that happens at the Hollywood Park [Inglewood, California]; it's actually coming up pretty soon.  (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Is the Al Wooten Center W-O-O-T-E-N?
Speaker 1: W-O-O-T-E-N, yeah.
Speaker 2: (No audible response).
Speaker 1: So, it's an after-school program, you know, that has, has tutoring and also homework assistance, and actually, we're implementing a college track program which I'm very, very excited about, so, you know, looks, looks, looks good.
Story_ID: 290734
Speaker 1: Now, in terms of current projects, as an actor, you're in something called 'Firefly,' which is a science fiction piece, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Set in the year 2500--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in outer--on the range and outer space, that's what you (unclear) (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about that, Ron [HistoryMaker Ronald Glass].
Speaker 2: Well, you know, this is a show that is, that is produced and written and directed by Joss Whedon, who also did 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and also 'Angel.'  So, a couple of years ago, when I got involved in it, I was, I was really, really happy because I thought--you know, I've been looking for another show to last four or five years, and then I can pass the baton comfortably and not, you know--but this one was not to be it (laughter), although I was, I was hoping 'cause I also loved the character that I play on this, on this thing.
Speaker 1: What is the character like?
Speaker 2: Well, his name is Shepherd Book, and so he's a--he's--you know, Book is not accidental, nor is Shepherd, so he's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It has biblical sort of implications it seems.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean he's a, he's a--he's some kind of minister or preacher type--a guy who's interested in people's souls, though he's not, he's not tight-butted about it at all; he's, he's a pretty--he's a, he's a pretty widely-experienced guy--a lot of mystery about him.  Average (laughter)--you know, we didn't really get to explore fully, but was really fun to play.  So, I think we did eighteen episodes of that, as well, and then last summer, a film was created called 'Serenity,' which is, is probably going to be released in September.
Speaker 1: So, theatrically?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Based on the same characters in--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 290735
Speaker 1: Now, do you have--do you have any aspirations to produce or direct, or come up with projects that, yeah--
Speaker 2: I don't.  You know, it's really--it's interesting, you know; I, I, I almost--it's very, very common for people to ask me, "So, what are you doing now?"  And, you know, "Well, are you writing?"  "Well, are you directing?"  "Are you producing?"--as though I should be.  And I often wanna say, "What the hell are you doing?"  I mean it's just, it just--"What, what are you talking about?"  (Laughter)  You know?  I mean--so probably, you know, you might sense a tiny little bit of defensiveness on my part, but just a tiny bit (laughter).
Speaker 1: We ask the--we ask the common questions because we're not Glasses (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) But, you know, it's--that--my desire is to act, and that's--I don't, I don't want to do the rest of it.  And part of it--you know, I, I mean I, I--part of it is--probably part of the reason I get so aggravated by that question is it probably stirs some kind of acknowledgement inside of me that there's some more stuff I could do (laughter), and I'm just not doing it, so rather than deal with that, just get mad at the person who asks the question, saying, "What are you doing," (laughter)?
Speaker 1: We always ask that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, as though that, as though that frees me up (laughter).
Speaker 1: But you know, what it is, I think that the reason why we always ask it and the reason why people always go there, I think, is because, you know, the media is so powerful, and once we get somebody in it, you know, we think that we--our expectations of them, you know, are probably too much.  I mean I'm not--I would never say that you're not doing enough, you know--I mean I don't know; but people have--when they--a lot of people when they get in it, they wanna do too much and they can't be effective, you know.  And it's really, it's really--it's a huge industry and we have, just as in most industries, the African American community does not have the power we would like to have or even should have, so we--I think we--you know, I think that's why people always ask that.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I understand that and, and I also--but I, I also wanna say that one of the things in my family that has been really, really common is that by the time people get to be about thirty-five or so--certainly by the time they're forty, whatever kind of ambition or talent or whatever, they--by the time they get thirty-five or forty, they're blown out, they're done (laughter); they've either been beaten up so bad, or so discouraged or so let down, or just tired (laughter), you know, and so what they--and so they just, they just sit on the porch and just kind of talk about people and stuff as though--as, as--kind of like as amusement, you know?  So, I--you know, I might not be doing enough, but I'm not doing that, so there's some progress being made for the family (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, being on, like four boards, I mean that keeps you busy probably doing--and working.
Story_ID: 290736
Speaker 1: That kind of leads to a natural question we ask as we wind down, and that's, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, again, you know, I, I, I am thoroughly African American, I'm, I'm, I'm totally committed to being what I am, which is a black man, but my concern for the African American community is about its humanity, which we all share--all colors.  My, my sense is that if people individually perfect the humanity inside of their lives, then we each become global citizens as opposed to being these little pockets of special interests.
Speaker 1: So, would you--I'm trying to figure out how to phrase--so would you be--I mean--well, you know, we have a lot of black organizations that are black organizations--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and you think we don't need so many of those, but more individual involvement outside of the black community?  Is that what you're saying?
Speaker 2: I didn't say that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, I didn't (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (laughter) What I--what I'm saying is that I think that from my perspective, the issues in the black community are not about becoming great black men, it's about becoming great human beings because if you're a great human being, you'll be a great black man, or a great green man (laughter) or, you know, if you're a, a great human being, you'll be a wonderful mother, or a wonderful daughter, or a wonderful wife--whatever your color is.  That is my--that's from my perspective, and that's also my, my hope, that's also my wish, that's also my--my prayer, actually, for the black community and for the global community.

Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I don't know. Maybe I wouldn't have waited so long to answer Benny's challenge to fight over at Third Avenue School [Evansville, Indiana] (laughter).  Maybe we should of fought a little bit--maybe we should of fought a week earlier (laughter).  I don't know, I don't know.  I mean I (laughter)--you know, I, I--you know, I, I sometimes wonder what it would be like if I had put on some party hats and some aprons and did the rest of those (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) '[The] Odd Couple' shows?
Speaker 2: '[The] New Odd Couple' shows just exactly the way they wanted them to, to be done. I mean--I don't know.  Would I have been labeled then a--I, I, I don't know, you know.  Or would--I, I don't know.  But what--you know, but what I do know is that I feel really good about the choices that I have made in terms of the characters that I have played and the way I've played them, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That kind of--
Speaker 2: --except for one (laughter), except for one (laughter), you know.  That was the one I was supposed to be able to talk about on the, on 'The Tonight Show,' you know what I mean?  But anyway--what were you gonna say?
Speaker 1: What character was that, anyway?  What character was that?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Lennie [Small].
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I never did do Lennie--I didn't do it.
Story_ID: 290738
Speaker 1: If you-if you had it to do all over again, was there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I don't know, you know?  Maybe I wouldn't have called a guy out for mistreating my girlfriend. Maybe he'd have offered me some better stuff--I don't know, you know, but I, I don't--. I'll take the chance on that, you know?  I mean--you know, I don't have--I'm, I'm really, I'm really comfortable with myself, you know what I mean?  I mean with my--I mean I'm not finished working on it but I'm, I'm, I'm pretty glad about who I am.  I'm not happy about everything I've done but, but that's reparable, but I'm really pretty confident and hopeful about who I can continue to cultivate, to un--to uncover, to manifest as a person, and I'm--I, I think in my life right now I'm, I'm more concerned about that than I am about what kind of characters I'm going to play, you know?  I mean--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In July I'll be sixty; I mean I think something would be really off if I were still--if I still had the same kinds of ambitions and goals that I had when I was thirty (laughter); it'd be pretty silly.  As a matter of fact, it reminds me--that, that reminds me of when I was in college [Evansville College; University of Evansville, Evansville, Indiana], I used to go--we, we had this great, this great, this great nightclub in Evansville [Indiana] that we all used to hang out at, and there was a man in there who at that time was probably, I don't know, he was probably fifty maybe, but he could dance his butt--I mean he could (laughter), he could dance and he had all the dance--all the moves down and wore the same clothes that the twenties and the twenty-five year-old guys were wearing and stuff. I mean he was--and--I mean I liked him and he was fun and everything, but there was some--but--and I couldn't put my finger on it but there was something about--that was like, what's wrong with him?  Something was (laughter)--and I couldn't figure out what it was, but as I, as I mature, I think that what it was is that he hadn't moved on (laughter), you know?  I mean he was, he was still--'cause he still had the same kind of lifestyle, I guess, that a--that the, the twenty and twenty-five year-olds had; there was something, I don't know, kind of off about that to me, I guess.  So, anyway--I don't even know if I answered your question, but I, I--it just reminded me of this guy and--there you have it.

Speaker 1: We usually ask about family and people that are married, we ask about their kids and so forth, but what constitutes your family now, and how do the--how do people around you feel about what you're doing and--.
Speaker 2: My, my parents [Lethia Gibson Glass and Crump Glass] are dead, my three brothers are dead. My sister [Geraldine Glass] is still alive; she lives twenty minutes from me, we have a really good relationship.  She has five kids, they have kids, I have a, a, a--an extensive chosen family network as well.  Is that what you mean?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Everybody has a family--some kind of extended group around 'em.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I'm--you know, I stay busy, I'm always--you know.  I don't have a computer, I don't have a cellphone.
Speaker 1: How do you live?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) But I'm getting closer (laughter).  I went to, I went to a store the other day 'cause I was--I wanted to type something, and I, I went into this huge big Best Buy store, and I asked them to, to show me the typewriter department, and they laughed.  I mean (laughter)--.
Speaker 1: Probably a merciless laugh.
Speaker 2: It was like--well, they were amused; I mean they were like--well, it was like--kind of like a delightful sort of fantasy kind of thing, you know?  Not only did they not have a typewriter, they didn't know where to tell me to try to find one.  And then I also realized that it's been about thirty years actually, since I've actually done any typing, so by the time I get through erasing and carrying on, a computer might be the place--the, the way to go, so--anyway, there's hope.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done so far, what would you consider at this juncture to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: 'Barney Miller,' clearly.  I mean, you do mean in terms of work, right?
Speaker 1: Well, in terms of work or anything else, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, certainly in terms of work, certainly 'Barney Miller' (laughter).  In terms of, in terms of the rest of my life, I, I--you know I'm just--I'm stepping out on a limb here 'cause I've, I've, I, I've never asked anybody that question, you know?  I mean I've never asked in order to sort of like get back--get feedback and stuff, but I'm stepping out on a limb, and I would just guess that it's--that it would be, you know, living a contributive life with sincerity and humor.
Story_ID: 290741
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?  It's similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I don't know. Maybe that's--maybe I've gotten my wish already.  Maybe to be remembered as a person who lived a contributive life with sincerity and humor.  I don't know, maybe that satisfies me, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
