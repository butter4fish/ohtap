Story_ID: 127904
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, we'd like to start by exploring your family background.  Could you tell me about your mother?  What was her name and where was she born?
Speaker 2: Her, her name was Trumela Dingle [ph.] and she was also born in Dillon County, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where did she grow up?
Speaker 2: In Dillon, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: And do you know much about her background and the conditions or environment in which she was brought up?
Speaker 2: Yes, a little.  She was reared by Janie and Eugene Dingle in Dillon, South Carolina.  She attended school until she was tenth grade and she was a high school dropout thereafter.  She left Dillon probably around her early twenties to live in Detroit [Michigan] and then from there to New York [City].
Speaker 1: And how would you describe her?
Speaker 2: Didn't know my mother very well.  We had probably inter--I'd say very little contact during our lives.  I was reared by my grandparents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So those were my, those were my parent figures.
Speaker 1: Do you recall any stories maybe that she shared with you when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not a whole lot.
Story_ID: 127905
Speaker 1: And what was your father's name and where was he born?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Montgomery McKenzie [ph.] and he was born in Dillon County, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: And did he grow up there as well?
Speaker 2: Yes he did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what do you know about his background or his growing up?
Speaker 2: Very little except that it was mostly an agrarian lifestyle, essentially the same as my, my background and then he moved off after going into the [U.S.] Army to cut hair in Virginia, and that's where he lived the rest of his life.
Story_ID: 127906
Speaker 1: So you mentioned you were raised primarily by your grandparents.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you share something with me about your grandmother?  What was her name and where was she born?
Speaker 2: Charity Dingle and she was born in Dillon County, South Carolina, as well.  She was born around 1900, attended Allen University [Columbia, South Carolina] for a time, and back during those years, it only required a high school--you only required a high school education to teach school.  She taught school for a time and then moved to New York [City] to live the majority of her adult life.  Then, she moved back to South Carolina and she basically was the farmer in the family; she ran our family farm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was your grandfather's name and what do you recall about his early background?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandfather was Eugene Dingle.  He was also born in Dillon County, South Carolina.  He was--he did a lot of things.  He was an accomplished musician.  He was an accomplish--accomplished seamstress or seam--or tailor, rather.  He was also a brick mason by training and contractor in addition to, you know, working on the farm and helping to run the farm.  Ran away from home when he was twelve years old, made a living working with portmans [sic porters] on the train until he was maybe seventeen or eighteen years old, a very independent man, very strong personality, disciplinarian and expected a lot of his children and grandchildren.
Speaker 1: Do you recall any stories that your grandparents shared with you growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes I do.  A lot of the--a lot of stories, quite frankly--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --About growing up in the South, about understanding one's sense of self, about pride in work, about pride in one's self, about the idea of change in a new South, lots of stories.  I've shared a lot of time with my grandfather, especially on Sunday afternoons watching the news.  He was a big fan of 'Meet The Press,' also loved reading the newspapers quite a bit, and it became my way of sharing with him as we discussed current events, the kinds of things that were helping to shape America and helping to shape the emerging South.
Story_ID: 127907
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your ancestors?
Speaker 2: Not very far at all, frankly.  The only thing that I do know is that I--the only common ancestor that I'm aware of is Carolina S that goes back into maybe 1880, something like that, in the Moncks Corner areas of South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Were there any stories or legends that were passed down in your family from her ancestry or otherwise?
Speaker 2: No.  Actually, Carolina S is a man, and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I could never quite figure out the name, but I didn't discover that from my grandfather [Eugene Dingle] as much as I did relatives of his that I met after his, after his death.
Story_ID: 127908
Speaker 1: What, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: I suppose playing out in our front yard as a young kid living in town before moving back out to the farm and understanding the comfort of young friendships.
Speaker 1: What was the community like at that time?
Speaker 2: The community that I really have the most consciousness of is the farm community, which I began to live in constantly at the age of five, and it was surrounded by people who worked together, people who played together, and people who supported one another.  There was a strong sense of independence because the entire community that I grew up in, in Dillon County [South Carolina] was an area about a mile long and on that stretch of roadway from beginning to end, the farms were all owned by African Americans.  They were owned in fee simple.  There were no sharecroppers that were there who had to be--who, who were--they were all black and there were some people who would come in and act as sharecroppers but the farms were essentially owned by blacks.  And a strong sense of property, the need to hold on to property, to keep it in the family, to keep the tradition of home ownership and property ownership very strong.  And the concept of support, that if something went wrong in someone's household, you were there to support.  And also the sense of a thousand watchful eyes, if you will, because everybody had responsibility for everybody else's children, that if I did something wrong and if I was at Ms. Katherine's [ph.] house, Ms. Katherine had just the right--as much right as my grandmother [Charity Dingle], grandfather [Eugene Dingle] had to punish me.  If I was doing something the right way, they were equally loving and embracing and encouraging that whenever you left that community, I think the kids that left and certainly myself included, left it with a sense of promise and a sense of responsibility not only to your immediate family but to the entirety of the community because that's who put their stake in you.  And I think that that was a tradition, that when you left, the responsibility for keeping the name a good name was, was important.  The responsibility for doing good, if you will, was important.  The lessons I think that you--that I certainly learned from that were ones of, of really struggle, that you struggle, you work hard to get what you need, and whenever there's somebody else that needs something, if that person is struggling to work with you, that you work just as hard to help that individual as you help yourself.  And those are the things that I remember most.  And some of the reasons why I say that, you know, if one asked me how I'm doin', I always say I'm doin' fine for a farmer from [South] Carolina because it keeps me connected to those things that I think have been very helpful in enabling me to do well in my own life.
Story_ID: 127909
Speaker 1: Were there any holidays, special events or any things that were a part of your daily life [in South Carolina] that you'd like to share?
Speaker 2: Well, you know what's interesting about those, those periods of time especially is that a lot of it was around work because, you know, you have a two-mule farm as they were referred to at that time, and especially in the tobacco belt, which is where we were.  Tobacco and cotton were the major crops.  They were extremely labor intensive and it was a very, very tough way to make a living.  But we--at the end of the year, we had a couple of traditions that I always thought were really fun traditions.  One was something called a chicken bog where all the families would get together after the last tobacco was cropped and everybody would go home and wash up and they would have a--the women would--I don't know how you make chicken bog but folks would pull together the ingredients for it and we'd sit around and--at one of the small locations around that was a gathering place in the farm area and we would have a feast of chicken bog and tell the stories of the events of the summer.  Whether somebody had almost stepped on a rattlesnake or what we did when we were cropping tobacco, that sort of stuff.  The kinds of things I think that happened that make rural life very interesting and somewhat comedic.  And then the other thing that we would do is at the end of the year, we'd all get a trip to Atlantic Beach, which, which was the only black beach in that part of South Carolina along North Myrtle Beach, a segment of about maybe a quarter of a mile, and we would pack up our lunches in the mornings and take that hour and a half long ride down to the beach and that was the highlight of the summer.
Story_ID: 127910
Speaker 1: Could you give your siblings' names in birth order including yourself?
Speaker 2: That's gonna be an interesting challenge (laughter).  I have no siblings of the whole blood.  All my siblings are of the half blood and I'd say that they would be on my mother's [Trumela Dingle's][ph.] side, Jerry Dingle, Douglas Ford, and I have one deceased brother, Frederick Thomas.  Then on my father's [Montgomery McKenzie's] [ph.] side, Linda Bayard [ph.], Russell Gene Davis, and Dorothy Whittington.
Story_ID: 127911
Speaker 1: And what street did you live on when you were growing up?  You described a more rural agricultural kind of community life, but was there a, a particular street?
Speaker 2: No, actually this, this one roadway was called Route 1, Latta, South Carolina, which was the nearest township in Dillon County to the farm area I grew up in, Box 163 as I would remember it.
Story_ID: 127912
Speaker 1: What are some of the sights, sounds, and smells that remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well interestingly enough, I think growing up on the farm, you're always around pack houses.  We had a pack house full of tobacco this time of year.  The smell of tobacco resonated whether you were talking about going inside of a tobacco barn that was curing or going inside of the pack house as tobacco had been cured and was being grated and being processed ready for market.  The smell of the, the, the stables where you keep your mules and your cows and the pigs, you smell that.  But then, you also had the clear smell of fresh air when you go to the fishing pond, but you wouldn't have any sort of smell beyond that that was perhaps less natural than or at least less concentrated in nature than being around a barn.  And that was just fresh air.  But all of it is something I remember.  I think in the fall of the year and the winter of the year, the thing that I remember most is, you know, going hunting.  My grandfather [Eugene Dingle] used to love to quail hunt and going hunting with him, the smell of the wood, and the smell of the dogs, doing that.  Those are, those are smells that I will always remember.
Story_ID: 127913
Speaker 1: Do you have any other memories of growing up that you'd like to share?  I think you mentioned life with, what seven?  Seven or eight siblings?
Speaker 2: Well, actually we never lived--only three of us lived together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All the others were in different households, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --So I just have a brother, Jerry [Dingle], and a brother, Doug[las Ford], that I grew up with.
Speaker 1: And are there any other memories perhaps that you'd like to share?
Speaker 2: Well, it was always a lot of fun.  I mean, growing up with them was, was a lot of fun.  It had its moments.  Perhaps the most impactful period of that part of my life was desegregating the high school [Latta High School, Latta, South Carolina] in that community.  I remember the spring of the year talking with several of my friends about the idea in 1964 of desegregating the white school and getting finally an opportunity to find out what goes on in those schools is so much better than what we had the opportunity to be exposed to.  And about ten or fifteen of us had agreed that we would go together, and on the day that it came time to, to go, no one else showed up and I was there alone.  And remembering the trip with my--the bus being followed by the state trooper for two weeks with my grandfather [Eugene Dingle] with a shotgun in the truck behind the state trooper.  He was truly a committed man about looking after family and making sure that folks understood that he would look after family.  And the experiences going through the kind of socialization in the South at that period of time was very impactful and left some unpleasant memories and also left some very pleasant ones.
Story_ID: 127914
Speaker 1: Let me rewind and, and let's go back to elementary school.  What elementary school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Latimer [sic, Latta] Elementary School in Latta, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: And were, were there any teachers there that you could recall that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --yeah, there is, there is--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --that influenced you?
Speaker 2: There is one guy who stands out as my--a mountain among men for me and his name is Isaiah Collington [ph.].  Mr. Collington was the first person outside of my family to tell me that I was bright, that I was intelligent, that I could do something academically, although I always did pretty well in school.  I was a trouble child.  I fought a lot and I was a teacher's nightmare, but he was able to find a way to reach me when probably the failure to have reached me would've been catastrophic for my life.  He taught history and I always did well in history, and I don't know whether I was ADD [attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder] or what my problem was, but I had problems.  And even when I would get into my class, I'd finish a test say in fifteen minutes.  The rest of the class might be struggling through and he'd let me go and I'd run over to the band room and hang out with the high school students and talk around or chase basketballs in the gym or whatever little kids at that age of--at the age of nine or ten do.  When it came time for me to come back to his class to change for the next class, I always respected the freedom that he gave me, always came back on time, and we just had a sort of understanding that helped me at a very critical point in my, my life to develop a sense of self and develop a sense of perspective about education.  Because education was important to him, it became important to me not to disappoint him, and anything--any freedom he gave me, any challenge he gave me.  And so that was really the very beginning of a sense of feeling an aca--a need for academic competence and a continuing need for some sort of a, a control over deviant behavior.  Probably the most prophet--prophetic point, turning point in my life was really there with, with him one afternoon, taking me aside near the end of my fourth grade and telling me that I was smart.  And it was something he continued to do throughout our association in high school--in elementary school and high school.
Speaker 1: So for your elementary school, it is a community school?  Was it close to home?
Speaker 2: No, nothing was close to home.  It was about five miles away--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --our farm was from town and all of the kids from that part of the area, say within a five or ten mile radius of that part of the county, attended the school, small black school.
Story_ID: 127915
Speaker 1: And at that time, thinking early on those elementary school years, did you have dreams and aspirations then?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think the only dream that I might've had was being a ball player or something like that because there really weren't any--many images that one could attach to to say that that was something you wanted to be.  Unless it was my grandfather [Eugene Dingle] whom I always admired as a bricklayer, but I knew that that was a tough way to make a living and it wasn't exactly what I had in mind for myself.  Teaching was not what I had in mind for myself.  And being a minister or an undertaker wasn't what I had in mind for myself.  And so beyond those images, there was not much else to look forward to and it was only after getting a lot--a little older and understanding the possibilities of what you could do a little differently that expanded my sense of that direction.  I'd say it was probably maybe around 1963 or '64 [1964] sitting in my living room with my grandfather on a Sunday afternoon watching 'Meet The Press,' watching an interview with [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.].  And I remember--I can't remember the nature of the interview.  The only thing I can remember was that here was a man that was so incredibly eloquent in his ability to express himself, and the interview had a sense of tension in it where this white interviewer, Edward R. Merrill [sic Lawrence Spivak], was asking him very tough questions, but he never seemed to be thrown out of balance.  He seemed almost stoic in his capacity to respond, and to respond with tremendous eloquence.  And I never saw one who--anyone who could use a metaphor.  He had to be the absolute master of metaphor.  And those were, were images that hung with me and hang with me to this day, that, that, that said to me somehow another that there is inside of all of us an equalizer, and it is education, a clear mind, and a clear sense of focus, and a clear purpose.  And we all have it within us if we'll just train ourselves to reach out for it.  And, you know, that was a point in time where it began to become a lot more serious about thinking about what the possibilities are for what I could do.
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was fourteen.  That was, that was, that was, that was the age.
Speaker 1: So at that time, were you a middle school student?
Speaker 2: I was in the, I think around the ninth grade.
Story_ID: 127916
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you go from elementary to high school?  Or elementary, middle to high school?
Speaker 2: The way things worked back then, you had just two.  You had elementary school that stopped at sixth and then from seventh grade to twelfth grade was high school, so I was in high school.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that first day integrating high school [Latta High School, Latta, South Carolina].  You were probably about twelve years old?
Speaker 2: No, no, actually I was, I was sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was in my junior year of high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, there was a sense of fear, but I did know that if anybody as the expression goes, had my back, my granddaddy [Eugene Dingle] did.  And there would've had to be two homicides at least.  There wasn't just going to be one.  And that was comforting to know because my grandmother [Charity Dingle] was extremely fearful of what it would be, but I wanted an education and I wanted the opportunity to do something different, and if this is what I had to do to get it, that was alright.  The students there were relatively nonplussed.  The only experience I think that first day was that I had never read a book and it's a shame to admit that, at the age of sixteen, I had never read a book, not even a comic book from cover to cover.  And, and the first class I had was an English class.  I asked the profe--the teacher at the end of that class about a book and she said don't worry, you'll figure it out.  She was not especially helpful and that was sort of clear to me from some of the comments that was made early on in that class about why some people felt the need to be first or why some people felt the need to impose themselves where they didn't belong.  And while I hadn't read a book, I wasn't stupid, and I clearly understood the subtle message that she was sending that I, perhaps, wasn't com--wasn't welcome there.  But then the, the, the opposite happened to me when I went to the library to talk to one of the teachers who taught college English and her name was Mrs. King, Mrs. King.  I admitted that I'd never read a book and she said well, "Larry, that's just unacceptable," and said, you know, I--she gave me my first book which was 'Fail-Safe' [Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler] and she said, "You intend to go to college don't you?"  And I said yeah.  And so what she did, she said, "Alright, I'm gonna post up this list of books and I want you to strike through as you read them, and when you finish this list, I'm gonna post up another list."  And from that day forward, there wasn't a moment of free time that I didn't have that I wasn't reading a book.  And I learned how to do book reports and it helped in my academic competence.  And oddly enough when I came off to Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia], I was still reading deficient.  But, nonetheless, Morehouse and Mrs. King all helped to bring me up to a point where I became eligible or able to read at the, at the college level.  But the struggle of getting there was not an easy one, and I think that it's--were it not for the experience of taking that risk, the things that I do today to make a living I couldn't do.
Story_ID: 127917
Speaker 1: Did you and your family attend church?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes we did.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: The one was a Union Mission, which was a small church directly across the street from the farm.  That was my church.  The other was Bethel A.M.E. Church in Latta [South Carolina] or just outside of Latta.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite parable, passage or sermon that you recall from attending church early?
Speaker 2: No, I, I guess the one thing that resonated with me and I, I, I can't--Reverend Miller was my minister and he was not a typical southern minister in terms of being highly expressive and very emotional in speech.  He, he really lectured more than he preached.  And I really liked that because at the end of the sermons, I always felt like I had a spiritual message that I could listen to and hear in my own way, that touched me in my own way.  And I think it would've probably been the story of Ruth that probably hit me the most because I was very, very close to my grandmother [Charity Dingle] and she was a person of very strong faith, and that was one that I think that, that probably touched me the most.
Story_ID: 127918
Speaker 1: Were there any other teachers from high school that you remember that were influential in your life?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'd say that the other was a teacher at the white school who--her name was Mrs. Monroe [ph.] and she was also the guidance counselor.  She taught French and was the guidance counselor.  And one of the things that she did to me early on as I didn't do as well as I wanted to do on the SAT, well enough to get into the places I wanted to go, but I just wanted to do better.  And what she did is she helped me to understand how the mind works.  I've always been very apt to produce explanations for things, and when I got my score, I explained to Mrs. Monroe that the school, that, that the schools that were looking at these test needed to understand that they were culturally biased.  And what she did next I think was probably one of life's best lessons.  And, you know, in South Carolina, you'd expect in 1970--'60 [1960]--'66 [1966], '67 [1967], she's not gonna be conscious of what's happening with other racial groups.  But she opens up her drawer and she pulls out a--an article from a young student in Florence, South Carolina, who made 1600 on the test; she happened to have been a black female and she says, "Don't ever make excuses.  Do your best.  Understand your own disabilities but do your best.  You don't start perhaps from the same place as this young lady did, but do your best."
Story_ID: 127696
Speaker 1: Coming back to [Latta] high school [Latta, South Carolina], can you tell me how you were treated by the other students when you went to the predominantly white high school?
Speaker 2: Mostly with acceptance and perhaps a great degree of non--I'd say maybe benign neglect that in a way, it was one of the most unusual experiences in that when I'd come into the classroom, the seat in front of me would be vacant, the seat behind me was vacant, the seat to the side of me, each side of me, would, would be vacant, that nobody wanted to be close or identify as being close to me.  I understood that and accepted it but that was really sort of the way things were.  The other person that I'd say who taught me a very good lesson about the capacity to have hope--of hope as a son of the South was my high school basketball coach, Eddie Rice [ph.], who as southern white males go was tough but fair-minded.  And sport became a means by which I was able to gain some sense of acceptance within the culture because I was a good basketball player.  I didn't play basketball my first year because when you transfer within a district, you have to sit out a year, so I was going from the white school--to the white school from the black school in the same district.  My senior year, I did get a chance to play.  And Coach Rice was fundamentally fair, I mean just absolutely to the letter.  He ran me the same way he did everybody else.  He treated me with absolute equality.  If I messed up, I got punished like everybody else.  If I performed, I got rewarded like everybody else.  He made absolutely no distinction.  And I've always respected him for that.  There are a couple of towns in 1966, '67 [1967], Pamplico, South Carolina, and Lamar, South Carolina, where he took me aside and said, "You can't play tonight, and you can't play tonight because I have a sense that something is planned that won't go right for you, so why don't you just sit these out."  And whether that was because somebody had made some sort of telephone call telling him or gave some warning that there was gonna be a disruption, I sat on the bench.  And he told me that there are things in life that are a lot more important than a basketball game, and he understood that.  And he looked out for me.  And, you know, when I say that I think about the South and you start thinking about good people and bad people, black and white, it makes no difference which way, which way you color him, just an outstanding human being.
Story_ID: 127697
Speaker 1: So you're mentioning you played basketball.  Were there any other extracurricular activities that consumed your time?
Speaker 2: Basketball, French, and the farm.  When you're a farm boy, basically when you leave the school in the afternoon, or when I left the school in the afternoon, I was headed back.  My senior year [at Latta High School, Latta, South Carolina] I drove to work every day, or at least to school every day, and drove back.  I didn't catch the bus because by that time, my grandfather [Eugene Dingle] had st--had taken ill, wasn't able to work the farm, so my senior year I had to work it, so that fifteen to thirty minutes earlier of getting back were important daylight hours to work the farm, so I didn't have time to do anything else.
Speaker 1: How did you have an interest or how was your interest in French cultivated?
Speaker 2: There were a couple of guys, one of who came off to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] with me and the other who'd gone on to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], two brothers, who were fluent in French and I thought it was really neat that they spoke French well, and they had a good teacher and something I wanted to do.  I never learned to do it but, nonetheless, that was something that I was very interested in.
Story_ID: 127698
Speaker 1: So let's say that junior [year] of high school, at that point, were you beginning to know what you wanted to be?  Did you have any particular ambitions?
Speaker 2: I had always professed starting at the age of fourteen or fifteen that I was going to be a lawyer.  And the interesting reason or the interesting thing about what motivates you, I can't remember the, the man's name, but he had attended Howard University [Washington, D.C.] from Dillon County [South Carolina].  And Howard at that time, and I still think today, is an extraordinary institution, but then, that was about the only place that I knew of that an African American could get a law degree.  And this fella had been accepted into How--into Howard's law school.  And the talk around the tobacco barn for the several weeks preceding his acceptance at Howard was just phenomenal, that people spoke of him as almost, almost as if he were god-like.  You would've thought he were Apollo, you know, and so I just thought, well gee whiz, if being a lawyer is that some--is a type of thing that causes these women around this tobacco barn to be so filled with that much adoration, it's gotta be something I gotta do.  And I hung--that idea hung with me for a long time, that it was just a concept of creating a sense of academic self that would be worthy of adoration.  And coming off to Atlanta [Georgia], as we mentioned earlier, I met some extraordinary people who were in that profession, The Honorable Clarence Cooper, federal district court judge here, one of those who encouraged that, [HM] Marvin Arrington, [HM] Carl Ware, a host of other people who encouraged that--the pursuit of that goal.  But, you know, back then it was just the idea of having my grandmomma [Charity Dingle] and the folks around the barn think highly of me.
Story_ID: 127699
Speaker 1: How did Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] emerge as your college destination?
Speaker 2: Interestingly enough, these same two guys who were good French students, David and--Manning [ph.] and Kenneth Manning, had different views about life.  Kenneth went on to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] undergraduate school and finished there and went on to teach at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  David wanted to--he was very Afrocentric and so his interest was in Morehouse.  My interest was still at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and I'd chosen three institutions once I filled out my application to college, Howard, Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia], and Morehouse College.  Because my family had no money, I had no source of support financially.  When it came time for me to go off to to college, I was processing student loans myself.  My grandparents [Eugene and Charity Dingle] were not able to help me a whole lot and the application fee at Howard was seventy-five dollars, the application fee at Hampton was fifty, and the application fee at Morehouse was twenty-five.  I felt like if I weren't gonna be able to make it, I'd be better off losing twenty-five than I would the fifty or the seventy-five.  But in addition to that, David had--David Manning had talked to me a great deal about Morehouse, that's where he was going to go, and I had spent the summer of 1966, around July of '66 [1966], talking for an hour on the railroad tracks by the community center with a guy whose name is Jimmy Jones.  Jimmy Jones is a physician now, but he had just finished med school and was a Morehouse graduate.  And he talked to me in glowing terms about Morehouse College, and it only reinforced this image that I had of Morehouse because it was Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] school.  That same fellow that I'd watched equal in conversation and intellect with per--and in some instances even pass David R. Merrill [sic Lawrence Spivak, Meet the Press].  And so Morehouse became much more than just a twenty-five dollar decision; it also became something that I was relatively enthusiastic about.
Story_ID: 127700
Speaker 1: So when you arrived in Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] for your freshman year, do you recall what the environment was like?
Speaker 2: Well, I was most impressed because I'd only been on a college campus once before in my life.  You know, coming off of the farm, this is probably the second or third time that I'd actually left the farm, so--and once contemporary circumstance, it's very difficult to realize how rural I really was.  I'd never eaten in a restaurant or the kinds of things that you take for granted like McDonald's, going into Kentucky Fried Chicken, not my experiences.  And so I was greeted with the whole idea of a--an entirely new set of life circumstances, both academic and social, and very curious about all of them and just wanting to make sure that I could be able to--I would be able to sustain myself because I knew that the two years of college or high school, rather, that I'd had at Latta High School [Latta, South Carolina] couldn't make up the deficiency of ten additional years.  And so with the enthusiasm was also a certain amount of fear.  Would I be able to survive?  Would I be able to make it?  Would I be able to succeed?
Speaker 1: So after your freshman year, how were you feeling?
Speaker 2: I felt fairly good.  I survived it and made some friends, had become a lot more comfortable with myself as a farm boy impersonating an urbanite, you know, trying to figure out, you know, how to become accepted within contemporary urban culture with a lot of rural ways.  I got a chance to eat at Paschal's [restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia] that freshman year, you know, my--one of the first forays into what I would consider a white table restaurant experience at that time.  A lot of things began to come into place for me that helped to ease the transition from where I started to where I was becoming or where I was going.
Speaker 1: Were you participating in any extracurricular activities?
Speaker 2: No, I was doing the best I could to survive.  I was really--that was really it.  That first year was really struggling to keep my grades up, struggling to be able to sustain myself at the institution.  I've always been very social coming along in high school, very popular, but the fear kept me from going to Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] very much or anywhere else, which was quite not my--was not quite my nature.  I mean, one would've expected that I would've spent a lot of time over there but was really focused on trying to survive.
Speaker 1: What was your major?
Speaker 2: I thought I was going to major in economics (laughter).  I had no idea what to major in.  I couldn't--I had no parents that I could talk to about it and that was--I just kind of listened to what other guys were talking about and trying to figure out what they were going to do and just chose economics.  It could've been political science.  It could've been anything but it was just something I decided because I thought it would be a way of getting through the experience, learning a little bit about it because you bear in mind that, again, I'm coming from a very, very rural background with very little exposure, and not many people that I feel comfortable talking to about my dilemma.
Story_ID: 127701
Speaker 1: So upon graduation from Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia], what were some of the things that were on the forefront of your mind?
Speaker 2: Well, actually I never graduated from Morehouse College.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At the end of my sophomore year, I married a young Spelmanite [Pat Dingle].  See, between my first year and my second year, I became quite social and, and I started working as an Atlanta [Georgia] police officer and began--because I was shifted from evening shift to day shift, once folks found out that I was back in school, that was not something that was favored in the department at that time, whether it was coincidental or otherwise, I never really knew, but I needed to have the flexibility to go to school either at night or day, and so I transferred to Georgia State [University, Atlanta, Georgia], which would give me the ability to take day classes if I were on the evening shift or morning shift or take night classes if I were on the day shift.  So I had to end my pursuit at Morehouse College, which has always pained me.  Maybe that's why I'm so excited about my son going; perhaps he can finish what I didn't.
Speaker 1: So how long did you stay with the Atlanta Police Department?
Speaker 2: I kept my status on the police department for about seven years and it was at an interesting time.  The chief at the time I came in was Chief [Herbert Turner] Jenkins and then I worked for a period of time under John Edmond [ph.], and it was under Edmond's tenure that I left, left the department and began working with the City of Atlanta's Crime Analysis Team under, under Mayor [Maynard] Jackson.
Story_ID: 127702
Speaker 1: And that was definitely a, a very vital moment in Atlanta's [Georgia] history.  Mayor [Maynard] Jackson definitely was a trailblazer.  What were your experiences or your interactions with him like?
Speaker 2: Well, the first time I met him was in 1968 when he was running for [U.S.] Senate, he came onto Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] campus, very handsome, very eloquent, very bright man.  And the second time I was able to meet him was as a police officer; this was I think around 1970.  He had been elected vice mayor of the city and we were engaged in I guess combat, if you will, with the police administration about the absence of fair testing in the police department, the absence of the advancement of African Americans within the Atlanta core.  And a group of us got together.  I can't remember all of the people, but the two leaders of the group or one of the leaders of the group, well two I'd say, were Floyd Reeves and C.C. Mitchell [ph.], the late C.C. Mitchell.  And we decided we'd go to Maynard's home at two o'clock in the morning.  He lived on 2nd Avenue or off 2nd Avenue in southeast Atlanta, not exactly the greatest time to knock on somebody's door to make a--an impression, but we knocked on his door at two in the morning.  He answered it.  He talked to us for an hour and a half, made promises to us, every one of which he kept, and to this day is one of my, I think, a hero to a lot of people because he just believed in doing what was right and causing to be done what was right under those circumstances.
Story_ID: 127703
Speaker 1: So at this time, you're working for the Atlanta Police Department, you've completed this degree at Georgia State [University, Atlanta, Georgia], and you transition into law school.  How did, how did that happen?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a lot that happened in between that.  I think that in working for the crime analysis team, one of the things that Mayor [Maynard] Jackson had a penchant for was trying to put the best people around him that he could find.  I mean, that was just his habit.  And the director of the crime analysis team, and actually there were two, one was Michael Terry.  Michael Terry was at the--he ran the Atlanta Legal Aid Society and done an outstanding job with him there, and then took on the job as the executive director of the crime analysis team, and as a lawyer, brought an interesting perspective to the discussion of social justice or the discussions of social justice that we were facing in the community.  Michael encouraged me to apply at the law school at University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina], but that didn't, that didn't work out.  I did well on the SAT but at the time, my wife and I decided that that was not a good idea to move from Atlanta [Georgia].  Then, his leadership was followed up by a guy named George Napper, Dr. Napper, was an interesting person, and he for the first time challenged me.  I'd often talked about going to law school at the graduate school and his expression was I suffered from what he called the "I'mo syndrome."  And I asked George what was that.  He said, "Well it's the I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna do that."  He says, "I don't want you to say anything to me about it until you've done something."  And so I waited around for a long time and actually started undergraduate school or graduate school at Georgia State in the political science program with the idea of getting a doctorate in political science.  And then shortly after that, the law school opened up.  I had become clerk of council as the department head for the City Council a year or two earlier, but it was very propitious that--in timing that the law school had opened up and I applied and was in the charter class of the law school.  But as it turned out, it was a very good thing to happen as it did.
Speaker 1: When you were entering law school, did you know what you wanted to focus on as an attorney?  What areas of specialization?
Speaker 2: No, I was still tryin' to please the, the ladies at the barn, still just tryin' to (laughter) seek out some satisfaction of my academic, my own academic credibility.  But I had the unique credibility of knowing Judge Cooper, of knowing [HM] Marvin Arrington--Judge Arrington, knowing Maynard [Jackson], knowing Isabel Gates Webster, knowing Marva Jones Brooks, Roy Mayes [III], John Myer [ph.], a whole bunch of people, Tom Bowman, who were extraordinary lawyers and extraordinary friends and supporters who would encourage me throughout my years just to try it, and so I was very fortunate to have the opportunity when I did.
Story_ID: 127704
Speaker 1: So upon graduating from law school [Georgia State University College of Law, Atlanta, Georgia], what was first on your agenda?  What was next?
Speaker 2: Well, I was still working as clerk of council as a department head and decided that I would continue to do that for a while.  And one day, [HM] Marvin Arrington told me that there are no jobs for ex-clerks, and it was one of the reasons why I went to law school as well.  I, mean, but he told me that you always want to have a--an exit strategy, and another good friend of mine, [HM] Carl Ware, the same thing.  And so Carl in particular took the time to help me about two or three years out from the time I was actually ready to leave to plan an exit strategy, which is what we talked earlier about Atlanta [Georgia] being such a unique place that you can have such tremendous associations with people who can help you and will help you in gaining a sense of self and gaining a sense of direction.  And so we planned an exit strategy.  One of those exit strategies was for corporate America; the other of those exit strategies was for a law practice.  And we did very competently in both.  And through his leadership and guidance and the leadership and guidance of a guy named Richard Guthman [ph.] and another, Lawrence Ashe, things worked out very well.  By the time February rolled around and November rolled around of 1989, I knew exactly where I was going.
Story_ID: 127705
Speaker 1: And at this time, we, we, we haven't discussed much about your family, so somewhere in this process, you got married--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --And there were children.  Could you discuss that a little bit please?
Speaker 2: Sure.  I have, as I mentioned to you earlier, one child from a teenage pregnancy, a beautiful young lady who works with Delta Air Lines as a flight attendant, and then at the end of my sophomore year, I married the young lady from Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], and Pat [Dingle] and I have two children together, Rob and Tiffany.  And then I'm currently married to Catherine [Dingle], and Catherine and I have a son, Joseph.  So I have four children, all very wonderful people.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you would like to share as it relates to wisdom about fatherhood?  Parenting?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things that I, I believe very strongly is that--is, is the sense of responsibility for children, that you have to love them because they don't ask to come here.  And if you happen to be involved in bringing them here whether accidentally or otherwise, that's your responsibility.  You take it seriously, both emotionally and financially.  They deserve that.  And if you give them that, they'll turn out to be good people.
Story_ID: 127706
Speaker 1: Okay, so I'm gonna come back to where you were talking about the transition that you were making, your exit strategy.  Where exactly did that lead you?
Speaker 2: Well, it led me to a host of considerations for law, law firms and had the opportunity to meet with Doug Dillard, Carl Westmoreland, and Dick Wilson of a law firm at the time, it was called Dillard, Westmoreland & Wilson.  And of all the law firms I had considered and the people I had talked to, we bonded very well.  I felt very comfortable with, with that group and I still practice with some of those same guys today, and that is now sixteen years later, about fifteen years later.  The strategy that [HM] Carl [Ware] had identified was to sit me down with one of his closest friends, one of his very good friends, Bill Ide [ph.], and then also to sit me down with Lawrence Ashe.  And between those fellas, I mean, they did just an outstanding job of getting the word out and creating the opportunity for me, for me to meet partners at other law firms or law firms to talk to them about my transitioning into the practice area.  Land use and zoning is something I've always had an interest in and so the opportunity to sit down and talk to Doug and the other partners at that firm was uniquely beneficial to me because I thought that that was the skillset that I had acquired the best facility to succeed in, leaving city government, and it turned out to, to work out that way.
Speaker 1: And you've actually published in this area.  Could you tell us a bit about your book?
Speaker 2: No, it's not really a book.  It's just been an article or two that I've written on land use and zoning issues, how you deal with meandering the local government process, property rights generally, changes in property rights law in Georgia, which is an, an evolution that's constant.
Story_ID: 127707
Speaker 1: So in terms of law as a vocation, how do you think it has best facilitated you making or leaving a legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I won't profess to be the quality of lawyer that leaves much in the way of a legacy.  I think that that's--that would be almost arrogant for me to say that.  I think that there are guys who have done enormous service to the legal profession in creating legitimacy for the zoning law practice, and people who probably do it far better than I.  What I try to do in my practice of law is to be in the business, in the business of helping people, whether that's a small client or large client, to make sure that I can take the issue that they have that may be complex and get them through it successfully to the extent that I believe in it.  Of course, as I say to clients, it's important for me to feel a sense of a capacity to be passionate about what I do, and if I don't believe in what you're doing, I can't be passionate about it.  So I've been blessed to have clients who are engaged in projects whether large or small that I can see a sense of right in, i.e. that it's a sustainable project, that it's done in a tasteful way, and that it will add both aesthetic and economic value to a community, and under those circumstances, I can always go to battle and fight as hard as necessary to be successful.
Story_ID: 127708
Speaker 1: Are there any cases that you'd like to share with us that have been of particular interest and, I guess, value to you professionally?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  I mean, I've had the opportunity to work at Phipps [Plaza] for a long time.  And for the longest time, when we started Phipps, it's one of the first projects that I began to work on in 1990 as I was exiting City Hall [Atlanta, Georgia] and going into the law practice, and seeing that as an opportunity for a mixed use development to occur where you could have high rise, residential development, office development, and retail on the same site that creates the kind of opportunities that Atlanta [Georgia] and the region are gonna have to take more advantage of in order to reduce urban sprawl.  That was, that was probably--that's one project that I'd say that I have a great deal of pride in being associated with.  One of the more recent ones is the Atlanta Gas Light site that I think also moves us in that direction.
Speaker 1: Are there any cases that have been controversial that you have served as counsel related to?
Speaker 2: Well, oddly enough, even Phipps, we ended up litigating the issue of the second tower in the back of Phipps, which I thought was an unusual set of circumstances.  Where could you best--where other--where else would you want to have density, high rise residential density?  What better location than the back of a shopping center next to an existing residential tower and right down the street from a series of office complexes?  But, you know, the expression is everybody wants--everybody hates sprawl, everybody loves density, but nobody wants to do anything about it, and that was just one of those examples.  But my career has been built upon most con--most of the time controversial cases, I mean--but I typically end up with the cases that are somewhat complex.  I've often wondered sort of jokingly whether or not it's because I make them complex or whether they are complex when they come to me.
Story_ID: 128771
Speaker 1: So you mentioned something about controversial, really having controversial cases, perhaps even their complexity being an addition that, that could be your--could be referred back to you.  Are there any other cases perhaps that you'd like to share that would be of interest or that have historical relevance?
Speaker 2: Well, not really.  I, I, I think that there are moments in time when you have--when I've advised clients and my role as a city attorney by way of example that creates some sense of, of, of importance and significance.  I remember in one of the local communities that I served as, as city attorney for, as one of the city attorneys, having a discussion about the Voting Rights Act and having the position of maybe trying to manipulate a client into a position of understanding what his vote meant and attempting to take away the right of the public to choose, and probably one of the most disappointing moments as a lawyer is when you realize both the social consequences of the decision and the political consequences of the decision in terms of what it took for people to be able to get the right to vote and how it is so easily confiscated by someone's decision, political decision, to take it away.  And the thing that was probably so prophetic about it, was that the person I was speaking to was an African American, and you realize sometimes how much things change and sometimes how much they don't.
Story_ID: 128772
Speaker 1: What is your perspective on the upcoming march here in the city with [HM] Reverend [Jesse L.] Jackson around that very issue [voting rightd]?
Speaker 2: I think that no right should ever be taken for granted.  The social challenges, the political challenges of the 1960s are certainly different than the challenges that we have in many respects today but there are still challenges, and I think it is unwise for any of us to believe that there aren't.  I mean, we can go back to the last two presidential elections and understand why it is so vitally important to keep voting rights very much alive in the South and to keep the rights for people to vote alive everywhere.  Also to understand that even in this community, which is considered the most enlightened among the African American communities in the country that most of our political leadership is elected with less than fifty percent of the vote, sometimes less than thirty percent of the vote.  What I--as clerk of council, one of my responsibilities was to act as election superintendent, so it gave me an opportunity to prepare the certification of all of the elections, and I was always nosy enough or, if you will, curious enough to look at the numbers.  And even in a mayoral election here in Atlanta [Georgia], if you have thirty-two percent of the vote, of the, of the vote as casting votes who are elect--who are qualified to vote in Atlanta or forty percent, whatever that number is, they may vote in the mayor's race.  Then, that number drops off dramatically for the [Atlanta City] Council president's race, and then all the other races, the other eighteen or rather the other fifteen now members of council who run were elected by an extremely small number of people, and that constitutes the governing majority, at least the governing authority of our community.  Whether you're talking about judicial posts or county commission posts, the same thing holds true.  So the challenges are different but they're still there.  In order to keep democracy safe and alive, I think Reverend Jackson's doing the kind of things that's necessary to keep breathing life into our democracy.
Story_ID: 128773
Speaker 1: Are there any other causes or relevant issues that you feel passionately about?
Speaker 2: Well, anything I feel, I feel passionately about it.  There's nothing--I tend to be very private in my political views, very private in most everything, and I don't--I react quietly for things.  I--I'd say that I have very strong feelings about the way that our community deals with elderly issues.  That, that to me is extremely important that that is a part of a focus in our society that we don't take seriously enough and we don't take care of them, whether those are homeless folks that are elderly or elderly people generally.  That would be one issue.  The other issue I think is youth.  I find myself on both extremes.  I don't think that we spend enough time focusing on trying to provide a quality environment for our youth.  A dollar spent or an hour spent, quality hour spent or hours spent with young adults, with young people, can save us a lot on the back end in terms of directing them into positive life roles rather than negative life roles.
Story_ID: 128774
Speaker 1: Why, why did you want to tell your story?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, I was asked and hopefully something coming out of this will be helpful, for one thing, first for any young person that sees this.  Whether you're growing up in the depths of the ghetto, in poverty, on somebody's farm with not much hope, I've been there.  I know what it's like to be poor, not necessarily poor of spirit and poor of promise, but poor financially.  I know what it's like to struggle.  I know what it's like whenever you've been a father at the age of sixteen and how that weighs on you emotionally to deal with it.  And I know what it's like to carry that with you for a long time, and I know what it's like to marry at the age of twenty and to provide for a family that way.  And I know what it's like to have a dream of entering a profession when it seems so distant away, but if you keep going day by day by day, you can make it.  If you keep your friendships strong with people who are also going someplace, it helps.
Speaker 1: How, how do you feel about the way you've lived your life and what is important to you?
Speaker 2: What's important to me probably more than anything else is fairness, that I have been fair to everybody, that I've, I've seen life as existing on one plane, that when I walk past a person who is homeless that I don't feel any better than that person.  I don't have the right to look down at that individual, that I look him or her straight in the eye, and they have the right to look me straight in the eye, that I try to help people in everything I do.  At the end of the day, if it helps somebody, then I'm better for it, being fair to everybody I know and helping anybody that I can.
Story_ID: 128775
Speaker 1: For those going into the profession of the law, what suggestions or recommendations do you have for them?
Speaker 2: Well, for one thing, the first and foremost message is to understand that the law is a way of making a living and is not a way of making a life, and if you keep making a living in focus and keep making a life the primary thing you're doing, it helps you understand the broader context in which you apply your tr--one applies one's trade.  Very often times you, you have people who focus on being lawyers without looking at community, who focus on the law without connecting to family, that it is a way of existing it's a means by which you can make a living, that's all it is.
Story_ID: 128776
Speaker 1: What do you still want to do that you have not done yet?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Go back to the farm (laughter).  You know, it's funny how things go full circle but, you know, right now the thing that I'm most interested in is being able to find a small farm someplace that I can actually have a way to get away to sometimes.  Never thought I'd ever say that because I hated the farm work so much, but the sense of tranquility and quiet that I found there as a youth for purposes of introspection and examining where I wanna go or wanted to go is now the thing that I look to in examining where I've been and where I wanna go.
Speaker 1: Are there are any professional ambitions?  Any ways in which you see yourself either continuing or expanding what it is that you do?
Speaker 2: Maybe in the development side at some point in time, I've toyed with the idea, but that would be the only other thing.
Story_ID: 128777
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you've done already that upon reflection you think you might've done differently?  Any regrets?
Speaker 2: You know, interestingly enough, the job that I had that I enjoyed the most other than doing what I do now is probably law enforcement.  That gave me a unique opportunity to feel like and to know that I could actually reach out and touch somebody's life and help them.  There was a unit called the Crime Prevention Unit when I was coming along where the law, where the [Atlanta] Police Department actually assigned us to go out in the summertime and to mingle with youth.  And there were some stories that I won't tell that--where I really felt like I changed somebody's life.  I helped them move in a different direction than where they were going, much in the same way that I think Mr. Collington [ph.] helped me, that there were points in times where I know that they were going in the wrong direction and how I treated them and how I dealt with their situation really made a difference.
Story_ID: 128778
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well, my, my hope is--well, let me start with the concerns first.  The concerns I have again have to do with how we are dealing with the concept of family and youth.  I really don't know how we get to a place that's valued.  But I think that again the way I grew up, while it's not a perfect way, was an excellent way where people had the ability to watch me and had the ability to discipline me, and if they didn't discipline me, certainly had the ability to report on my conduct, that there were always eyes in the community watching what I did, and if they weren't watching, I was always fearful that they might be.  And so that, that really governed my conduct and my parents--my grandparents [Charity and Eugene Dingle] had an open eye and an open ear to those criticisms and were willing to respond to them and trying to give me a sense of direction.  As a community, we don't reinforce one another well, and I don't know whether that's because the way we've evolved in an environment like a city impacts that, where you have a lot of anonymity that you don't have on a farm, but that's one of the things that somehow or another the way that we live as a society is, is problematic, that we don't know the people down the street and we don't have a sense of connection to the people down the street where we realize the common aims and common goals we have for the future of our children.  That would be the thing that concerns me.
Story_ID: 128779
Speaker 1: What thoughts do you have about this generation's trials and what suggestions or recommendations do you have to them?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I see a lot of, I see a lot of promise in this generation.  You know, I have a--an eighteen-year-old getting ready to head off to college and I think about his music and I, I often times wanna be critical of it, but I have to be remindful of the fact that whenever I was coming along, I probably heard the same things about that devil music I was listening to as rock and roll from my grandparents [Charity and Eugene Dingle].  And so to, to understand that that medium is, is something that bothers me, I try to put it into context, but I'm still troubled by the, the, the nature of expression that seems to me to be a little bit more civil--I meant a little bit less civil than, than I'm accustomed to.
Speaker 1: You're speaking about rap music?  Or?
Speaker 2: I'm-
Speaker 1: R and B?
Speaker 2: I'm thinking--I'm talking about rap music.  I'm talking about the suggestive nature of it, that it tends to be a little bit more than--I understand it's art and I understand that people have a choice not to, not to select that--that they--that which they listen to that offends someone else, but I'm thinking about the general nature and the general direction that it seems to be going in that, that's a little bit of a problem.  And I know there are people that have different views about it, but I'm probably a little bit old-fashioned that way.  I think that there's a different way to, to do it than the way we're doing it.  And I, and I, I don't know that it's fair to indict the artist because in my household, people--my son may listen to it, but he's got other reinforcement there to help him understand the nature of the words.  At the same time he's reading or listening to rap music, he's also reading James Baldwin.  There's something else positive going on that helps him understand or [HM] Nikki Giovanni's poems or helping him understand that there's something different.  In some parts of our society, that's not the case, and I wonder what we can do to change that balance.
Story_ID: 128780
Speaker 1: When you look at your life, what stands out the most?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Just being a farm boy from South Carolina is about all I know (laughter).
Speaker 1: And what values do you consider to be the most important and why?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said earlier, I think honesty and, and really the way that you're dealing with people, the fairness in the way you're dealing with people or things that have always stood out for me as being important.  Creating a sense of dignity within people is something I take a great deal of pride in.  If, if I can walk past somebody and say something to them that makes them feel better about themselves about that day, that to me is a power that I'd always want to share with folks.  One of the things that I will always remember, and I've had some great teachers, and I think that Maynard [Jackson] was one of those, that I'd walk into my office as a young department head and he'd have my secretary wrapped around his finger just talking to her, this great big mayor who would take the time out of his busy day to walk into my office to speak to her.  The power that we have within ourselves to lift one another up was something that I think was an art that he took to a different level, and that every day that if we could share within ourselves the ability to lift one another up, there's no limit to how far we can elevate ourselves as human beings.  And that's what Maynard did with everybody around him.  If there's one thing that I could borrow from him that I wish I could was the ability to do that, and to practice that art in the same way, the same way that Judge [Clarence] Cooper does it, the same way that [HM] Carl Ware does it, to keep encouraging us as a body to move forward, and if we do that, every once in a while we're gonna touch somebody and make their life different and better.

Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?  What do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: That I was a farmer from South Carolina who did a little bit of good (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's very central.  What message or lessons do you have for your children, grandchildren in the world?
Speaker 2: Well, that it makes no difference where you start.  What really matters is how you end up.  And it's the message that I give to my son who's got a starting place that is far better than the starting place I had, that at the end of the day if he hasn't done better in some way to improve his position, then it is for naught, whether that becomes better educated, better trained.  It makes no difference that he is going--whether it's engineering, sociology, whatever it is he does, he's gotta find a way to improve himself and improve our lot as a people.
Speaker 1: Why do you think that history is important?
Speaker 2: Well, if you don't know where you've been, it's very difficult to kinda know where you're going.  There's an old story that someone told me about, well about the way that as people we figure out who we are.  For me, you know, my grandparents [Charity and Eugene Dingle] used to tell me about--in specific, the story they used to tell me about was my grandfather's courage, his capacity to stand up and to be counted, his capacity to reason and to be calm when necessary, and the stories of history help us understand where we fit within the context of human behavior today, so I think it's important to look back.  It's important, it's important to know.  It's important to know, for example, why it is that African Americans aren't referred to in the Constitution, okay.  Having that historical context helps one understand struggles of today.  Going back to the dispute about in 19--or in 1887 or 1787, should we, should we be considered property of people?  Well, one, one part of The Constitution mentioned feeling very strongly that we should and others feeling that we shouldn't, and Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, states that were very important to the union of the thirteen states, having great deals of slaves, were not going to be a part of the union.  So when you understand history, it helps you to understand lots of things and gives you a different perspective on lots of things.
Speaker 1: Just for general information purposes, we've covered a lot of ground in this interview and I wanna make certain that there aren't any questions that I might've needed to have asked that I haven't asked about you personally or professionally.  Is there anything you'd like to share that I haven't inquired about?
Speaker 2: You've done a very good job.  You've asked a lot of very poignant questions and I'm, I'm--I can't think of anything.
Speaker 1: Well, Mr. Dingle, I'd like to thank you so much for your taking the time out to complete this interview.

Speaker 1: I didn't go into the role of Clerk of Council to a great degree.  Actually, I became a department head in the City of Atlanta [Georgia] at the age of twenty-eight and at a very critical time in Atlanta's history was in the end of Maynard's [Maynard Jackson] first term and the beginning of his second term as mayor.  The council at that time was a body of eighteen council members with a council president who's headed up by [HM] Carl Ware, who now is or at least later became an executive at Coca-Cola, and he was followed by [HM] Marvin Arrington as the council president to succeed him.  A very interesting time in Atlanta's political history was also during the time when the new airport was being built and the beginning of the efforts of Maynard to create economic parody or economic fairness within city contracting, was a very pivotal time, I think, in our community's history, and one of the circumstances under which I think the city's leadership recognized the need for economic desegregation, which I still think is in the future of this country and extremely important aim that there has to be economic diversity within the context of those people who hold wealth.
Speaker 2: So when you're speaking about your involvement with Maynard Jackson, are there any other key players that were the focus or at the focus of attention at that time that you were speaking with, or?
Speaker 1: Yes, there were because it wasn't something that Maynard did all alone.  The--there's a fella named Morris Finley, the ordinance, the City of Atlanta's Minority Business Enterprise Ordinance used to be called the Finley ordinance.  And Morris Finley was a person, I think, who authored Atlanta's first economic diversity ordinance or Minority Business Enterprise Ordinance.  There were also people again like Carl Ware, Q.V. Williamson, Pankey Bradley [ph.] who were very instrumental in the enforcement of that ordinance because at that point in time, the council was essentially split, had nine blacks, nine whites, and very often, these kinds of initiatives required collaboration between African American elected officials and white elected officials to pass.  And most often, they didn't pass along a majority line of blacks and whites.  It really meant that there was people who crossed over, or there were people who crossed over, to support those important policy initiatives.  I think that that was one of the things that marked and marks Atlanta as a very special place in this country and that you do have a great deal of dialogue that occurs between blacks and whites in a constructive level to help us move our community forward.

Speaker 1: Do you have any memories early on of a young Shirley Franklin?
Speaker 2: I do.  I can remember the very first time I met Shirley.  I was looking for someone on Tuckawanna [in Atlanta, Georgia], the street that she lives on, and didn't know the exact address.  And, and the second time I saw her, she was a commissioner of the Department of Cultural Affairs and I was the department head of, of council at the time and she just seemed uniquely competent as a, as a commissioner, always had a good feel for her budget, and always had a good sense of what she wanted to do with the arts program.  And then when Maynard's [Jackson] term ended and Andy [HM Andrew Young] was elected and she became chief operating officer, I thought that Andy had maybe not made the best decision because she ran the smallest department in city government and I just wasn't sure of what her capability was to be the chief operating officer.  Within six to eight months, I was convinced that Andy was brilliant because she demonstrated the ability to take very strong personalities like Pat Glisson, who was the commissioner of finance, Lee Brown, the chief of--the commissioner of public safety, of Chester Funnye.  These are people who've had--who had years and years of experience in their positions and lead them.  A she led them by listening, and she led them by evaluating, and then led them by competent decision making.  And from that day to this, she gets the highest marks I could give a public official.  She listens and that's a skill that I'm--I hope I can acquire and develop to the level that she has.  But she listens and she listens intently.  She has almost an innate ability to evaluate and to make--help people come to the right choice.  And she is a master consensus builder, and I have the fondest hopes for Atlanta's [Georgia's] future in Her Honor's hands.  She is truly a person that does it, not because she's looking for political pats on the back.  I think she could care less about that.  What she does, she does from the heart.
