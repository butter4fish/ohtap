Story_ID: 187072
Speaker 1: Sir, I want to start out by asking you about your mother [Cindy Antoinette McGee Marr].  And, if you could give her name and tell us a little bit about her background.
Speaker 2: Cindy Antoinette McGee Marr.  She was the daughter of an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] minister who was pastor of St. James A.M.E. Church in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] when I was a baby.  As a matter of fact, I would be very surprised if my grandfather didn't baptize me and marry my parents.  It was a kind of a rivalry between the Marrs and the McGees.  And somehow the oldest Marr and the oldest McGee got married, and I was the first (unclear)
Speaker 1: So, you say there was a rivalry between the two families?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was friendly.  One was always trying to outdo the other one.
Speaker 1: Do you remember, like, one story that your mother told you about her growing up in Pittsburgh?  Did she talk like that?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Now, your father.  Can you-- well, let me ask you your mother's-- did you grow up in your grandfather's church?  Or--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you tell about just the background of that church?
Speaker 2: It's considered, it was considered an important church in Pittsburgh.  And for some reason or other, the ministers always were-- rivalry between A.M.E. St. James A.M.E., and Wiley Avenue A.M.E..  I don't know, I don't know.  Somehow or other, they managed to get along.
Speaker 1: So, what would be one-- do you have sort of a favorite memory of your time in the church, you know, or attending church?  Do you have that?
Speaker 2: There was a minister whose name I can't recall, who was determined to start a young people's church, and I was expected to lead the church.  It didn't come off.  It didn't come off.
Speaker 1: Why was that?
Speaker 2: The minister was transferred.
Story_ID: 187073
Speaker 1: Now, can we, can I ask about your father [Warren Quincy Marr].  If you could give his name--
Speaker 2: The same as mine, Warren Quincy Marr.
Speaker 1: Can you tell about him?  You've got a lot of family history on that side, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.  He was, as I said, the first child in a rather large family.  There were six children who lived, and three who died in infancy--anyway, six grew to full maturity.  Dad-- I can't help but think of the way Dad worked as a young man.  He went to Carnegie Tech [later, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and studied household equipment and sanitation, which was plumbing.  But after he was graduated, he found out he could not plumb.  You could not touch sewage unless you were a member of the union.  And so, at this stage he had to find something else to do.  And I don't know the order of things, but I know that he ran the elevator in the Ford Motor Company there in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  He owned Ford cars along with working, running the elevators.  We had, I don't know when the first car was purchased.  But all of my boyhood, I can remember Ford cars.  And we used to have to clean the valves every once in a while.  And I could take those things, I could take that equipment and fasten it to the valve and twist it until the valves were clean.  It was fun, I thought.
Speaker 1: Did your father talk at all about his growing up?  Was he a talker, or was he more of a quiet man?
Speaker 2: He didn't talk much.  I know he--he tells the story of matching pennies to earn money to go to college.  He matched pennies.  Apparently he made a hauling, because he paid his way.  And his mother washed and ironed towels for the mill, Jones and Laughlin Steel Company.  And when my grandfather, Dad's father, got so he couldn't any longer handle the cooking, he was taken into Jones' personal office where he was kind of--well, a maitre' d, serving drinks and so forth.  Granddad lived to--in his eighties.  Both of my grandparents, all of my grandparents lived into their eighties.
Speaker 1: Well, that was, that was a long living family in that time.
Speaker 2: It was.  And well, I'm eighty-seven.  My father was eighty-six, my mother was about sixty.  I can't see, I cannot-- one of these days I'm going to look at her birthday and figure out how old she was when she died.  I never, never have figured it out.  But she, she was washing dishes one day.  And she got a heck of a headache, and asked Dad to help her upstairs where she laid on the couch.  And in five minutes, she was gone.  She had a hemorrhage.
Speaker 1: She had an aneurysm?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Well, Sir, on your father's side, the family originally comes from Virginia, right?
Speaker 2: Virginia, yes.
Speaker 1: And was that your grandfather, or was that, does that go back further?
Speaker 2: My grandfather left Warrenton, Virginia around the time he was eighteen or nineteen.  He stopped in another place near Fokia [ph.] to pick up a girl that he had made an overture towards.  He said that he was going to come back for her when she was eighteen.  And apparently, she must have been eighteen.  Anyway, they went to Pittsburg [Pennsylvania] and settled in a little house on Wiley Avenue.  But it was not Wiley Avenue--it was a little dirt street in East Liberty [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] under the Meadow Street Bridge (laughter).
Speaker 1: But, you're saying they didn't settle on Wiley Avenue?
Speaker 2: No, they settled on Wiley Avenue, but it was not Wiley Avenue as we knew it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 187074
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: It's, oh, (laughter)-- Well, I guess I -- chasing my mother [Cindy Antoinette McGee Marr] around the table when she was chasing me with a broom, and I did not want her to catch me.  And finally I got tired and I stopped and took the broom away from her, and we both stood there and laughed.  And from that day on, I had to do everything that my mother said.  I never questioned-- I must have been somewhere around twelve.
Speaker 1: Twelve years old?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: At that point in time, or even earlier, are you living on Wiley Avenue [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: No, we never lived on Wiley.
Speaker 1: But you said they settled on Wiley, but it wasn't what was known as Wiley.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But where did you, tell me the street that you grew up on.
Speaker 2: The one that I should name--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --is Winslow Street [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], where grandmother and granddad lived.  And it was that house that was the center of activity for the family.
Speaker 1: Can you describe the house?  Or do you know the address?
Speaker 2: 164 Winslow Street.  And it was at one time I'm told, a barn.  And they did some minor alterations, and it became a home to live in.  She raised six children in it, and grandchildren.
Speaker 1: Now, did you... can you just recount some of the times, you know, spent in that home?  You know, family times?  Can you recount just some memories?
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: Maybe around holidays or, you know, stuff of that sort.
Speaker 2: Well, one thing I remember, I had a cousin who was two years younger than I.  We both used that house a great deal; he lived there.  My grandfather used to put his eyeglasses on his head, on his hair, and was always asking, "Hey, Joe, do you know where my glasses are?"  And Joe would say, "Hey, Pop, they're on your head," (laughter).  So that's a silly little thing to remember, but it's a remembrance, it's a remembrance.
Story_ID: 187075
Speaker 1: Was there a lot of activity at the house?  You know, you said it was the center of activity, was there peop--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was always...  Well, my grandmother was religious-- in a religious sense.  And--
Speaker 1: In the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] Church?
Speaker 2: The A.M.E. Church.  And she, she saw to it that the kids behaved, oh, yes.  They didn't have any monkeyshines around her (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Any other memories around, you know, holiday periods, or birthdays, or maybe some crises that happened?  I don't know that you remember any of that.
Speaker 2: I fell when I was seven years old, with a bottle of milk in my hand.  And it cut my palm wide open.  We lived-- Winslow Street [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] was right around the corner from a little hospital.  We went around there to have the thing taken care of, my mother [Cindy Antoinette McGee Marr] and I.  And he dug around in the palm and extracted a piece of glass, and put a bandage on my hand, and of course, the ligament fastened to the cut as it healed.  To this day, that finger will not bend in the first joint.  I was able to get the use of one joint, but I never could take it.  Mother used to, "Give me the devil; Use it, use it, use it."  I used it as much as I felt like it.
Speaker 1: So, she felt if you used it, it would not get stiff like that?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 187076
Speaker 1: Sir, I want you to take yourself back to that street.  And I'm wondering if you can just--there are two things.  I'm going to ask you first--what sights, smells and sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: What a question.  It's an interesting question, because I have never-- not fastened on anything that--
Speaker 1: Was there a lot of activity on the street?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother [Cindy Antoinette McGee Marr] baked stuff for the neighborhood, for the kids.
Speaker 1: Any smell that comes from the baking?  Was it pies or cakes, or--?
Speaker 2: Apple pie, (laughter) apple pie.  But for some reason or other, I decided to make bread.  Mother had been making bread, and I decided I was going to make it one day.  And I baked the bread.  And when I got up, got finished, the others--the five smaller kids--refused to eat Mother's bread anymore.  I became the bread baker (Laughter).  That's--  And she said, "Oh, it's all right.  I have enough to do, I don't"--
Speaker 1: I don't need to bake bread.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, any other, any other images?  You know, I'm just wondering, I'm trying to get a picture of the Pittsburgh that you grew up in.  That's what I'm trying to do.  A lot of activity around the steel-- you know, the mills?
Speaker 2: We were confined pretty much to the house.  We could play in the neighborhood, with the kids in the neighborhood.  We were not allowed usually to go away from home.  I was in charge of the kids, of course, which reminds me.  Anytime a kid was hurt, it was Mother's task, with me to help take them to the hospital--take them to the hospital.  West[ern] Penn[sylvania] Hospital [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] became our favorite medical source.  My brother cut his arm.  It was all right, it healed.  Several things like that happened.
Story_ID: 187077
Speaker 1: I had a sister [Grace Marr] who was two years younger than I.  She and I fought like crazy, until, I don't know, maybe fourteen years old, and I decided to get along.  And she-- I was tall and skinny; she was short and fat.  And then it became a chore for Grace and me to dress as twins.  And we both looked enough alike that people-- she's sneaking off.  Grace died, well, after she'd become a very important nurse.  She was the first person to become an assistant executive director of American Nurses Association in a day when-- I'm going to--(unclear)
Speaker 2: So, she was the first, she was at what hospital, Sir, your sister?
Speaker 1: At Harlem Hospital [Center, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she trained at Harlem.
Speaker 2: That's how you--okay, we'll-- That's-- she-- is that how you met your wife?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Oh, it was not?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: I thought--
Speaker 1: You know something, but I don't recall telling it (laughter).  No, Grace and [HM] Carmel [Marr]--Grace taught microbiology at Columbia University Teachers College [sic, Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, New York].  Carmel went to law school at Columbia University.  And she began bringing Carmel home, and I would immediately engage her in conversation. What? (Laughter)
Story_ID: 187078
Speaker 1: Can you describe the Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] of your youth though, in terms of, you know, where the--well, at that time we were Negroes, or coloreds--where they lived?  You know, what part of town? Or was that the case?  And weren't there... were there at the time-- and we're talking about the twenties now, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Before the, before the [Great] Depression, okay, right--that's the period I'm trying to--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --talk about.  And you were probably, like around eleven, twelve, right, in nineteen--?
Speaker 2: In 1920--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, you were--I mean before the Depression, you were like, maybe about twelve, thirteen, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Late in the twenties.
Speaker 1: In the late twenties?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But I'm saying, can you describe Pittsburgh in the twenties?  Are there--you know, do you have a sense of that?  That's what I'm trying to understand a little bit.
Speaker 2: Pittsburgh was segregated.  It was just as segregated as the South.  And Mother [Cindy Antoinette McGee Marr] and I used to break the rules.  We went to restaurants and so forth once in a while, because we could get away with it.  Other than that--oh, and at the shows, we'd sit where we wanted.  Anyway, we went-- Dad [Warren Quincy Marr] had--Dad was brown-skinned, and Mother was fair.  When I was born I was fair, comparatively.  So, Dad was glad that he had a son who could pass for white.  Dad spent most of his time renting in white neighborhoods.  We went to school-- I went to school.  I don't remember the name of the school, but I went to several schools where nobody knew that I was colored, as we said in those days.
Speaker 1: Sir, on your mother's side, do you know of anyone in her part of the family that passed, actually passed, and didn't come back to the family?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: And why was that?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  But that, the families were-- I don't know.  The families were close enough knit that there was no effort--at least if there was, I didn't know anything about it.  Mother was one of six children.  I used to tease Mother.  She looked like a dirty wop, meaning--it was not a kind remark.  But I used to tell her that she looked like a dirty Italian housewife.  But she, all of her sisters were white enough to pass.
Speaker 1: But no one did, except for occasion?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  No one actually--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --gave up the family and passed. Okay--
Story_ID: 187079
Speaker 1: So you're saying in a lot of the communities you lived in-- Well, did that cause any tension with your father [Warren Quincy Marr] at all?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  My father, my father and I didn't get along for many years.  I remember getting a beating for coming home from school five minutes late.  And he stripped me and then used his belt to beat me.  And I went down to the kitchen where my grandmother, Grandmother McGee, and Mother [Cindy Antoinette McGee Marr] were, as naked as I was.  And while they were saying, why don't I go put some clothes on, I said, "If he ever hits me again like that, if he ever beats me again like that, I'll do my best to kill him."  And they remembered it.  And I didn't get along with Dad.
Speaker 1: He was very strict.
Speaker 2: Oh, very, very.  When I was eighteen, I left home and went to Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  Because there was no school at the time that I could go to except maybe Wilberforce, where I could get in.  Dad's sister lived in Xenia [Ohio], which is three miles from Wilberforce.  I used my thumb to get back and forth (laughter).
Speaker 1: To go to, to get to Wilberforce?
Speaker 2: To go to Wilberforce.
Speaker 1: You were hitch-hiking--
Story_ID: 187080
Speaker 1: So, had you--because your father had gone to Carnegie Tech [later, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] at that time it was called Carnegie Tech--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And had you thought about going there yourself?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  As a matter of fact, the plan had been that I would go to the University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and study business administration.  And then I would run the business from the office, and Dad would continue to operate it from the field.  It never developed, it didn't work.  I remember it was-- Dad's sister, Evelyn [ph.], was in Pittsburgh visiting right after school was out.  And she asked me where I would go to school in the fall.  I said, "I don't know.  There will be no school, so far as I know."  And Evelyn said, "Well, if you come and stay with me, you can get in probably as a state student."  And it worked-- it worked.
Story_ID: 187081
Speaker 1: Before we leave Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and, you know, take you to Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], I just want to know if there are other things as a young man that were forming you.  You and your mother [Cindy Antoinette McGee Marr] had a very close bond, I take it.  But were there other people that, you know, you were influenced by, or any institution?  You know, I mean the church or anything else that influenced you?
Speaker 2: Mother's mother, my grandmother on the McGee side, I used to say that if anything happened to Mother, I would want to go to stay with Grandma.  Of course, it didn't happen (Laughter).  But that's the way the attitude--
Speaker 1: But now, do you remember the [Great] Depression affecting your family?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: The Depression affecting your family?  Do you remember that affecting your family?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me how?
Speaker 2: Well, somehow the rent was paid.  And the money for welfare arrived at home.  And Mother never--she always managed to get-- You know, I'm having trouble telling this, because I can't be accurate with it.  She managed to never take, never cashed--
Speaker 1: She never cashed the welfare check?  Is that what you're saying?
Speaker 2: She didn't, she didn't actually handle the welfare check.  She must have gone to the grocery store and had them to handle it.  It was rough.  And we always were clean and neat.  Mother had an expression, "Soap is cheap, soap is cheap."  (Laughter).  And the clothes were washed and ironed.  Many people in the neighborhood thought we were well-off because we were always neat, and they didn't know.
Story_ID: 187082
Speaker 1: What about school?  Tell me the schools you went to before Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Peabody High [School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Peabody High?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And it's a segregated--no, it wasn't a segregated school.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: So, were you the only colored in your class, like you said?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, but the racial makeup of the other people--were they Italian?  Were they Polish?  Were they--you know, because Pittsburgh has a lot of Eastern Europeans.
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  I remember Italians.  As a matter of fact Mrs.--alright, I thought I remembered her name.  A woman who had been my freshman English teacher was made a counselor in senior high.  And so, she, she didn't come in the class at all until time to take an exam-- exams.  I remember teaching the English, freshman English, and she took the exam.  There were two twins, Italian, who lived across the street from my grandmother, 164 Winslow Street [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And they hated my guts.  I'm sure they knew that I was colored, and they, I think they hated me for that reason.  But anyway, there was a boy, David Ludwig [ph.], in high school.  He and I were close, and he invited me to a party.  And I was close enough to hear my history teacher tell him that he doesn't want people like me at the party.  That really hurt, hurt.
Speaker 1: So, some people knew? They knew (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, they know.
Story_ID: 187083
Speaker 1: When you decide to go--you know, your aunt makes it possible for you to go to Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  And this is really, is it your first time really away from home?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so a new world is opening up for you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're staying with your aunt.  And tell me what you find at Wilberforce.  Who's the president at the time?
Speaker 2: Richard Robert Wright [Sr.] was the president.  Any time he had... in speaking, when he had to make a point, he would start out and then gradually run down.  And in making another point, he would start out and gradually run down.  He used to say to, he used to say... it was the first time I ever saw it, and I haven't seen it since.
Speaker 1: So now when you, so you decide-- what are you thinking you want to do when you go to college?  Do you have an idea?
Speaker 2: No, no.  The first year was pretty much routine.  And I coached several students.  Oh geez, oh geez, Russell-- Russell-- There was a, I went to live at eighteen or nineteen or something like that-- twenty, in southern Illinois.  And I found an aunt who had a son ten years old.  I had made a good impression on her father, who was doing his best to get me named a commissioner.  No, no, no, he was trying to get me a job teaching.  Everything was fine it seemed, until one day a colored boy, Richard-- his name was Russell [ph.].  Anyway, he showed up with the post in hand.  He was athletic director and he taught English.  I didn't make it.
Story_ID: 187084
Speaker 1: So, you didn't get to teach then?  Now, sir, can you just give a little history on Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio]?  Were you aware of its history when you went there?
Speaker 2: Wilberforce was divided.  The state side was funded by the state.  The church side, which was small, I don't know whether it had any more than two buildings.  Emory Hall was the men's dormitory.  And Sugar Hall was the women's dormitory, and classes were held shorter.  Lots of buildings were on the state side.  I took English, as a matter of--I took English and other related subjects on the church side.  And on the-- yeah, on the state side, I took printing, and years later I had a printing business.
Speaker 1: So you started printing in, taking printing classes at Wilberforce, okay.  Now, what do--would we know any of, some of your classmates that were there?  Some of your classmates--was there anyone of note that--you know, your classmates that were there at Wilberforce at the same time?
Speaker 2: Corrina Hayman [ph.] was a fine singer.  I put on--her in concert at [New York] Times Hall [later, Helen Hayes Theatre, New York, New York], with fourteen people in the audience.  I had just come to New York, and I scheduled her for this concert, thinking that putting ads in the newspaper was all that was necessary to get people to come to the concerts.  And it didn't, they didn't work (Laughter).  So, I sat up and had a box with my brother while Corrina went ahead with the concert.
Speaker 1: So, did you enjoy your--did you enjoy your Wilberforce experience?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 187085
Speaker 1: Well, sir, you were a journalism major, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, what were you thinking you wanted to go do with that?
Speaker 2: Work for the newspapers, and I did work for several newspapers after I left Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  The Plain Dealer [Cleveland, Ohio] was the last one.  I wrote for the Pittsburgh Courier [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  I set for--oh, I can't call his name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But so, you worked for--did you do any work for the [Chicago] Defender [Chicago, Illinois], or any work for the Call and Post [Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, okay-- but the Pittsburgh Courier.  The Defender?
Speaker 2: No.  The Courier was the only paper of note.  But I worked for the Plain Dealer, and I had a column in that. And I set type and wrote--
Speaker 1: So, you, now, so you're learning now what it is to produce a paper at this point, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now, when you graduate, is that when you get--where do you go at that point?  Are you, do you go--
Speaker 2: Where did I go?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: I was lost.
Speaker 1: You were lost?
Speaker 2: I was lost for a year or two.  And finally, I got to work with the paper, and I went on.
Speaker 1: But you went--is that when you went to work for the St. Louis Argus [St. Louis, Missouri], you know, as a linotype operator?
Speaker 2: That came later.
Speaker 1: That came later, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you were doing-- so right after college, you lived where?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I can't think of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay.  But in nineteen-- I have that you were working at the St. Louis Argus in 1938.  So, you would have been, you know, twenty-two at that time.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But you--tell me what... you basically started your career as a--you know, as a linotype, you know--
Speaker 2: Lino-typist?
Speaker 1: Linotype, I'm sorry, thank you.  Well, what makes a good--I mean what made you good at doing linotype, you know, linotype operator?  What's involved with that?
Speaker 2: Speed.  And I had a--
Speaker 1: You were a good at it?
Speaker 2: I was a good operator.
Speaker 1: Okay, good operator, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was generally considered that a person who set a galley of type 180 lines an hour was alright--was considered average.  Under pressure, I could produce three galleys of type.  And I mean they had to leave me alone, and I would sit there and I'd bang (Laughter).  I could make it; I could make it for about three hours, and after that I fell apart.

Speaker 1: They [Cairo and Mound City, Illinois] were referred to as the tri city.  I was working for a newspaper down there setting type and writing whenever I felt like it.  This particular day, Sunday, I got my two buddies, my cousin and a friend, in my car and went to the movies.  And I was referred to the upstairs.  I got up there and found something white stretched across the canvas, across the balcony.  So, I said to the boys, "Wait a minute, let me investigate."  I went and checked, and it was a canvas stretched across, reserving three-quarters of the seats for the other folks from the main floor.  And I got mad and went downstairs and demanded my money back, and took the boys off.  And that Monday, the merchants in the three towns had a meeting trying to figure out what to do with this young Negro.  Virgil Thomson [ph.] heard about the meeting.  He was a great, big son of a gun.  I, at that time was no bigger than...  He walked in, unannounced, into the meeting.  And he said, "Good day, Gentlemen.  I hear that you have plans for this young fellow, [Warren] Marr[, II].  If you're wise, you'll leave him alone."  Virgil Chambliss [ph.] was colored, as we said then.  He was about my color, a little darker.  But the Chamblisses controlled the money.  And the three towns, they had the money in the bank, you know, and everything.  Nobody could have survived.  They left the boy alone.

Speaker 1: Sir, when you were--but that happened down in Cairo [Illinois], right?  Cairo and Mound [City, Illinois], you know, in that area.  Now, for the years that-- so you say--I'm just going back to your being a linotype operator.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm going back to those years.  And because you actually did that for a while, right?  That was your profession.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so, where you were working--but I'm trying to figure out where you were working during those times.  Were you working--was it in, was it in Illinois or was it in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't.
Speaker 1: Where were you at?
Speaker 2: In Columbus, Ohio.  I got a job as janitor in a music store.  I went back to Pittsburgh and stayed a short period of time.  And then I went to St. Louis [Missouri] working-- A friend of mine was going to St. Louis.  I went to St. Louis with him.  We drove, and froze (Laughter).  When I found out that he planned to stay in St. Louis, I said, "Well, dag, I haven't anything to get back to Pittsburgh for.  I'll go find a job."  I went to St. Louis Argus [St. Louis, Missouri].
Speaker 1: So, that's how you got to Argus?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: It took me a while (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, you were at Argus for a year, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 187088
Speaker 1: And then you went--how did you get the position at the Plain Dealer [Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I went to southern Illinois.  It was Cairo [Illinois].  Now, it's Mound City [Illinois]. I was there for a while, and then it fell through and I didn't like it.  And I went to St. Louis [Missouri] and wrote to Hamlet [ph.], who was the owner of a paper.  And he had--maybe six or eight months before, had made an offer.  And he had bought a--when I reminded him of it, he bought the--
Speaker 1: The Plain Dealer?  He bought the Plain Dealer?
Speaker 2: No, he already had--
Speaker 1: He already-- okay, but he brought you in?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, he brought you in.  So, did you like working at the Plain Dealer?
Speaker 2: Loved it, loved it.  I didn't like the fact that Kansas City [sic, Cleveland, Ohio] was segregated (Laughter).  Although I should have been, you know-- But I got along, I had my own circle.
Speaker 1: And you worked there how long, Sir?  I think you--oh, I know.  You worked there until 1942, right.
Speaker 2: I would assume.
Speaker 1: This is--you have-- you haven't-- at this point, you've not met your wife yet, right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, you're still single and you're working, you know, in your sort of-- Because there's a craft to being a linotype operator, isn't there?  Can you describe what's involved a little bit?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: What's involved with being a linotype operator?  What, what, what's involved with it?
Speaker 2: Nothing, except operating a machine--turning out galley after galley of type.  I was not a member of an--a union.
Speaker 1: Well, you couldn't be a member of the union, right?  I mean in those days, no, you couldn't--
Story_ID: 187089
Speaker 1: Now what about the concert management that you did?
Speaker 2: For five years.
Speaker 1: Yes.  And where was that?
Speaker 2: At [New York] Times Hall [later, Helen Hayes Theatre, New York, New York], the Town Hall [New York, New York], the big halls.
Speaker 1: In--
Speaker 2: In New York.
Speaker 1: In New York.  So, you went... you came... then... at this point, you went to New York?
Speaker 2: Let me see.  I visited my sister in New York, and I decided to stay, yes.  What did you say again?
Speaker 1: I just said, what about the concert management?  Because you did that for five years.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  And I was wondering how you got involved with that?  Or even how you got to New York, that's another thing.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I drove.  The captain of a soldier serving in New York stayed with my sister, and one thing led to another.  I stayed long enough to want to get a job.  But instead of getting a job, I decided that I would create my own.  So, I got Corinna to sing.  She was... and I don't remember who was next.
Speaker 1: So, you got into managing acts sort of.  That's what you were talking about.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so where were these concerts?  Where were they held?
Speaker 2: Times Hall, Town Hall.
Speaker 1: Town Hall is different from Times Hall, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: There were, I think I remember [HM] William Warfield telling me he performed in Town Hall.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It was, it was a place...  Can you describe what its importance was?  Wasn't that a place where a lot of people would start their careers, in some respect?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  They, people tried their best to have a debut at Time... at Town Hall.  It seats 492 people.  And you see, I didn't forget that.  (Laughter).  And anyway, I went on and scheduled the people.  Some of them were white, some of them were black.  And Ozan Marsh was a white pianist, and he was good.  His wife was also a pianist; she was about average.
Speaker 1: So, how many, how many people did you actually manage or promote?  Or that you-- you know, because you-- Would you rent the facility?  I'm just trying--
Speaker 2: I did everything.
Speaker 1: You did everything.  So, you rented the facility, you got the--just describe it yourself.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I rented the place, I had the tickets printed, I had brochures printed.  I mailed them all over the place.  I suppose that's pretty much it.
Speaker 1: Now, who owned the places primarily?  Like, who owned Town Hall and--
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: You don't know.  Okay, but they would rent it out?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You didn't--did you experience any discrimination at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How was the--did you make a decent living that way?
Speaker 2: I made enough.  I don't remember what I made, but I made enough.
Speaker 1: And what--do you remember a favorite act or a favorite person that you, you know, that you--
Speaker 2: Alice Holland [ph.].  Alice Holland lived not too far away from where I lived at the time.  And she was a mezzo-soprano.  And when she sang, she sang.  She was white.  She sang.  And the one critic wrote that she was the answer to every critic who covered her.  I can't recall, but--
Speaker 1: They were impressed.
Speaker 2: They were very impressed.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us who Alice Holland was, Sir?
Speaker 2: Alice Holland?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: She was the daughter of a fellow who had been the Consulate General to Germany, and that's all--
Story_ID: 187090
Speaker 1: Why did you get out of the business of managing?  And you ended up being, you know, going and becoming a drapery maker.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  That was a strange thing.  I met [HM] Carmel [Marr] near the end of a year.  And I was busy with the concerts, and I had several scheduled.  And I don't know how it came up, but anyway, Carmel said, "You've got to start making money instead of giving money away."  So, I had one concert left that season, and I handled it.  When I got married, I had two spectacular performers to perform--William Vesey, who had--did you know the name?
Speaker 1: I know the name, Sir.  Yes, I do.
Speaker 2: I'll be darned.  Because he's--
Speaker 1: I haven't heard his name in a long time.
Speaker 2: No, because he's dead.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, I know he's dead, but I hadn't heard the name.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He--
Speaker 1: Can you tell about him?
Speaker 2: Well, he had been in Europe, and was rated according to one newspaper, the best dressed baritone in all of Europe.  Anyway, he had been... and the war came along.  And William Vesey tried to get out, and couldn't get out.  They actually-- and turned him-- in a building he owned in Brussels [Belgium].  Finally he was able to arrange to get out.  He went to his mother's home in Atlanta [Georgia] to recuperate.  On the way, he had a nervous breakdown.  And he came to New York after he got better.  And a fellow I know, Lorenzo--
Speaker 1: Fuller?
Speaker 2: No.  Apparently, you know that name.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, no, Lorenzo?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Anyway, someone suggested that I should take a look--I should take time and spend it with Bill.  And he had a good voice, but he was scared to sing.  He was... and so I met him and we hit it off, and I began coaching him.  Finally, I said "Bill's got to sing."  And I scheduled the Y[MCA, Young Men's Christian Association], a Y concert, and he got halfway through the concert and... "Warren, I can't sing, I can't sing anymore.  Oh, my voice.  I want to call it quits."  I said, "No, you're doing-- you're doing it."  And so, he didn't.  He announced that he was cutting the concert short, and that was that.  But I went ahead and I continued to work with him.  We went on a cross-country--
Speaker 1: What had happened to him, that he was afraid?
Speaker 2: Oh, he had--he had broken down, and he was afraid that he wouldn't be able to pick up as he had.
Speaker 1: So, how would you describe him, you know, as a person?
Speaker 2: He was a, well, he was as tall as I am; heavy--not unduly heavy, very gentle.
Speaker 1: And he was really, in his time, as popular as Paul Robeson, right?  I mean I've read about him, but just never met anyone who knew him.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Many times-- he never married.  He lived at the Y most of the time.  And every once in a while he'd call me up and ask, "How about a steak?"  And I'd fix steak for him and have him in for dinner.  But he was, he...  Carmel and the family were going to Canada.  And I had heard that Vesey was in town, and I went by his place.  It was sad, it was sad, because you knew he was ill.  But he died before I got back from Canada.  I couldn't very well...  I had a carful of customers driving.  I couldn't very well stay with Vesey then.

Speaker 1: Now, what about the House of Marr?  Can you talk about that?  What was the House of Marr?
Speaker 2: Anything I decided to do (Laughter).  A bunch of us got together--two sisters, [Richard] Bruce Nugent, Raymond Shankins [ph.]--and we decided, they decided, that I would go into printing cards.  They would do the artwork, and it worked, as far as it went.  I had Bergdorf Goodman, Georg Jesse--Georg Jensen, Pirie Scott [sic, Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company, later, Carson's], Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Carson, Pirie, Scott--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as clients?
Speaker 2: Greeting cards, greeting cards.  There was nothing that indicated that they were colored.  In fact, anything except that... except it would be in...  And I sold them until... Forest Burton [ph.] was a member of the Ford Foundation.  He was also friendly with Henry Ford.  Henry Ford had a card one year that I had produced, and he wanted, he wanted me to produce cards for him.  I couldn't find anybody to do any work for me.  I was it then--at wits end. I would say I was financially broke, everything.  So had I produced a card for Henry Ford, for his friend, for his firm, I would have been able to weather my bad spell.  It didn't work.
Speaker 1: So, that's what happened to the house of--
Speaker 2: So, the house of Marr went.
Speaker 1: Went.  But you know, so this was really the first line of--were they Christmas cards?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And this--but this was the first Christmas cards--line of cards--by a black person?
Speaker 2: So far as I know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how did you get all your distribution?  Were you able to do it because you could pass?
Speaker 2: No, I just, I wrote to them.
Speaker 1: You wrote, and they...  And so, how much were you doing?  Were you doing good business for a while?
Speaker 2: No, I wouldn't say it was good.  But it was enough to encourage me.
Speaker 1: And you know, the other--so you had it for like four or five years, right?  Yes, from--yeah, you had it for a while.  You had it for eight years, eight years.
Speaker 2: I didn't remember how long.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, who distributed-- did you do all of that internally?
Speaker 2: That's why they quit.  It finally got to the point where I was doing all the work.  My brothers didn't do anything.  Bruce, who was a superb artist, worked only if I stood over him-- everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I printed the cards; I bought the paper and printed the cards; packaged them and solicited the stores-- everything.

Speaker 2: Uh-huh.

Speaker 2: Oh, did you?
Speaker 1: (CARMEL MARR):  And what does the handshake mean?

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now-
Speaker 2: (CARMEL MARR):  I didn't do any of the artwork.
Speaker 1: Right.  So, you were actually--  But see, this is what I'm confused about.  You got a degree in journalism.  I know you--when did you start painting?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't know, let me see.  It was after I went to--let's see... I don't know.

Speaker 1: Now, who are some of the people that you're associating with on sort of a business level?  Let me mention a name.  Like, William-- was Bill Hutchings, was he around?
Speaker 2: Yes, but I didn't know him.
Speaker 1: You didn't know him?
Speaker 2: I didn't know him.  Carl Van Vechten--
Speaker 1: You knew Carl Van Vechten?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You knew the whole--
Speaker 2: I knew a great, I knew many of the people from the black--
Speaker 1: The artists?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, can you describe, just give a little description about Carl Van Vechten, what he was like?  Did you know Zora Neale Hurston and--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Carl-- I don't know.  My impression was that he was nearly as tall as I am.  This is going back many, many, many, many, many years.  It was ugly.  It was ugly.  (Laughter).  So--
Speaker 1: Why do you think he had such an attraction for the black community?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know.
Speaker 1: He was from means, though, right?  He--
Speaker 2: I don't know where he was from.
Speaker 1: I mean he had financial means, right?  He was from a well-to-do family, I think.
Speaker 2: He had enough means to get along.  But--
Speaker 1: Did you know Van Der Zee?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Van Der Zee.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: The photographer.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what's the name of the two brothers?  You knew the dancers?
Speaker 2: (CARMEL MARR):  The two brothers that were photographers.
Speaker 1: Wait a minute, the two brothers that were photographers.
Speaker 2: (CARMEL MARR):  They did most all of the pictures, especially of the, you know, the black circle.
Speaker 1: Do you know who she's talking about, Sir?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know.
Speaker 1: But I can't...
Speaker 2: She's always pulling names.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you, did you know... was it [Charles] "Honi" Coles?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (CARMEL MARR):  Very well.
Speaker 1: Okay, good.  See, I'm trying to pull some names.  So you know, can you talk about Honi Coles?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  He was, he was sweet.  He was the kind of person that was sweet.
Speaker 1: Did you know Josephine Baker at the time?
Speaker 2: Josephine?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Yes.  (Laughter).  I didn't know her well, but I knew her.

But I don't know, maybe she lived for five years, I don't know.  But I--oh, God, we saw each other at a function that was given by St. Philip's [Episcopal] Church [New York, New York], a great mob of people.  And she looked across the room, and there I was.  And she came swooping across the room and, "Hi, Marr, how are you Darling?"  And she kissed me on the cheek and, well, we chatted for a while.  But she didn't make any apology for her action.  Some people knew who she was and-- she was supposed to behave this way.  But she-- arms out-- and the arms--

Speaker 2: I knew--
Speaker 1: Eubie Blake... and Sissle.
Speaker 2: I knew he lived on one side of the town, and we were about ten minutes away.  And I could call him up.  And if he had nothing to do, all I had to do was to go get him and bring him over to the house--
Speaker 1: Eubie Blake.
Speaker 2: And he'd play the piano, just played the piano.  And at the time, we were living in a house with a library at one end of the floor and a great big reception hall, and then the den.  One was playing the organ in the library, in the den.  And what's his name?
Speaker 1: Eubie Blake.
Speaker 2: Eubie Blake was playing the piano in the living room.  It didn't clash.  There was enough space between that they didn't clash.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  That's cute.  You know, because one is jazz, and the other is...  You know, not jazz, but I mean popular music.  I remember--you know, I was totally amazed when I learned he had written 'I'm Just Wild About Harry.'  I could not... anyway, I didn't know that he was a young black person.  I was just, like totally amazed.  Anyway, I want to ask you about what--like, what were the artists like?  And how was Harlem [New York, New York] at that point?  You know, because you hear about people, you know, whites slumming in Harlem or coming up.  You hear about the, what's it called?  Where the artists would perform, but it was white-owned.  What was the name?  Cotton Club [New York, New York].  I'm having trouble, too.
Speaker 2: The Cotton Club, I never--
Speaker 1: Yeah, you never-- right.  Because it really sort of off limits, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But what were some of the places--I mean, like, can you describe Sugar Hill [New York, New York]?  Did any of the artists you know live in 409 [Edgecombe], 455 Edge--?
Speaker 2: I lived in 409.
Speaker 1: Oh, well, that...  See--

Speaker 1: That was the address.

Speaker 2: Oh, don't ask me.  I don't know who-- I don't know.
Speaker 1: Now, how long did you live in 409?
Speaker 2: Not very long.

Speaker 1: Why don't we go to your work with, you know, at the church for Homeland Ministries.  Because that's really where you-- Didn't Amistad [Affiliates] come out of-- yeah, it came out of that, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, can you tell me how, you know, how you got--one, how you...  So, the greeting card company is gone, it's kaput.  And how does this opportunity come?
Speaker 2: Did you know Ann[a] Arnold Hedgeman?  She had, I had met her one day, and she was working for the United Church [of Christ, New York, New York].  I met her at a point when I was down and out.  And I told her about it, and she said, "Well, I have a secretary.  Would you have any feelings about working for a woman?  I said, "No."  She says, "Well, let's start Monday," or whatever day it was.  "Let's start a day or two from now.  Be in my office at 287 Park Avenue [New York, New York], and we'll take it from there."  We were working-- I knew Roland Hayes.
Speaker 1: Oh, Roland Hayes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Another one, that's right.
Speaker 2: That's through Ann.  Anyway--
Speaker 1: And who was Ann?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Who was she?
Speaker 2: Roland Hayes?
Speaker 1: No, Ann.
Speaker 2: Ann?  She was, she was important in the area--in the New York area, anyway.  Ann Arnold Hedgeman--her name was always given that way.  She was quite a speaker, and everybody had her for a speech at some point.  Anyway, her husband, Merritt Hedgeman, was a tenor, but he didn't make it very far.  Okay, so I worked with her secretary, and met Roland Hayes and some other people, until maybe six months later, when her boss decided that he was not going to renew her contract.  And he asked me if I wanted to stay on, and I said, "Yes."  And I started really in the same job, and was a consultant.  I started-- I had been two or three days in the position when West Hodgkins [ph.] got me one day and said, "Warren, how would you like to go to Puerto Rico for a while?"  I'd never been there.  I said, "Sure."  Well, he went on and spoke about the hospital they had down there.  And he said, "I think you ought to go down there and spend a few days finding out what's cooking."  So, I said, "Okay." And off to Puerto Rico I went, with a week to do nothing except keep my eyes and ears open.  Well, that relationship lasted for seven years and it lasted after that, it still goes on.
Story_ID: 187097
Speaker 1: Now what was the work?  What was the purpose of the, you know, the Homeland--
Speaker 2: Ministries?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Ministries.  And why was it created?
Speaker 2: Oh, now you're going to get into history.  In 1839, there was a ship, the Amistad ship, which brought what was left of fifty-three Africans here from Cuba.  They were housed with thirty-something Africans who actually made it. They were housed in New Haven [Connecticut], and they weren't treated very well.  But a man named Lewis Tappan headed a group that raised money and saw to it that the Africans were treated better.  And eventually, this was organized into the American Missionary Association [AMA].  If you are by chance a member of the United Church of Christ [New York, New York], you'll know AMA has now been disbanded.  But I went, I was employed by AMA.  When I asked West, my boss, "Hey, what is this business with Amistad that I hear people talking about around the office," he gave me a one word answer.  And said, "Why don't you go around to the library?  We have a library around the hall, read about it."  So I went right around to the library and found lots of material, and read about it--the Amistad and other things.  And eventually West asked me to go to Ryder [Memorial Hospital] down in Puerto Rico.  I went to Ryder Hospital.  The operating room doors swung open.  It was horrible, but it was the only hospital in eastern Puerto Rico.  I became interested then.  I raised, I held... I was responsible for holding a luncheon where Fadee Amunos [ph.], who had never been friendly, hosted the luncheon with fifty wealthy people.  I raised $100,000 dollars in twenty minutes.  Amunos opened a meeting, and the chairman of the board spoke for about three minutes and then (unclear) got up and he said, "I want fifty checks for five thousand dollars right now."  And I had fifty checks for five thousand dollars for the hospital.  That was unusual, at least it was unusual for me.  Well, I went on and I frequently did that.  I scheduled conferences and all sorts of things for the hospital.  Okay, so I swore that I was going to make "Amistad" a word in the English language.  And in '76 [1976], I had a-- I rented a ship which was called, "The Western Union."  I covered the name up with a sign, saying "Amistad," and sailed it up the Hudson [River, New York] in Operation Sail.  Okay, I had fifty people aboard, and got fifty dollars each.  And that was that.  I went ahead and built Friends of Amistad and later, Amistad Affiliates, all in the meantime before 1990.

Speaker 1: Before you start working for the AMA, American Missionary Association, before you start working, you had never heard of Amistad?
Speaker 2: Uh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And not many people knew about Amistad, right?  So, you, when you find that out, do you go home telling your wife that evening what you've learned?  And what did you learn?  You learned that--
Speaker 2: This association, the American Missionary Association, was busy setting up churches where black and white could get along together.  And that was exactly what I was having, exactly what I was having.  And so, I started Friends of Amistad.  Then we raised-- As an aside, Cliff Johnson and I started Amistad Research Center.
Speaker 1: Right, but that's what I'm wanting-- how did you meet Cliff Johnson?
Speaker 2: This is a very complicated story.  We had, AMA had six colleges, which I went to visit from time to time.
Speaker 1: So, which were the six?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to LeMoyne[-Owen College, Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And Cliff Johnson was there.  He had just cataloged the documents out of the attic of the AMA--300,000 documents.  I asked him, "Are these worth studying?"  And he said, "They certainly are."  I said, "Let's go find a room and make some notes."  I made notes on a piece of paper, took them back to my boss the next day, and said, "West [ph.], this is what I'd like to do."  I had written the name "Amistad Research Center."  West liked it.  He said, "Go ahead."

Speaker 1: Sometime afterward--
Speaker 2: After seven--I mean, right.  But I'm saying, the library that you went to see had been in existence?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And that library, they had maintained-- They had a-- so they had an archivist.  So, within the...  See, I'm trying-- So they were establishing--they were not the Congregationalist-- Are they the Congregationalist American Ministries?  Are they the same as the Congregationalists, the Congregationalists that set up several African-American, I mean, black schools?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, In the South?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, LeMoyne[-Owen College, Memphis, Tennessee] is one.
Speaker 1: Dillard [University, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Dillard.
Speaker 1: Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Fisk.  And you- (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Fisk, Houston-Tillotson [University, Austin, Texas]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Le Moyne, Talladega [College, Talladega, Alabama], Tougaloo [College, Tougaloo, Mississippi].  I have to do them alphabetically. (Laughter).  And I have visited every one of them.
Speaker 2: (CARMEL MARR):  As a matter of fact, I was at the U.N. [United Nations] then in those days.  And he got a number of speakers from U.N. countries to go down to those colleges.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know what she--
Speaker 1: Your wife was saying that she was at the U.N. then.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And she--you got a lot of the--you know, people from New York to go down to the colleges.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 187413
Speaker 1: They kept very good records is what you're saying, okay.  And this is no surprise to them about this story, because it was a major court battle, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That they won?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: With John--
Speaker 2: Adams.
Speaker 1: With [President] John Quincy Adams, right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was he a Congregationalist himself?  That's never... okay.  Was he a, was he part of the AMA [American Missionary Association]?
Speaker 2: I have never been able to find out.  I think he was, but I don't know.
Speaker 1: So, did he tell the story of why he took on the case?
Speaker 2: [Lewis] Tappan, who headed the organization, succeeded in telling Adams things that Adams went for (laughter). He just--you know, if I sat up here and told you the story of the AMA, you'd be, you'd be sold.  Adams hadn't-- he had-- he was sold.  I used to-- I told the story in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Tell the story.
Speaker 2: I'm not going to tell it, it's too long.
Speaker 1: Long?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are you sure?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That could be the highlight of this interview--
Story_ID: 187414
Speaker 1: You go and you find this--and this is something that most... no one knows about, really, especially in the black community, right?  But you also find--  Now, in your travels, you find this out.  But it's not until you find Clifton Johnson, and he's at LeMoyne[-Owen College, Memphis, Tennessee] which is in Memphis.  Because you're going traveling around, right, to visit the colleges.  You're... what is your position?  What are you assigned to do, though, after Ann [Arnold Hedgeman] leaves [United Church of Christ, New York, New York]?  I mean, what is your job?
Speaker 2: I was secretary of the AMA [American Missionary Association] college centennials.
Speaker 1: For their 100th celebration?  No?
Speaker 2: No, I couldn't have been there since--  Well, anyway I stayed there seven years.
Speaker 1: Okay, you stayed at the AMA seven years?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, okay, so when do you meet Clifton Johnson?  Is that after your first year, or is it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think I had been there about a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you meet him and he's-- you said he's just finished--
Speaker 2: Cataloging 300,000 documents from the attic of the AMA.
Speaker 1: And, and he knows about this?  He knows... what does he find in the attic?   What kinds of things does he find?
Speaker 2: Oh, God, all kinds of things--history of the schools, history of churches, history of all kinds of things.  They had, you know, they had not kept a good library, but they had kept papers.  And he cataloged... the papers were bundled and stored haphazardly in the attics at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].  He went over to Fisk and spent a year cataloging the material.  Much of it, he couldn't catalog... water damage and so forth.  He cataloged 300,000.  With that, we started the Amistad Research Center.
Speaker 1: And what was the thought about the center?  What were your thoughts about what the center should be?  It started out as a repository for these records, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But then it became much more.  And I'm just wondering what, what were the two of you thinking you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: Make it a place where everybody could share; where the exponents of the AMA now go out and start... places where they can go together.  I'm not making good sense.
Speaker 1: But are you saying--let me understand this, Sir.  Okay, there is... you have these documents there.  And that's sort of serving as the basis...  Where were the documents housed during the first-- is it-- where they housed at the beginning?
Speaker 2: They were housed at Fisk University.  I mean--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --at LeMoyne[-Owen College, Memphis Tennessee].
Speaker 1: At Le Moyne?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, when did it move to Tulane [University, New Orleans, Louisiana]?  Later, much later?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Later, but this what year?  What year are we in right now, when you get with Clifton Johnson.  What year is it?
Speaker 2: You know, this is something I have not done.  I have not kept record of time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Anyway, it's thirty years ago-- thirty years ago.  He has been head of the Center and has retired after twenty-five years.  He's been retired a couple of years.  So--
Speaker 1: But it's before '76 [1976].  We're talking about much before '76 [1976].  It's in the sixties, it's longer than thirty years ago, Sir.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  But, so what I'm saying is that you-- or what I'm asking is that you get together, it's at Le Moyne.  And what are you thinking?  Are you asking people--what are you thinking are going to go besides the papers of the AMA [American Missionary Association]?
Speaker 2: The papers of other individuals, organizations.  For example, the papers of Bishop Stephen Gill Spotswood of the CME Church [Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, Brooklyn, New York] are housed at the Center.
Story_ID: 187415
Speaker 1: But no one is even thinking along these lines at the time.  And what are you, what are you telling people?  I mean, people are not even thinking in the black community about collecting.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: It's tough.
Speaker 1: So what are the... so you're trying to tell people--
Speaker 2: That they should save the documents, that their history is in them.  Your history, my history--all of my papers are down there.  Carmel's papers are almost all-
Speaker 1: (CARMEL MARR):	 At the time that the--[HM] Warren [Marr, II] was going around collecting, every time he ran into--and I can't remember her name--the woman at the library in Manhattan [New York, New York].  She would complain to Warren that she would go someplace to get documents and always--
Speaker 2: He would have it?
Speaker 1: (CARMELL MARR):  He would have been there before her.
Speaker 2: Oh, so you were making headway.
Speaker 1: (CARMEL MARR):  Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: So, you, you're having success even though it's a hard sell?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, who are your target groups that you decide to go after?  Who did... did you have a game plan about we're going to go after churches... or who are you going after?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  I don't know; I go after whomever.  If I find somebody who's open...  You know, years ago when I was living in the [Greenwich] Village [New York, New York], I met a fellow with whom I used to run a great deal, as long as he didn't know I was colored.  I talked to him as best I could.  He told me about his mother being taken for a ride by a Jewish salesman, for example.  And he was mad at all Jews because of this one situation.  I said, "Well, you know, you can't judge them all by one."  He hung out at the Village, and the last time I saw him he was in a restaurant, a big restaurant, with a black boy, I mean literally black, having a good time.  When I first met him, he couldn't think of sitting with this fellow.  But I had worked on him (laughter), piece by piece.  I'm a member of the Board of the National Maritime Historical Association [later, National Maritime Historical Society, NMHS].  There's nobody but me.  But I gave the president of the organization a real model of the Amistad, a real model.  They've gotten so that they know [HM] Warren [Marr, II]--they know something about the colored folk.  You know, once upon a time I used to say that integration wouldn't happen until white folks had invited colored folk in for dinner.  And the white person, unless they could sit down and break bread together, they're not getting to know each other.  I don't say that anymore.
Story_ID: 187416
Speaker 1: Sir, I want to know--well lots of thoughts are going through my head.  I want to know that... was the feeling that if you did not protect it, it would be all gone?  Was it, was it Cliff, was Clifton--was he signing the, you know, warning bell?  What was... was there any sense about what other collections existed out there?
Speaker 2: I probably expanded it beyond where it would have gone.  So far as I know, the papers would have been bundled up and kept in files or something, and nobody would have known.  Clifton's white, by the way.
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: And he's from Georgia.
Speaker 1: I met him at an Amistad luncheon.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: It was after I'd written to you and had been declined.  And I had told him, you know, that we had been declined.  But you had done, you know, you just--in the letter you just say that there's an interview... that you had already done an interview for Amistad, and so you didn't want it to be a conflict at that time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's right, and it was a nice letter.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But Sir, so you had a vision.  You saw an opportunity, is what I'm hearing.  But focus on paper, because you-- Amistad is known--and I always tell people to this day, if you want to give papers, give it to Amistad.  So, you-- you really tried to focus on that, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But who did... did you focus on churches first, or individuals or--who were you talking to?
Speaker 2: I was talking to individuals.  I get a bunch of individuals together, and hopefully they'll carry on what I dreamed to be the case.  Everybody's not going to do it, but they might--they might, they might.  Look at that Chicago [Illinois], how many members it has.  I'm not pretending to think that Chicago is black and white; I'm not pretending to think that.  But at least it's something, it's something.
Story_ID: 187417
Speaker 1: Can you talk about the collection, you know, that you've assembled over the years?  Can you talk about the Amistad Research Center, how many documents are in it?
Speaker 2: My count is eight or ten years old.  But there were ten million documents.  And I've added the record of the Amistad--everything regarding the Amistad.  You know, look at the--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: But I wanted to call your attention--we had 10,000 people at the inaugural, at the dedication, according to a piece in the New York Times--black and white.  I never had that-- never had that up there-- as long as it's not too many (Laughter).
Speaker 1: That's what you would hear?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Sir, let me-- so, so how long did it take to get to the ten million?  That took twenty-something years, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what about the fundraising?  What about the--you know, what was necessary to sort of move things along?  Because archiving is very expensive.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's expensive, alright.  We get some, we get some--I should let Cliff [Clifton Johnson] talk about this.  But we get money from people once in a while who can afford it.  And well, we've spent a fortune there, and we're about out of means.
Story_ID: 187418
Speaker 1: Tell me--now how did-- I want-- I want to understand the movie ['Amistad'], and how it came about.  How did Debbie Allen hear about Amistad?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: You don't?
Speaker 2: Cliff [Johnson] says that she's a member of the [Amistad Research] Center.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she had come there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But you don't know exactly how she heard the story?
Speaker 2: No.  And a couple of points--Cliff tried to coach [Steven] Spielberg on the points of inaccuracy.  It didn't work, but I liked the movie, anyhow.
Speaker 1: And what did you like about the movie, and what didn't you like?  What did you like?
Speaker 2: Oh, geez.  I liked the whole thing, as long as--  There was a couple of rough spots that got in the way.  The rough spots are not going to spoil the movie.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: What didn't you like?
Speaker 2: What do I like?
Speaker 1: What didn't you like?
Speaker 2: What didn't I?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  And what was inaccurate?
Speaker 2: Well, the first thing is the black guy in there, he must have been just put in there in order to put someone there.  (Laughter).  He had no real serious role.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Would you have preferred the story told from the African's perspective?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, no.  No, you'd get the--you'd get a mish- mush, and not much interest.  You'd have to tell Spielberg.
Speaker 1: Now, what are the...  Okay, Sir.  So, but did you feel, were you happy with the movie in that it heightened awareness of Amistad?  Because, honestly, Sir, I did not know about Amistad.  And all of a sudden I hear that there's an opera, and there's an exhibit, and there's a movie.  And I'm sitting, wondering what rock have I been under?
Speaker 2: You're not by yourself.  The opera is no good.
Speaker 1: I heard that, but I hadn't seen that one.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: It's no good.  Ten years was the first time I had seen a portion of it, of the opera.  It wasn't any good then, and it's not any good now.  And I'm sorry to say so, but I'd like to give it to [President George H.W.] Bush.
Speaker 1: And Sir, but was the movie--were you happy with the results that more people knew about--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And even if someone brings up a point "Oh, man, I didn't care for that," or something, you know--
Story_ID: 187106
Speaker 1: I was determined to get the ship built for the same reason that I used a dummy to tell the story ten years before.  There's no way to tell the story without the ship.  A few people would listen to it, and the rest would go.
Speaker 2: Now, the process of building the ship, what did you use as--I mean what were the documents used to really build the ship?  Because you built a schooner, right?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  A firm in California drew the blueprints, and I don't know the firm.  But they drew the blueprints, and everything is according to the original, except the ship was longer, and proportionately a little wider.
Speaker 2: And how long did it take to build the ship?
Speaker 1: Two years at least, two years.
Story_ID: 187107
Speaker 1: What is, what are the plans, ongoing plans for this ship?
Speaker 2: To continue to-- well, we'll go to Miami [Florida] this year, and over to New Orleans [Louisiana] and Houston [Texas] and Panama City [Panama] and the West Coast.  That's the plan.  The plan is next year to go to Sierra Leone and Cuba.  Cuba comes first, and then Sierra Leone.  We've got a first over there--a hundred trees, a grove of trees.  We went to Sierra Leone to find some lumber to use for a specific purpose.  We got this lumber and we left a hundred trees in a grove of trees.  We also started a fishery.  I don't know how many fish are in there, but they're both producing, and right now they're broke.  (Laughter).  I shouldn't say they're broke.  They're, they're able to keep going.
Speaker 1: So, Sir, what... how did Bill Pinkney get involved?  Whose idea was that?  Captain Pinckney.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  When I found out about it, he had already been elected.  I'm sorry to see him go.  He's good for the ship.  "Rah hah."
Speaker 1: The two of you share a love for Puerto Rico, I know that.
Speaker 2: There's a, there's a resort in the south side in Puerto Rico, near Humacao [Puerto Rico].  We've had a timeshare there for about ten years.  It's lovely.  Great, big... our timeshare is not the most expensive, but it's good.  It's a big place, a big place-- oh.  My friend, L. Piddio Moheca [ph.], took me on a trip around the island, and as we passed this spot he said, "Warren, look over there and down there.  See that house and ship?  He said, "Well, that's going to be a"--what's the word?
Speaker 1: Resort?
Speaker 2: Resort.  They certainly got, they've got million dollar homes in there.  They've got the golf club; oh, it's a beautiful building.
Story_ID: 187108
Speaker 1: When you look back on your, you know, this quest of yours, and your life--did you imagine that you would have the type of success that you've had?
Speaker 2: I don't know what I thought.  I must have thought that I would have had success, or I wouldn't have kept up with it.  I've just kept driving, driving, driving.  Well, the last year or two, I've got the strength to keep going.  But as soon as I can write, I'll start sending out letters again.
Speaker 1: So, when you look at the body of work that you've collected, what were you attempting to do for--one, black people?
Speaker 2: Okay, you're waiting for an answer.  Where have you seen history written? where have you seen history?  We don't write.  And the people who do write, most of them are making believe, or they're not writing from fact.
Speaker 1: And what did you want to accomplish for American society then?  What did you want to...?  Remember you were talking about your friend who you, you know, you had worked on?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And then you saw him with a, you know, a young black boy.  But what were you, what did you want to accomplish?  And do you feel you've accomplished that?
Speaker 2: So far as I've gone in my life, I've converted some individuals.  I can't ask for any more than that, except to reach a little further and hope--
Speaker 1: And Sir, what do you want... what do you... what are your hopes for someone in picking up the mantle to take and go on?  What is, what hasn't been done that you hope still can be done?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.  The Amistad Research Center has to have money.  It has to have resources, resources with money.  The ship, Amistad, will go on visiting ports.  People will come aboard, black people and white people, all people, and some will be sufficiently moved to change.  You don't, you don't have the same kind of--you don't have the same sense of faith that I have.  I have faith.

Speaker 1: Tell us about this photo.  Okay, when was this photo taken? (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Sir, this one. No, no, no (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's the one that's--that was first taken--
Speaker 2: No, this one, take this.  Take the one on the chair, Sir.
Speaker 1: I don't know if that one is first.  That's what I'm--
Speaker 2: Okay, do you know how old you were?  Maybe in your twenties?
Speaker 1: Somewhere, or early thirties.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is [HM] Warren Marr II, though?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  What does that one say on the back?
Speaker 2: This says, March--No, "Marr."  It's 1941.  So 1941, you are seventeen, I think.
Speaker 1: Twenty-Five.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Twenty-Five.
Speaker 2: Yes, okay, that's right.  In 1941?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And what was the occasion for the photograph?
Speaker 1: I don't know, just-

Speaker 1: Yes, you did.
Speaker 2: (CARMEL MARR):  And at the wedding, when the minister asked who will give this woman in marriage, my father started to cry.  You could hear him from one end of the church to the other.

Speaker 2: What's her name?
Speaker 1: That's Grace.

Speaker 1: Well, I think I made up my mind.  Oh--
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
