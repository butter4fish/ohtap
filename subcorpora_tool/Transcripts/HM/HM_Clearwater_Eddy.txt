Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for the HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My name is Eddy Clearwater Harrington.  That's E-D-D-Y, Eddy, Clearwater, C-L-E-A-R-W-A-T-E-R, Harrington, H-A-R-R-I-N-G-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: And, sir, now, where is Clearwater from?  What--how'd you get that name?
Speaker 2: Well, that was a given name to me by a one-time booking agent, promoter of mine by the name of Jump Jackson, from the musician's union in Chicago [Illinois].  So he said, he said I want to sign you up to a booking contract.  But I want to change your name from Eddy Harrington to Clear--to Eddy Clearwater.  So I said, fine with me.  So he signed up and registered with the musician's union, and I've been called Eddy Clearwater ever since.
Speaker 1: Now, is there any history behind the name of why he chose that name or did you like the name or what--?
Speaker 2: Well, he just chose it.  Well, it was like--at the time it was a take--a take-off on Muddy Waters.  He said, there's a Muddy Waters.  So he said, we're gonna name you Clearwater.  So then he named me Clearwater, so it started to come out in the newspapers and stuff.  And Muddy said, I want, I want to meet this guy called Clearwater.  So I, I got to meet Muddy, and we became very close friends.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, that's an interesting story.
Speaker 2: He called me his son, as a matter of fact.  He said, that's my son, (laughter), you know, he would tease me.
Speaker 1: Clearwater, right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have any nicknames?
Speaker 2: "The chief."  I got the name "the chief" because I was playing at this one club in Westmont [Illinois].  And the bartender said, said she wanted us to come to a party at her house at the end of the evening.  So I went to her house, and she had the headdress hanging on the wall in her house.  So I said, I'd really like to have that piece to wear for my stage appearance.  At first she said, no, I--well, I can't sell it to you because it belonged to my deceased husband.  So I said--I just let it go at that for the time.  But I kept expressing, from time to time, that I really would like to have it.  So she said, I tell you what.  I won't sell it to you, but I'll give it to you as a good luck charm, providing you never part with it, you know.  So I gave her my word, and we shook hands.  And that exact same headdress--it was, it was in 1975, it still hangs in my den and at my house.  And that's how I got named "the chief" cause I wore it as artwork for album called "The Chief".  So everyone started calling me "the chief," so I got that nickname "the chief."  However, I am part Native American.  My grandmother was, almost full-blood Native American, Native, Native American.
Speaker 1: Was she Choctaw?
Speaker 2: No, Cherokee.
Speaker 1: Cherokee?

Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, now, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a full-time musician, songwriter, musician, entertainer.  I travel all over the world playing music.  I just came from England with a real successful concert, knock on wood.  It was well received.  It was a big festival so it turned out good.  So next week I go to Poland for another concert.
Speaker 1: Okay.

So I was there on a two-week vacation once, and I had a great time.  And I would have to say that would be my favorite place to go.  I've been to New Orleans [Louisiana], I've been a lot of places for vacations, but this is, this tops it, Hawaii does.
Speaker 1: And I think Taj Mahal lives in Hawaii now, I believe.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, what is her date of birth and place of birth?

Speaker 1: Okay, so you were raised by Ida and Jim Harrington?
Speaker 2: Correct, yes.  And I had an aunt, Aunt Mattie.  She was, she used to nurse me and take, take--give, change my diapers and the whole bit.  She, she never let me forget it either (laughter).  But she was very good to me.

Speaker 2: My mother was about twenty-eight when she died.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very young.
Speaker 1: So she was twenty-eight.
Speaker 2: I never even remember her.  I have no recollection of her at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how much do you know about her side of the family?  How far back can you trace your ancestors on that side?
Speaker 2: I know very little about my mother's side of the family.  It's mostly my, my dad's side of the family.  And like I said, I, I was never really connected with my mother's side of the family.  They were Richardsons, Richardsons and Love, that, that was their last name.  But I, I just never got really connected with them.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you really don't know much about where they came from or anything else?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I just know they're from the South, and, but that's about it.
Speaker 1: What did they do for a living?  Were they farmers?
Speaker 2: Farmers, oh, yeah, farmers, sharecroppers, you know.  That was pretty--basically, a way of life at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just about everyone was sharecropping, and--.
Speaker 1: All right, well, did, did your aunt and your uncle [Houston Harrington] talk about how your mother was raised or anything or what happened to her when she was coming up or any stories about her at all?
Speaker 2: Well, all I know that she was, she was a farmer.  She worked there on the farm.  And she had two children, my, my brother and myself.  And my brother was two years older than I am, but he died in '63 [1963].  And that's the most that I know about her.  They said she was a tall lady with a nice smile (chuckle), and that's about as far as I know.

Speaker 1: Well, your father.
Speaker 2: My father.  Ralph Harrington.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, he moved to, to, to Florida at--when I was very young.  He moved to, he moved away to Florida.  He met some lady, and they got married, and they moved.  And that's--and I, I just remember going to see him when I was like fourteen years old or something.  I went down and visited him for a week once, and that's the first time he got a chance to hear me play, play guitar so--cause, cause my uncle [Houston Harrington] took me down.  And he say, you got to hear Edward play guitar.  So he had an acoustic guitar.  I sat down and played for him.  I, I--that I remember quite well.
Story_ID: 5255
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were raised by your uncle Jim Harrington then, right?
Speaker 2: My, my grandfather, Jim Harrington.
Speaker 1: Your grandfather, your grandfather, okay.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: But I had an uncle [Houston Harrington] and an aunt [Mattie Harrington] that lived--which was their mother and father, there was, there was an uncle and an aunt that lived at home with--the same time I was at home.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you, you were raised, you know, by all three--I guess, they were the adults in the family and they all raised you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, they were the adults in the family, yeah.  They taught me how to farm.  They taught me how to fish.  They taught me how to swim (laughter); taught me how to ride horses and things like that, my uncle did.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you--what was your uncle's name?
Speaker 2: Houston.
Speaker 1: Houston, okay.
Speaker 2: Houston Harrington.  He's the one that encouraged me in music also, Houston Harrington.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was a gospel musician.
Speaker 2: Yes, right, yes, gospel musician.  Yeah, he was--.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Ida Harrington and Houston Harrington lived with your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Yes, which was my, which was their father and mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was your grandfather like?  Tell us about him.
Speaker 2: My grandfather, he was just a typical farmer.  He loved, he, he--well, he went to church every Sunday, that I remember.  And I used to hear him sit around and sing little hymns and stuff, during--like on the weekend and stuff.  And he was really a nice man, very nice man.  I have a picture of him at home that I, I could send it to you.  It's not a very good picture because it was real early pictures and, but he was quite a, quite a nice person.
Speaker 1: Now, how old was he when you were, you know, coming up?  I mean was he--do you have any idea when he was born?
Speaker 2: When, when I was born?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, do you have any idea of when he was born, your grandfather?
Speaker 2: No, God, he would have had to been born at the very early--cause I was born in 1935.  So he would have been born right at the, the beginning of, of the 1900s, you know.
Speaker 1: So he was about thirty-five when you were a baby?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it would have to been thirty--thirty-five or forty years old (unclear), as near as I can remember.  That would have been about it.
Story_ID: 5256
Speaker 1: Okay, well, now, what's your first childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My first childhood memory of, just, what?
Speaker 1: Anything.
Speaker 2: Not music, just any--my, my first childhood memory would be probably, probably once seeing my grandmother [Ida Harrington] cook in the kitchen.  I remember being in the kitchen and seeing her make greens and stuff and mix cornbread.  And I--we, we had a churn where you churned milk for butter.  This, this would be my fondest memories as a, as a real small child.  I used to sit and watch my grandmother do this, and then like, shuck corn, take the shucks off of corn.  And that would--and I would just sit there.  And then later on, they taught me how to do it cause that was (laughter), that was part of the workload (laughter).  I didn't realize it at that time, but I, I soon realized, hey, this, this is part of the way you survive by helping out on the farm, you know.  So these are my fond memories of being a child, and then going fishing, my brother and I.  My uncle [Houston Harrington] taught us how to fish, you know, and take a hook and put the bait on it, and throw it out in the water.  And the fish bites it, and I said, wow, that was pretty cool.  And then you, and you pull the fish out of the water.
Speaker 1: What kind of fish did you usually catch?
Speaker 2: Perch and catfish, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what--.
Speaker 2: Trout once in a while, trout.
Speaker 1: Okay, what were some of the--we always ask this question this way.  That's why I'm asking.  What are some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Just the smell the grass and the--being cut and weeds and the cutting down trees.  And the sights would be like, certain birds, the way they whistle, like, that's the way I learned what a whippoorwill was, a whippoorwill that, he's got a certain sound.  It sounds "chip fell out"--my grandma, my grandfather [Jim Harrington] used to say that they were saying "Chip fell out of the white oak, chip fell out of the white oak" (laughter), yeah.  And they would say this over and over again.  So we believed that's what they were saying, "Chip fell out of the white oak" (laughter).  So those were sounds that I--that stuck in my head.
Speaker 1: Yeah, those were the days people actually knew--a lot of people that are from the country, they know, they can imitate the birds and stuff.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And they know which ones are which and which trees are which.
Speaker 2: Some people can which bird and which trees.
Speaker 1: It's a different kind of knowledge.
Speaker 2: Oh, a different kind of knowledge, yeah.  Well, I learned the--well, the oak tree from the, the pine tree, the--all different trees and stuff, you know, cedar, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the bird things are what amaze me now cause I think most people don't pay attention to what kind of birds there are.
Speaker 2: They don't pay attention, right, yeah, but they, they all have a distinct sound, different sound.
Speaker 1: Can you make any of the sounds?
Speaker 2: Oh, God, I wish I could (laughter).  Oh, no.  I can't even whistle.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what else?  What other sights and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: The, the locomotive train (chu-chu sound), the locomotive.  That was fascinating to me.  That's when I first learned what a train was.  Oh, that was just--and my grandparents took me to see a train with the big wheels going around.  I said, this is fascinating stuff.
Speaker 1: Did you, I mean did the train--did you wonder where they were going and stuff like that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, like--well, they told me, they said, well, this train goes from Mississippi all the way to Florida.  And I got, wondered in my head, Florida?  Where, where in the world is Florida from (laughter) here?  From Mississippi.  So I, so I had an idea that they go from place to place.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were growing up, did people like hitch rides on the train and ride, you know, to each town?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, that's when I first learned what the word "hobo" meant, cause a lot of people, a lot of the musicians, that's how they got to Chicago [Illinois] from the South.  They, they didn't have money.  They had to--they had to just get their guitar and hop on a train and hobo their way and go--let that train take them as far as it go, and then wait for another one and then hop on one of the box cars.
Story_ID: 5257
Speaker 1: That's what the whole hobo thing, like Robert Johnson.  I just seen a documentary on him, and this is how he traveled a lot of times cause he didn't have money.  He just hoboed to a town and get off and play music, and hope someone give him a few dollars, you know (chuckle).
Speaker 2: Now, Robert Johnson, now, he was like, he was gone when you were coming up, right?  I mean he had--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, he was, for the most part, he was, he was gone.  Yeah, he, he had passed away when I got old enough to rem--to know who he really was and everything, yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, did people like tell stories about, you know, when you were a kid, did you listen to stories the grown people would tell, you know?
Speaker 1: A lot, oh, yes, yes.  Like the gentleman I had perform in my club here, Robert Lockwood, Jr., he was a, was friends with Robert Johnson.  As a matter, matter of fact, Robert Lockwood--Robert Johnson used to court his, I think it's his sister or someone.  And they, they played music together quite a bit.
Speaker 2: Okay, any stories about Robert Johnson that you, that he told you?
Speaker 1: Well, no, they just said he always traveled from place to place.  And he didn't think much of what he was doing.  It just--he was just doing what he felt basically.  He didn't never realize he would become the legend that he is now, you know.  He, he never saw it that way cause he made very few recordings, you know, that was ever published, you know.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And did you all ever talk about the devil at the crossroads or any of that kind of stuff that they talk about now?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I've heard that story numerous times.  There may be some truth to it, but which percentage of the truth, I really can't say, but it seemed like he had a spirit, he was driven by a spirit, it seemed like he was because like, 'Hellhounds on my Trail' and stuff like that, you know, he--these are the things he sung about.  So he--obviously, obviously, he felt something that was a little out of the, the ordinary, very unordinary.  You see, music is driven by spirit.  A lot of it's very, very, a very spiritual thing.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, you can explain more if you want.  We got plenty of time.
Speaker 1: Well, no, I, I just wanted to say that, in a sense.  It's part of a spirit.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in what sense?  I mean, what do you mean?
Speaker 1: Well, it's more than just something that you listen to.  It's something that--it becomes a part of you, and you become a part of it, you know.  It, it carries.  It, it stayed there.  Just like you can hear a note, it's just a note that you heard, and it's gone.  But like blues, it's something--just like, ever since I first heard B.B. King, I became like an ambassador of his, like this guy is far beyond.  It's--what he's doing is much more than just music.  It's--he's connecting with people in a real spiritual way, and I've always felt this about him from the first time, first time I heard him until now.  He's a, yeah, I'm a huge fan of his.
Story_ID: 5258
Speaker 1: What kind of little kid were coming up?  What were you interested in, and what did you--what were you thinking about when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: Music (laughter).  I'll tell ya, my uncle, my Uncle Houston [Harrington], he opened a little country café.  And every weekend, that's where everyone would hang out at the little café.  And he had a jukebox there.  At that time, it held twelve records, twelve seventy-eights.  And on that jukebox was Louis Jordan, people like Louis Jordan and [Sam] Lightnin', Lightnin' Hopkins.  And I used to hang around there, and, and help clean up, just to get to hear the jukebox.  And my uncle would let me hang around, and people would be hanging out drinking whiskey and listening to music, eating fish, catfish (chuckle).  And I said in my mind then, when I heard Louis Jordan singing 'Caldonia' and 'Ain't Nobody Here but us Chickens', I said this is what I want to do with my life.  I could visualize myself being on stage singing and playing, and--cause I could visualize him on stage, doing it, just from hearing him on the jukebox.  And I said, that's what I want to do with my life.  I want to become a full-time musician.  At one point in my life, I kind of wanted to be a minister, but then I said, there's more than one way to administer to people, you know.  As long as you do something to help bring humanity to--closer together, then that's a way of administering to people.  As long as you can do something on a positive to try and get people to be closer together.
Story_ID: 5259
Speaker 1: Okay, now, one of the venues, I guess, for music, I guess where you grew up was the church, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that was a way of life, you know.  Well, now, you mentioned the Robert Johnson story, the same story like with Robert Johnson and the devil, I've heard this story all my life.  See, we weren't allowed to play blues records on Sunday at home cause that was considered the devil's music, you know.  If you played 'em, you dare not let your parents hear you playing 'em.  You'd have to wait until they'd leave home if you want to play, say like a [Sam] Lightnin' Hopkins or John Lee Hooker record, you would not let them hear you.  They'd walk in the house and say, don't be, don't play those blues records on Sunday.  You--that's, that's the devil's music.  Did you forget this is Sunday, you know.  So, so we were raised with that theory that the blues was of the devil, and, and the gospel was of, of God, you know.  But to me, they both--it all depends on what you're saying.  There's a lot of truth in blues, a lot of truth.  And that's what the blues is about, the truth.  It's about the feeling of the truth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Expressions, expressions.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, can you give us an example of truth that'd be in the blues?
Speaker 2: Well, here's a guy singing now about, say he's got a sweet little angel, and I love the way she spreads her wings.  She, when she spreads her arms around me, she give me joy and everything.  Well, this is how he feels about this person, this woman, whoever she is.  He, he thinks she's really sweet to him, and he love the way she treats him, and vice versa, it could be a woman that treats him really bad.  And he's saying, "Well, I don't know--I wonder why, why my woman won't treat me right.  She leave home early in the morning.  She don't come home till late at night."  See, these things does happen to people, and they are broken-hearted over it, you know.  So they're just singing about what the truth is (chuckle), you know.  They're not making it.  It's not a lie.  They're just telling, telling what really happened to them or someone that they know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I just want--so, so you went to the church and, and--well, the blues and the church music were going on at the same time, but they, but the church people didn't want the blues played on Sunday.
Speaker 2: Didn't want, right, because it was considered the devil's music.  And there's such a fine line between gospel and the blues (laughter), so it's--how do you separate it (laughter), you know.  It's, and the gospel is about the truth.  So, so is blues (chuckle).
Speaker 1: Yeah, Saturday night and Sunday morning.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Thank you.  It's--.
Speaker 1: And when does one start and the other end.
Speaker 2: The other one stop, that's right.  Two diversions of the truth, about, about what you feel.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's just a matter of how you express it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what church did you all attend when you were coming up?  Did you have a speci--particular church that you went to?
Speaker 2: The Bethel Methodist Church.  Then there was a, a Baptist church that, that my uncle [Houston Harrington] belonged to.  There was a Methodist on one, one end of town, and there was a Baptist on the other end.  So we would go to, to both of them.  But most of my folks was Methodist.
Speaker 1: Okay, was there any particular kind of Methodist or, was it United Methodist or AME [African Methodist Episcopal] or, or CME [Christian Methodist Episcopal].
Speaker 2: I, I guess, I think it was AME, I believe it was.  Yes, I believe so.  And my uncle, he was a preacher, so I used to go and hear him preach once in a while.
Speaker 1: Is this Houston?
Speaker 2: Houston.
Speaker 1: Harrington?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, and he also had a joint, he owned a joint too and preaching.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was, he was a jack of all trades (laughter).
Speaker 1: So he had, now he, in his life, he spanned both things.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, he was dealing--you (laughter) you might say he was dealing with the devil and God (laughter), you know.  It's all in what you believe basically.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you wouldn't--the people in the, dealing with blues weren't necessarily trying to do wrong, were they?  I mean they were just--.
Speaker 2: No, they was expressing a, a feeling, what, what they thought, you know.  Just like Muddy Waters, you know, he wasn't singing the blues because of it being an evil thing.  He was singing what he felt, and, and singing about some of the things that had happened to him.
Speaker 1: Now, did you get the feeling that people in church were, though they were supposed to be doing good, weren't all good either, or I mean did you--or did you think they were all good?
Speaker 2: No, well, I, I had a, a, I had a positive feeling about the whole thing.  I, I thought there was a place for, for all of it.  I thought, you know, if you're in church, you do gospel.  And when you--it's like you're performing at a club, you're singing for people that enjoy what you're doing, and I thought there was a place for that also.  I didn't think--I didn't think ill of either, either one.

Speaker 1: Well, now, tell me about school.  Now, where did you go to grade school?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to grade in, in Macon, Macon, Mississippi.  Yes--.

Speaker 1: Now, was this school run by like a black church or was it run by the state or the county?
Speaker 2: Run by the state, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I never will forget, my first teacher was Beatrice Hunter.  I thought she was the meanest person I'd ever seen (laughter).  A kid, there were certain kids who would get, get a whipping every day.  Back, back then, they'd--if you did wrong, they'd whip you in school, you know, and, and God, I was, I was terribly afraid of her.  She only hit--I only got one spanking, I never will forget.  On recess we went outside.  So two kids--there was a wooded area, two kids want to go in the, in the wooded area and look for acorns or something.  So I went along with them, but I didn't take note to the time.  And when we got back, it was way after the class had started, and boy, did we get a whipping (laughter).  We stayed away longer than we were supposed to stay.
Speaker 1: Now, how many kids were in the school?
Speaker 2: Ah, at that school, it must have been at least between, thirty, forty and fifty kids, you know, in all different classes, at least.
Speaker 1: All the grades together?
Speaker 2: Yeah, take grades together, about, about maybe sixty children.
Speaker 1: Okay, like would yawl have one room or did you have like--?
Speaker 2: Oh, nah, we had different rooms, like first grade, second grade and third grade, and fifth grade, sixth grade.

Speaker 1: Did you like school?
Speaker 2: Oh, I liked it, yeah.  I liked it.  But I used to--I had an aunt, aunt, Aunt Hilda, every time I see her--she lives in St. Louis [Missouri] now, every time I see her now, I remind her of it.  I was the most shy kid in school that you probably would ever see.  And I wouldn't talk, I wouldn't talk to anybody.  I was just too shy.  And my aunt used to, always trying to get me to talk.  Well, Edward, why don't you talk?  And she would try and make a conversation with me.  I wouldn't talk.  So when it was warm, on our way home from school, we would take our shoes off and tie the strings together and put 'em over our shoulder and walk barefoot.  And my Aunt Hilda used to grab my shoes and say, I'm taking these shoes home with me.  I'm not giving them back.  And I thought she was serious.  Ah, and I was so--I got to have my shoes.  I can't go home.  She says, nah, you're not getting these shoes back.  And I thought she was serious.  And, oh, I'd start crying, and then--and she say, I don't care if you cry.  I'm not--you're not getting these shoes back, and she would do that until I would just be boohooing (laughter).  But she just loved it because she, that's the only way she could get, get my attention and get me to talk.  So when I got older, I realized that she was just kidding around.  She didn't want my shoes.  But she just wanted to get my (laughter), get a response from me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were shy kid, huh?
Speaker 2: Very shy, yeah, real shy.  And I very seldom--only a couple of kids in school I would talk to, that I was close, close friends with and stuff.  A kid named Bussie Hunter and I can't think of the other name, another couple of kids I would talk to.  But other than that, I would talk to anybody.
Speaker 1: Now, did you live with any cousins or anything when you lived with your grandfather [Jim Harrington] and your grandmother [Ida Harrington]?
Speaker 2: Nah, nah, just my brother and, and my uncle [Houston Harrington].
Speaker 1: So you were the only kid there?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: So did, did you feel kind of lonely there being the only kid in the household or--?
Speaker 2: Well, no, well, my brother and I, we communicated quite well.  So we, we kept each other company.  And like I said, I was very close to this one uncle, my Uncle Houston.  He was like my mentor, so it was--.
Story_ID: 5262
Speaker 1: Now, did he [Houston Harrington] teach you how to play music?
Speaker 2: Well, he just, he, he made a--he made it available for me to play cause he bought an acoustic guitar, and he would allow me to pick it up and try and play it and see if I could do things with it.  So he encouraged me.
Speaker 1: When did you start really getting serious about playing the guitar, or that you really tried to learn how to play?
Speaker 2: Well, when I moved to Birmingham [Alabama], my uncle introduced me to some gospel groups, like the Norfleet Brothers and the Five Blind Boys of Alabama.  So they would come around my uncle's place.  He had a little place where he'd have people come around and practice and play.  So the Five Blind Boys came by, and they would let me play.  And they said, we're gonna need a guitar player for next Sunday, and they asked my uncle, could Edward play with us?  So my uncle said, yes, you know.  So I got to go and play, play behind the Five Blind Boys, you know.  And that gave me some encouragement too.  I said, wow, this, this, this seems like fun, you know.
Speaker 1: And how old were you when--?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was very young.  I had to be about thirteen or so, yeah, thirteen or no more than fourteen, fourteen years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But to me, it was like, each Sunday they'd have a different place they would go and sing.
Speaker 1: This was about 1948.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that would be about right.  And I thought that was pretty special, you know.  But I had no idea that the Five Blind Boys were gonna become as famous as they are (laughter).
Speaker 1: So they were just getting started then?
Speaker 2: Just getting starting, yeah, yeah, and, incidentally, just February of this year, I was at the Grammys in Los Angeles [California], and they were there.  And they won, but I didn't (laughter).  They won.  Yeah, I was nominated, but they won the Grammy.  So this is their second time winning, so it was really good.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Five Blind Boys, I mean they, they had a genre, a genre of music with a quartet, and I think that's really--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes--.
Speaker 1: --awesome, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, a lot of the guys--.
Speaker 1: That's one, that's a feature of Alabama--I don't know if it started in Alabama.  Maybe you could tell me, but that kind of singing, you know.  I think Alabama is famous for it if it didn't start there.  The Five Blind Boys and I think other groups, The Mighty Clouds of Joy, are they from Alabama?
Speaker 2: The Clouds of Joy, I believe they may--I believe they are from Alabama, yeah.  But definitely, the Five Blind Boys are from Alabama, yeah, yeah, they--very good group, very good group.
Speaker 1: Now, you played with some--so, once you played with them, now, why did you stop playing with them?  Was it--?
Speaker 2: Well, after that I moved to Chicago [Illinois], and I really go the, the urge--that's when my uncle introduced me to people like Muddy Waters, Elmore James, Jimmy Reed, Howlin' Wolf [Chester Arthur Burnett], I got to meet people like that, and I said--I, I really wanted to be into the blues cause I, I had so much respect for the people like Howlin' Wolf and [Sam] Lightnin' Hopkins, John Lee Hooker; then later on, B.B. King, I met him.  I said, well, I was converted all over again.  I said this is, this is great stuff, you know.  You know, that's--I got into blues when I came to Chicago.
Story_ID: 5263
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did--you went to high school in Birmingham [Alabama], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, you went to Parker [High School]?
Speaker 2: Parker, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to finish high school?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't finish.  I, I went to the, the ninth, ninth grade, and I--that's when I dropped out and I came to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, why did your uncle [Houston Harrington] decide to--well, two questions, I guess.  Why did he--how did you all come to move to Birmingham, and then how did you come to move to Chicago?  I mean what was the reason for him moving--?
Speaker 2: Well, my, another one of my uncles wanted my grandmother [Ida Harrington] to move away from the farm in Mississippi because farming was like on its way out.  It was pretty fizzling, and, and they were getting older, you know.  So my uncle lived in Birmingham, named Willie B. [Harrington], he said, I, I have a place for you all in Birmingham.  I want you to come and live near me.  And so he just, he just, practically insisted that they move away from the farm because they had been all their life, you know.  And he said that's--wanted to come to a more urban area which was in Birmingham.  So that's why we moved there.  And then when I got a little old--when I got eighteen, I decided to go on my own.  And my uncle said, well, if you come to Chicago--cause he knew I wanted to make music my career, he said, if you come to Chicago, you'll get a chance to meet people like Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf [Chester Arthur Burnett], Jimmy Reed.  And he said, this is where they make their living.  So that, that was like, like held wide open for me.  I said, that's what I want to do.  I want to pursue it.  And that's when I moved to Chicago.
Speaker 1: So you came up when you were eighteen [sic, fifteen].
Speaker 2: Eighteen years old, September of 1950, on the Greyhound bus.  The ticket was fifteen dollars (laughter).  I wished I'd a-kept the ticket stub, you know.  It's a big difference in the price now.
Speaker 1: Fifteen dollars?
Speaker 2: Fifteen dollars, yeah, never will forget it.
Speaker 1: Okay, well what was it like?  Well, what did--when you arrived in Chicago, I mean what did you think?
Speaker 2: Oh, when I arrived in Chicago on that Greyhound bus, it, it seemed like it took me forever to get here, if there is a such thing as forever.  I got here, it was around 12:00 o'clock at night.  So I got out of the bus downtown, on Clark Street at that time it was.  So I took a taxi to my uncle's place at 1548 S. Homan.  So I told the cab driver where I wanted to go.  And he pulled up, it was pitch dark, he pulled up on the street, he said, it's, it's right there.  It was little--but it was a little basement apartment which was just dark.  You couldn't see anything.  So I paid him, and I got out, and I went, and I knocked on the door.  And my uncle answered the door.  But, boy, was that scary because being in a big city like Chicago at the age of fifteen, it was--I said to my son, I said, I, I came to Chicago when I was fifteen years old.  And I, I told him, I said, I couldn't imagine you being on your own at fifteen at, at this day and age.  I said, I wouldn't even imagine that, you know.  But I just, I did what I felt I had to do.  You know, I mean, so I have to make it work.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a different day now in that respect.  I know, I know what you mean--.
Speaker 2: Totally different day, yeah.
Speaker 1: Things that--.
Speaker 2: With all the crime and at the point, it's so much crime and everything now, much more, seeming-- seem like, than it was then, you know, with all the gangs and the whole bit, you know.
Story_ID: 5264
Speaker 1: But somehow or another I managed.  So I moved, I came--I stayed with my uncle [Houston Harrington] for a short while.  And he met a lady, and he moved out and moved in with her.  And he left me there with the little basement apartment by myself.  So I--he took me up to a restaurant called Little Jack's Restaurant.  So I got a job washing dishes, and that's how I paid my rent and bought my food.  And there was a bank across the street on Madison and, Madison and Kedzie.  There was a bank across the street on the corner.  I was making thirty-seven dollars a week.  Whatever I had left over my food and my rent, I would go across the street and put it in the bank.  And that, next door to the restaurant, there was a pawn shop.  And they had a guitar hanging in the window, an Epiphone one guitar.  So I looked--every day at lunch I'd go over and just look in that window at that guitar.  So I, I finally got up enough nerve to ask him how much it was.  For the guitar and amp, it was a hundred and seventy five dollars.  So I managed to save enough money working at the restaurant to go and buy that guitar.  So when I saved enough, I went over and said, I want to buy this guitar and amp.  And I bought it, and that was my very first guitar.  And my second guitar was a Silvertone.  I bought it from Sears Roebuck.
Speaker 2: So what did--did you put that guitar to use right away?
Speaker 1: Oh, right away, oh, yeah, yes.  I practiced every chance I got, and I went around and did a lot of auditions all over until people would say, come in and audition; if we like you, we'll hire you, you know.  Sometimes they would, sometimes they wouldn't.  But I didn't give up.  I kept saying well, I'm just gonna keep going until--.
Speaker 2: Now, did you meet any--did you practice with any of the Chicago [Illinois] musicians here, I mean that were already playing or did you have to listen to records?  Or how did you (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: Well, I listened to records mostly, but I would go out every chance I get and listen to people play.  The first band I heard when I came to Chicago was a band called Little Mack Simmons.  He just died a couple of years ago.  He was a harp player.  My uncle took me to see him, and I really became interested.  And after that I started to see people like Magic Sam [Maghett], Otis Rush and Howlin' Wolf [Chester Arthur Burnett] at Silvios, Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters and Elmore James, and I just became--there was always some place every night on the West Side or the South Side to go to hear blues, there was places all over that you could go and listen to blues.
Story_ID: 5265
Speaker 1: Now, a lot of these guys that you mentioned are from Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: I would guess, I don't know, and correct me if I'm wrong, but it seemed like a lot, most of the musicians in Chicago [Illinois] that played the blues were from Mississippi.
Speaker 2: A good percentage, the biggest percentage of 'em are from Mississippi.  You know, like Jimmy Reed, he--or Muddy [Waters] is from Mississippi.  Howlin' Wolf [Chester Arthur Burnett] and B.B. King, he's from Indianola, yeah.
Speaker 1: And Willie Dixon was from--.
Speaker 2: Willie Dixon, Mississippi, oh, absolutely, yeah.  The biggest percentage--Magic Sam [Maghett], Otis Rush, they were all from Mississippi.
Speaker 1: See, I always wonder if, when the guys get together, they talk about where they come from--.
Speaker 2: A lot, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and talk about the state.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot, they talk about it.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet anybody that wanted to go back, you know, to Mississippi and play (laughter)--?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah--.
Speaker 1: --in those day--.
Speaker 2: Well, Bobby Rush, he moved back to, to Jackson.  He, he's from Mississippi.  So he, he lives in Jackson now.  He moved back there, yeah.  But I go back and play.  Occasionally, I go to Mississippi when I'm going, doing a Southern tour, a lot in Tennessee and also Mississippi, and a few times in Birmingham [Alabama].  There was a club in Birmingham, but I think it's closed up now.  But I went through a few times and played Birmingham on my way down to Miss--to Florida and stuff, yeah.
Speaker 1: What I'm trying to get at is in those days, things were pretty rough in Mississippi, I guess.  I mean, did you have any stories from your family about the situation in Mississippi--
Speaker 2: You mean the segre--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 1: --or in Birmingham, which was also pretty rough.
Speaker 2: Did their segregation, that's, the segregations aspect of it?  Yeah, a few years ago, I went to Birmingham to do a few gigs.  And I took my band with me from the North, which they didn't know anything about the South.  So we got downtown Birmingham, and all of the outdoor restaurants was open with the outdoor cafes around the campus and the whole bit.  And you see the, the black and white people sitting together, eating, drinking and talking, laughing and having a good time.  And to my band it seemed like, it's always been this way (laughter), you know.  And I said, you see what you see now?  They, they said, yeah, but what are you referring to?  I said, like all the college students, black and white sitting together eating and drinking and talking, playing music.  I said, this is not the same South that I came from.  I said, when I came from here, this was unheard of.  There were separate washrooms, separate places to, to eat, and the movie, you had to either side upstairs or downstairs.  You had to be totally segregated, you know.  They said, is, is, is this true?  I say, yeah, it's history (laughter).  It's history.  It was totally separated.  Now, Birmingham, it'd be just like in, say, Hyde Park, you know, yep, it was no such thing as integration at that time.  Just like with Rosa Parks here getting on the bus, that's when I'd just left Birmingham is when the whole Civil Rights Movement started.  I just had left and came to Chicago.
Speaker 1: You left in, when, you said, '55 [1955], was it?
Speaker 2: No, I left, 1950, so it was shortly after that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, about six years later.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--.
Speaker 1: The Birmingham Bus Boycott was like '56 [1956]--.
Speaker 2: --that's when the, the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 1: It was about six years away.  It was six years away from when you left?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  It, it--yeah, so they, they couldn't believe that it was that much difference.  I says, it's whole different world.
Speaker 1: Does it seem strange to you now to be back and have that kind of--?
Speaker 2: It seems strange--I played in Oxford, Mississippi--Jim O'Neil from 'Living Blues' magazine was there.  And all of the white kids was walking up to me asking me for my autograph and the whole bit.  And it was really a kind, gentle thing.  And Jim O'Neil said, he asked me, he said, being from here, how do you feel now from the time that you left, like these kids--they're not segregating against you.  They're, they're asking you for your autograph because they look up to you.  I said, I feel very humble.  I said I feel, feel very humble.  It was a humbling experience, yeah.
Speaker 1: A lot different.
Speaker 2: A lot different, yeah.
Story_ID: 5266
Speaker 1: So you're starting to--you bought this guitar from the pawn shop, and you're starting to play and auditioning?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I started auditioning.  Then I ran into a gentleman, an ex-promoter that used to promote for Don Robey, that recorded Bobby Blue Bland out of Texas, Duke Records.  So he said, he said, I used to be a promoter for Duke Records.  He said, I can help you get a band together if you want, you know.  So he did.  He got--helped me get a trio together.  It was my first trio, with a gentleman named John, John Hudson and Richard Rogers.  So we were a three, a three-piece trio.  So then we started auditioning all over.  And Mr. [Harry] Reeves got a job at the, the Trianon Ballroom on sixty--it used to be 63rd and Cottage Grove.  We played a dance.  And that was my first professional gig (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you're a trio.  And Richard Rogers played the drums.
Speaker 2: He played drums, right.
Speaker 1: And then what did the other gentleman play?
Speaker 2: John Hudson played guitar.  I had second guitar.  I didn't have a bass player then, just a rhythm guitar, and lead--I was on lead, and a drummer, yeah, three-piece trio.
Speaker 1: And did you sing too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I started singing--my uncle [Houston Harrington] tricked me into singing.  He was having a party at his house on a Saturday night.  He invited a few people over, a friend of his.  But I thought I was just gonna play the guitar.  And he said, Edward's gonna play the guitar for you all.  So they, they were sitting around drinking beer, and I'm just sitting there playing the guitar.  So I seen my uncle setting up a microphone.  I said, uncle, why you setting up a microphone?  And he set it up and plugged it in, and then he announced, "Now, we're gonna have my nephew sing a song for everyone".  I said, (laughter) I had never song in front of anybody in my life (laughter).  I said, are you kidding?  Then they all start clapping, and now it's too late to back down (laughter).  I'm into it.  So I, I'm trying to think of the song I did.  It was an Elvis Presley song I think, (singing) "I feel it in my legs; I feel it in my shoes, when I got the feeling I get the rock 'n roll blues; let's have a party, let's have a party" (laughter), you know.  So that's the first song that I song in front of any, front of anyone.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how'd you--now, did you sing any when you were with the Five Blind Boys or you just--?
Speaker 2: No, just, oh, no.  I wouldn't go near a microphone (laughter).  I was, no way (laughter).
Speaker 1: Those Five Blind Boys are really good (simultaneously)--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, let them sing.  I was just--stay in the back and play, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you--did your uncle ever hear you just singing a, you know, practicing or something?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he heard me, like practicing when no one was around.  That's why he tricked me into singing because I would do it when there was no one around.  But then when there's people, then it was just out of the question.
Speaker 1: So he knew you could sing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's why he tricked me into it.  He said, he knew I could sing, but he knew I was also too shy to do it in front of anyone.  That's why he had to really put me on front street (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, is there a particular challenge to being a left-handed guitar player?  Now, you're a left-handed guitar player.  So is Lefty Diz who's also a friend of yours.  There are others I guess, but is it hard to do that, play it left handed?
Speaker 2: No, it's not hard cause I'm used to it.  When people think--when people speak of it, then I think of it, like, well, I'm doing it the opposite way.  Then it seems awkward, but I never think of it unless someone speak of it, you know.  To me, it's just a natural way to play, you know.  What I'm doing, I'm reversing all of my chords and playing--like a C-chord, I'm playing it backward as opposed to this way.  So, Otis Rush, he plays the same way.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's three--.
Speaker 2: And Albert King also, he played that way.
Speaker 1: That's four, that's four real, who are real good ones.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, Albert, yeah.  Yeah, he was a, he was a master.  So is, so is Otis (chuckle).  That's my hero, Otis Rush.
Story_ID: 5267
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you sang for the first time.  Now, did that open up more doors for you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, after I did it the first time, I felt like I broke the ice.  Then I started to listen to songs and try to learn more songs to sing, you know.  Then I started--then when we'd do auditions, I would sing in front of people then.
Speaker 1: Now, did you at that time try writing some of your own songs?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, I'll tell you who got me into writing.  Willie Dixon and Chuck Berry.  Willie sat down and told me early in the game, he said, let me tell you something, Clearwater.  He said, concentrate on writing your own songs because people are gonna remember you for what you do much more than they will remember you for imitating someone else.  He said, write, write and play your own songs.  Plus, you get paid for it.  And he said, also start your own publishing company, which I did, cause then you get paid for your music being published, being played on the radio and the whole bit.  So I, I'm really, God rest his soul, he gave me some very good advice on that.
Speaker 1: And good advice.  I think Tyrone Davis said the same thing.  He was imitating a lot of other people.  And he was told the same thing, and say, hey, look, you're not gonna go anywhere until you do your own--?
Speaker 2: Do your own style, do your own stuff, oh, yeah, absolutely.  People will remember you forever, forever for what you do.  But if you do what someone else is already famous for, they gonna remember the person that's famous for doing it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Even if you can do it just as good, it doesn't make any difference.
Speaker 2: It doesn't make any difference, that's right.  Just like I could go out and invent an airplane that looks just like the one that the, the Wright brothers invented.  But guess what?  The Wright brothers invented that a long time ago (laughter).  So they gonna get, always get the credit for it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, now, when you start singing, about what year is this?
Speaker 2: Fifty-five [1955] or '56 [1956], right around there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fifty-five or '56.  Yeah, cause I recorded my first record in fifty--'56, I believe, yeah, a song called 'Boogie Woogie Baby' and 'The Hillbilly Blues', a forty-five [45 record].
Speaker 1: 'The Hillbilly Blues'?
Speaker 2: 'Hillbilly Blues,' yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, one of your heroes growing up, I read was Hank Williams?
Speaker 2: Hank Williams, yeah, oh, yeah.  Hank Williams, yeah, '[Your] Cheating Heart,' yeah, 'Cheating Heart, yeah. ' (Singing) "Your cheating heart", is that the one?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, (singing) "Will make you weep", yeah.
Speaker 2: Did you ever play it in public?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I recorded it when I did my last session, but I didn't--they didn't release it.  Maybe they'll release it on, on my next CD.  Yeah, I love that song.  I do a more bluesy version of it, but it's, it's the same song.
Speaker 2: Now, did--when you write your own songs, what kind of messages are in your songs?  Do you have a certain theme you usually--?
Speaker 1: You, you know, whatever is, is current at the time.  Just like I wrote a song on the new CD called 'Good Times Are Coming.'  It's a reflection of how bad the economy is and everything now.  So I, I took a positive spin, and said "Good times are coming, don't let the bad times get you down; pretty soon it's gonna be Christmas is gonna be coming back to town".  Then it says, "I had, I had money in the market, but now it's almost gone; having trouble making the mortgage payments, you 'bout to lose your home, but don't worry because good times are coming and don't let the bad times get you down".  So that's a reflection on what, what is happening now, you know.
Speaker 2: And that's happening to a lot of people--.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --thinking about it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they need hope.  They need hope that tomorrow can be better.
Story_ID: 5268
Speaker 1: And so you were playing on Cottage--63rd and Cottage Grove, right, right, I guess near the el station, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, by the train--the train ran across Cottage.  The Trianon Ballroom [Chicago, Illinois], yeah.  It used to be a club called McKee Fitzhugh's.  That's the--that's when I first seen Louis Jordan at McKee's, first seen him live, as long as I had been listening to him on, on record.  I heard him live, you know.  He appeared at McKee Fitzhugh's.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in those days like, I've heard that 63rd Street was really jumping.
Speaker 2: At that time, oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So who was on 63rd Street, and what kind of musicians would you--could you see on 63rd Street?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, God, all up and down 63rd Street.  There was a club called the Crown Propeller, right past Cottage Grove on 63rd.  And that's the first place I seen Lester [Willis] "Prez" Young at, Lester Young.  And a lot of the jazz musicians used to play, like at the Birdland and all those clubs, yeah.  All the jazz greats used to play out there.  Lester Young and, what's the other sax player name, oh, God--?
Speaker 1: Charlie Parker?
Speaker 2: Charlie Parker, the other guy.  Oh, man, it won't come to my mind now, a real famous guy.  Yeah, but they, there was--that area was, was really crowded with a lot of jazz musicians.
Story_ID: 5269
Speaker 1: So you made your first album--I mean record--a forty-five, in '56 [1956]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, around '56.
Speaker 1: 'Hillbilly Blues' and--
Speaker 2: And Boogie Woogie, 'Boogie Woogie Baby,' yeah, 'Boogie Woogie Baby.'
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what kind of distribution was available then for a blues musician to get their work out?  I mean who bought your records?  I mean, and how would they even know they were out?
Speaker 2: Well, the distribution was pretty tough then.  Well, Chess, Chess Records was the--he, he had the whole market sewed up.  He recorded everything, and he distributed everything through his people.  And, so that's--you either had to go through those channels or you just didn't get--you didn't recognized at all, you know, so far as distribution was concerned.
Speaker 1: So how would it work?  Would your music ever be played on the radio?
Speaker 2: Well, WGES was the only station, and then WOPA Radio, Oak Park, Illinois, which was Big Bill Hill.  Those were the only two stations that really played blues, was WGES and, and WOPA, Big Bill Hill.  They was the only two blues outlets.
Speaker 1: Okay, and they had shows on a certain of day?
Speaker 2: A certain time, at night, yeah, mostly.  And WGES was on in the daytime also.
Speaker 1: So, but mostly, you made your money on, making personal appearances?
Speaker 2: Personal appearances, yeah, right.  And, well, so did, well, Muddy [Waters] and everybody.  That's what they had--Chess would put out records on Muddy and [Howlin'] Wolf, but then they hardly got paid any royalties.  They, they got paid for just performing and making personal appearances.
Speaker 1: All right, now, what was, now, what did people--how did people receive your record?  I mean how did they like it?
Speaker 2: Well, the percentage was very small, but the people that heard it liked it, but like I said, it was such a small percentage of people that would hear it.  Say, for instance, like B.B. King, he decided early in his career--cause he couldn't get, like you just said, he couldn't get the distribution that he really wanted or he felt he should have, so he just took his show on the road, and went and played as many places as he could possibly go and let people hear him in person.  And then with the hope they would hear him and buy his record this way.  That's how he really--he had to, he had to really push himself a lot.  He did this, but then it worked.  He, he was, by being consistent, he made it work, you know.

Speaker 1: Okay, so you played most of the venues on the South Side in those days?
Speaker 2: South--well, at that time, I was working pretty local, South Side and the West Side.  I hadn't started to travel, you know, like nationally and internationally, not at that time.  I was just a local artist.
Speaker 1: So did you have to work another work too?
Speaker 2: For a short while.  I was lucky enough to stay busy enough in Chicago [Illinois], believe it or not, to work five or six nights a week, like from one place to the other; two nights on the West Side, three nights on the South Side, you know.  So it worked out.  Then, then I started to work in the surrounding suburbs at, at the clubs like in Melrose Park [Illinois] the Casa Madrid Lounge.  And at that time, if they liked you, they'd hire you for six nights a week for maybe five or six months.  As long as the people liked you and came to see you, they would keep you there.  So I was fortunate enough during the disco era to just move out to the suburbs and keep going.  Well, the reason I could do that because I--they considered me to be versatile cause I would do blues.  Then I would like the early rock 'n roll, like Chuck Berry, [Antoine] Fats Domino type stuff, Little Richard [Richard Wayne Penniman], I would mix it all together.  And I wouldn't just play blues.  I would play music that the kids could get up and dance to.  So I was fortunate enough to stay busy.
Speaker 1: Now, did you keep--did you expand your band?
Speaker 2: Well, I had just four pieces.  I had--but I've always had basically four pieces.  At one while I had a fifth piece, but the basic thing has always been four pieces.
Speaker 1: Now, those four would be?
Speaker 2: Guitar, bass, drums--guitar, bass, drums and second guitar, rhythm guitar and lead and bass and drums.  But I, at--from time to time, I've used saxophone players or either keyboard players.
Speaker 1: So a lot is heavy guitar.  It's a lot on--emphasis on guitar playing.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, a lot, lot of emphasis on the guitar.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what are you known for as a guitar player, cause, I mean, I would imagine that your career has a lot to do with your virtuosity on a guitar?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I'm known for playing a lot of high energy music, be it rock 'n roll or blues, a lot of high energy, a lot of--like up-tempo, high energy and stuff.  But then I do a lot of slow stuff also, but I'm known for doing a lot high energy.  It's like Chuck Berry type stuff, like that.  That's, that's how I built my reputation (laughter), you know.
Story_ID: 5271
Speaker 1: When did you--now, when you were working like in these clubs, like six nights a week and that sort of thing, how did--what did you income compare, like with say a guy working in a, at the Ford plant or working at steel mill?  I mean was there, were you making more than somebody doing that at that time or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was probably making more than a person working at a--at that time, I would probably make more than a person working at a, say, a Ford plant or a auto mechanic shop or something.  But the thing, the difference is there, there's no benefits as far as insurance and the whole bit.  You make good money--being a leader, you make a fairly decent amount of money, but then you, you have to buy your insurance and the whole bit cause you're self employed.  That's, that's the difference.  But like with a company like, say General Motors or Ford Motor [Company], they give you a good salary, plus insurance benefits.  That's how it used to (laughter).  The way it's going now--.
Speaker 1: Before the unions got erased, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, yeah.  It's, it's pretty sticky now.  Yeah, but the, you can paid a decent salary, you know.
Speaker 1: And I'm just wondering cause I've heard stories--we interviewed Howard Armstrong in Boston [Massachusetts] last year.  They--you might remember him.  He, he played a mandolin and played with [James] Yank Rachell and I can't think of some of the other people he played with.  But he played country blues basically, and played the fiddle, a good fiddle player from Tennessee.
Speaker 2: From Tennessee.
Speaker 1: He ended up working in a plant, auto plant in Detroit [Michigan] for the balance of his life, you know, and then he had to come back to music later in life--.
Speaker 2: Later in life.
Speaker 1: --after he retired, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, yeah, a lot of people do this.  They have a, an extra job to supplement their income.  And it's a--there's a certain amount of people that, that are gonna shine through and be able to sustain, say like B.B. King.  He was able to sustain.  And, and look how many people he employ with him because he was, he was strong enough to sustain and make a big enough name.  The same thing with Buddy Guy.  Now, he, he almost had to go to work at a, as tow truck, truck driver.  But he got, he got a lucky break, and he's--the rest is history, black history too (laughter).  And I look up to him a lot for that, being able to, to hang in there.  And that's what I've done.  I've hung with it, and I've been able, through my songwriting and performing, I get the royalties from my songs and, and also my publishing company.  I have two publishing companies.  And this is what Willie Dixon told me early in the game.  He said, make your publishing and write your songs cause you'll make money while you're sleeping.  You don't have to get up (laughter) and go to a job to make it.  And by it being played on the radio, they're gonna send you money for it.  So this is what happened.  So it's--I was fortunate enough to do that.
Story_ID: 5272
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is there any moment in time where you, you say, well, this is--when I got my big break, where I knew I was gonna be able to play for the rest of my life and wouldn't have to do anything else?
Speaker 2: At what moment did I--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, is there any, any place and time where it was it was real clear that you could play music as a career, and you wouldn't have to worry about doing anything else in life or, or did you always just take it for granted you'd be able to play?
Speaker 2: I just took it for granted, and I just be-believed in myself.  And I kept doing it, like my publicist from Nashville [Tennessee].  She, sometimes she'll say now, she said, "Do you realize how far you've came from where you was before"?  No, I don't.  I can't even realize it.  I'm just doing what I like to do.  And they pay me to do it, and I keep doing it.  This year they'll offer me, offer me one amount of money.  The next year they'll offer me say, a thousand or two thousand more.  I'll say, well, okay.  But I never looked back and said, well, I was only making one thousand last year; now, I'm making three thousand.  I just look at it as well, it's--if it's working out, it's working out (laughter), you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But the more I receive, the more I want to the other people.  That's the thing about it.  And I want to instill this in the people that are coming up.  If you get something, if you get more than one sandwich, and if you have a friend that's hungry, share one of those sandwiches with a friend because, believe me, it will multiple and you'll get more.  By saying, well, no, I'm gonna eat both of them, both of the sandwiches and I have a friend that's hungry, so let that be his problem.  No, yeah, we are our brother's keeper, whether we want to be or not, we are, you know.  If you get something, it means you're supposed to be, have a good enough heart to share it with someone else.  And what I mean by that is giving back.  You don't, you only need so much to live.  You can only eat so much at one time.  If you had five cars, you can only drive one.  If you had five houses, you can only live in one.  So why not help someone else that need a little bit of help, if you can.  And that's, that's my motto of life to do that and my endeavor.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, tell me, now, how--now, you've got a, at this point, you've got lots of albums out, and you've got like--you've done some travel.  And you got a club here.  I mean like, when did, you know, did you ever notice, you know, that things are getting a lot bigger than (chuckle)--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I stepped back a couple of times.  My publicist, like I said, Karen [Leipziger], she made me notice it.  She kept saying, "Look at this; you didn't have this or that five years ago".  And I started to think, well, you know, I guess she's right.  But I still don't let it touch me.  It's just, I just feel blessed that I can be able to sustain and, and live a good life and, and help someone else.  Just like, it never dawned on--sometimes I think of it now, that I, I own two Jaguars.  And I remember the time when I--it would be like, a big thing if I could just afford to buy one Jaguar and pay for it cash, you know (coughing), excuse me.  But now, it doesn't faze me because it's just another thing.  It's just (chuckle), it's just a car, you know.  I don't look at it as, as anything that feels extraordinary.
Story_ID: 5273
Speaker 1: Okay, well, let's go back to--now, in the '60s [1960s], as you were saying, I think off-camera, in the '60s a lot of the blues music that's being played in the United States is being listened to in England.  And a lot of young British bands started playing the blues and Eric Burton and the Beatles and the Rolling Stones--.
Speaker 2: The Stones, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's plenty of 'em over there.
Speaker 2: Eric Clapton.
Speaker 1: Eric Clapton, right, exactly.  Yeah, when that movement was going on, were they--did you have any contact with any of those British groups?
Speaker 2: At that time, I didn't.  But later on, I, I got to meet, like Clapton and also there's a picture on the wall with John [Gypie] Mayo and myself that used to be with the Yardbirds.
Speaker 1: Yeah, John Mayo.
Speaker 2: Yeah, John Mayo.  There's a picture of him, him and I on the wall.  Yeah, but see, what that did, see the blues was totally unaccepted in America, even though it's American-born music.  It took people like, like the British and the French to pick it up and accept.  And they started playing it and brought it back to us, and said, listen to this, this is you guy's music (laughter), you know.  So they just made their own versions of it and say--when they heard it, they said, this is great stuff.  But the average American was stepping right over the blues, saying, well, we don't want to listen to that.  They wanted to listen to disco and stuff like that.  But they totally just walked right past the blues until, like I said, the British picked it up and started making big hits out of it and brought it back to America and said, this, this is what you guys created.  And then that's, that's the reason they just had me on this show that I just did in, in Britain because they wanted to hear my version of the original, original stuff from America.  So that's why they booked me on the show.
Speaker 1: Now, when did you first start going to England?
Speaker 2: In 1976.  My first tour of Europe was '76.  On the tour was myself, Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, Jimmy Johnson, good player from Chicago [Illinois], and Hubert Sumlin, the guitar player that was with [Howlin'] Wolf for a lot of years.  That was my first European tour for twenty-one days.  So it was a great tour, and we finished in, in London, England.  That was the last, last gig on that--no, I'm sorry.  We went to London, but we finished in Stockholm, Sweden, Stockholm.
Speaker 1: Okay, was it surprising that there were so many blues fans over there?  I mean--.
Speaker 2: I was amazed with the magnitude--like they really get into the blues, you know.  And you're talking like big houses, not small clubs like, like here, like my club.  Big clubs like three and four and five and six thousand people.  They, like big theaters, they just fill up, you know, people come out.  I was amazed.  Yeah, quite--well accepted, but we have them to thank for really opening our eyes in America for what the blues really is.  See, cause sometimes you can have a beaut--a backyard full of beautiful flowers, but you look at your neighbor's yard across the way, across the street and say, ah, they have beautiful flowers in their yard.  Their yard is beautiful.  But you never stop to look at your own (laughter), look at your own.  You just, the same flowers you have right in your own yard, you know.
Speaker 1: Exact same in this case.
Speaker 2: Exact same.
Story_ID: 5274
Speaker 1: Now, when I came to Chicago [Illinois]--well, in the, well, let's say in the late '70s [1970s], by the late '70s, a visitor to Chicago and wanted to hear the blues, they picked up the Chicago Reader or the [Chicago] Sun-Times and stuff and looked where the blues, they--none of it's in the black community pretty much.  You'd have to go to Kingston Mines, all these other venues on the North Side to hear blues being played, you know.  You'd have to go to, you know--how did that situation come about from a situation where you had all the blues on 63rd Street and on the West Side, and then all of a sudden you got to go North Side to hear the blues?
Speaker 2: That's a good question, and I'm glad you asked that question because within the last six months I've had about five or six journalists from different countries--one was from Poland, which I'm going to Poland next week, and one, a few of 'em from France have asked me.  And people--from Germany, they ask me the same question, like when we come to Chicago, we go to blues clubs, and we look around, and there's only maybe two or three blacks there.  They asked me why, why is this?  That same question.  And I said, well, to be honest with you, blacks, in general sense, have turned their back on the blues.  This is the music that they don't want to hear.  That's why you don't--to answer your question about clubs here, all of the blues clubs used to be in, in the, what you called the area, the black sections of town.  But now, it's shifted.  All of the blues clubs are in the areas that's more populated with white people because they have--I hate, it's sad for me to say this, but they have a bigger appreciation for the blues than we do.  And it's our own heritage that we're turning our back on.  That's why I thank God for people like, like The HistoryMakers, like what you're doing.  It's, it's gonna be very enlightening to the black people because this is something--this is where we came from.  This is, this is our own heritage.  But we turned our back on it.  So I'm glad someone is bringing it to the light and saying, look at black heritage and the history of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you think it's because of the messages in the blues that black people don't listen to it or the style of music?  You think we've moved on to something else or what do you think it is that--?
Speaker 2: I think it's--.
Speaker 1: Why we don't--.
Speaker 2: I think it was stigmatized a long time ago to say, as being looked on as slave music or something.  I think that has something to do with it.
Speaker 1: A country, a countrified song?
Speaker 2: Yes, countrified, you know.  And I think they wanted to not identify with that.  This is my, my concept of it.  They wanted to identify with something that's more hip, more into the, like, say, hip-hop, and blah, blah, blah, you know.  But then, coming to realize, all the music that they, they are embracing all came from the blues (laughter).  It all came from the blues.
Story_ID: 5275
Speaker 1: Now, I've heard people say, say like Jimi Hendrix in the '70s [1970s] that he was really blues musician at heart.
Speaker 2: He was a blues musician, Jimi Hendrix, that's what he was, yeah.  And they just interviewed Carlos Santana, and there's a picture of him and I on the wall right here, Carlos Santana, they interviewed him a couple of days ago about all of the young people that's really looking up to him now.  And they asked him, why is this, like all the young hip-hop players, they really have a high respect for Carlos Santana.  And he simply said, well, what I'm doing, I'm just playing African music.  He said, what I'm playing is like Latin and African music.  He said, (laughter), it's the way--that's the diversion of it, but it's really African music, that it's Latin and African.  That was his own words.
Speaker 1: Right, right, and he was on T.V. this morning, he was on this morning.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this morning, yeah, with the Latin Grammys, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess--now, there have been like several attempts to--and there are several organizations in Chicago [Illinois] now that were founded to preserve the blues.  And Willie Dixon even founded the Blues Heaven.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Blues Heaven, yeah, yeah, Heaven Foundation.  I'm a member of that also, yeah, Blues Heaven Foundation.
Speaker 1: And I know that people like Billy Branch go out in the schools and--.
Speaker 2: Oh, he does, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and try to teach children about the blues.
Speaker 2: About the blues, yeah, he, yeah, he--we were just in England together a few days ago.  I was downstairs having breakfast, and down come, walks Billy Branch out of the, out of the, from upstairs in the hotel.  Yeah, we sat down and talked a long time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, on the bright side, I mean Chicago's got like, got a blues fest that attracts people from all over.
Speaker 2: Chicago Blues Festival, yes, I was on it this year, yeah.
Speaker 1: You were on the cover, in '96 [1996] you were on the cover of the magazine for the fest--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, for the festival.
Speaker 1: --and was a featured performer at the fest.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, with the headdress on and everything.
Speaker 2: For the whole bit, yeah (laughter).  Yeah, I was on it this year.  I almost, I almost got rained out this year, but I just finished my performance.  Then it started to pour down raining the first day of the festival.  But I finished just in, just before it started.
Speaker 1: What's your, what's the, what do you think the future of the blues is?  I know there're some young guys now playing--you've heard of Corey Harris?
Speaker 2: Corey Harris, yeah, oh, yeah.  See, I, he's, he's a folk player, yeah.
Speaker 1: He plays more of a folksy blues?
Speaker 2: Folk side, yeah, yeah, he's, he's good.  He--well, the acoustic stuff is coming back very strong now.  And that's where it started.  It's going back to the roots.  Yeah, there's a song on my new CD called 'Back Down to It,' you know.  It's about my home town in Mississippi.  It's in there, so that's where it's going, back to the roots.  And then just like when you transplant a flower, as it gets started, it's gonna grow all over again.  It's gonna escalate.  Yeah, it's gonna escal--it's my prediction, it's gonna really escalate because this is roots music.  It's music of the heart, music of the soul.
Story_ID: 5276
Speaker 1: When you look back at your songs, and the songs that you produced, liked do you have a favorite or some favorite tunes of your own?
Speaker 2: I, well, a couple of songs, 'Blues for Breakfast' from my '[The] Chief' CD is one of my favorites.  'Blues for Breakfast' and 'Find You a Job,' those are my--two of my other favorites and, and 'Came Up the Hard Way.'  It's, it's a real bluesy song, you know, 'Came Up the Hard Way.'
Speaker 1: Now, 'Came Up the Hard Way,' is that autobiographical in any way or is it just about--?
Speaker 2: Well, it's basically about my life from the South.  "I came up the hard way.  I had to work both night and day.  It's a shame that a po' man have to live this way; I came up the hard way.  I had to work from sun to sun.  It seems somehow, seems somehow or another, a poor man's work is never done."  So, it's one of my favorite songs.
Speaker 1: Okay, it tells your own story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's telling, it's about my life beginning.
Story_ID: 5277
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I hope that they come back in, in, in numbers and re-embrace the blues because B.B. King has been saying this for a long time, this is our heritage, and we should embrace it because if there's anything that's truly African American, it is the blues (chuckle), believe me.  And I just hope they come back in, in, in number and begin to support the blues again like it, like it used to be.  They really--like every, every blues club you used to go to would be crowded with, with black people, you know.  And that's how it should be because this is--I'm not saying that the white people should like it.  They have just as, right to--as much right to like it as anyone, but of all people, we should embrace who we are.  This is who we are.
Story_ID: 5278
Speaker 1: Do you ever get a chance to perform for a all-black audience or mostly black audience?
Speaker 2: Once in a while.  I did a college in Virginia, and I really enjoyed it a lots.  It was a pleasure for all blacks.  Plus, I, when I went to West Africa, I really had a great time there, you know.  It just--it was well accepted, well received.
Speaker 1: Are people there fairly knowledgeable about the blues (simultaneously)--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yeah, very knowledgeable.
Speaker 1: Okay, and there's even been a book.  And a man by the name of Samuel Charters, a black man wrote a book called 'The Roots of the Blues,' and he, he tried to show the relationship between some of the West African and Guinea coast string music, played on a chora and these other string instruments with the blues.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: A few years ago Taj Mahal was on the stage in, at Lincoln Center playing with a chora player.
Speaker 2: A chora player.
Speaker 1: And they were playing Honey--'Queen Bee'.
Speaker 2: Yeah, (laughter).
Speaker 1: With a chora, and you know, and a guitar, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I did a lot of workshop in Africa, and it was amazing some of the instruments that they have, and they get great sounds out of 'em.  It's really amazing, you know, it was just, it's just what they intermingle with 'em, it was great.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you--?
Speaker 2: I learned a lot just watching them, you know.
Speaker 1: Did you meet any of the West African guitar players in Africa?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I gave away guitar strings.  The United States government gave me like cases of strings, and I gave them to the African musicians, you know.  And Senator Paul Simon, before he passed away, that was one of the things that he, he--he set that whole thing up with the USIS [United States Information Service].  Yeah, that's one of the posters of Africa, West Africa.
Story_ID: 5279
Speaker 1: When you look back on all the things that you've done, is there anything that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I'd probably do more of what I've done.  I would probably be more, more persistent about it.  But I--I probably would take pretty much the same route, you know, I think.  Yeah, I think I would probably do the--basically, the same thing, but just with more, more courage, probably.
Story_ID: 5280
Speaker 1: Now, this club, we're in a club.  And it's not a huge club, but it's a very impressive place, a beautiful place.  When did you get the idea for opening up your own club [Reservation Blues]?  A lot of blues musicians don't have a club, you know, so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, this is something I've had in my mind for a long time.  I've always had the idea I wanted a place at home, where when I come home, if I don't want to tour, I can go and play and hang out with my friends, some of my musician friends and just have a good time.  So, like five years ago, we--I made the dream come true.  We just walked in and seen the place, we bought.  It was a dry, an old dry cleaners.  So we bought it and gutted it out, put in new floors, painted the ceiling gold.  We wanted to keep the old ceiling and just bought this bar from a church.  It was just sitting in the basement of a church.  And we bought it and refinished it and put it in.
Speaker 1: From a church, huh?  That's a Saturday night, Sunday morning.
Speaker 2: There you go (laughter).  There--that's right (laughter).  So we was fortunate enough to get it.  And we just bought the building.  There's an apartment upstairs, and we have a lot of fun in here.
Speaker 1: It's really a beautiful place.  I mean a lot of beautiful stained glass, and you've got the Indian motif everywhere.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, you know.
Speaker 1: Since you started this, the Indian motif has attracted a lot of people.  I mean have any American Indians, I mean Native Americans actually approached you about the--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah, patronize the place, yeah, absolute--quite a few, yes.  As a matter of fact, we had a band come in, a Native American band come in from South Dakota.
Speaker 1: Do they play the blues?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah, they play.  They had a girl singing with 'em, and they played--they're called Soul Kitchen.  They came in, and had a very good time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's an interesting story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we have a good time here.  A lot of my friends play here like Lonnie Brooks, Phil Guy, Buddy Guy's brother, Phil Guy, he plays here.  Jimmy Johnson, also Ronnie Baker Brooks, Lonnie Brooks' son, he plays here.  And Robert Lockwood, Jr., he played here.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you've been open about five years?
Speaker 2: About five years, yes.
Story_ID: 5281
Speaker 1: When you look back on your career--and I know it's still going on, but I mean what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh, I would, I would have to say my--did you mean my legacy, well, it's, it's--I don't, I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: I guess in terms in terms of like what do you think you've left behind, you know, for other people.
Speaker 2: Well, I would hope, like some of my songs that I've written, that's what I was trying to think of, that maybe, that maybe some of my songs will, will stick to someone and someone else will record 'em like--a few people have recorded some of my songs, which is a very good feeling.  And I would just want to leave something for the future, for the, for the upcoming generations to grasp onto and say, well, this was written by Eddy Clearwater, you know, so, as opposed to just being a performer, I want to leave something for the generations that's gonna come along.  Just like what, what Robert Johnson did.  He had no idea that his legacy would be as big as it is now.  He had no idea.
Speaker 1: I mean you have a bigger idea.  And you have more of an idea that what you're doing is being collected and preserved and people are scrutinizing it and comparing you to other people and that it's gonna have a place in history on some level, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in history.  Yeah, I'm hoping--you, that's why I was saying earlier, I want to give as much back as I can.  Like the [Delta] Blues Museum in Clarksdale [Mississippi] asked me for something for the museum, and so I'm putting together something to give to the museum for them to keep and put it on, put it on display because I hope to enlighten as many people--mainly the younger people, to become interested in the blues and take a part in it because, believe me, I got a lot from people like B.B. King.
Story_ID: 5282
Speaker 1: I went, I once went to the Regal Theater [Chicago, Illinois] to see B.B. King perform.  And he was on a show with Jackie [Sonny] Wilson.  And when B.B. King came out, they booed him, and he went backstage and broke down and cried, cause they, they didn't want to hear B.B. King.  They wanted to hear Jackie Wilson with the fancy stuff.  And I, I knew then that--I said, this is gonna last.  I said, this, I knew this, because this man has got something that's very solid.  The younger people just hadn't, they couldn't open their eyes at the time and see, hey, this, this, this man is representing us, representing who we really are.  And--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it must have been a--that's a moment you don't hear that much about.  But that's a, that's a real--you know, he, he performed for The HistoryMakers last fall.
Speaker 1: Last fall, yeah, that's, that's the one I had to miss cause I was out of town, and there was, there was no way I could juggle my schedule, but my wife [Renee Greenman] came.  She was there.  She took a picture with him, yeah.  She was, she went, came to represent me and to The HistoryMakers cause I couldn't make it.
Speaker 2: Well, things kind of turned around, I guess for him, you know, from those days.
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh, absolutely, oh, oh, yeah.  Now, he's idolized all over the world, you know.
Speaker 2: Now, are things--did things ever get that bad in the South, where a person like B.B. King would be ignored or shoved aside down South, I mean cause we--?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, right.  There, there was an occasion where he went--he was traveling and his bus broke down.  And he went into this one restaurant, which was all-white restaurant, and he was very fearful at first.  But then the owner of the restaurant recognized him.  He said, this--that's B.B. King and his band.  He told him, y'all come on in.  He brought 'em in and gave him a table to sit down, and whatever he wanted to eat, get it, you know.  And this was right during the segregation.  They treated him royal because they found out who he was.  You know, they said, that's B.B. King, you know, and he told them the story, his bus had broke down.  And he was, so then they gave him royal treatment, but, yeah, he was, he was shoved aside a lot, you know, he really--better believe it, yeah, went through a lot.
Speaker 2: I'm asking like if black people in the South actually, were ever at a point where they didn't want to hear the blues?  Or they, did they kind of set him aside?
Speaker 1: Well, the black people, you mean?
Speaker 2: In the South, yeah.
Speaker 1: In the South.
Speaker 2: Yeah, cause I know in the North there's a tendency to say, well, that's country music, you know, we don't want to--.
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah, I, I don't think, I think the South has always embraced him because he, he was the son of the South.  And he was a, like a, a real king down there.  He was like--cause he's from, being from around Memphis [Tennessee] and the whole bit, he's, he's always been idolized a lot.
Speaker 2: Okay, so they never got that far.
Speaker 1: No, never, not, not that I ever heard of.  No, he, he's always been looked up to.  Yeah, he's a, he's a king, he's a hero down there (laughter) in, in every sense of the word.

Speaker 1: Did your uncle [Houston Harrington], you know, get a chance to see you become a star?
Speaker 2: No, he--I wished he'd a seen me after I really started to travel and, you know, to Europe and places.  He never--unfortunately, he never got to, to see it blossom to that extent, you know.  I wish he had of.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there anything I haven't mentioned that you think you need to tell us, that--anything I haven't asked that--and that goes too, if he--I know he has a question.  I know he must have one.
Speaker 2: No, that's okay.  I'm fine.
Speaker 1: No, I, I think you probably covered everything except I'm working on a new album right now.  I'm just working on some songs for the new CD, and I, I want to add a couple of gospel songs, you know.  That's part of my, my upbringing, and I definitely--certainly will never overlook that because that's where I came from, a very humble beginning.  And my grandparents [Jim and Ida Harrington], like I said, they were very ligious--very religious and, and that's, that's part of me that will always be within me.  So I want to express that, just like I expressed on the last CD, some of my rockabilly side.  So I want to express the gospel on my upcoming project.
Speaker 2: Okay, the last question is, sir, how would you--similar to legacy, but different, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 1: As a very kind person, always wanting to give as opposed to always wanting to receive.  I, I want to be remembered as a person that would always go as far as I can go to, to give and extend to someone that needs, needs something that maybe I could provide.  And I want to be remembered as a giver, not a taker.

Speaker 1: Tell us this B.B. King story.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It came to my head.  We was going to a concert.  So his bus broke down.  He had a flat tire.  So naturally, he got there late.  The place was like jammed with people.  He got there way late because he had a flat tire.  So he walked in, and he said to the promoter, I, I had flat, you know, that's why I'm late.  So the promoter said, well, you know, you're late, I can't, I can't pay you for your performance because you're late getting here.  So he didn't--and B.B. King, he didn't argue with the guy.  He's such, he's such, such a good-natured guy.  He's very easy going.  He said, ah, okay, I understand.  I'm late getting here.  And the people were saying, ah, B.B., are you gonna play for us?  And so B.B. said, well, I'll tell you what, hook my, hook my band up.  He said, I'll play a couple of songs.  He got up played for two or three songs, and then he got on the, got on the microphone and announced, well, you all can get your money back now, cause I, I was late getting here, so I'm not gonna perform.  So get your money back (laughter).  And everybody started going up to the promoter.  The promoter went to B.B. and say, come on, here, I, I'll give your money.  Go ahead and play (laughter).  He just politely announced, well, y'all can get your money back now cause I was late getting here, and the promoter, he's not gonna pay me.  So naturally, you know, I can't play the show (laughter).  So that ended that (laughter).  He say, they hurried--he hurried up and gave him his money (laughter).
Speaker 1: Have you ever had an incident like that in your band where you had a--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've had some similar things happen, you know, where guys get--he's gonna think of a slick way to get out of paying you, you know, and things like that happen.  But he--and B.B. was just as smart as he was.  Well, he just played just enough to get 'em interested in him playing, when he, he knew they wanted to hear him play more than two songs, and he, "Y'all can get your money back now" (laughter).  That ended that.  "No, here, here's your money" (laughter).

Speaker 1: I didn't ask you who were, any protégés, you know, people that you had helped, that were coming up--up and coming musicians?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, Will Crosby, I helped him in blues when he started.  He, he had never been into the blues and was a good guitar player.  So I took him in, and took him with me for a while, and then he got good enough to go out--and he, he plays with Mavis Staples now.  Yeah, him, and a few other people I've helped out.
