I taught nurse's aides and I retired from there two years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay and you were also--
Speaker 2: I also was a member of The Velvelettes.  We've been together on and off for many years, I can't even remember.  In the beginning we broke up, I think it was '86 [1986] when we finally got back together and we've been together ever since.

Story_ID: 656951
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we always ask that only require a short answer. They're kind of like a warm up.  The first one is: do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, my favorite food--and that's because I'm on this continual diet--baked chicken breast and green beans.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Navy blue and silver
Speaker 1: Okay, a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I like the springtime and I like the fall, I don't like it when it's really hot and really cold.
Speaker 1: A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada].
Speaker 1: And the last one is: do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I do have a phrase, one of them is chickey do, and I'm trying to think what the other one is, we'll come back to that, but chickey do and that, that's not meant as a negative.
Story_ID: 656952
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family first and then your father's side and then we'll put them together.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Dora Ress Gill [Dora McDonald Gill], her maiden name was McDonald.
Speaker 1: And can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: D-O-R-A, Ress, R-E-S-S, and then G-I-L-L--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --slash McDonald, that was her maiden name, M-C-D-O-N-A-L-D.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: March--I want to say it's March 12th; I've got her obituary and I think I have it on one of those sheets that you have, I can't remember.  She was born in like the 1920s, '21 [1921].
Speaker 1: Okay that's good enough, circa 1921.
Speaker 2: I think.
Speaker 1: And well, and where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in, if I'm not mistaken, Rankin County, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: And what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How bar- how far back can you trace them first of all and what were they doing?  Are there any stories about them?
Speaker 2: Well I do remember years ago when I was maybe in kindergarten, my grandmother [Lizzie McDonald], my mom's mother came up to babysit 'cause my mother was in the hospital with a kidney problem.  She used to send me sugar cane up in a box, it was a Christmas gift.  I used to love to eat sugar cane.  I was born down there, but my parents moved to Kalamazoo [Michigan] when I was two and we never went back down there until I graduated from high school [Kalamazoo Central High School, Kalamazoo, Michigan] in 1960.
Speaker 1: Now is this the part of Mississippi where they grow sugar cane?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay because they don't do it all over.  So this is down towards the gulf [Gulf of Mexico]? Or--
Speaker 2: Well my grandmother lived in Brandon [Mississippi] out in the country and they had sugar cane out there, I guess or she went and bought it.  I never found out where she got it from. But she would send sugar cane and I can remember it was so hard to pull the outer section of the sugar cane off because all you could do--you could just suck it.  You didn't eat it or swallow it, it was a matter of sucking the husk or whatever form it came in and I do remember that.  I know when I went down there in 1960; I can remember my parents got me a typewriter for graduation.  My dad [Willie Gill], as a matter of fact, when you came in you may have seen this little car sitting underneath my television and that's the car that we--that's the type of car that we--it was a station wagon. And we drove down all seven of us kids and my mom and dad. And I can remember going down south and along the way stopping at the bathroom and there were bathrooms that said white only.  Well I couldn't wait so I went in that bathroom.  The people there were very upset with me, so my dad rushed me back in the car and took off and finished going down south.  When I went down there in 1960, it was probably not a very good experience for me because I had no clue what an outhouse was.  Had no clue what it was to have a sign that says white only.  So that was very, very horrible to even see those signs down there even in the '60s [1960s].  But see the '60s [1960s] was the year that discrimination was addressed, segregation was addressed and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  So that era was a big era but I was not involved in any of that in school at all.  My brothers who later were involved at the school and particularly at the colleges there because there was just so much going on at that time. And I didn't have privy to be involved with that because I ultimately got married and moved to Flint [Michigan].
Story_ID: 656953
Speaker 1: Okay now I don't want to cover too much territory in this--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) but I just wanted to ask you--I wanted to find out what you knew about the ancestors on your mother's [Dora McDonald Gill] side.  So your mother's parents--you knew your grandparents.
Speaker 2: No, I just knew my grandmother, never met my grandfather [Willie McDonald (ph.)].  He was killed by a horse at the age of thirty from what I was told, thirty-five somewhere around there and I think they were of Indian [Native American] descent but I'm not quite sure, I'm not clear on that because they didn't really discuss a lot of that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your grandmother's name was what?
Speaker 2: Lizzie McDonald.
Speaker 1: And your grandfather?
Speaker 2: I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay and they were--I suppose they were farmers, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you know if they owned their own land?
Speaker 2: I don't--I think they did because my--yeah I think they did, I'm not quite clear on that.  I do know that my grandmother's--my mother's sister, she and her husband owned about thirty acres, maybe about a hundred acres and sold some of it but a lot of them just sort of inherited their land after years and years but nobody ever went into that.  I know they had outhouses and I hated, hated, hated going down there.
Speaker 1: So as far as you know your mother's family had been in Mississippi a long time?
Speaker 2: Oh definitely yes.
Speaker 1: So it goes all the way back to pre-Civil War?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah and I'm sure they came up during the slavery era too because that's what was going on down there at that time.
Speaker 1: Right so di- are there any stories about slavery in your family?
Speaker 2: Not really, they just talked about working farms and working crops and having their crops working on a farm where they took care of the crops and made sure that they came in and they had to pay, if I'm not mistaken, they had to produce so many bales of whatever that they got and turn it over to whoever owned the land.
Speaker 1: Okay so they--
Speaker 2: I don't think they really owned the land, I think they just worked on the land.
Speaker 1: So this was like sharecropping?
Speaker 2: Sharecropping yes, yes I have, I have heard that's what they did back then.
Speaker 1: Some people are doing it now too (laughter) there, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so your mother, she--did she have any stories growing up?
Speaker 2: Not a whole lot.  They didn't talk a lot about growing up down south.  They talked about the number--she had quite a few brothers and sisters and they all lived in the country and they all like walked to school.  But back then I think the highest grade that a lot of them went to was like sixth grade and then they eventually moved away from there.
Story_ID: 656954
Speaker 1: I know my dad [Willie Gill] was in Kalamazoo [Michigan] first and sent for my mom [Dora McDonald Gill]. This is after they got married. But I was born down South and I do remember coming up here when I was very, very young.  I remember vaguely the first apartment that we lived in.  We had an aunt that lived here and everybody that came from down south stayed with her until they got settled.  My dad had brothers and sisters who eventually came up too.
Speaker 2: So was the aunt the first one to come up to Kalamazoo?
Speaker 1: I think my aunt yes was the first one, my Aunt Eunice [Eunice Gill] and then my dad came and then my dad's other brother came but I think he settled in Detroit [Michigan].  Then the other two brothers came to Kalamazoo.
Speaker 2: Now it may sound like I'm asking for insights into the obvious but did you get the feeling that they wanted to get out of Mississippi?
Speaker 1: Oh definitely. They wouldn't talk about it.  I know we went down there when I graduated from high school [Kalamazoo Central High School, Kalamazoo, Michigan]. We stopped at a hardware store.  My brothers wanted to buy a little pocket knife and the guy that owned the hardware store refused to sell the pocket knife to them.  Then I was told do not get out of the car because I had a pair of shorts on and I was just out of high school.  Black women could not walk the streets with a pair of shorts on.  I don't know, my dad never told me he just said, "Do not get out of the car with your shorts on."  This was in Brandon [Mississippi] and I go back there today and it's totally different.  I've been down there several times 'cause my mom has one living sister; she's a hundred an- she's a hundred now in a nursing home.  I go down there and see her and it's totally different.  They treat you totally--I mean it's totally opposite than I remember.
Speaker 2: What a way to live when you think about it that a black woman wearing shorts is subject to be attacked and it would have been nothing that her male relatives could do about it that would not cost them their life.  That's why that's so--
Speaker 1: And that was not explained to me.  I asked, "Well why?" And he said, "Don't ask, just get back in the car," so I did.
Speaker 2: So I guess to explain something like that to a child is a--
Speaker 1: I was nineteen.
Speaker 2: Nineteen, yeah.
Speaker 1: I wasn't a child. Yeah. I was eighteen or ninet- well I gradua- this was when I graduated from high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah it's interesting what people will not tell you.
Speaker 1: I think I was eighteen, sev-
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think I was eighteen.
Story_ID: 656955
Speaker 1: So your mother [Dora McDonald Gill] came up after your father [Willie Gill] came up. And--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --was your mother able to--you said--was she a-, was she able to go very far in school?
Speaker 2: She--both my parents went to sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: After moving to Kalamazoo [Michigan] my mother and my dad had a cleaning service and that's what they did, but my dad also worked at a place called Ingersoll [Ingersoll-Rand plc] that made tanks for the [U.S.] Army.  My mother cleaned a few houses 'cause I used to go with her.  She went up by the campus and cleaned a lot of the professors' homes, et cetera and I did that for a while and I hated it, hated it.  And of course being the age that I was that's just not what I wanted to do.  Then my mother--when they--when the civil service exams came into play where you could get a job as a civil service employee, she took the class and did her high school thing there.  Took the class, passed the test and she started working as a nursing attendant with the Kalamazoo State Hospital [Kalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital, Kalamazoo, Michigan]. And she worked there for about seventeen years until she--she came out on disability because she had a heart valve problem.  And my dad--
Story_ID: 656956
Speaker 1: Now, now let me--I'm going to ask you about him now, I'm going to leave your, your mother's [Dora McDonald Gill] story--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) where it is and I'm going to go to your father's side then we'll put them together and try to--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --pick it up.  But can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Willie Green Gill [Willie Gill].
Speaker 1: Well, can you spell it for us?  I know it seems--
Speaker 2: W-I-L-L-I-E.
Speaker 1: Okay. And Green G-E-R--G-R-E-E-N?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Gill, G-I-L-L.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His birth date is--I've got it written down there, I don't keep all that in my head.
Speaker 1: Is it is the 1920s?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were both born close together.  I think he is a few years older than my mom.
Speaker 1: And where was your father born?
Speaker 2: Bogue Chitto, Mississippi (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Boo--how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: I don't have no clue.
Speaker 1: Booker what?
Speaker 2: B-O-G-A-C-H-I-T-T-I-E [sic.].  You might want to check my record sheet (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Bogue Chitto?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Bogue Chitto, Mississippi (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Mississippi.  Um-hm.  I think.
Speaker 1: I hadn't heard of that.
Speaker 2: Because they talked about so many places down there.  Nobody had anything written down as to where they were born and what year.  They didn't have any of that stuff down there.  The only time I found out was when they passed and their birth certificates. Because my parents--they weren't forthright in giving us all that information at all.  It's like they didn't want anybody to know how old they were or when they were born, some people are like that today.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  So--
Speaker 2: I don't think they meant it in a negative sense at all by no means.
Speaker 1: Yeah I know what you mean that was that era and that's how people felt. And so the same question, like what can you tell us about the ancestors on your father's side, I mean the people that preceded him, his parents, his parents' parents? His parents' parents' parents?
Speaker 2: Well, on my dad's side his mother did move to Kalamazoo [Michigan] and--Grandma Della [Della Gill] was her name and I never knew my grandfather, her husband.
Speaker 1: Well was he--had he passed or anything?
Speaker 2: No, I guess he was--well he may have by the time--maybe that's why she moved up here, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Were there any stories about him or what his name was or anything (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nope.  I--no, I'm sure--oh I think his name was Willie [sic. Andrew Gill], he was a minister.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: As my dad was too.
Speaker 1: So Reverend Willie Green and your father was a junior?
Speaker 2: I don't--not back then (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay they just didn't recall him that then. All right. So somehow they split up and your grandmother moved to--
Speaker 2: She came to Michigan.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Kalamazoo. And--
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Stayed with her daughter [Eunice Gill].
Speaker 1: Now often, and I don't know if this is the case with your grandmother, but I've heard other stories where a female member of the family is taken by a white family they work for down south up to where they live up north or something.
Speaker 2: Oh I've never heard that story.
Speaker 1: They change residence or the white people would move up north and they move with them.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no I never heard that story.
Speaker 1: So is there another story about how she came to Kalamazoo?  Did she find out about a job (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I her--well I think her kids sent for her.
Speaker 1: Her kids were up here already?
Speaker 2: Yeah they were already here.
Speaker 1: Okay I thought she was the first.
Speaker 2: No I think the kids came and then she--they got her--sent for her, she came out I think that's the way it happened.  Then her other kids subsequently--a lot of them were already here 'cause I remember my grandmother was with us at one point.  I don't know how long, I was real young, I don't, I don't, I don't remember all that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause we were just too young.
Speaker 1: I mean to Flint [Michigan]--did they move to Kalamazoo, or--?
Speaker 2: Kalamazoo.
Speaker 1: I'm getting confused.
Speaker 2: We're in Flint right now, I moved here (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. We're talking about Kalamazoo.
Speaker 2: We're talking about Kalamazoo, yes.
Speaker 1: All right, so--
Speaker 2: And we had an aunt there.  Her home was another home when people came from down south.  She had a big, big house--rooming house and they moved in with her until they got settled. 'Cause the paper mill was there, Checker Cab [Checker Cab Manufacturing Company, Kalamazoo, Michigan] was there, the bakeries were there.  My dad ended up being a baker too as well.  I'm trying to think, Upjohn pharmaceutical company [Upjohn Company] was there too, but African Americans did not get jobs at Upjohn Pharmaceutical Company at all.  I remember 'cause it was right--not too far from where we lived.  The paper mill was not too far from where we lived. And we used to always wonder--I wonder what they make in there. And they were just like right around the corner from us.  So there were things still going, especially in the '60s [1960s], still discriminatory things going on back then (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  But, but there wa-, there wa-, there was a lot of economic activity in Kalamazoo.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 656957
Speaker 1: Okay, so your, your, your father [Willie Gill] went to like about sixth grade as well in--?
Speaker 2: I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think they started taking some classes after they--later on but I don't know when they did it.  I know my mom [Dora McDonald Gill] did 'cause she had to get the job and she couldn't get the job until she went through their--that process of passing certain exams and stuff to allow her to take a civil service test 'cause you could not do that back then--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --just go take it.
Speaker 1: Did your father have any stories about growing up?
Speaker 2: No they didn't talk about--now.
Speaker 1: Now was he a veteran?
Speaker 2: Oh no, he had a brother that was in the [U.S.] military and I think two brothers were in the military.  When he, he--when he first came to Kalamazoo [Michigan], I do remember where we first lived he opened up a restaurant.  His restaurant made the best hamburgers. I don't--I never worked there 'cause I was really young.  Then years later he opened up another restaurant that also had a bakery in back of it and then my brother [Richard Gill] eventually opened up two bakeries and--
Speaker 1: How did the family get involved in the bakery business?
Speaker 2: 'Cause my dad came here and learned the trade in a bakery.  He worked--always worked two jobs and he learned the trade in the bakery.  He basically ran the bakery with all the baked goods and then he got his own bakery--opened up his own bakery and then my brother opened up--
Story_ID: 656958
Speaker 1: Tell me what you know about the ancestors on your mother's [Dora McDonald Gill] side?
Speaker 2: I know that my mother's mother, Lizzie McDonald, was my grandmother and I never knew my grandfather [Willie McDonald (ph.)].  He was killed in his thirties riding a horse.  The horse fell off, kicked him and he had seizures or something and I just never heard that entire story.  And then I heard about the brothers and sisters that my mom had and they were all still in Mississippi.  My grandmother did come up here once, I do remember when my mom was very sick, and babysat my brother [Richard Gill] and I.  We were the two kids that my parents had that time.  But as far as any other relatives down there, I can't remember any of them coming up here during the time I was small.  But eventually her sisters, they started visiting back and forth each other and I can remember going down south with mom to visit her sister.  But this was way after like I got out of high school [Kalamazoo Central High School, Kalamazoo, Michigan].
Speaker 1: I think you were saying that they, they were--there was land acquired by the family but there was also sharecropping going on.
Speaker 2: Yes I think it was mostly sharecropping with them but they never really talked a lot about that.  I guess it was just so traumatic the things that went on when they lived there and they didn't share a lot of that with us.  Now my dad [Willie Gill], on the other hand, they had land.
Speaker 1: So I'm going to get to him in a minute, but, but your mother she was able to finish sixth grade--
Speaker 2: I think it was sixth grade.
Speaker 1: But then when she moved to Kalamazoo [Michigan] she's able to go further.
Speaker 2: Yes but--
Speaker 1: And to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) I don't know exactly what grade she finished because--we just knew she was in school and I can remember seeing her notes from class and then she went to get a job.  She started working at the Kalamazoo State Hospital [Kalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital, Kalamazoo, Michigan].  She took a civil service exam test and passed that to be employed and that's how she ended up being a nursing attendant at the Kalamazoo State Hospital.  'Cause I used to go up there and see her in these uniforms and I thought I'm going to have a uniform one day.
Speaker 1: Okay. Your mother, she didn't talk about growing up at all, going to school, what kind of school she went to--
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: --what her teachers were like, what life was like out there on the farm?
Speaker 2: One room classrooms--they didn't talk a lot about that not to me.  They didn't talk a lot about that to me 'cause I, I just--no.
Speaker 1: Did you get the impression that they wanted to go back one day to Mississippi?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. (Laughter) I ask this facetiously but I'm asking it because I want people who see this--
Speaker 2: I think a lot of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) two hundred years from now to understand--
Speaker 2: --a lot of them left to get out--to get away from the southern trends of discrimination, segregation, sharecropping, you know, so to speak.  But they would not elaborate and to deliberately bash someone, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  Their families were still down there.  Now all my mother's brothers and sisters stayed down there.  They eventually--some of them migrated to--the kids did--California.  I think we've got some cousins in Gary, Indiana.  I can't remember but there are a few other places where they are located.  But a lot of them eventually left. Some of them went back and some of them did not.  Some of them--the kids' kids like some of them are in Atlanta [Georgia], L.A. [Los Angeles, California] but the immediate family--my mom's immediate family, I think she had one brother who took his family to California and never came back.  They came back to visit but a lot of them just left.  Now my mother had a brother, he stayed down there, as a matter of fact, the street that he lived on they named it after him.
Speaker 1: In Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Mississippi and I go down there now and the name of that street is still there, McDonald Avenue is the name of the street.  The house is still there.  He's passed, his wife recently passed a few years ago.  And it's just unfortunate that some of the stories I hear with respect to what they used to do back in the day they would not go into detail.  They talked about the families that they worked for and who they washed clothes for, who they ironed clothes for well never doing that it just seemed odd but then you were told why, that's just the way of the world down there.  Some ti- some places down there are still like that.  People don't talk about it but I'm sure if you go to some of those little backwoods where some of those people still live 'cause I've been down there and I've seen places where they live.  I see little groups of homes all bunched up together and just the African American community and they are all in their little spot and they go beyond that if they have a job but they come right back to that spot and they don't seem to be progressing at all with anything.  So I never wanted to live down there at all.
Story_ID: 656959
Speaker 1: Now let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Willie, W-I-L-L-I-E, Green, G-R-E-E-N, Gill [Willie Gill].
Speaker 1: And now he's a reverend, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's a reverend (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) His father [Andrew Gill] was a reverend too.
Speaker 1: Okay. And, but he didn't go by the name of junior?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: What denomination was he a reverend of?
Speaker 2: Baptist
Speaker 1: All right, now what is your dad's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I think his birthday is in--I think I said November but I think his birthday is in December.  I think it's Bogue Chitto, Mississippi I think.  I've got his--both my parents' obituary and I think I put them in your little sheet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On your information (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So B-O-G-A-C-H-I-T-T-I-E [sic.]--
Speaker 2: Yeah
Speaker 1: --Mississippi.  Now is that a--you think that's an Indian [Native American] name?
Speaker 2: I don't have--I have no clue.
Speaker 1: Creole name? Or, I mean.
Speaker 2: I don't know. Nobody ever told me anything different.
Speaker 1: And where is it at?  Is it like southern Mississippi near Louisiana (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's not that far from--not that far from Jackson [Mississippi]
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's near Jackson.
Speaker 2: Everything was close around Jackson.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right, now, well once again like what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: I don't know--the only ancestor I know is my dad's mother [Della Gill] who did come to Kalamazoo [Michigan].  I never knew his father, I never even remember meeting him, and I don't think he ever came to Kalamazoo at all.  I've never seen him, I know nothing about him.  I do know that they had land down south that he acquired and it all eventually went to all of the brothers and sisters and then it then went to all of my brothers and sisters and my father's brothers' and sisters', their kids, it's just a whole bunch of kids who now have control of his property.  I know we pay taxes.  And it's just something about--one thing we did not know talking about owning the land.  You didn't own--was it mineral rights or oil rights?  If you owned the land there was something with the land that you did not own.
Speaker 1: It depends on what kind of contract you sign when you bought it, I guess.
Speaker 2: Well see I would--I have no clue.  There's something with respect to--yeah a lot of people down south had property but--
Speaker 1: You can sell the mineral rights to someone else.  You can do that so that--maybe that's what happened (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know how--
Speaker 1: If you own land you have the rights to it--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but there are certain rights you can sell off.
Speaker 2: And that may have been done, minerals rights may have been sold off because the people who were divvying for the mineral rights knew what that meant.  So if they struck oil which they thought there was oil on my folks', my dad's, my father's property.  But you know, what do they know about mineral rights, who explained it to them?  They probably explained it to them in a roundabout way so they didn't know what the hell they were talking about. So--
Speaker 1: And the money looked good at the time.
Speaker 2: Well yeah so--but I know the land that my dad was part of--lumber, timber.  Lumber was the trees big time.  Those trees paid the taxes for years and years and years and now all the trees are gone and it takes about twenty years for a tree to re-grow once they cut them down.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have to plant another one.
Speaker 2: So my brother used to go down there to see what the property looked like and one of the first things he mentioned was that there was no easement and that the property was divided by highway.  Part of it was here on this side of the highway and part of it was over here four lanes across the highway.  So I don't know what happened when all that was done because they would have had to gotten--well what is the other tool that they use when you've got property in the way of a highway, what do they call that?
Speaker 1: Eminent domain.
Speaker 2: Eminent domain that's how they got by with that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it's just sitting there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So they give you something--a bottom line, a figure for it--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and then take it.
Story_ID: 656960
Speaker 1: You were telling us off camera that your, your, your [paternal] grandfather, Reverend Willie Green [sic. Andrew Gill] as well, he was a Baptist minister too.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And he died young, is that true?
Speaker 2: He may have--my grandfather, I don't ever remember meeting him at all.  I know nothing about him other than his name and that he was a minister.  Now he also had a son that was a minister, Reverend Carl Gill, my dad's brother.  But he was a pastor of a church in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and then of course my dad [Willie Gill].  He founded Friendship Baptist Church.  They just did a fun- a benefit for him to recognize his fi- being the founder of Friendship Baptist Church in Kalamazoo [Michigan].  He started it in the same building where he used to have his restaurant.  When the restaurant closed the building was just empty but my aunt [Eunice Gill] owned all of that property there so he started Friendship Baptist Church.  And all seden- seven of us kids had to get up every Sunday morning, go to church and I was the piano player, my brothers and sisters was the choir.
Story_ID: 656961
Speaker 1: So, so when your father [Willie Gill] came up, he came up as a teenager or as an adult (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He came up married--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to Kalamazoo [Michigan] first and then my mother [Dora McDonald Gill] and I came later.
Speaker 1: All right, now is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: No if it is I'm not aware of it.
Speaker 1: Now they did live in the same town, right?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I think they worked sharecropping, I think they worked on somebody's farm 'cause they didn't have no way to get to--they didn't have no nightclubs, little juke joints back then.  I mean they may have but they didn't have any transportation, to walk.
Speaker 1: Except to walk, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, so either it had to be like a church--some local church in the area or--
Speaker 1: So they never had a story about how they met or who introduced them or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, unh-uh. If they did I don't remember.  I know my mother had two sisters that married two brothers and my mom married my dad and I was born thereafter and then she had my brother [Richard Gill].  My brother was born in Jackson, Mississippi and I was born in Brandon [Mississippi].  So they did move to Jackson and that was probably for him to get work and then from there moved to Kalamazoo.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Came on--'cause I can remember being on the train my mother telling me these stories, I don't remember it. We came up on a train to Kalamazoo.
Story_ID: 656962
Speaker 1: So the story is that your father [Willie Gill] came up and his aunt had a boarding house already (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)Yes.
Speaker 1: --already here.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Aunt Ollie [Eunice Gill], um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she had a house in back of her house and she rented rooms there and she rented rooms in her house.  And she was like the matriarch of the Sutton [ph.] family 'cause we were related to them too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she was my dad's aunt or we call her Aunt Ollie, I don't know if she was biological aunt or not, I never asked before it never was--that issue never came up.  But there's a--they are our third cousins, the Suttons are in Kalamazoo [Michigan].
Speaker 1: So you father eventually worked for Ingersoll [Ingersoll-Rand plc], right?
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: That--it's a company that makes tanks.
Speaker 2: Tanks for the [U.S.] Army.  That was like in the '40s [1940s] I would think or before that 'cause I was born in '41 [1941], he was I think already working there.
Speaker 1: So did he work for them his whole life?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I think after that he also sold insurance on the side then he started working for the bakery because I know he got laid off.  When was Pearl Harbor [Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii] bombed, was that '41 [1941]?
Speaker 1: Right
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): December 7th.
Speaker 1: Everybody was without a job.  I remember that. When Pearl Harbor was bombed stuff just happened for the worst and I think he got laid off after all that.  I don't know, I don't know all the details of that but I know he used to work for Ingersoll and they made tanks.  I think he worked for Checker Cab [Checker Cab Manufacturing Company] for--well I don't know if he worked Checker Cab but Checker Cab was in Kalamazoo too.  I can't remember if he worked for Checker Cab or not, I don't think so.  I think it was all Ingersoll and then he started working for the bakery, Reese's Bakery [ph.]. But there was another one prior to that.  But then my mom [Dora McDonald Gill] and dad had a cleaning business.  They cleaned restaurants and homes at night.  They'd do the restaurants at night after they closed and they would do homes while the people were at work.  My mom did, my dad didn't and I know I went with her a couple of times to clean a few homes but I didn't like that 'cause I wanted to do other stuff, I was in high school [Kalamazoo Central High School, Kalamazoo, Michigan] then.
Story_ID: 656963
Speaker 1: Let's see they--so can you tell us--when you think about your parents' per- personalities, their dispositions, their, their talents, what they look like and how they walk and how they talk, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I probably took features after my mom [Dora McDonald Gill] but I was more like my dad [Willie Gill].  I was always busy with something, always worked two jobs.  He worked two jobs and I probably picked that up from him.  My mom never worked two jobs at one time and I always liked to get involved with stuff at the church [Friendship Baptist Church, Kalamazoo, Michigan] 'cause I was his running buddy when we would go to church.  He'd take me out of town to church and I would get to meet the chur- the other ministers' sons but I was so young, I just enjoyed going and visiting different churches' revival meetings.  We went to different churches in different towns for their revivals and then those ministers would come to Kalamazoo [Michigan].  And when my dad had his own church, then I had to play the piano for the choir and the only songs we sang were the music out of the hymn books because I couldn't play by ear, I had to play by music.  I took piano lessons for about six years and I took voice for about four or five years while I was in high school [Kalamazoo Central High School, Kalamazoo, Michigan].  But I hung out with him, always wanting to go somewhere or do something.  My mother was more of a homebody, cooking and cleaning and ironing and washing and doing this and I didn't really want to do all that stuff.  So I kept busy, I was--I got involved, I was a girl scout, I joined the Y [Young Men's Christian Organization], I just joined stuff but I had to walk a lot of times to these places.  So I didn't have a lot of transportation, never rode the city bus. Walked.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My parents didn't have a lot of money.
Story_ID: 656964
Speaker 1: There were seven--I was the oldest of seven kids, so.
Speaker 2: Now can you name your, your brothers and sisters for us starting with--now you're the oldest, right?
Speaker 1: I'm the oldest.
Speaker 2: Okay and--
Speaker 1: Richard [Richard Gill] is next.
Speaker 2: Okay and tell us a little something about each one.
Speaker 1: Richard is a year younger than me.  He retired when he was fifty, his job--just quit.  He was a marketing supervisor at a company in Kalamazoo [Michigan].  They offered him another job to move out, move, move, take your family and move, he wouldn't do that.  He graduated from high school, he took some additional classes at the local college, I can't remember what but it was tied up with his job.  Then he married a girl young.  His wife [Sylvia Fisher Gill] was a registered nurse, she graduated from Nazareth but she died three years ago.  So he's having a really, really tough time right now.  My brother Charles [Charles Gill] graduated from--he went Western [Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan] but he graduated from Nazareth College in Kalamazoo the same place where my brother's wife graduated from 'cause it was an all-girls school and then they went coed.  He lives in Bloomingdale, Michigan.  He's married, he's has one daughter who lives in Albuquerque--Alto, New Mexico.  He worked--he has--his degree is in social, he was a probation officer for the City of Kalamazoo.  Then I have a sister, Carol [HistoryMaker Cal Street].  She recently retired from Western by way of Upjohn [Upjohn Company]. She lives in Kalamazoo, she lives in my parents' [Dora McDonald Gill and Willie Gil] home that she acquired several, many years ago and she's retired.  Billy [Billy Gill] my other brother who is under Carol lives in Farmington Hills [Michigan].  He retired a few years ago, assistant principal of Kettering High School in Detroit [Michigan] and his wife retired from Ford Motor Company, executive assistant for the president, one of the vice presidents there. And they just moved to Farmington Hills after they retired.  Sold their home, they live in a gated community now.  My brother Roger [Roger Gill] works at Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] still he hasn't retired yet, he will be soon.  He's got quite a few years in there.  He lives, still lives in Kalamazoo.  He's not married, has no kids and he's getting ready to retire pretty soon.  I don't know exactly when but he's gonna, he's thinking about it.  Then my younger sister Gwen [Gwendolyn Gill (ph.)] worked at Brown Company [ph.].  I think they made parts for General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] if I'm not mistaken.  Her and my sister both went to a business college.  I don't--I can't remember when but I know my younger sister moved here and went to school here for a little bit here in Flint [Michigan] and she moved back to Kalamazoo.  She got married and moved back to Kalamazoo and her job--everybody cut everybody so she's now on a different job.  I can't remember--I want to say she works in a nursing home, I'm not sure.  She controls the activity department or something to that effect, I'm not quite clear on that as to what she does right now, administrative assistant or something to that degree.  Then I'm here (laughter) and I've been here.  I got married to Bertha's [HistoryMaker Bertha McNeal] next door neighbor, believe it or not and this is where I ended up and I'm still here.
Speaker 2: In, in Flint.
Speaker 1: In Flint (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, yeah.
Story_ID: 656965
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness. Yes.  One of them, when I was--and I don't know how I remember this.  I was in either the first--I think it was the first grade or second grade I got lost coming home from school [Lincoln Elementary School' Lincoln International Studies School, Kalamazoo, Michigan] and a lady picked me up, I have no clue as to who this woman was, but she knew who I was and she brought me home to my folks [Dora McDonald Gill and Willie Gill].  I still to this day do not know who the person was that picked me up and brought me home.  That was a very, very scary moment.  It would have been scarier now because people pick up kids now and you don't see them again.  And then there was another--my uncle, my dad's brother used to come to the house and tease us a lot.  He would chase us sometimes through the house and I can remember him--I don't know if I was upstairs--I think we were upstairs and he was tickling us or something and I was running away from him and I went to the top of the stairs and I tried to run down the stairs and I fell, busted my lip, blood was everywhere.  I, I was--it just hurt too much.  I never ran up and down the stairs after that.  It taught me a lesson but it also taught him a lesson, don't play with kids on the stair step, don't play with anybody on the stair step.  I've got two grandkids and every once and a while I'll hear them go thump, thump and I thought, oh boy get off the steps, you cannot do that.  But that, that was memorable. And another memorable time was when I learned how to drive a car (laughter) and I can remember I snuck the car out and it got hit, but I brought it back home, put it in the driveway, put the keys back in my dad's pocket and went to bed, never told him.  He died not knowing to this day and the next day he says, "Mildred [HistoryMaker Mildred Gill Arbor] did you have a car--," what did, what did he say? "Did you take the car out?" Or something to that effect. And he said, "It looks like it got hit."  I said, "Well I don't--," I think he knew that time I got the car out.  So he asked me a question and I said, "Well no I parked on such and such side of the street."  He said, "It couldn't have been because the hit is on the other side" (laughter) so he caught me.  Never said anything and I said, "Well I don't know somebody had to hit it."  But I know one time I took the car, he didn't know and you know how you have these semi-trucks that were backing up to drop their goods off and all these cars were waiting on both ends of the street.  So I decided, oh he's pulling up, I'm going to have time to shoot by.  Well when I went to shoot by the semi backed up and hit the side of the car and I was so upset.  I went home, put the keys back in his pocket, got in the bed and pretended like I didn't know nothi- didn't know nothing; I was scared to death to this day.  Those were memor- rememor- you know, memorable times.

Speaker 1: What are some of the sights, and sounds and smells of growing up?  Now did your neighborhood have a name in Kalamazoo [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Or was it a certain side of town?
Speaker 2: Well we lived on the north end of town.
Speaker 1: Okay now was this a traditional (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The east side of town was the bad side of town, I heard that.
Speaker 1: Okay well what side of town--or what sides of town were traditionally be the African American sides--
Speaker 2: North.
Speaker 1: North side.
Speaker 2: Well it wasn't originally but it soon became--a lot of African Americans lived on the north end of town.  Just like here [Flint, Michigan]. But all cities are not like that.  'Cause then in Chicago [Illinois] it's different (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sometimes the south side, west side, east side, it's always one side.
Speaker 2: Yes there was the east side of town, my parents [Dora McDonald Gill and Willie Gill] did not allow me on the east side of town.  I never knew why but then I found out (laughter).
Speaker 1: What was it?
Speaker 2: Well they had a club over there, they did numbers.  Remember the numbers back in the day, I guess they still do those now. And there was just some--I wasn't allowed to go to any clubs at all.  I was only allowed to go to church and school and don't get caught at a house party. I had to sneak to those when I became, you know high school [Kalamazoo Central High School, Kalamazoo, Michigan] age.
Speaker 1: Okay so what about sights, sounds?
Speaker 2: Well the only sounds that I can remember waking up in the morning, the next door neighbors had chickens (laughter) and I remember listening to chickens cackling and I remember the neighbors giving us chickens.  I remember the neighbors wringing the necks off the chickens to kill the chickens and then they would have the nerve--we had to clean the feathers off.  Oh no, oh no don't bring stuff.  My dad made us do that.  I used to have to clean fish, I hated fish.  My dad would catch a hundred fish, bring those fish home and I'd hear, "Mildred [HistoryMaker Mildred Gill Arbor] got to come clean these fish."  Oh I hated it, hated it, hated it.  I had to scale them, cut their heads off, oh that was just gross to me that's why I don't deal with fish today.  It has to be cooked, already done; I don't clean nobody's fish.
Speaker 1: Now was there a, was there a black business district in Kalamazoo?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Were you had beauty shops and barber shops and churches and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We had--yeah and they were all on the north end of town.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had a beauty shop that I used to go to.  There was a black restaurant. That was the o- oh no there was two 'cause I think on the east side of town is where you found a lot of black businesses more so and then they sort of migrated to the north end of town.  I used to work at the restaurant in the winter time after high school.  In the summertime when school was out, I worked across the street at Tastee-Freez that was owned by Caucasians and they hired me and I think I can remember making like ninety cents an hour or something like that.  Then I thought okay the beauty shops--some people had beauty shops in their homes, they did beauty shops in their home but we had this one beauty shop that was well known in Kalamazoo.  I can't remember the name of it but I used to go to get my hair done when I could afford it.  Because I--when I started working my parents couldn't afford to--every time I wanted some clothes or whatever, they couldn't afford to do that all the time.  So I--I started working when I was like thirteen, fourteen babysitting.
Speaker 1: So was there a black theater on the--
Speaker 2: No we just went to the theater but it wasn't black owned.
Speaker 1: Okay. Was there a place for black entertainment to perform in Kalamazoo live?
Speaker 2: There was a couple of places, the Armory [ph.] and the--but that was later on in years.
Speaker 1: I'm talking about when you were growing up.
Speaker 2: Yeah when I was--I do remember going to the Armory.  There were Bobby "Blue" Bland [Bobby Bland], I went to see him.  I'm trying to think who else I went to see coming up there wasn't a whole lot 'cause we--our parents wouldn't let us go to stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I had to wait until I was almost grown.
Story_ID: 656967
Speaker 1: So you spent a lot of time in church--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --grow- growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, BYPU [Baptist Young People's Union of America], usher board and we had prayer meeting at our house every Thursday 'cause my dad [Willie Gill] was minister. And choir--I was in the choir, usher board, BYPU.  We had to be at church every Sunday.  If we went anywhere Saturday, we had to go to church Sunday morning but our punishment was if you screwed up, you weren't going to go to church that was our punishment 'cause we loved to go to church.  'Cause my dad was associate pastor at the church that's still there right now.
Speaker 1: Okay did he have a pretty big church?
Speaker 2: Not in the beginning, oh no.  You know when you start off churches you don't--but now Friendship [Friendship Baptist Church, Kalamazoo, Michigan] is huge.  A couple of the ministers took over 'cause my dad ended up also being a pastor out in Allegan [Michigan] in another church [Messiah Baptist Church] 'cause the minister out there passed.  My dad went out there and we used to have to drive to Allegan to church forty miles to church and I played the piano out there and my brothers and sisters sang in the choir.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So we followed suit and after a while I got tired of doing all that stuff.  'Cause after you get--as you get older and involved in other stuff, you want to do other stuff.
Story_ID: 656968
Speaker 1: Tell us about school.  Now, now where did you start school? What, what, what (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I started Lincoln Junior High--Lincoln Elementary School [Lincoln International Studies School, Kalamazoo, Michigan] from there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --went to junior high at Lincoln [Lincoln Junior High School, Kalamazoo, Michigan].
Speaker 1: And did you like school when you started school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: From Lincoln I went to--
Speaker 1: Were there any special teachers at Lincoln?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh Ms. Johnson [ph.] was my kindergarten teacher.
Speaker 1: And was the school like--did you have any black teachers?
Speaker 2: Very few. I think the shop teacher was black I think.  Very, very few, if any, and if they were they were like in the shop classes. It wasn't--we saw very few African Americans.
Speaker 1: Did you have anything that you kind of specialized in elementary school?  Were you good at math or some other skill?
Speaker 2: Well I just did what I had to do. But when I got to high school, I can remember taking algebra and geometry and I loved algebra, I didn't care too much for geometry.  And then I started singing in the choir in junior high school then it continued on. And I remember in junior high school the choir members were selected to go to somewhere in Ohio.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTPION)
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: What was the name of your junior high school?
Speaker 1: Lincoln.
Speaker 2: Okay now was the high school in the same place too?
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Elementary and high school, elementary was at one end of the building and the junior high section was at the other end of the building it went up to ninth grade.  So it was kindergarten to ninth grade.
Speaker 2: Okay then you went to another school altogether.
Speaker 1: Central High School [Kalamazoo Central High School, Kalamazoo, Michigan]
Speaker 2: Okay, all right so--you wan- you wanna pause here?
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: All right, so this is Lincoln Junior High School now in the same area but in a different building.
Speaker 2: Same building.
Speaker 1: Same building okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. The front part of the building was the elementary school from kindergarten to sixth grade and at the other end it was seventh to the ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay. So were there any particular teachers in junior highs school that you--
Speaker 2: Mr. Doyle [ph.] I think was my history teacher or English teacher.  I do remember him because he used to walk down the hall with these certain kind of shoes that guys wore back then. They looked like winged tipped, you know what I'm talking about.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But they had taps on the end of them.  So you always knew it was him coming down the hall and you better get in your seat.  Mrs. Bush [ph.] was my music teacher. I had a German teacher for geometry, I can't remember her name.  My gym teacher was--I can't remember her name.  But those that stood out were my music teacher, my kindergarten teacher.  I repeated kin--or was it first grade? I repeated one of those grades because my mother [Dora McDonald Gill] kept me out of school for thirty days because she was in the hospital and her mother [Lizzie McDonald] was in Kalamazoo [Michigan] babysitting.  She couldn't keep up getting us up and ready for school and taking us to school, she couldn't do that.  My dad [Willie Gill] was working so she just kept us home.  They have home school now that would not have happened if they had it back in the day but they didn't have that back in the day.  If you didn't go to school, they made you stay. They, they kept you, they made you repeat.  You couldn't miss over so many days of school. And I used to get teased about that a lot because I graduated a year older than the other kids did but, you know, after a while I didn't care after that.  So, and then after junior high then I started high school.
Story_ID: 656969
Speaker 1: Kalamazoo Central [Kalamazoo Central High School, Kalamazoo, Michigan] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay. Now were you involved in any clubs and social groups in school, or?
Speaker 1: Um-hm. When I was in high school I was a Girl Scout [Girl Scouts of the United States of America], I belonged to the Douglas Community Ceneter--Center [Douglas Community Association, Kalamazoo, Michigan] which had a basketball team I was on.  I was on the church softball team, I tried a little bit at tennis but that didn't work quite well.  I tried synchronized swimming in high school that did not work out well.
Speaker 2: Is there a story there somewhere?
Speaker 1: There is no story. You knew when you went in that you were not going to be part of the team.  I also tried out to be a cheerleader but you knew when you walked in that you were not going to be picked because they were all Caucasians.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I was the only African American both times so I just knew.
Speaker 2: Well what was the percentage or roughly, I know you don't know exactly but of the black students at the school?
Speaker 1: Probably maybe 15, 20 percent.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Not that many. And it was the only high school in that area but there was another high school on the other side of town. I think they we- all the high school kids came to this one high school, Kalamazoo Central but they had Christian high schools that none of us went to.  They had what we called Kalamazoo State High School [Kalamazoo, Michigan] which was a private school with probably about 2 percent African Americans went there, not very many.  I think Jared Deeter [sic.], Jared Deeter is from Kalamazoo [Michigan], I think he went to State High.
Speaker 2: Derek Jeter yeah, yeah the baseball player with the Yankee [New York Yankee] all-star yeah. Right.
Speaker 1: I'm trying to think and then there were Christian schools, high schools but we weren't and not a part of that.  We only had one high school and then Loy Norrix [Loy Norrix High School, Kalamazoo, Michigan] was built.  I was the last graduating class of Kalamazoo Central High School.  That class graduated 725 students.
Story_ID: 656970
Speaker 1: Kalamazoo Central High School [Kalamazoo, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now by this time had you, I mean, had you started singing outside of the church [Friendship Baptist Church, Kalamazoo, Michigan] anywhere, or?
Speaker 2: Well I sung in the choir and I did a couple of things outside of the church.  When I was in high school I sang--oh I was telling you about when I was between seventh and ninth grade I was in the choir, school choir and we were picked to go sing at some festival--
Speaker 1: In Ohio, you said.
Speaker 2: I can't remember just when but--what part of Ohio but when we got there, I was an alternate person.  I was so upset because I was not picked in the beginning and somebody could not go. I was so upset. But I got picked and the outfit that they wanted us to wear had to be navy blue and white.  Well I didn't like the navy blue and white so I got raw blue and white.  It was really a cute outfit but it wasn't like anybody else's in the choir and I just didn't want to look like everybody else in the choir and I know that's probably why I did it.  So we went to Ohio where we met Pat Buttram and Gene Autry, I'll never forget that and I thought oh you know we see them on TV and stuff, you know, riding their little ponies and stuff.
Speaker 1: Pat Buttram was a comic sidekick with Gene Autry (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes sidekick for Gene Autry, yes I do remember that.  That was the only outside activity that I was involved with.  Now when I was in junior high school [Lincoln Junior High School, Kalamazoo, Michigan], I played the harpsichord, the violin, the clarinet, I think those were the three instruments that I played.  Every year I took up an instrument, I did that.
Speaker 1: So were you good at all these instruments (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No of course not. The harpsichord was real easy, the violin I didn't really like that, because it--I didn't.  The harpsichord was easy, the clarinet I did, not good, I didn't keep it up.  I only did it the one term--each of them one term.  Then I started taking piano lessons.  When I started taking piano lessons the church gave me a piano. And in the church--you know the great big pianos that used to stand tall, they literally brought that piano to my parents' [Dora McDonald Gill and Willie Gill] home.
Speaker 1: An upright piano?
Speaker 2: Upright piano. And I took piano lessons for about five or six years.  I always wanted to play by ear.  Never ever learned--I can cord by ear but never learned how to play by ear. But I knew how to read music and I knew how to play the songs in the hymn book and I did that for a long time.  And then I started singing with the girl choir in high school and then I was the first person--African American to sing on the mall in Kalamazoo [Michigan].  When Kalamazoo's mall was built down the middle of town--you know they closed the street off down the middle of town, you could not park down the middle of town because now they had a mall.  If I'm not mistaken I think it was in Life magazine, Kalamazoo was the first city in the United States, if I'm not mistaken, that had a mall downtown in the middle of town.  You might want to check that.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the mall?
Speaker 2: Kalamazoo Mall [Kalamazoo, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or Gilmore Mall [sic.], Gilmore ran Kalamazoo.
Speaker 1: Yeah because the Mall of America in Minnesota [Bloomington, Minnesota].
Speaker 2: Yes, but I think the mall concept, if I'm not mistaken, started in Kalamazoo and if it didn't it might have been the second one. But I sung 'Summertime' and then I was in the band I sung 'Summertime'.  I was so shy, I look back and I thought oh my goodness.  I just stood there, I did- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How old were you?
Speaker 2: I was like sixtee- about seventeen, eighteen and I look back at that and I think oh my goodness, I just stood there and sung.  I did- I didn't move, I didn't do nothing. I just--'cause I didn't know what you were supposed to do (laughter), but stand there and sing.
Story_ID: 656971
Speaker 1: Kalamazoo Central High School [Kalamazoo, Michigan].  What were your aspirations?  Now, you sang at the mall [Kalamazoo Mall, Kalamazoo, Michigan], you were--yeah we were talking about that really--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and, but--well let's finish that before we get into what your aspirations were. But when you were--well let's do it like this--when you were singing at the mall did you have it in your mind that you wanted to be a singer when you got out of high school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not really, that was part of my high school voice teacher's suggestions that they were going to be doing--he was going to be doing some music for an opening at the mall and he asked me to sing 'Summertime.'  Now we had a band follies prior to all that and I was part of that and I sang 'Summertime' in the band follies.  That's why he asked me to sing it in the--at the mall for their opening ceremony.  But at that time no I did not have any idea of being at Motown [Motown Records] at that time at all.  That did not start until I graduated from high school.
Speaker 1: Now did you know about Motown in high school?
Speaker 2: No, we knew about Randy.
Speaker 1: Oh 'Randy's Record Shop' ['Randy's Record Shop Show'].
Speaker 2: Yes, down south.
Speaker 1: Gallatin, Tennessee.
Speaker 2: We used to listen to 'Randy's' on the radio every night.  We knew about The Shirelles. We knew--those groups were already out there. And I did not become involved--I knew nothing about Motown. We found out about Motown after I met Bertha [HistoryMaker Bertha McNeal] up at Western [Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan] when I started at Western.
Speaker 1: Motown kind of hits the scene around 1959 or '60 [1960].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Fifty-seven [sic.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Fifty- '57 [1957] it's been said, I think.  But yeah they were just--what's the song, "Money that's what I want" ['Money'].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's a Motown song.  When you were in high school who were the--I know The Platters were out, The Drifters, The Coasters, Fats Domino.
Speaker 2: A lot of those groups that were not from Motown was out and I think one of the first groups' music that I heard was probably Smokey [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson].  I want to say Smokey, 'Shop Around'.  I can't remember. I know The Supremes had something out as well as The Marvelettes but I think they came out afterwards.  They may have come out mid--
Speaker 1: Mary Wells--
Speaker 2: Mary Wells (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) I think was maybe when you were a junior or senior.  Yeah you had Mary Wells and you had--
Speaker 2: Junior Walker and The All-Stars. They were a little bit later.
Speaker 1: Yeah but did you have a favorite R and B artist when you were in high school? Or who were some of your favorites?
Speaker 2: Johnny Mathis that's what we heard in high school.  We heard Johnny Mathis, we heard Sam Cooke. We heard some of the blues singers.
Speaker 1: Ray Charles had some records out.
Speaker 2: But I don't remember him like I do some of the others 'cause it would have had to have been like in the '60s [1960s].  I remember going to a concert with Bobby Blu- Bobby "Blue" Bland [Bobby Bland] it wasn't that I really liked him but that's all they had appearing at that time and I went to that concert.  I snuck and went to that concert my parents [Dora McDonald Gill and Willie Gill] didn't know I went.  I wasn't allowed to go to concerts.
Speaker 1: Now did Kalamazoo [Michigan] have a strong Mississippi connection like Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No not really.  I think there were quite a few people there from Mississippi but we didn't know who they all were.
Speaker 1: Okay. So most of the people that you grew up around--I mean did they have like a Mississippi--
Speaker 2: Some of them and some Chicago some Mississippi but I can--we had a lot of families that were from many different places. But I don't know, I'm not--I didn't have privy to that.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. Okay I was just trying to get a sense of who you really idolized in those days.  Did you listen to [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson in those days?
Speaker 2: Yes 'cause I remember having LPs Nancy Wilson--who is the guy, who's the guy that played 'Poinciana'? 'Poinsietta' [sic.]? On the piano?
Speaker 1: Not Eddie Heywood or--?
Speaker 2: No, if you mention his name, it was keyboard.  'Poinciana' was the name of the song it was an album.
Speaker 1: Erroll Garner or--
Speaker 2: No, what did [HistoryMaker] Ramsey Lewis play?
Speaker 1: Piano.
Speaker 2: Did he ever play--
Speaker 1: Yeah 'The In Crowd' I've never, I've never heard of the song you just mentioned from him but I'm just trying to figure out if it was somebody--
Speaker 2: I can't remember the artist--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but there's a few LPs.
Story_ID: 656972
Speaker 1: But I might add too that I--we could not--in my home we could not play rock and roll music at all.
Speaker 2: Was that because of the--
Speaker 1: My dad [Willie Gill].
Speaker 2: Your dad being a pastor?
Speaker 1: Um-hm. We could not play cards at all.  We could not go to chur- go to movies on Sunday at all.  You were in church [Friendship Baptist Church, Kalamazoo, Michigan] all day from sun up to sun down every day.  Of course until you got older and grown and left.  There's just some things that we just could not do.  But my brothers had more privy of stuff than I did.  Me being the oldest, I didn't have an older sister or an older brother to go out with so I was sort of left alone.  And where I went my brothers I didn't want them going with me.  But they had more privy, they sold papers and they had their shoe shine kit thing and they'd shine shoes downtown on the corner and sold newspapers on the corner.  They didn't deliver home to home, they went downtown and stood on the corner and sold their newspapers.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Bought them from the Gazette [Kalamazoo Gazette].
Speaker 2: That's the old school way, of course (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's the old school way.
Speaker 2: --it hasn't been done in a long time.  Boys would get their papers and go downtown.
Speaker 1: Now they had papers that were delivered but very few African Americans delivered papers.  They worked down on the corner selling newspapers on--that's what they allowed them to do.
Story_ID: 656973
Speaker 1: In high school [Kalamazoo Central High School, Kalamazoo, Michigan] then what, what did you--did you have an idea of what kind of career you wanted when you graduated or if you wanted to go to college or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I had college prep classes but I didn't know at the time that's what they were.  I had biology, I had chemistry, I had English, I also had typing, I was really good at typing.  I got straight A's in that 'cause I played the piano. And I had gym. I had--when I had English I can remember having to read 'Julius Caesar' ['The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,' William Shakespeare], 'Macbeth' [William Shakespeare].  I didn't know jack nothing about either one of them, didn't have them in high school [sic.], didn't know nothing about nothing.  So I was green, the only African American in this class.  It was like who is Julius--I have no clue, but the kids in my classroom, they all knew who Julius Caesar was they all knew that because they got it in their junior high school.  The junior high school [Lincoln Junior High School, Kalamazoo, Michigan] where I went we did not have that.  We didn't know anything about Julius Caesar.  I found that out in high school and I wasn't very fond of Julius Caesar at all.  I did give a rat's behind about that, I wanted some other stuff.  But they didn't offer anything else.  You had to do the regular history book stuff that was it.  So it's amazing, you know, how far we've come because there are a lot of studies right now on different cultures and different backgrounds of a lot of different people that are more interesting and have developed things over the years that we just did not have privy to when we came up and then that's a plus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's a lot still yet to do.
Speaker 1: Now did you have--how were your grades in high school?
Speaker 2: I was a B, C student.  I got A's in gym, music, typing but the harder subjects B's and C's.  I think I picked up a D in something too.  Oh I know I took chemistry for six weeks.  They had this line, I never had chemistry, didn't know nothing about it.  I just took chemistry 'cause they told me I had to have it to be a nurse.  I took chemistry, I went to a tutor after class, the line was long and the minute the line got to me the tutoring session was over with every time I went for tutoring sessions.  So I got a D and then I dropped it then I found out I didn't have to take chemistry to be a nurse (laughter).  I was trying to figure out what formulas I've got to develop to be a nurse. None, nada.
Story_ID: 656974
Speaker 1: The choral instructor was--would you consider him like a mentor or something in high school?
Speaker 2: My core instructor?
Speaker 1: Your chorus--choir instructor.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, Mr. Casdor [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was in several musicals.  One musical I got kicked out of because we brought food, we were hungry and we brought food.  Two African Americans brought food and he just happen to come when we were eating, kicked us off of the musical.
Speaker 1: During the show?
Speaker 2: Yeah while we were rehearsing for the show we got kicked out.
Speaker 1: So what musicals did you all (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And we flunked it, we flunked music.  There was four marking periods.  So I took music all the way through from the time I hit tenth grade to twelfth I had music.  I didn't flunk the class, I flunked that section--that semester and he told us why.  We weren't supposed to be eating but guess who else ate?
Speaker 1: He did?
Speaker 2: Other students.
Speaker 1: Other students (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Caucasian students.
Speaker 1: Oh so you were the only two black students?
Speaker 2: Well yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So they were still doing stuff like that.  They still do stuff like that today if you look at certain things.  So I have seen him since we've been performing as a professional group he has literally come to our concerts in Kalamazoo [Michigan].  I've come this close to reminding him, I'd say, "There is one memorable occasion where I remember when I had you as an instructor," (laughter) but I haven't brought myself to do that yet to tell him how I felt.  But I hear now that he's--I don't know if he has, he's senile now or something is wrong with him.  But we used to have the robe choir.  You had to audition for that but I didn't know that.  So when I started high school, I just went into the robe choir class room.  They wanted to know why I was there and I said, "Well I want to--I signed up for robe choir."  They didn't tell me I had to audition in the ninth grade to get in it.  My teacher never told me nothing, when I signed up for it, nothing.  So I had to go in the regular choir and then I became a part of robe choir that was the choir to be in and I, I was in there for two years.
Story_ID: 656975
Speaker 1: So what kind of counseling did you get about--did you get any college counseling at all? I mean about what, whether you ought to go or not--
Speaker 2: I basically--we do--we did have a counselor, I went to the counselor and I told him I wanted to be a nurse.  The only reason I want to be a nurse is because my mom [Dora McDonald Gill] was working at the Kalamazoo State Hospital [Kalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital, Kalamazoo, Michigan] and she would get up every morning, put her white uniform on and white shoes. And I said one of these days I'm going to be a nurse, without even thinking about it.  So he told me I had to take chemistry.  I think this was when I first started tenth grade. So that's why I took chemistry.  Wrong thing to do, I knew nothing about chemistry.  The tutors they had, as I was telling you before, did not--always ended his tutoring session when it was my turn to go--for him to tutor me.  I was not happy with that at all.  And then he told me that there were no nursing schools in Kalamazoo [Michigan] and he lied there were three.  There was, both hospitals had a nursing school.  Back in the day hospitals had nursing schools but they were diploma schools. And there was a junior college in Battle Creek [Michigan] that had a RN [registered nurse] school. But there was a practical nurses school in Kalamazoo. But my counselor told me there was nothing.  So I didn't pursue anything.
Speaker 1: So the coun- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went straight to Western. And--
Speaker 1: How did you find out about Western--I mean did you know students there already or did you have any friends there?
Speaker 2: No, Western was just there.  Some friends were students there that had graduated a year before I did.
Speaker 1: It's in Kalamazoo?
Speaker 2: In Kalamazoo.
Speaker 1: Western Michigan University
Speaker 2: Yes. And the practical nurses school that was there, I didn't know where it was.  They didn't tell me that there was one there at all and there was no RN program other than both hospitals.  They didn't tell me about those.  So I basically had to find out on my own and the way I found out I went to Western, started in September, I dropped out--
Speaker 1: This is September of 1959 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sixty [1960].
Speaker 1: Sixty [1960], okay.  Nineteen sixty [1960].
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty [1960] I went to Western.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 656976
Speaker 1: I went a semester--two semesters. That's when I met Bert [HistoryMaker Bertha McNeal].  That's the same year I found out about Motown [Motown Records] because Bob Bullock [Robert Berry Bullock], Ber- Berry's [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] nephew was a student there. And I'd just heard Bertha playing the piano in the student union.  And you know, she'll probably tell you part of that story and that's how we met.  So she had a cousin that sung and I said, "Well I've got a sister that sings," and that's how we formed.  If it hadn't been for me it wouldn't have happened trust me.  If I hadn't been up at Western listening to her playing the piano there would be no Velvelettes.
Speaker 2: All right now, now, calm down (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, I'm just--you know.
Speaker 2: No, I'm just playing with you.  Did you and your sister sing at home?
Speaker 1: We sang in the church [Friendship Baptist Church, Kalamazoo, Michigan] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh church, the church choir.  Did you ever sing together?
Speaker 1: Not really, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was in the church choir I think before she--you see she left; she went to stay with my uncle and them, when she was like nine or ten years old or somewhere around there.
Speaker 2: So she wasn't around the house?
Speaker 1: She wasn't there for the most part because my uncle and my aunt took her to Detroit [Michigan].  They had no kids so they convinced my parents to allow Carol [HistoryMaker Cal Street] to go with them and that's what she did.  But she didn't stay there long, she came back to Kalamazoo [Michigan], but then she went back. And that--her and I were not--I mean we're quite a few years apart.  My high school friends and her friends don't--did not mix.
Speaker 2: So what's the age difference between you and your sister?
Speaker 1: Well, I'll be seventy-three; I think she's sixty-eight, sixty-seven, sixty-eight somewhere around there.
Speaker 2: That makes a big difference when you're young (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well yeah and when you're young I didn't hang around my little sisters at all.  I didn't even hang around my brothers; I had nobody to hang around with.  I had a couple of girl friends that were my age and I didn't have that many friends that were allowed at my home.  So you know, I didn't--I basically hung around with me when I got involved with the Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America], got involved with the BYPU [Baptist Young People's Union] and the choir and you know, my sister wasn't with me when I was doing all that stuff.  I do remember her growing up but she was in and out a couple years with my aunt and uncle.
Speaker 2: Okay so you meet Bertha and she's playing the piano at Western--
Speaker 1: And I just heard her.
Speaker 2: And you heard her and--
Speaker 1: And I went over there to her and I said--and then we got a bunch of girls and got around the piano and we started, (singing) "Sitting in my la la, waiting for my ya ya" ['Ya Ya'].  And that's the song we sang at a talent show in Kalamazoo.  Well it was not really a talent show.  Then I de- we decided, I said, "Bertha, there's about twelve or fifteen girls in this room too many."  So she said--I said, "Well I've got a sister that sings."  She had a cousin that sung, my sister had a friend that sung and so we just got them all together and that's how The Velvelettes started.
Speaker 2: Okay. So name all of them.
Speaker 1: Betty Kelly, Norma Barbee [HistoryMaker Norma Fairhurst] then, Bertha Barbee then--
Speaker 2: And they are cousins Bertha and Norma okay.
Speaker 1: They are first cousins to each other.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Betty is not related to neither one of us.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then with Carol my sister and myself.
Speaker 2: Okay so you had two sisters, two cousins and one person that was not related.
Story_ID: 656977
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Shortly after we signed with Mo- or before we signed with Motown [Motown Records], The Vandellas was having a problem with one of the girls.  A husband didn't want her to something, something, something.
Speaker 1: Well let's not get into that yet.
Speaker 2: Oh okay.
Speaker 1: Let's just deal with Velvelettes first.  So these are The Velvelettes, it's five of you, right?  So Motown didn't make you, you formed your own group yourself.  So, so what did The Velvelettes do when they formed?  Did they sing around town, or did--how did you get work?
Speaker 2: We just practiced a lot up in the dorms.  We couldn't do it at my home 'cause my dad did not allow rock and roll.  So we had to do it on campus and sneak.
Speaker 1: I know earlier today Norma [HistoryMaker Norma Fairhurst] was telling us that her parents really kind of frowned on show business activities too.  They didn't really--
Speaker 2: Well they didn't really know about show business.  It was entertainment stuff the singing.  My parents [Dora McDonald Gill and Willie Gill] frowned on rock and roll singing and these record companies but they didn't know--they didn't have any history about all that.  You know he'd just hear stuff, he'd just hear about the singers back in the day.  But you didn't hear a whole lot.  They didn't have a lot of input--they didn't have a lot of information about record companies.  We just knew that my dad was not going to allow us to sing rock and roll at home--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at all and wasn't going to sign a contract.  He couldn't do anything to me because I was eighteen, over eighteen; I think I was eighteen going on nineteen so I can sign my own.  My sister Carol [HistoryMaker Cal Street] they had to sign for her.  My uncle convinced my parents to allow us to do it.  So he drove us (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Before I get you--I don't want to jump too far.  I want to take this bit--a chunk at a time.  How did you find out--who connected you to Motown?
Speaker 2: Oh we were up at Western [Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan] and they were having a talent show.  We entered the talent show.  Subsequent to that we met Bob Bullock [Robert Berry Bullock] in the student union.  I think Bert [HistoryMaker Bertha McNeal] and I met him or somebody came and told us somebody was there at Western.
Speaker 1: Now this is [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy's nephew (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Berry's nephew.
Speaker 1: What did that mean to you at that point?
Speaker 2: Well we had--I think we had heard about Motown and we were excited that somebody was there that was related to the man that owned it.  So he was telling us, "You ought to go down. Go down and audition. Go on and audition."  So we did and my dad took us down (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you set up an appointment.
Speaker 2: We did not set up an appointment.
Speaker 1: You just went down there?
Speaker 2: We just went down there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because we heard that they only did auditions on Saturdays--I think it was Saturdays. 'Cause everybody was in school. And I think Bob may have mentioned that they do auditions on Saturdays.  So my dad drove us to Detroit [Michigan] in the winter time.  It took us five hours to get to Detroit from Kalamazoo [Michigan] because there was a snow storm.  My dad almost turned around on many occasions but we just pleaded and begged with him not to do that.
Speaker 1: So that's twice as long as it normally takes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes we got to the stu- we got to Hitsville, Hitsville U.S.A. that's what it was and we walked in to go audition.
Story_ID: 656978
Speaker 1: We go to the receptionist; I can't remember if it was [HistoryMaker] Martha Reeves that the--that was the receptionist or Kim Weston, one of them, somebody was the receptionist.  We told them who we were and that we came down to audition.  We told them where we were from and they said, "Well there are no auditions; you have to have an appointment."  They were just real snooty.  Ironically Bertha [HistoryMaker Bertha McNeal] and Norma [HistoryMaker Norma Fairhurst] had already cut a record with her uncle [Simon Barbee] and her family from here in Flint [Michigan] called 'Que Paso' [sic. 'Que Pasa?']--(unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's part of the Barbees--the singing Barbees.
Speaker 1: And the guy that did it for them--that produced it for them just so happened to walk through the door when we were out in the lobby.  The lady was giving us the runaround that we drove all the way down there for nothing.  And [HistoryMaker] Mickey Stevenson popped out and we were allowed to do the audition, Johnny on the spot, chickey doo did not want to let us do anything.  But then we later found out they were privy to the people from the Detroit [Michigan] area, trust me, as opposed to we're from Kalamazoo [Michigan].  We were all like still in high school, some of us are in college [Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan] and you know, they didn't want--they just made little snide remarks about that.  And every time we went down, we stayed with my uncle and my sister Carol [HistoryMaker Cal Street]--I'm trying to think was she--yeah she was staying with them at the time if I'm not--no she wasn't staying with them at the time.  She may have been--I can't remember she can tell you that history.  So we signed but during the time of signing, my parents [Dora McDonald Gill and Willie Gill] didn't want to sign.  My uncle had to talk my parents into signing.
Speaker 2: Now what did the contract stipulate?
Speaker 1: I can't remember.
Speaker 2: Okay, were you given any instructions when they gave you the contract?
Speaker 1: Not really.
Speaker 2: I know we, we were interviewing Joe Billi- [HistoryMaker Joe Billingslea, Jr.] (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You just read the contract and they just tell you to sign.  You didn't know nothing.
Speaker 2: Okay now who gave it to you?  Was this Esther [Esther Gordy Edwards]--
Speaker 1: It was Esther, I think it was Esther. Or Berry [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy].
Speaker 2: Gordy Edwards.
Speaker 1: Yeah right, um-hm. And there was a lot of fine print.  I think Bertha or somebody got a copy.  I think my ex-husband took my copy because I could never find it after I divorced him. I don't--I'm sure they have a copy of it.
Speaker 2: Okay, so here's a contract but your parents were not--your father wouldn't sign it.
Speaker 1: Well, they had to sign for my sister.
Speaker 2: Oh they had to sign for your sister.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but not for me.
Speaker 2: Okay you were already (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But you know they don't give you time to go over no contract.  We got a lawyer (laughter), we got a lawyer at some point, and they were not happy, we wanted to see our books, they were not happy. My uncle's lawyer.  Because you know, you hear stuff, older people hear stuff about how record companies do folk and how they work you and how they pay you, and.
Story_ID: 656979
Speaker 1: Now had you any idea or did you ever think about what the life of an entertainer might be, I mean just based on some of the news stories of those days?
Speaker 2: No.  All we wanted to do is make a record.  This touring and doing shows, that was not part of our thought process at all it just happened.  We started doing record hops and we did the Dick Clark tour [Caravan of Stars].
Speaker 1: So wait a minute you imagined that you'd just make the record, people would buy the record and it would sell--
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: --and the money would come in.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So the rest of this touring you didn't think about.
Speaker 2: No not really but when we did it--when it started everybody was still in school.
Speaker 1: Were you surprised when they told you that you had signed a contract to promote your records and go on tour?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but we wanted to do that after they discussed it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause it was surprising, you hadn't thought about that before.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh. And they booked us [The Velvelettes] usually on the weekends 'cause we were in school. And I was working. And because I had started working in the hospital I got into a surgical technician program once I didn't go back to Western [Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan].  I went to the hospital and got a job.  I got selected to be in this pilot program and that's how I ended up working in the operating room.
Speaker 1: That's much later, right?
Speaker 2: Well it was around the same time that I was at Western. Right after--yeah because when I didn't go back that semester, I went and found a job.  That's how I got involved at the hospital; I went up there and applied.  I was working when we went to Detroit [Michigan] to, to audition.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know I was off on weekends and we went down on the weekend.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was still working.
Story_ID: 656980
Speaker 1: Tell us about the--the song you auditioned with was 'There He Goes.'
Speaker 2: Norma [HistoryMaker Norma Fairhurst] wrote that--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --we auditioned that and there was another song.
Speaker 1: Now I think her uncle's friend took credit for it, though, right Stevenson [HistoryMaker Mickey Stevenson] I think.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, but we didn't know nothing about that.  And I thought oh no. But guess what?  They never pushed that record.  It hit the charts, I can't remember what number it was, but everybody knew that record would have done something.  Because we were not from Detroit [Michigan], we just heard that there were other groups that were not going to be too happy with a group from out of the area coming in and having a hit record.  Sort of unspoken but that's what they did.  Of course we didn't know. We just were happy to--glad to hear it playing.  You know driving down in your car and you hear our record on the radio station and they played it here in Flint [Michigan] 'cause that's where we, that's where I heard it first.  Well I heard it first in Detroit then they played it here in Flint.
Speaker 1: Now here in Flint did they have like a top forty station?
Speaker 2: Yes they did.
Speaker 1: But there wasn't a black station here was it?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh. Unh-uh, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Not in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: No and of course you know you had payola there so you know how that goes.
Speaker 1: Well I don't know. (Laughter) But okay so Norma's song 'There He Goes' (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She wrote the song and we made the music up--we did it before we went to the studio.
Speaker 1: Okay now who--the members of the group like who sang what part?
Speaker 2: My sister [HistoryMaker Cal Street] sang the lead, Norma was soprano, I was alto and Bertha [HistoryMaker Bertha McNeal] was like first tenor or we tried to do a jazz thing too.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now I've heard that The Velvelettes are the jazziest of the Motown [Motown Records] groups.  So your harmonies are more--
Speaker 2: We put a jazz chord in when we're singing background.  Tried to anyway, certain songs.
Speaker 1: Which would sound like what, can you give us an example (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh no to get the full--
Speaker 1: You'd have to have everybody?
Speaker 2: Well yeah.  I mean I probably could figure it out but it's best with the group.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I used to sing first soprano but I don't sing first soprano anymore.  Back in the day when I was younger, I don't do that anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: I do alto--first, second alto.
Speaker 1: Does your voice change with age?
Speaker 2: Oh I think it--oh yeah.  Oh I've worked with people whose voice--and then us, I'm a smoker, I'm still a smoker, I smoke so my voice does change.  But it changed way before that.
Speaker 1: Okay. I think that just general observations makes me thing that smoking deepens the voice but I'm not, you know.
Speaker 2: But I have worked with people--been in choirs with people who never smoked and their voice does change, something happens.  Unless you're doing it all the time like your opera singers see how they long last.  But they don't last forever something eventually happens and they can't get those high notes anymore and then you don't hear anything about them anymore.
Story_ID: 656981
Speaker 1: How long w- was the group [The Velvelettes] formed before you went on a tour, I mean started doing sock hops and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: We started like almost when we did 'There He Goes.'  I think that was '60 [1960].
Speaker 1: That was '60 [1960] I think. Or '61 [1961].
Speaker 2: But you know what happened one time it's real memorable this is really funny.  I was married, lived here; we had to go to Detroit [Michigan] for a sock hop.  I had the 45 record [45 rpm record] in the back of the seat of the car.  We get down to the sock hop and they didn't have the 45 there, we had to bring our own.  So we took the 45, we got up to start the song and do our routine and the record started skipping.  Now do I need to say--should I--do I need to say anything else?
Speaker 1: This is a crisis.
Speaker 2: It's a crisis.  Everybody started laughing--the whole audience started laughing and then they'd skip above it because the sun had warped the record.
Speaker 1: Oh, you left it in the back window.
Speaker 2: While we were driving down there, without even thinking.
Speaker 1: So the record was like a roller coaster.
Speaker 2: In a certain section but the person that was running the record should have his own 45, we had to take our own 'cause I guess Motown [Motown Records] didn't trust him to ha--I don't know but I do remember that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 656982
Speaker 1: We're talking about going to a sock hop and like when was your first major tour? Was that the same year, '61 [1961]?
Speaker 2: I think so the Dick Clark tour [Caravan of Stars].  That's the only one I actually went on.  The Supremes, Bobby Freeland--Freeman, The Drifters, Dee Dee Sharp--
Speaker 1: Bobby Freeman was 'The Swim' ['C'mon and Swim']? (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. The Crystals, Tillotson, Tillotson, Roy Tillotson [sic. Johnny Tillotson], he sang something, something.
Speaker 1: This is a white guy, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Bobby--Brian Hollan- Hyland [Brian Hyland]. 'Itsy Witsy Teenie Weenie' [sic. 'Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini'] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini.'
Speaker 2: Yeah. And then there was the road manager, of course I said The Supremes and Diana's mother [Ernestine Moten Ross] was there.  She was the chaperone because my sister [HistoryMaker Cal Street] was underage.  I can't remember if Betty [Betty Kelly] was too. I think--I can't remember. And Dick Clark--I think it was a two or three week tour--and Dick Clark would come on the weekends.  I can remember we went to a lot of cities.  We flew to--or did we take the bus--we flew somewhere (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was that your first plane ride?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Flew somewhere and then we boarded a bus that says Dick Clark Caravan of Stars and we did all the East Coast cities.
Speaker 1: Now what was Dick Clark like?  Did you get a chance to--
Speaker 2: Very nice, very respectful of everybody.  He didn't slight anybody.  We had an incident that happened in one of the southern restaurants.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: We walked in, put our order in.  The group was mixed but there were more African Americans than there were Caucasians in the group.  They took our orders, never brought the food.
Speaker 1: Did they take your money?
Speaker 2: No, because they never brought our food. So Dick Clark went back and said something, he said, "You know, we've been sitting here," it was over an hour and these people are coming in getting their orders and we're trying to figure out why aren't they bringing our food.  So he went and said something to the waitress or somebody and then they started bringing the food.  So Dick Clark stood in the aisle, he went like this (gesture) and told us all to stand up and we all walked out and never went back 'cause they wouldn't wait on us.  One of the places that we stayed, one of the motels, one of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now where was this incident?
Speaker 2: Down south, I can't remember the city.
Speaker 1: It was down south someplace?
Speaker 2: Yeah
Speaker 1: This had to be like sixty--this was before 1963 or so? Sixty-two [1962], sixty--
Speaker 2: Yeah somewhere, I can't remember.
Speaker 1: So this is--yeah it's when the civil rights agitation was going on down there.  People were agitating for civil rights.
Speaker 2: There was a fight that broke out in one of the motel rooms because the people that lived there thought that somebody went in the wrong motel room and they were a different color.  So I never knew just how all that happened but that was the only incident that I can remember while we were on tour.
Speaker 1: So when you were on tour, you could stay in a white owned hotels and motels in the South?
Speaker 2: No they were pre-planned.  They knew which ones to go to.  We didn't make those arrangements at all.
Speaker 1: Was it white owned?
Speaker 2: Oh they were all white owned.
Speaker 1: Okay that's what I'm asking.
Speaker 2: I'm sure because--
Speaker 1: So they made the plan (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Dick Clark being Caucasian, he's making these arrangements.  Oh they're going to rent them to him and they were white owned. So, and where we ate was white owned, the restaurants were.  Where we sang was owned by Caucasians not African Americans.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Until we started singing in other venues like the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this on this tour you've got a mixed review of people you know Bobby Tillotson as well as The Velvelettes and were you singing to an integrated audience?  Were there black and white patrons in the audience at the same time?
Speaker 2: Some were, some were not.
Speaker 1: Okay depending on where it was down south?
Speaker 2: But there were basically white audiences.
Speaker 1: Okay. Are there--were there any towns where you had to do a white show and a black show?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't ever--no. We had a mixed show in some places.  When we were in Ohio 'cause we ended up in Ohio too and it was a mixed show.  I think it was probably, it was a lot of African Americans that were there because I think the area where we sang was a lot of African Americans lived in Dayton [Ohio].
Speaker 1: Dayton, okay, yeah that's true. About 40 percent of the city.
Story_ID: 656983
Speaker 1: But as far as the other places that we sung it was predominantly the white audience.  But when we went to the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York] it was all African American that was after the tour [Caravan of Stars] 'cause we did there for--
Speaker 2: This was a black tour when you went to the Apollo, right you had a black show?
Speaker 1: Yeah but we--it wasn't a tour, we were just hired to perform there--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --with Walter Jackson as I was mentioning earlier and The Impressions.  I can't remember who was all on that show.  I know Walter Jackson and, and when we were on the show there were three of us left (laughter).  We had these black (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What happened to the other two by that time?
Speaker 1: Well Betty [Betty Kelly] was--oh that was (unclear) about Betty--
Speaker 2: Now there is a story--
Speaker 1: The story about Betty, Smokey [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson] approached her because Martha [HistoryMaker Martha Reeves]--one of the singers with The Vandellas, was not allowed to go sing with The Vandellas.
Speaker 2: It wasn't Martha though it was somebody else.
Speaker 1: No, I don't know if it was her sister or cousin or whoever. And so Betty Kelly resembled the girl that couldn't sing so they asked her.  She came to us to ask us if it would be okay, that they've approached her about singing and signing with The Vandellas.  We told her it was fine. You know, that if they're wanting her, then that was fine.
Speaker 2: Were they going to pay her more?
Speaker 1: Probably not. She got her pay when she started singing the records and getting the royalties and stuff I'm sure.
Speaker 2: Okay, so they let her get in on the concert--
Speaker 1: They may have, I don't know.  Well I think, I can't remember if she--I'm pretty sure she signed with them eventually. I'm pretty sure she did because she sung with them for a long time.  And then of course Martha went by herself, busted all of that up but then when we started calling ourselves the originals, she got them back together again calling herself the originals [The Original Vandellas].
Story_ID: 656984
Speaker 1: Now what--who were The Andantes?
Speaker 2: They did background vocals for every group.  Every group that needed background vocals The Andantes did that.
Speaker 1: These were women--all women?
Speaker 2: Yes three, yep, three of them.
Speaker 1: Three of them and who were they?  Do you remember their names?
Speaker 2: Louvain [Louvain Demps] and I can't remember the other two.
Speaker 1: But they didn't tour or anything or did they do any touring or did they--
Speaker 2: I don't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) make any records as The Andantes?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think so. They did a lot of studio work 'cause you do--you had studio musicians that only worked in the studio doing recordings and then you had musicians that went out on the road.
Story_ID: 656985
Speaker 1: Did you [The Velvelettes] ever backup any other singers in, in the studio?
Speaker 2: We did some ad- we did some adlibbing for--we were on Stevie's 'Fingertips', the shouting and stuff in the background and Stevie played the harmonica on one of our songs. 'These Things pe-'--
Speaker 1: 'That's the Reason Why'?
Speaker 2: No 'These Things Will Keep me Loving You,' Stevie is playing the harmonica on that one.
Speaker 1: What was he like, what was Stevie Wonder like?
Speaker 2: Oh as nice as he could be.  But he was real young when we met him.  He had to have been twelve or thirteen and we were just amazed at his talents. And we've seen him since--over the years when Motown [Motown Records] has had their gatherings down at Hitsville [Hitsville U.S.A., Detroit, Michigan].  Smokey [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson], Stevie, a lot of them have come.  Holland Dozier Holland and we just saw them not too awfully long ago and then of course we were out in California quite a few years ago for the lifetime achievement award that we received.  Every year they have something in commemoration of Motown.  Now it's a historical building.  Berry's [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] niece runs that building now the Motown Museum [Detroit, Michigan].  Whenever I have friends that come here and want to go down there to tour, I, I usually go with them.  We've had friends come over from London [England] and have stayed here at my home and I've taken them down there to the museum.  I call the museum up and tell them we're coming.
Story_ID: 656986
Speaker 1: Could you remember what year 'Needle in a Haystack' came out?
Speaker 2: I think it was '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Right, I think that's what we have here. But--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I know Norma [HistoryMaker Norma Fairhurst] seems to remember different na- years, but she said she wasn't sure, so.
Speaker 2: Me either.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm just guessing '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: So a 'Needle in a Haystack' that was like the first sort of hit, like, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I remember that one that was written by Norman Whitfield.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you participate at all in any of the song writing?
Speaker 2: Norma wrote 'There He Goes,' we did the music.  There was another record on the side, on the flip side and we wrote that.
Speaker 1: 'The Reason Why'--
Speaker 2: No it wasn't that, it was another one, (singing) "(Hums) they say (unclear) try." 'Should I Tell Them' we wrote that.  I think that's on the flip side of 'There He Goes,' I think.  I don't even have 'There He Goes,' I don't even have the 45 [45 rpm record].  People just take stuff from you.
Speaker 1: Is it hard to get it these days? Hard to find it?
Speaker 2: Probably. Well you can get it on CD [compact disc].  I've got all that we have done ever on CD.
Speaker 1: Now the song 'He Was Really Saying Something' ['He Was Really Sayin' Somethin''] was produced by Norman Whitfield again, did he write it as well?
Speaker 2: I can't remember.
Speaker 1: That was like the biggest--that climbed the charts higher than anything else in the United States anyway.
Speaker 2: And then there are some things that they wrote for us and I don't like them.  They weren't going to do anything; I already knew that just by listening to stuff.
Speaker 1: So did [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy make these decisions about who got what song?
Speaker 2: Oh I'm sure. Who's going to play what, when, where and that's fine.
Speaker 1: I think I saw (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I--you know there are some of the songs that were sort of more in the can.  Now I have a copy and anybody that has our CD, I've listened to everything on both of those CDs and when I listen to some of those things, I said I can't believe they put that on there.  I, you know, I'm listening to stuff right now and listening to music right now and listening to how music was back then and who was singing and what they were singing, et cetera.  I would have never, ever put certain songs on that CD.
Speaker 1: 'Cause they just weren't that good (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No but I think it was sort of to appease. And it may not have been, I don't know and that's okay.  But there were some selections that were there that I thought were not good selections.  We had no, we had no say as to what they put out there and we never did an album.  We never did an album, we never did a CD.  So when they came up with this compilation CD that was a plus. That was a plus. We've worked as a result of that CD and when we got back together--after we quit we got back together--
Speaker 1: Well I don't want to jump to that yet.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: I'm still trying to deal with the first time around and get all of that out and then we'll get you when you, you know when you split.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Gotta back it--(unclear) I kn- you know, but--
Speaker 2: Having one of my senior moments here.
Speaker 1: Well everybody does this.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I think people get maybe a little tired and they jump to the end. But so the--now 'He Was Really Saying Something' you know, later was covered by a British group called Bananarama.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I heard that version (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Bananarama.
Story_ID: 656987
Speaker 1: There's a story that Norma [HistoryMaker Norma Fairhurst] told about [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy saying that the song 'Needle in a Haystack' or 'He Was Really Saying Something' ['He Was Really Sayin' Somethin'']--one of them--saved Motown [Motown Records] 'cause at the time he couldn't--he was wondering how he was going to pay his bills (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think--yeah. I think it was 'Needle in a Haystack.'  He mentioned that at the Heroes and Legends Awards ceremony out in California.  He told everybody that how he got back on the charts making money because of 'Needle in a Haystack'.
Speaker 1: So you all were definitely earning money for Motown that's definitely true.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How were you all doing financially as a result of being a full blown, full time professional entertainer?
Speaker 2: No. We--no. Like money wise--making beaucoup money, no.
Speaker 1: Did people think you were making--
Speaker 2: Probably but I'm a realist you know.  I can remember when we went on tour how much we got per week with Dick Clark (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How much did you get?
Speaker 2: I think it was sixty bucks [dollars] a week.
Speaker 1: Sixty?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay now this is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Maybe forty--it was either forty or sixty a week and I had two kids.
Speaker 1: This is in '62 [1962] or '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: Whenever the Dick Clark tour was.  Sixty-two [1962], '63 [1963] somewhere along in there.
Speaker 1: Now this time I know--
Speaker 2: But I know they were getting more than what we were getting paid.
Speaker 1: If you worked for Ford [Ford Motor Company] or Chevy [Chevrolet] or a Chrysler [Chrysler Corporation; FCA US LLC] plant or something, you would get a hundred plus a week.
Speaker 2: Oh definitely.
Speaker 1: For working in a factory.  So, so we're talking about maybe half of what you'd get for factory work.
Speaker 2: Yes, I just remember getting paid for that tour.  And I think we were on it for three weeks, two weeks or something like that and it was sixty bucks.  It had to be sixty bucks 'cause I know my husband [Arbor's ex-husband] wanted me to send money home and we had to clean our own clothes, feed ourselves with that.  We didn't pay for transportation or where we stayed, Motown took care of all of that.
Speaker 1: But you had to feed yourself with that money and get your clothes cleaned too?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But you know Dick Clark because it was his Caravan of Stars, what do you think he got?  They get the venue.  We look at that now and Berry got paid. He's farming us out.  We don't know how the industry works; we don't really care how--we didn't care how it worked.  All we wanted was to do a record and then when they told us we had to start doing tours that was something like added that we didn't know anything about.  We started doing that and whatever money we got we thought everybody got that because they were all out there with us.  We all got the same amount of money, I guess, we don't know.  Nobody talked about how much they got you'd just know it was payday.  When payday came around guess what everybody was doing, playing blackjack cards.
Speaker 1: Trying to win somebody else's money (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Trying to win somebody else's money of course I didn't know how to play ba- blackjack.
Speaker 1: Did you participate in that?
Speaker 2: No, I know I picked up somebody's car one time and they about flipped.
Story_ID: 656988
Speaker 1: Trying to think what group--I'm trying to think was it The Four Tops? 'Cause we were out--oh we had to drive one time with The Four Tops from Detroit [Michigan] 'cause the planes were grounded 'cause of the weather.  We had to drive from Detroit to Uptown Theater in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] Christmas program--a Christmas show.  That was horrible.
Speaker 2: Why?
Speaker 1: Because we had to get on the bus and drive from Detroit to Philly--
Speaker 2: At Christmastime (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) all night long (laughter) in the snow 'cause the planes were grounded.  We couldn't catch a flight.  They cancelled the flights or something.  That was horrible.  Oh, wait a minute when we arrived at the Uptown Theater, the show was at four o'clock, we arrived at the stage door at 3:30.  We're supposed to be on stage at four--the show starts at four.  So we had to run in, run to the dressing rooms and they were raggedy, clean up real qui- I mean real quick, dress and be on stage.  I think we were the first ones on.
Speaker 2: You didn't enjoy being on the road I take it?
Speaker 1: Not like that.
Speaker 2: Now, were you all chaperoned, you were young ladies then--
Speaker 1: Well when we were of age--when everybody was of age, we didn't have a chaperone after that.
Speaker 2: When you started you were eighteen--
Speaker 1: Um-hm. The others though--
Speaker 2: --and you could sign your own contract.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But your sister [HistoryMaker Cal Street] was under age--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  My parents [Dora McDonald Gill and Willie Gill] had to sign for her.
Speaker 2: Did Mrs. Powell accompany you all on these trips?
Speaker 1: Yeah Mrs. Powell has come too--they used her too.
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Maxine Powell.  Did you ever feel in jeopardy or anything on the road?
Speaker 1: Unh-uh. The only time I felt that way was the time when we stayed in one of the motels and there was a fight that broke out in The Four Tops room--somebody's room.  Because the white boys thought--what did--they either thought the black girls went in the white men's room or vice versa and they busted in the room and started fighting and they were totally (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now these were white people that--
Speaker 1: That lived there.
Speaker 2: That lived in that town--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --but not--okay.
Speaker 1: And that was the only incident that I heard of.  We heard the scuffle but we didn't know what it was.
Speaker 2: So they were trying to police the social behavior of the caravan.
Speaker 1: And when we stayed together, we all stayed like in the same room.  You got a room that was like a suite type.  Sometimes they'd put us in two rooms, two of us in one room and two of us in another room.  We didn't go out much, we didn't have time 'cause you travelled one night and you sung one night.  Then you travelled that night, you got to the other place, slept, and you had to sing.  You sung one night, you'd travelled, sung and travelled and sometimes we slept on the bus.  Then we went and stayed in some hotel too at that time.  They had certain for us in certain places.  But we didn't stay at a hotel every night 'cause we had to drive after a show all night and maybe check into the hotel and then be ready to go do the show that night, get on a bus and drive again (makes sound).
Story_ID: 656989
Speaker 1: So you all [The Velvelettes] stayed together until '66 [1966] the first time around, right?
Speaker 2: Somewhere around there.
Speaker 1: And, well what happened?  Why did the group, you know, disband (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We got married.  Got married, got pregnant, had kids.  Carol [HistoryMaker Cal Street] stayed as long as she could and then she got some other girls after we quit.  Then she started dating Richard who was with The Monitors then and we just never went back.
Speaker 1: This is Richard Street?
Speaker 2: Richard, her ex-husband.  Of course he since then has passed but she married him and we never went back.  Well in 1986--
Speaker 1: Well let me just asked you what you did after--well, first of all--
Speaker 2: When I got married--
Speaker 1: --what was your, what was--well yeah go ahead.
Speaker 2: I got married, moved here [Flint, Michigan], I took, had taken a surgical technician pilot program from the hospital in Kalamazoo [Michigan].  I got married and moved here, had job offers at three hospitals different shifts and I picked the one that was the first shift [McLaren Flint, Flint, Michigan].  Twelve years later that's when I went back to school and became a registered nurse.  After I graduated, I started teaching as well part time.
Story_ID: 656990
Speaker 1: Now during this time did you sing at church or that sort of thing? Or did you do anything (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went to church--I belonged to a church here but very little I sung in the choir, very little.  The choir--the church that I joined when I got married, I never sung in that choir, I joined my husband's [Arbor's ex-husband] church.  After I started back in nurses training--I started back to school I went and visited the Presbyterian church and I eventually ended up joining that church and I still belong to that church to this day.
Speaker 1: Was singing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I sang a little bit in the choir, not much.  They always want me to sing and I say no, I sit in the pew and sing along with everybody else.
Speaker 1: Now why were you averse to singing in these settings? You just didn't wanna--
Speaker 2: Why I did not?
Speaker 1: Right
Speaker 2: I just don't.  First of all I work third shift for years, choir rehearsal is at six o'clock in the evening, I had to be at work at ten sometimes at eleven.  I could not stay up all day and take care of my kids 'cause I was--I divorced and I was a single parent for years and I worked third shift.  I went to school during the day while my kids were in school and if I went to church Sunday morning, I'd always fall asleep 'cause I got off from work at 7:30 in the morning.  I worked every other weekend.  So, and I did try and sing in the choir, it just was not working out.  I stepped in the choir and fall asleep 'cause I'd go there right after I'd get off from work in the morning.  Church starts at what ten, eleven o'clock.  I'd get off from work at what 7:30, 8:00? By the time I'd get home and get the kids up, baths and all that and go to church and then I'd fall asleep.  So I just chose not to be involved at the church.  So I--now I just go to church, I do sing from the pews like a whole bunch of people do and there have been occasions that I have done a solo for the church but I don't do a whole lot like I used to.  I didn't really do a whole lot then.  Then I'm involved with Big Brothers and Big Sisters [Big Brothers Big Sisters of Flint and Genesee County] so there's a little sister--two of them that I've mentored over the years.  One of them just got her degree from Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] a month or so ago and now I'm mentoring her sister and now I have two grandkids.  So I just have stuff that I do and then on my human relations commissioner for the City of Flint [Michigan] that's a volunteering job too as well.  So I just, you know--you split your time with what you want to split it with and that's what I choose to do.

Speaker 1: Now '71 [1971] a Velvelette song 'These Things Will Keep Me Loving You' becomes a hit in the UK [United Kingdom].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And it reaches number thirty-four on the charts.  Is it--now I've heard when we interviewed Martha [HistoryMaker Martha Reeves] of Martha Reeves and The Vandellas [Martha and The Vandellas], she was talking about how big a hit they are in the UK and other groups, I mean, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh we found that to be true.
Speaker 1: Motown [Motown Records] is big in the UK, bigger than it is here.
Speaker 2: Yes they've got shows over there, impersonators well you can go to Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] where you can really find impersonators.  But they have people over there that are impersonating groups big time. And they've been doing it for years.  They can't stop them from doing that unless they are going over there trying to be and act as that particular artist.
Speaker 1: So as long as say they're just an impersonator--
Speaker 2: They don't have to even say that.  Say for instance Dennis Edwards featuring The Temptations. Or The Temptations featuring Dennis [The Temptations Review featuring Dennis Edwards]--there is a certain wording because they got sued--Otis [HistoryMaker Otis Clayborn Williams] sued Dennis, and Richard [Richard Street] was in another group.  There were about four Temp groups running around the United States.  They all cannot sing under the auspices of being The Temptations.  They have to use--it has to be worded and phrased another way.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. I was told that The Velvelettes owned their own name.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Which is different from other groups.  The record company did not own your name and so you can decide who is a Velvelette and who isn't and who gets credit for being one, and.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay. And do you st-, you still get royalties from your songs--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --today?
Story_ID: 656992
Speaker 1: Now the group [The Velvelettes] got back together again in, I think it was '84 [1984]?
Speaker 2: Eighty--
Speaker 1: Eighty- '86 [1986]?
Speaker 2: (Speaking off camera) When was that you went to Toronto [Canada], remember when your daughter went to Toronto to hear her sing for our twenty-fifth?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): (Unclear).
Speaker 2: The indication that I have here is that it was '84 [1984] that you reunited for a concert appearance--
Speaker 1: That's 'cause we were contacted by Max Oates.
Speaker 2: Max Oates and who is Max Oates (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was the disc jockey here in Flint [Michigan], oldies but goodies--oldies and goldies record, record station, he was a disc jockey.  I think he's on the East Coast now.  We don't hear from him.  We went--we performed in Baltimore--Boston [Massachusetts] and he showed up, we hadn't seen him for years.  But he got in contact with us and that's how we got back together and then we did a concert at--we did an acapella concert at Western [Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan] via Bertha [HistoryMaker Bertha McNeal] and some people down there that she knew, a women's conference or something. And--
Speaker 2: Yeah the Concerned Professional Black Women's Roundtable Conference of Southwest Michigan [sic. Concerned Black Women's Roundtable Conference of Southwest Michigan].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And we did that but Max Oates is the one. And then he decides to get Marv Johnson, ourselves, Mary Wells, Junior Walker and The All-Stars and did two shows.  One here at The Whiting [Flint, Michigan] and one in Saginaw [Michigan] and Mary Wells disappeared at the one in Saginaw. She claimed she--somebody--something happened.  She got kidnapped or something, some really crazy thing that happened I can't even remember.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Dress--clothes got lost or something.  But Max Oates is the one that got us back together.
Story_ID: 656993
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about--now at a certain point in '80s [1980s] you, you went on a London [England] tour, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And rerecorded your hits for a company called Nightmare Records.  That was run by Ian Levine?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now is he the same person with all the Motorcity Records?
Speaker 2: I ca- I--I can't remember, I don't know a lot about his (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah something was created called Motorcity Records too over there.  I think he's--I'm pretty sure he is the one.  And so, now did you--these are songs that you already recorded over here so was there any legal--I mean what was the legal (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well their laws are different over there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's--we weren't told but we also did a few new recordings with him and they were on a big record but it wasn't a 33 [33 1/3 rpm record] or it wasn't a 78 [78 rpm record], I can't remember what their counterpart is to an album over there.  'Running Out Of Luck' I think was one of them and there was another one.  Yeah he redid some songs while we were there because he, he downloaded them on a video and we see them online now.  So we don't know--their laws are just different over there.  First of all they know you're not going to be running back and forth to demand money, et cetera.  You've got to hire a lawyer--you've got to go over there and do that stuff.  And they know you're not going to do that it's too expensive and it's not that it can't be done over there they just need to be up- honest and upfront.  He was not honest and upfront with giving us information as to how that was going to be done.  Then he got my sister [HistoryMaker Cal Street] and Marv Johnson to do a song together. But nowadays you don't go in the studio, they had to pay you.  Back then they don't pay you to go in the studio; you had to pay them to use their studio (laughter) back then. Dub, dub--when you go in to make your record, all the dubbing sessions that you had they just put it on your bill--your tab and you owe them.  But nowadays record companies today will pay you depending on what you sound like.  Now your demos and stuff, you've got to get somebody to hear something before they even take you on.  But nowadays they pay you to make a record.  I mean, I think they do it a little bit differently now.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now you all over the years have done things.  Like you've done the national anthem for the Tigers [Detroit Tigers] game--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --for the Pistons [Detroit Pistons], and you got a thirtieth anniversary celebration performance in Canada.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's the one that Larry [Larry Turner] and his girls came to over there yeah.  And my brother used to do background vocals for us to for a hot minute.
Speaker 1: Okay. So is he a singer?
Speaker 2: He was yeah.  He and my sister had a group. I mean they were--I can't remember what they called themselves.  You'll have to ask her she'll give you that information (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. A new CD [compact disc] was released by Motown [Motown Records] called 'The Very Best of The Velvelettes' in 1999, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Fifteen tracks. What do you consider your very best songs?
Speaker 2: Oh I love 'There He Goes' and 'He's Really Saying Something' [sic. 'He Was Really Sayin' Somethin''] and 'Lonely Girl' ['Lonely Girl Am I'] those were it for me.
Speaker 1: What would you consider the highlight of your activities with The Velvelettes your career as a singer?
Speaker 2: Well I think way back in the day, we, we totally enjoyed making new records and doing the sock hops and then as you got older that changed because you were busy, you were in and out.  Then when we got the chance to go to London [England], that was--we were there for about a month.  They put us up in an apartment right down the street from Buckingham Palace [London, England], Hyde Park [London, England].  I think we were there maybe it wasn't quite a month.  We had a road manager, took us to all the venues and they were very, very--they treated us very nice like carte blanche and they've always done that every time we've been to London.  We've been there many times.  As a matter of fact we just got back about a month or so--well April--we were there in April for a week.  And we don't know when they are going to have us back.  They might have us back next year. Usually we've been going about every other year.
Story_ID: 656994
Speaker 1: We sing here too but people are not--they're not being user friendly, I'll put it that way.  People have asked, "How come you're not singing downtown?" I say, "They've got to hire us. You know. They know we live here, people know where we're at.  We have a website if they want us they know how to get a hold of us."
Speaker 2: Do people around here generally know who you are?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm. Yeah we've done quite a few things here in Flint [Michigan].  Priva- some private sector things, but yes we've done quite a few.  We've done the library here in Flint, we've done the river fest downtown, waterfront--riverfront stuff, we've done the Flint Symphony [Flint Symphony Orchestra].  They know we're here.
Speaker 2: Did being a Velvelette--how did that affect your being a nurse in an operating room and that sort of thing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That--when we had--as a matter of fact when we did our thirty year thing in Canada it was a Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  Thursday and Friday what happened? Oh someone covered for me and I got back at midnight.  The next night I got sick after the show so I called in.  Monday morning I got called in the office with a newspaper--they pulled a newspaper out and said to me, "You called in sick, but we see here where you performed in Canada."  I said, "Hold up, hold up, hold up. If you're looking correctly the performance started at eight o'clock, we were out at nine.  If you remember correctly the night before was the same thing and I came to work, I had someone to cover for me until midnight and agreed to do that.  The next night I called in sick, I did not call in sick while I was performing down in, in Canada." I was done.  I really didn't feel like going to work--coming to work.  I really didn't feel well, but it had nothing to do with me having another job and that was the emphasis.  So I had to say, "I'm sure that when you, and you work at the race track every night when you get off from work that's another job I never see anyone complaining about that.  So what's your point?  I did not call in during the time that I was somewhere else."  So they just never came back to me with that but that created a problem.  One time I showed up that same weekend, I flew in the night I was late. Bertha [HistoryMaker Bertha McNeal] and Norma [HistoryMaker Norma Fairhurst] both had to go to the hospital with me and sit in the lobby and then I had to run upstairs to go to work and Bertha's mother [Emergine Harris Barbee] came and picked them up from the hospital.  And that was (laughter)--we did that real quick.  So I'm going to work, I take my--I've got all this glitter all over myself, I've got to change clothes, put my scrubs on, you know, and I come in there, "Millie [HistoryMaker Mildred Gill Arbor], Millie, where--what did you do tonight?"  'Cause I wouldn't tell them a lot 'cause they, you know, people are just sometimes mean with stuff.  But they were busy trying to find out when stuff came out in the paper.  I never told them they just all of sudden they'd end up in the nurse's lounge.  There it was, "Oh you did--." "Yeah. No it wasn't during work hours."  They had a little thing with that during work hours, no.  One time we would go to London [England] and they gave me the dates, I scheduled the dates at work then the London dates changed, I couldn't change my time at work.  I didn't go with them that time they just went with three of them.  Two of them, well Bertha, Carol [HistoryMaker Cal Street] and Norm went; I didn't go 'cause I couldn't get off from work.  I couldn't change my days but it never happened again.
Story_ID: 656995
Speaker 1: So these days--I mean in the past, say in the past ten, ten years how, how often have you travelled with The Velvelettes?
Speaker 2: Oh my Lord, I can't even count (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is it like once a month maybe or once every two months, a couple of times a year?
Speaker 2: It's not--it just varies. It just varies. Some months we might do a couple of shows and then we might not do anything for six months.  We're not out there like people would think--we don't work that much.  One of the reasons with that is because when we were working, we could not go and everything was based on whether Carol [HistoryMaker Cal Street] could go or not and she was still working.  So then if we were not--if we were working and couldn't go, we would work with three people but we haven't worked that much.  We don't work--I mean, because that's not our only thing that we do.  Like those people that do it every single day, like every month they're at a venue, every single month, that's their job.  Well look at the people in Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] they do that every night.  When Larry [Larry Turner] and I were in Vegas, we went to see Human Nature the group that Smokey [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson] introduced to The Venetian [The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada] down there.  They are excellent.  Have you heard them?  They do a Motown [Motown Records] show and they're from Australia. Good, excellent.  We went to see them. But that's all they do, they've been singing since they were twelve or thirteen years old and now they're here in Vegas.  There is no telling how long they'll stay there.  You know some of those pe--look at Celine Dion she's still there--been there that's their job.  We don't work like that; we've never worked like that.  We've haven't--we've never been at that level, I'll put it that way. And once you have that set in place and that's what you do, that's what you're going to do.  Don't sidetrack 'cause if you sidetrack and you don't have something else laid out there for you--because we were all fortunate enough to have something else other than singing.  And you know a few times I know Mary [Mary Wells] used to mention that to us. "Girls wanna be--you're glad that you went to school and you have other things you can do other than singing and another career," and you know, we've just been tapped into that.
Story_ID: 656996
Speaker 1: You know I was reflecting on talent with, with Norma [HistoryMaker Norma Fairhurst].  We were talk--talking about talent and opportunity. And sometimes people are big, are bigger than their talent actually--become bigger personality-wise than in talent actually.  Many great talents don't, don't get a chance to--they're never popular for some reason--one reason or another.  There is a story that she told me that you all won some sort of a contest that [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy staged with the Motown [Motown Records] stars.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah the Battle of the Stars.
Speaker 1: Battle of the Stars and you all out performed, at least to the general public, The Supremes.
Speaker 2: Right. But I think that--everything that happened during that time, I think it was developed to happen that way.  I think it was set up to happen that way.
Speaker 1: Okay so you don't--that it's just something that happened on its own, it was something that was fixed (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No I'm not saying it was fixed, we did do better than them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were. But (laughter) I won't say anything else.  It wasn't going to stay that way.  I'm a little bit more realistic in terms of thinking, oh okay I wonder what's going to happen next time or how long is this going to happen or are we going to be doing this forever or are we going to get a really, really a hit--number one hit record?  And when they start talking about payola then I thought oh Lord.  I didn't know what that was but then I found out how certain records are played and how certain people are put on the top and I'm sure that happened in some of the companies.  I'm not saying that it happened at Motown but I'm just saying that's a possibility that those things happened.  So they know who they want up top--up front and you come with a record that's out of sight.  Now I listen to all this rap stuff that's going on now and I mean it's just so many. The music has changed so much but one thing that hasn't changed that Motown sound they play it.  There are shows that do it, the Motown sound all the time.  I just did a Motown lip sync of a lot of different groups, people were lip syncing it and I actually have been lip syncing our songs for the last four years as a fundraiser for the college.  Every time they do that they do the Temps [The Temptations] they do Ray Charles, they just do people from that era that people still enjoy coming and listening to so that's a plus.  But I think that back then, we did not know that the impact was going to be either positive or negative.  But we found out with respect to all of our efforts and energies that we put into you know, working with the recording companies and some of the ups and downs with that and how it worked.  Of course we wouldn't know that, those things are not shared with the artists by no means.  You have managers that take care of all that.  But nowadays it's a little bit different. And I applaud those who have been able to tap into it and tap into getting with people who are going to be honest with you to tell you exactly what the deal is.  But for the most part sometimes it's not, all the information is not there for you to get.
Story_ID: 656997
Speaker 1: So when you look back at everything you've done to this point in your career is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could change something?
Speaker 2: I don't--I think not.  I think that everything that was done was done for a reason.  I think that everything that happened happened for a reason.  If it had been anything different it would have turned out differently and we don't know that, we can't foresee that.  So I'm happy with the way everything turned out, I really am.
Story_ID: 656998
Speaker 1: It's unfortunate that we were not put in the jar with everybody else and I think that was designed that way because Mrs. Edwards [Esther Gordy Edwards] made a comment to us one time.  We took her out--she and Mrs. Powell [HistoryMaker Maxine Powell] out to lunch one time and there was a comment made that we were put on the shelf for a reason.  She didn't say--we knew what she meant.
Speaker 2: What reason can that be?
Speaker 1: Well we were not from Detroit [Michigan] first and foremost and the majority of the entertainers down there were from the Detroit area.  Now the only ones that were not were The Marvelettes but they were so close that they were able to get there.  See we could only go down there on weekends.
Speaker 2: Where were The Marvelettes from?
Speaker 1: I think it was Inkster [Michigan] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They're from In- Inkster yeah that's--well most people consider that Detroit.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. So we could only go down there on the weekends.  They could go down there Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday right after school and that's what a lot of them did.  They stayed in that studio, we could not do that.  So I think when we took Mrs. Edwards and Mrs. Powell out to lunch that time she made reference to that.  That we were not going to be--we were not the chosen.
Speaker 2: Being there most of the time does (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We could have been.
Speaker 2: Yeah okay.
Speaker 1: But because the other groups were having a problem with us being there because we were from Kalamazoo [Michigan], well where is Kalamazoo?  Nobody even knew about Kalamazoo.  I think there were some comments made and then some of the records that we did make I didn't particularly care for them.  They weren't--I mean if you listen to the CDs [compact disc] and you'll understand.
Speaker 2: So you were really at the mercy of the songwriters.
Speaker 1: Well yeah and what are they writing for us?  Now The Supremes did a song that we didn't want but they got it.  I think it was 'Baby Love' if I'm not mistaken.  But we were at the mercy of the writers and the writers had to really do a song that's really going to do something like 'Cloud Nine' and Mary Wells' stuff and whoever.  They weren't doing that kind of stuff with us and ours was a little bit different just to, just to appease us I think to a certain point.  I might be wrong.
Story_ID: 656999
Speaker 1: Once again when you look back at everything you've done to this point in your career, musical and medical, I mean, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well The Velvelettes, my career 'cause I was in healthcare but I helped--a lot of my students have become registered nurses. And then my working with the City of Flint [Michigan], human relations, solving disputes against neighbors that had disputes with each other, I belonged to that group and Big Brothers and Big Sisters [Big Brothers Big Sisters of Flint and Genesee County].  I really have given a lot of my years to them and I didn't start doing it until after I retired 'cause they wanted me to do it before and I said this is just too much.  Then I've got two granddaughters, I've got the oldest one--well they are both in dance and tumbling classes right now.  The one lives down south, so my son just got back and went and picked her up.  She's going to be here for the whole summer.  And so they--all grandkids look at what parents and grandparents do with them and they talk about it.  So I'd like to legacy with them with respect to education, with respect to staying in school and hopefully they'll be able to learn something that I have been able to pass on to them particularly with healthcare, particularly with volunteering for certain agencies that have children who are in need of some type of mentoring process. And that's--you know, Big Brothers and Big Sisters I've played a very important part with some of the little sisters in that group.
Story_ID: 657000
Speaker 1: Well tell us about your children.  Now you ha- you have how many?
Speaker 2: I have three; I have a daughter and two sons.  None of them are married but my middle son has two children. They are five and fou- I mean six and five now.  My daughter graduated from college, my two sons have two years of college but they didn't graduate--they didn't finish.  And my daughter and my son they both live here.  My other son doesn't live here but none of them married and they may have picked that up from me being divorced, some of the issues that you run through when you're divorced and you have certain issues that you have to address.  Kids in school, parent teacher conferences, the meetings, community things that your kids need to belong to.  It was all on me to do all that. And when I started back to school, I only went to school when they were in school during the day.  Some of the neighbors that I didn't know when I moved over here they didn't know what I did.  They never knew I went to work at night 'cause I went when people were in the bed and one of the neighbors says, "We just thought you were a lady of the night."  I said, "What do you mean a lady of the night?"  "Well you know what a lady of the--," and I said, "No I don't know what you mean, what are you talking about?"  And then when she told me I said, "Well when you see me leaving in the morning, I'm going to class, when you see me coming in the morning, I'm coming in from work."  I had to literally explain to some of the neighbors what I did because they literally thought I was a lady of the night.  I thought why would you think that?  "Well we never saw you going to work on a job but we saw you coming in and leaving in the morning and coming in early in the morning."  "Yeah I was getting off from work and in the morning when you saw me going down the street after my kids went to school I was going to school--I was going to college.  I was in nurses training then." It took me five years but I got through.  So it paid off and I'm glad I did what I did and I did a lot of it by myself.  Some assistance, I had a lot of babysitters I'll tell you that, but then when I started working nights and my kids got older it got much better.
Story_ID: 657001
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black commu- community today?
Speaker 2: I--well we've got a lot of crime going on and I think the--because some of the job opportunities that are not here.  I think also that everybody can't be an A student and I think those that are B or C students sometimes it's more difficult for them to latch on to a job and keep it because they've got to have transportation, they've got to make the money to buy stuff.  They've got to make money to buy a car.  The churches are the biggest organization that can put a dent in the thought process of kids in terms of being in gangs, stealing from people, breaking into homes.  You know you hear gun shots--I hear gun shots more than I ever have and there's a trend with gun shots.  Parents need to do some stuff with their kids to teach them but the problem with that is a bunch of the parents are in that group of destructive behavior.  So you try to get to them. And I know it's difficult.  The police department can't do it by themselves.  The churches can't do it by themselves.  Somebody has to stand up to the plate and say, "Hey this is what we're going to do." And then I belong to the block club.  I have a block club that I belong to. And we go out and a lot of people are afraid to go outside anymore.  When I came up you didn't have to lock your doors, you better lock your doors now.  Or you see people now, I don't have bars on my windows but a lot of people have bars on their windows.  But these teenage kids unfortunately are doing the dirty deeds and sometimes the parents are.  We have a red alert system in our neighborhood.  If somebo- if something happens we get a phone call.  It tells us where it is, tells us to keep on the lookout for strangers, et cetera that's doing the crime.  So I wish that--you know when I had my class there were so many women that just don't get it.  I've had to literally take them to the side and say, "Look this is what I did and you can do the same thing.  You've got to start small but if you stick to it and if you need some help I'll show you how to do it."  I had to do that. Several of my students are registered nurses now and I'm sure it probably had a lot to do with either what I said to them or somebody else did but I can't get everybody.  Everybody is not going to do that.
Story_ID: 657002
Speaker 1: Is there anything we haven't talked about that we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I, I can't think of anything but if you do be sure and give me a call.
Speaker 1: Okay 'cause you're not going to answer it now (laughter). All right. Well the last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Ma'am how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh how would I like to be remembered?  I would like to be remembered as a person who has come through leaps and bounds whether they be difficult or easy or mediocre, have managed to get through all of them.  The obstacles that were in place, I had to go around them up underneath them or do something a little bit differently. And I say a lot to young women to always reach for your goals and admirations, tap into what you feel you want to do in terms of career.  You can get that starting off in junior high school, grade school.  Kids have things that they enjoy doing and try to tap into those things.  And find out what their goals are.  When I was coming up I rarely heard anybody talk about goals and aspirations at all. They just never did.  There was no--you just went to school and when you graduated from high school nobody encouraged you to go to college.  My parents [Dora McDonald Gill and Willie Gill] couldn't afford to send me to college I just decided to go. And it's costly.  Back then there weren't a whole lot of people that had a whole bunch of kids going to college in that time.  Fortunately my brother Billy [Billy Gill]--Willie--Charles [Charles Gill] and myself we all priv- we all went to Western [Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan] but that doesn't say that other people can't go because they can.  I have a couple of nieces that graduated from Western but they went there on a scholarship, gymnastics.  They were the only African American girls on Western's gymnastic team in Kalamazoo [Michigan] and there are just opportunities that are there.  If you see them you need to grab them.  Always have somebody as a mentor, always seek out those people who are positive, always seek out those people who are about getting involved, doing volunteer work.  Volunteer work, a lot of people don't like doing because you don't get paid.  I've done it for I don't know how many years.  I don't get paid it doesn't bother me but I feel good because I made somebody else--gave somebody else the opportunity to tap into some other type of idea in terms of career, in terms of what they want to do.  My little sister just graduated from Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] with her bachelor's in criminal justice.  So I say, "You need to go to law school so you can back to Flint [Michigan] and be a judge." And she doesn't want to go to law school but now I'm mentoring her sister.  I take them to church, I take them shopping, I've taken them down to the Motown Museum [Detroit, Michigan], both of them.  And you don't find--you've got to have more people doing stuff like that.  There are organizations that do and I think the church is where a lot of the things that are going to be done particularly to your men.  Young men very--I mean--the only--you don't hear about the mentoring projects that they have for young men.  I know there is a 100 Men's [100 Black Men of America, Inc.] group but every church should have at least ten, twenty young men in their community involved with their church doing something.  They don't have to be at church everyday just do it and we have a few churches that do that.  So I would just like to be remembered by my involvement in the community.  What I was able to give to them and I would hope they would be able to give it back.
