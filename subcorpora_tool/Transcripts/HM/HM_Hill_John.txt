Story_ID: 290866
Speaker 1: Now, let's begin Mr. Hill [HistoryMaker John Nathan Hill] (clearing throat), excuse me, talking about your mother.  Starting with your mother's name and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --where your mother was born and where she spent her childhood and grew up as a girl.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My mother's name is Blanche Hollis Hill.  Her maiden name is Hollis and she was born in a small town in South Georgia, called Dixie, and it's in Brooks County [Georgia].  One of the things in Georgia, we always refer to not only the location of the city but also what county you lived in because there was some delineations, you know, as to, to each county.  And, she--but, she grew up in that community.  She was part of a reasonably good sized family.  She had four brothers and one sister.  And, they were, they were children of a minister's mini--their father was a minister and my grandfather.  And, their mother was, was quite a very, very nice first lady of the church, if you will.  Their names were Eddie [Hollis] and Nellie Hollis.  But, she, she grew up--went to Brooks County Training School [Dixie, Georgia], I think it's what it may have been called then.  And, that was in 1919.  She was born January 25th of 1919.  So, she's eighty-six years old now.  She went to, to school; went to college to be a school teacher at Fort Valley State College [Fort Valley State University] in Fort Valley, Georgia.  She taught school for thirty-five years.
Story_ID: 290867
Speaker 1: Did she [Hill's mother, Blanche Hollis Hill] ever share any stories with you about what life was like for her as a girl growing up, and some of the things that she endured--enjoyed doing as a girl?
Speaker 2: Well, she, well of course, as a young lady, she enjoyed playing with, with her, not only her siblings, siblings but also other members of the community, and cousins who lived in that area.  Because it--there were a lot of relatives of the family; first cousins, second cousins who lived in the, the area of--in that Dixie, Brooks County [Georgia] area.  So, she enjoyed doing that.  And, she enjoyed playing as she said, playing school.  Because you fi- I think apparently, it was very popular for young women at that stage to, to go into the teaching profession.  Of course, she sometime enjoyed going to church.  Her father [Eddie Hollis] was always, you know, one who made sure that they stayed very close to, to the church.  And, they were very involved in, in the church activities.  So, she spent quite a bit of time doing that.
Speaker 1: And, how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: Beautiful lady, and very strong will, very outspoken, determined to achieve and to get what she believes she wants in life and out of life.  She is one who cares about people, about others.  A servant, I would say, of the, of the community and a servant of others.  Even at her young age of eighty-six now she still drives.  She walks about three times a week, about three miles each day.  And, she goes fishing.  She loves to fish.  And, being in South Georgia, the temperature there is moderate enough mostly year 'round, where she can enjoy that sport.  And, she take others with her who are even younger than she is.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And, her buddies, her fishing buddies.  She, she has been very active in her church there.  Again, I'm sure that stemmed a lot from her, her childhood.  But, she, she just recently retired from being the financial secretary of the church for forty-one years.
Speaker 1: Wow!
Speaker 2: And, but she, she's a very caring, very soft spoken person until she wants to get a point across.  Yes.
Speaker 1: And, did she grow up on a farm, or was it more of a community?
Speaker 2: Community.  It was more a community.  Her--there was farming around her because certainly a lot of the other landowners around their, their particular property did farm tobacco, cotton, peanuts, you know, potatoes, sweet potatoes, those kind of crops.  And, but, she did not necessary grow up on a, on a farm herself.
Speaker 1: Did she ever talk about her community that she grew up in?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was a close-knit community, you know.  And, it was one of those--it was very small.  And, it was one of those communities where kinda everybody knew each other.  And, I think, you know, over the--especially during the, the Clinton era [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton] they talked about it takes a, a village as opposed to--to raise a child.  It took the community.  And, maybe it wasn't looked at as being a village, but, but it was that community that helped raise each other's kids.  Each family depending on each other to do that.  And, so, it was a very close knit community.  And, it was very similar to what I grew up in.
Story_ID: 290868
Speaker 1: Let's talk now about your father.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Starting with your father's name and where he was born and where he spent his childhood growing up.
Speaker 2: Okay.  His name was Napoleon Hill.  And, he, he was born in Boston, Georgia, Thomas County.  And, he, he was born in 1918, September the 10th, 1918.  And, he passed away, unfortunately in August of '89 [1989].  He was a, a very energetic, very, I would say, outspoken person, too.  Quite opinionated.  And, he was one who did, I would say, he, he had what I considered to be a high level, a high degree of common sense, if you will.  And, he, he did not go any further, I believe, than about the sixth grade.  Because his father, whose name is John Hill, wanted him to work with, with the family in there--now, they were farmers.  Big farmers.  They owned quite a bit of property there in Thomas County.  And, he was needed to, to help--along with his brothers and sisters to help with the farm.  But, he was quite--as he grew and developed through, through the years, he, he became very entrepreneurial in his way about things.  So, he was very creative and very industrial, industrious.  But, he was also a, again, a very advocate believer in young people, in kids.  And, so, he always wanted to help in any way he could.  He also was a very good, an excellent provider for, for our family, in so many different ways, you know.  Not only just being there when you needed him as far as our activities were concerned, but spiritually.  He was very active in his church and the church that I grew up in, Trinity Missionary Baptist Church in Boston.  He was head of the deacon board there.  He also ended up owning his own dry cleaners in Boston.  And, it was the only African American dry cleaning business in Boston.  He, as I mentioned, was very much into farm and both in livestock, as well as, what they call the truck crops, such as beans and peas and watermelon and okra, and that type of thing.
Speaker 1: So, did he farm when you were a little boy--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as well?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  We got involved in that too.  He also was head of a, he was elected president of the Parents Teacher's Association [Parent Teacher Association (PTA)] which he served, I think, for several years.  He was president of the Bambooster's Club [ph.].  I mean, and, he--but, he was just involved.  And, for someone who only had a sixth grade education, I admired him.  I thought he was an excellent role model for me and for others, you know, in the community, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, did he ever talk about how his father, your paternal grandparents, how they came to own their land?
Speaker 2: It, it was over time, you know.  They were at one point sharecroppers.  They were a big, big family; the Hill family was.  And, the people that owned the land who hap- they were also white, but they allowed them to acquire, acquire some of the land.  Some through just giving, but others through buying and investing their monies and pooling their resources, they were able to buy up a lot of this land.  And, eventually, in my father's case, some of his cousins and al- first cousins and also sisters and brothers decided to get rid of their land.  They didn't want to, to work it, work it any longer.  So, he proceeded to buy it.  And, so that's how he ended up acquiring a lot of the land that we still own; quite a bit of it.
Story_ID: 290869
Speaker 1: Do you know how your parents [Blanche Hollis Hill and Napoleon Hill] met?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They somehow, I think, even though he lived in Thomas County [Georgia], and my mother lived in Brooks County [Georgia]; they're only about eight, eight--ten miles apart, or something of that nature.  And, I think it was at a school function that my mother was involved in, and he happened to be--a friend of a friend that introduced him to her.  And, at first, you know, he, he was coming on, you know, pretty strong, she said.  She didn't care anything for him.  And told that boy to go on and get out the (laughter) out of her life or what have you.  But, he was persistent.  And, it paid off in the long run, so they ended up getting married.
Story_ID: 290870
Speaker 1: Let's talk now a little bit about your grandparents--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --starting with your paternal grandparents, the Hills.  And, can you tell us their names again?
Speaker 2: John Hill and Gussie [Baker] Hill.  And, they were also--ones I would say--. I, you know, I knew both of my paternal and maternal grandparents.  But, I knew them probably better, the Hills, because they were in Brooks County [Georgia] and they lived not too far from where we lived.  And, until I became of school age, I stayed with them along with my father's [Napoleon Hill] brother's children.  And, so, we all kinda hung out there, if you will.  And, they looked out, looked out for, for us.  They were fantastic people.  And, they also, you know, I grew up in a family that it seemed all, everybody was kind of involved in the community, or involved in church; very close to church and, and their religion.  And, that over time, I'm sure had its impact; had a tremendous positive impact on the way we, we grew up.  And, what we carried with us as we left the community of Boston [Georgia].  But, they were also farmers too.  And, they raised chickens and pigs and my grandmother was an excellent cook, I thought.  She could cook anything.  And, made it taste so good.  And, she also had remedies for any of your ailments, you know, she could come up with some concoctions that were terrible (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of 'em?
Speaker 2: Castor oil.  Castor oil and ginger ale, I believe is what, what they mixed or something like that.  The ginger ale was to help cut it a little bit and to make it so it's a little bit more pleasant to the taste going down.  But it was supposed to rid you of a lot of things.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You know, and I won't into and elaborate what all those were.  But, but she was, she was an excellent cook.  I can remember her cooking blackberries dumplings and dumpling pie or something like that.  Where she made dumplings out of flour and rolled it up and then you had the blackberries that we would go out and pick.  And, she would co- mix sugar with them.  And, then cook it down, and then put those dumplings in there and cooked it 'til it got a little bit--I mean, they were very sweet but it was excellent.  And, but, they were, they were great people as well and people that we as children certainly respected them highly but, we, we, we loved them because they, they really did a great job in looking out for us.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, what about your maternal grandparents.  What were their names?
Speaker 2: Eddie [Hollis] and Nellie Hollis.  And, as I mentioned earlier, my grandfather was a minister in the church for many years.  Very proud person, but one who also--here I go again, you know, they, they, they cared about people and invested a lot of their time and energy in serving others.  And, they, and also being, if you will, strong leaders if--for not only for the community but for our family, and for their family.  And, he also, by profession was a--and I don't remember the proper name--but he was one that was very good at taking straw, that they had at the time, and it was a special kind of straw, and weaving it to make chairs and stools and ottomans, if you will, for people in the community.  Then he would sell it to them.  And, he passed that on to his, his sons.  And, one of his sons whose name is Will or William Hollis, picked it up and he carried it on to--until he died.  But, it was his profession.  He ended up moving to Pennsylvania but they were, they were--. And my grandmother was very soft spoken.  But, a beautiful lady who had very, very nice features, facial features and, but she was also very proper I always thought, you know.  Every time I saw her, she was dressed very nicely, even if she was working around the house. And--but also very supportive of her husband and granddaddy, in the church and, as well in the community.
Story_ID: 290871
Speaker 1: And how far back can you trace your ancestry?
Speaker 2: Not as far, I think, my grandparents are as far as I can remember.  And, I've taken the time over the years to start piecing together more about our ancestors prior to them.  And, in that piecing together is in the form of videotaping.  When I find someone in the family who knows a lot more about the family history, I have been recording it and putting it on tape.  Haven't taken the time to really take it out and edit it.  We, we have, for examples, family reunions now on my maternal side of the family. My--the Hollis family.  We, we've had family union--family reunion every year for the last forty-five years.  We're gonna have one coming up in July [2005], which would be the forty-sixth family reunion.  And, I haven't been able to make all of them, of course, but I've made a lot of them.  And, it's a beautiful time where we get together and we talk about the history.  We talk about as far back as our ancestors are.  There's three people that are living from that first generation now.  And, so, we're trying to get as much information from them.
Story_ID: 290872
Speaker 1: Tell me, what is your earliest memory of growing up?  Like, what is one of the very first things that you remember as a child?
Speaker 2: I would say, Christmas.  It seemed--it was like, it was a very special time of the year.  And, I would always look forward to Santa Claus coming (laughter).  And, as far as gifts, I don't remember exactly, maybe some of my early play things.  But, I do remember getting a train set and at one, one year, which I thought it was fascinating to have some--a train running around on the tracks.  And, I also remember at one time I got--I like--I used to watch a lot of TV which was black and white at the early time we were growing up.  And, I remember the first time we got our TV, and we got a TV for Christmas.  And, I used to watch a lot of the westerns on there at that time, you know.  And, I always felt that I needed to have me, two guns and a holster (laughter).  And, a cowboy hat--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You know.  So, I wanted to be a cowboy.  So, I remember getting that early in my life.
Story_ID: 290873
Speaker 1: And, I also remember the times that we stayed, again, with my [paternal] grandmother, and this was Gussie [Baker] Hill, and some of my other cousins.  And, some of the games that we would play and the things we would do.  And, this was before, of course, before we started school.
Speaker 2: What kinds of games?  Do you remember some of the games?
Speaker 1: Well, we played hopscotch, I suppose that's the name of it.  And, we--and shooting marbles, you know, I learned how to shoot marbles early.
Speaker 2: Were you pretty good?
Speaker 1: I got to be pretty good.  And, and I had quite a collection at one time.  And, now I wished I had kept them.  Because they were some unusual marbles that I had with all kinds of different colors and size.  And, then we used to play a lot of hide and go seek.  That was, you know, it didn't take much to do that, you know.  But, you would play, it was a wonderful game.  And, then we would try to, I would say, mimic some of our elders, because again, we spent a lot of time in church [Trinity Missionary Baptist Church, Boston, Georgia] so (laughter), so we would have those of us--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --who would get up a preach (laughter).  And, then--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --you would have your, your deacons and your--the deaconesses are the ladies, you know, who would be saying, amen.  So, we would have church occasionally, and that was playing.  But, it was, it was fun.  And, then we would sing.  We would try to sing some of the songs that we listened to on the radio.  Because, at--early on, we didn't have TV.  And, so, we spent a lot of time listening to the radio.
Story_ID: 290874
Speaker 1: What other memories do you have of growing up?  Like, were, were holidays big events in your home (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: That kind of thing, Thanksgiving, Easter, birthdays?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  Those were very, very, very good times.  Birthdays, you know, one of the things I say today is my mother [Blanche Hollis Hill] particularly, was very, very good about remembering special occasions like your birthday.  And, she always wanted to do something special for you.  And, even 'til today's date, she remembers all of our birthdays.  And, she also tries to remember the, the kids' birthdays, and, our children's birthday.  And, do something, send a card.  She likes to give something whether it's a savings bond or something of that nature.  But, I remember also, you know, Thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving was a big time, you know, mainly for us, young, like it was a lot of food.  And (laughter) even though we, we felt good, you know, and I don't, I don't think I ever had a feeling during--in my childhood and even in my later years, adolescents and what have you, that I felt that we were deprived of anything.  Because, our parents were very good providers.  Whether they had the resources to do that or not, but I never felt that we didn't have it.  So, but, special times like Thanksgiving.  Easter was also a great time because we would, my mother would make sure we got involved in coloring, if you will, the Easter eggs.  And, putting little caricatures on them or what have you.  That was done not only at home with our family, but also it was at church, and then it would be at school.  So, you, you'd have all of those celebrations going on.  And, then we would have to learn for, for Easter, there was always an Easter program at church [Trinity Missionary Baptist Church, Boston, Georgia].  And we would have to learn a special verse to say; scared to death to get up in front of someone to say a verse that you had to learn.  And, our Sunday school teachers would always give us those verses and say, "You need to learn this Nathan [HistoryMaker John Nathan Hill]" we're gonna--for Easter.  And, that was my Easter speech.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And then, getting, also getting new clothes.  That was also a big thing.  You'd probably get a new suit then, you know.  And, the ladies always wore their beautiful hats and they would all come out looking--I think the girls would have their nice pretty dresses on.  Christmas was another time; big event.  And, again, we would be involved in skits or we would be involved in saying something during the Christmas program that you were involved in, and the exchange of gifts.  So, that was also a big time.  Halloween I would say would be another one, because we always dressed up in something.  And, even if it was something that we found at home and my mother would cut the holes out of a, of a sheet or whatever.  I mean, you know, so that we could just have something for our, our holiday.
Story_ID: 290875
Speaker 1: Could you please give us your siblings' names and their birth order, including yourself?
Speaker 2: Okay.  It's only two of us.  And, my sister is Katie Irene Hamilton [Katie Hill Hamilton].  She, and she was born on September the 23rd.  And, she's three years--1950.  She's three years younger than I am.  And, I was born, again, on November the 19th, 1947.  And, so the two, it was just, as I stated, the two of us in the family.  And, we've maintained a very close contact and relationship over all these years.  And, she currently lives in Yeadon, Pennsylvania.  She's married to Dwayne Hamilton.  And, they met at school at Wilberforce University in Wilberforce, Ohio.  They have two children.  Two sons.  And, one of them is a, an entertainer and a performer on, on the Carnival Cruise Lines, I believe.  Yeah, he's a wonderful singer; a great voice.  And, the younger son, Khalil [Hamilton]; the other one's name is Dwayne Hamilton, Jr., and the younger one is Khalil.  He's, he's involved in working with kids.  He just graduated not too long ago in a Pennsylvania school with honors.  And, so, he's doing great work too, again, in the community, doing something like that.
Story_ID: 290876
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of the street that you lived on growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And, don't laugh; Railroad Avenue [Boston, Georgia].
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Railroad Avenue in a little small community called Bellevue [ph.].  And, this was a part of Boston.  And, you have to understand, Boston was only about 2,500 people.  And, but, we had all the different, all the different communities, and we happened to live in Bellevue.  And, of course, Railroad Avenue was a street that ran right beside a railroad.  And--.
Speaker 1: And, can you kinda described your community for us; the community that you grew up in?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, it was, of course, all African Americans and, it was again, one of those kind of communities where everyone basically knew each other.  I would say, approximately twenty-five, thirty families that lived in that community.  And, all of them had kids, you know, and we would all get together.  All, I said, at different, different times.  But, we would get together and we would play, and play all kinds of games like, certainly like cowboys, and we would play church, and we would do all of those things like that.
Speaker 1: What type of houses were there on Railroad Avenue?
Speaker 2: They were all, and Railroad Avenue was only one of the streets and there were other offshoots from that.  But, I think the majority of them, if not all of them, were wooden frame type houses with tin, tin or metal tops, you know, roofs, if you will.  So, you, and you saw very few, if any, brick, or blocks, or anything of that nature.  And, you certain didn't see any aluminum siding or anything like that.  And, and I would say, so, they were very modest looking, very simple homes.  But, people did, I thought, an excellent job in try--in keeping the area around their homes neat and tidy.  That's what I can remember.
Story_ID: 290877
Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds, and smells, remind you of growing up and remind you of your childhood [in Boston, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Sights.  Well we, we also had, even though we lived in the small lit--on a small plot of land, we had--many of the people had chickens; so, speaking of sounds, and smell.  So, we had a lot of chickens and I can always remember feeding them.  And, then when my mother [Blanche Hollis Hill] wanted to cook one of them, to go out and select a chicken that was a prize for that particular meal.  And, then there was art to, to getting a chicken ready for that.  And, I won't go through the gory details but, but anyway that was a process.  And, I would say also as far as sounds, you know, I could hear the trains, you know.  It's living that close to the railroad tracks, you know, you knew when the train was coming.  You almost got it down to a perfect schedule.  And, sometimes in the early hours of the evening, you knew when the train was coming, so you try to time your sleeping pattern (laughter) to make sure it had already gone, the last one had gone before you went to bed.  As far as the smell, I--you know, I always remember cooking, you know, as I said, my mother and my [paternal] grandmother [Gussie Baker Hill] and a lot of the ladies in that area, in that neighborhood were excellent cooks.  And, I would, we would go from one house to another and many times we would sample, or get a sampling or something what was being cooked by the lady in that particular home.  As I--it was a reasonably close knit community as I mentioned, and everybody knew each other, knew each other's kids.  And, as a result of that, you also received sometimes the caring comments or the caring pat on the back, or the caring spank, spanking that you (laughter), you know, you needed from somebody else.  May not have always been your own parents.  And, then you also knew that if you went out and did something and you thought you got away with it before you got home, they would know about it.  And, even though early on, I can remember we didn't have telephones--
Story_ID: 290878
Speaker 1: --I can remember when we first got telephones installed.  That was a big deal.  And, and I don't remember the time of year but I'm thinking it was close to Christmastime.  And, when we got this first black telephone.  You didn't have any other colors.  It was just black, and it was dial tone of course.  And, you had to go through the local operator in Boston [Georgia].  They had their own switching--switchboard set up.  And, I had the opportunity to go see that.  But, that was, it was quite interesting and exciting to hear that first phone call, and to be able to hear the phone ring and then pick up and talk to someone and they were across town, you know, or somewhere else in another, another neighborhood.  But, that was quite interesting.
Speaker 2: Do you remember who it was who called; the first phone call?
Speaker 1: No.  I--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --really don't but it--and it may have been, you know, for my parents [Blanche Hollis Hill and Napoleon Hill].  It may have been somebody next door or around the corner because we were very good friends with people who lived the back of us, on another street.  And, then I remember, I think, one of my best friends who I used to play--shoot marble with and we would play cowboys and Indians and climb trees, and shoot BB Guns at birds and what have you, up the street.  His name was James Richardson [ph.], but he may have been the first one that I heard or talked to on the phone.  Right.
Story_ID: 290879
Speaker 1: What was the name of the elementary school you attended?
Speaker 2: It was called, initially it was called Boston Elementary School [Boston, Georgia].  And, then eventually it was changed to North Boston Elementary School [Boston, Georgia].  And, the reason for that is, you know, you hear and read and hear about stories of small towns and you read about them where people talk about which side of the tracks, you know, you lived on.  And, it just so happened most, not all, but most of the blacks in our--in Boston [Georgia] lived on the north side of the tracks.  And, most of the whites lived on the south side.  And, as I stated, early on it was called Boston Elementary.  And, then there was also, and that was for the African Americans and the south side was for the whites.  So, when, in and around the early '60s [1960s] before the passing of the civil rights bill [Civil Rights Act of 1964], then they all, maybe shortly after that, the name was changed to North Boston, and then there was South Boston, okay.  So, but that was the name of the elementary school that I attended.  And, then there was also--the middle school was there too.
Speaker 1: Let's go back to elementary school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of your teachers from elementary school, and were they any--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --who influenced you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  One in particular, from the first through the sixth grade, and I didn't go to kindergarten.  But, from the first to the sixth grade--and, I started, I started school when I was six years old.  My mother [Blanche Hollis Hill] was teaching at the same school and it just so happened throughout my entire twelve years of schooling, she never taught me.  Not--never taught me in the school environment, let me put it that way.  But, my first teacher from first through sixth grade was Mrs. Abby Lee Barnes [ph.]; wonderful lady.  There were times I didn't think so, but she was a wonderful lady.  And, she had a paddle.  That was the first thing that jumped in my mind.  But, she had a paddle that had a hole in it, in the big part of the paddle.  She had a handle on it and she had a hole in it.  And, she said, that's what she used to tame tigers.  And, she tamed us a little bit, occasionally, when we got unruly, you know.  But, she was an excellent teacher.  She not only taught me in the elementary school from first to the sixth grade, but she also taught me in the church [Trinity Missionary Baptist Church, Boston, Georgia] in Sunday school.  And, she also worked with me and my friends in what we called the BTU, Baptist Training Union.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You might know a little bit about it, in the Baptist church.  So, I never got away from her, you know.  I would (laughter) see her during the week and then I would see her on Sunday, or anytime else we, anytime we had other activities.  And, then for the seventh, eighth, and eighth grade, I had a Mr. Simmons [ph.] who was my, we call it middle school or junior high, if you want to, was my teacher then.  And, he was very good also.  Very patient with the students.  But, we learned a lot, I think.  And, but, Mrs. Barnes was my favorite, I think.  And, I maintained a relationship with, with her as far as keeping in contact, sending Christmas cards, until she died a few years ago.

Speaker 1: During the elementary school years [at North Boston Elementary School, Boston, Georgia], what type of student were you?
Speaker 2: I think I was a good student.  And, in part of that is due to the fact that my mother [Blanche Hollis Hill] also taught school.  And, she being in the schools system, she would ensure that at home, you know, one, you had to get your homework; and two, she would check it and proof it.  That was done before you did anything else.  And, you--by her being a part of the school system, I think from a disciplinary perspective, I was reasonably good there too.  You know, I would do silly things.  And, like I said, you know, we would make a lot of noise having church (laughter) in the classroom when we were supposed to be quiet.  Or, I wouldn't put my head down and go to sleep because--take a nap, you know.  You all--from in the first, second, and third grade, somewhere in there, you were supposed to take a nap right after the lunch period.  I probably didn't do that all the time, 'cause I always wanted to see what was going on.
Speaker 1: And, did you have dreams and aspirations during elementary school?  Like, what did you wanna be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Didn't have clue (laughter).  I, I don't think I thought a lot about it, you know.  I was enjoying the present.  I was enjoying, you know, the games we played and the people who were around me at that time.  And, you know, I don't, I don't think I paid as much, and maybe it was just me but, I paid as much attention to what was happening too in this big world in which we live.  Like a lot of the kids do probably today, who are at that same age because they, they're more knowledgeable and they've been exposed to so much more.  Computers, we didn't have computers, you know, when I, when I first went to school.  So, I just don't think I thought much about it.
Speaker 1: And, what type of child were you during the elementary school years.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Very obedient.  Because, my father [Napoleon Hill] and mother were strong disciplinarians.  And, we spent a lot of time, and I even said to them when I got older, we spent too much time going to church [Trinity Missionary Baptist Church, Boston, Georgia] (laughter).  But I, but, I was a happy child, you know.  We had a very strong family unit with just the four of us.  And, and so, so I was happy, you know, well taken care of, you know.  I had nice clothes to wear.  I always liked to--I was kind of shy at first.  I don't think I came out of my shyness until maybe I started into high school [Magnolia High School, Thomasville, Georgia], which we'll take about.  But, I, I was somewhat shy.  I didn't learn how to dance.  That was another big thing.  We used to have a spring dance.  And, I think about the sixth grade was when I first kind of broke away from being a wallflower and started participating in some of the dances.  And, so, that was a big coming out for me, if you will.
Story_ID: 290881
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned church a couple of times.  What was the name of the church your family attended?
Speaker 2: Trinity Missionary Baptist Church [Boston, Georgia].  And--
Speaker 1: And, what were your experiences like there?
Speaker 2: They were very good.  And, I think, and I was looking at a website, you know, I have to share this part with you.  When I got the packet from [The] HistoryMakers and I started reading and thinking back and, about my growing up, my childhood.  And, I said, "You know, I don't believe I've ever gone on the Internet to see what they have in there for Boston, Georgia."  So, I went on the Internet and just put in a search, Boston, Georgia, and sure enough, hey, here it is.  And, there was some interesting information and some-and wonderful data about the breakdown of Boston.  I didn't even know we had Scottish people who are living in the community.  Now, that is about 17--1,400 people.  It was some Germans there; one or two, of German, German descent.  But, where I was going with this is, there's also Trinity Missionary Baptist Church mentioned there.  It was one of the first official churches in that community.  And, and, so, I've maintained a tie with that church ever since I was born.  But, all of our family, my, my parents [Blanche Hollis Hill and Napoleon Hill], my father's brothers and sisters, all went to that church.  So, the Hill family was quite big in that church.  And, then my Sunday school--my elementary school [North Boston Elementary School, Boston, Georgia] teacher [Abby Lee Barnes (ph.)], some other teachers who were in the same school system all went to that church.  So, it was, it was also great experiences and that's why I talked earlier about Christmas and Easter and Thanksgiving, and all of that.  But, a lot of that centered around too, the activities we had at church.  And, they were very fond memories.  And, I remember the minister, some of the ministers that we had and how dynamic they were.  And, also how engaging they were, as far as kids were concerned, 'cause we always--a lot of times the kids had to go down to the front.  That was for two reasons for that.  They said, "They were talking to the--." He would have special messages for us.  But, they also have to keep us out of trouble--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --if we got (laughter) somewhere else in the church.  That's what I learned later.  And, I joined the church at an early age.  I think I was about ten, ten years old when I said that, "Okay, maybe this is something I should do."
Story_ID: 290882
Speaker 1: During the junior high school years [at North Boston Elementary School, Boston, Georgia], what were some of your favorite subjects and what kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Junior high, you know, that was say seventh and eighth grade.  Here I'm about thirteen, fourteen years old.  And, to try to keep focus on studies at that time, when you're entering kind of an adolescent period.  You know, girls started appearing for some reason, you know, I see them--
Speaker 1: Just out of the blue (laughter).
Speaker 2: --out of the blue.  Well, then I think a little of it started in the sixth grade, when I started dancing, you know.  And, I started touching them, you know.  So, that, that was a kind of a nice awakening.  But, I still think, you know, I maintained and I was able to maintain a good focus on my ta- on the subjects; the classroom activities.  And, being--doing my homework, and being a good student, and being probably even more disciplined as I got older, in class.  And, and again, I didn't want to do anything to embarrassed my parents [Blanche Hollis Hill and Napoleon Hill] because they were both every active, not only in the community but in the school.  And, I know if I did, I'd just have to have--I'll pay for it.  But, I felt I was a good student even then.  And, I had some good classmates too, you know, we all seem to get along pretty good together.  You know, you'd have your, your scrummages every now and then, but nothing very serious, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, during the junior high school years, so like the tween or pre-teen--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --years, who was influences you at this particular time in your life?  Who were you being most influenced by?
Speaker 2: I would say, from, from an adult perspective, I really have to say my parents influenced me quite a bit.  I would also say, you know, some of the people I've mentioned earlier, like the--my teacher Mrs. [Abby Lee] Barnes [ph.].  Even though in the seventh and eighth grade or ninth grade, I was no longer in her class.  But, I would still see her at church [Trinity Missionary Baptist Church, Boston, Georgia].  And, she was very influential.  There's a lady named Mrs. Sadie Richardson [ph.], I'd never forget her.  We used to call her Little Dynamo because, she was very short, but, but very stern, like very firm, you know in, in disciplining.  But, but also who would come up and hug 'ya, and, hug you real tight, you know, and walk with you.  Or, you walk with her however it was.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But, I could always remember that.  But, she also was, was wonderful.  And, I would think--and then I had a couple of friends, you know, who were--I don't know if they were influential but we were very good friends.  A fellow named Willie Brooks [ph.], you know.  Everybody has a Willie Brooks I think, and he was, but he was the kind of guy no matter what you needed, no matter what situation you were in, he would always be there for you.  And, we maintain contact even 'til today.  But, I would say those were some of the influences.  And, of course, my [paternal] grandmother, my [paternal] grandfather, particularly, John [Hill] and Gussie [Baker] Hill.  And, then, not even to a lesser, but, I mean, to a little bit lesser extent Eddie and Nellie [Hill's maternal grandparents, Eddie Hollis and Nellie Hollis] because--at least growing up in that, that period.
Story_ID: 290883
Speaker 1: Around this time were you starting to think about what you wanted to be or do when you grew up or did that come later?
Speaker 2: I think it started around the ninth grade; thinking about, you know, what, what is it I wanna do when I grow up.  And, we were very fortunate in our high school system.  And, I went to high school [Magnolia High School] in Thomasville, Georgia.  And, I might just step back just briefly.  Up until around '60 [1960], 1960 or 1959, we, we had the elementary school [North Boston Elementary School, Boston, Georgia], the junior high school, and the high school was in Boston [Georgia].  All right there together.  And, I can remember, you know, even some of the people in high schools, the kids in high school playing basketball and some of the shootouts that they had at the gym.  And, shootout mean, in shooting the basketball.  But, I can remember that and then around '59 [1959] or '60 [1960], that changed.  And, we went to, starting going to a high school in Thomasville.  And, what that was, was, it was kinda like the county school for African Americans.  And, the kids were begin bussed in from all over the county to that one high school.  So, but, we--
Speaker 1: What was the name of the high school?
Speaker 2: Thomasville High School [sic. Magnolia High School].  Home of the Buccaneers.  Yes; never forget it.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And, but anyway, that, that was when I think I started formulating some idea--and when I said we were blessed, in the fact that we had some very good counselors who started talking to us as we came into the ninth grade about, you need to be thinking about what you want to do.  Mainly because, they had certain curriculums that you would follow.  If you were thinking about going to college, if you were thinking about going to college and concentrating in the sciences, then they were certain courses, subjects that we needed to take.  And, vice versa, and what have you.  So, that's when I started thinking about it.  And, then, my father [Napoleon Hill] also owned a dry cleaners and I thought maybe I'd like to be in business doing something like that.  He was also in farming.  I knew, I knew for a fact, I did not want to do that.  I didn't wanna work out in a field.  I didn't wanna work with pigs, and cows, and nothing like that.  Farthest away from me as I--I wanted to work at an air conditioned office (laughter).  Being in South Georgia it was hot--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --and humid.  And, that was no, no picnic, you know.  So, I wanted to get as far away from it as I could.
Speaker 1: What kinds of activities were you involved in, in high school?
Speaker 2: A lot of things.  I, I was on the track and, track team.  I participated in the, what may be called the glee club.  We would sing, or the choral--chorale.  I participated in the band; played, instrument in the band.  I was a, what we called a NFA [New Farmers of America] or FFA, Future Farmers of tomor- of America [Future Farmers of America].  I was in the 4-H Club.  And, I was also--at different points, I was a classroom officer, you know, voted by my class to be an officer.  And, I--so, a lot of those kinds of activities I participated in.
Story_ID: 290884
Speaker 1: So, what were you thinking that you wanted to do with your life?  You knew that you wanted to work in an office type environment.  What--had you thought any further about exactly what you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had.  First of all, I knew I was going to college.  And, the reason I knew that is 'cause my mother [Blanche Hollis Hill] said, and my father [Napoleon Hill] said--my father who only finished the sixth grade, "You're gonna go to college."  Mother said, "You're definitely gonna go to college.  So, you gotta get that in your mind.  You don't have a, you don't have a choice."  And, so, that was fine, you know.  And, then I started working in my, my ninth grade year [at Magnolia High School, Thomasville, Georgia].  That would've been about '60 [1960], '61 [1961].  I started working in a pharmacy or drug store as we call it, in Boston [Georgia].  And, it was a, it was owned by a gentlemen named Kromarty [ph.], Kromarty.  And, he and my father were good friends.  And, he decided to employ me there part-time.  And, as I started working there, I said, "You know, this may be good, to be a pharmacist."  And, I said, "That's what I wanna do."  And, so, I told the counselors, excuse me, and I was put on a track to, to certainly develop a basis in the sciences, and get a good math foundation to prepare me to go to pharmacy school.  That's what I decided to do at that time, in the ninth grade.  Yes.
Speaker 1: And, where were you thinking you wanted to go to college?  Had you, what were your thoughts about--you knew you were going, but what were your thoughts about where you would go?
Speaker 2: Did not think much about that.  I supposed my thinking which may have been guided somewhat by what I had seen others do before me, is going to, to college somewhere in Georgia.  Not going far from home, okay.  And, that was my initial thought.  And, then as I, you know, advanced through my high school years, you know, it started opening up that hey, there's other possibilities out there.  And, when I started looking at schools that had pharmacy programs, you know, I said, "Oh, gee, there's quite a number, you know, to, to really take a look at."  And, I applied to, to several eventually.  And, ended up though going to Clark College [Atlanta, Georgia], which is now Clark Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia].  They had a pre-pharmacy program.  And, you go there for two years and then you would go to Mercer Southern School of Pharmacy [Mercer University College of Pharmacy] right there in Atlanta [Georgia], the remaining three years.  It was a five year program.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: What about Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia]?  Did--was Morehouse, was it all the rage, for lack of a better term, throughout Georgia or, you know, just what was the take on Morehouse?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was.  It was, it was very well known.  Frankly, mostly all of the schools in what was called the AU Center, Atlanta University Center [Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia], was well known throughout Georgia.  Morehouse, Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia], Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], and Clark, all of those were right there.  And, so, we knew about them and we said, "Gee whiz," you know, a lot of the--there were some guys who wanted to go to Morehouse.  I wanted to go to a co-ed for some reason, school (laughter).  I don't know why--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --but I did.  And, and it just so happened when I applied, Clark was one that granted me a scholarship to come there.  But--.
Speaker 1: In what year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: In '65 [1965].  The--what, June of '65 [1965], something like that.  And, we were, we were the largest graduating class in the history of, of Thomasville High School [sic. Magnolia High School].  A hundred and four students--
Speaker 1: Wow!
Speaker 2: --graduated from college--graduated from high school.  And, I was, you know, fortunate enough, I'd been a good enough student.  I was valedictorian of the class which was quite a, an honor, and an achievement.  And, we--and then I played in the band, and played a tenor, tenor saxophone, which was in the marching and in the concert band.  But, going back just briefly to other colleges that--Albany State [College; Albany State University, Albany, Georgia] was another one that was mentioned quite a bit in our circles.  So, there was, there was quite a good awareness of what was going on in Atlanta.
Story_ID: 290885
Speaker 1: You know, Mr. Hill [HistoryMaker John Nathan Hill], I wanted to ask you a little bit about what was happening in terms of civil rights in Southern Georgia, in Boston [Georgia], in that area?  Was it a community that was heavily involved in civil rights, or, you know, what was happening during that time?
Speaker 2: That's an excellent question because, you know, throughout my adult years I've been engaged in conversation about the civil, civil rights struggle; segregation, particularly in Georgia and in South Georgia.  And, people ask me, you know, how did you feel and how do you feel now?  How did you feel then and how do you feel now?  And, I must say and this is a very true statement, in Boston, Georgia a small town in as 'bout as far south in Georgia as you could go.  You knew there was separate, you know, you knew the whites lived in one part of town.  You knew the blacks lived in another part of town.  And, you probably hear me now use interchangeably, I'll say blacks and sometimes I'll say African American, and it's kind of synonymous.  But, but I feel comfortable frankly in using both, both words.  But, I--we, we didn't have the--I'll say as overt, the whole thing about bitter racism in that small town as I saw in others, maybe that were larger.  I think it was because people made an effort to just get along, okay.  I think everybody understood that there were the signs, if you will, that said, for colored only, or white only, when it came to, came to drinking fountains.  And, I can remember so vividly some of those fountains, you know.  And, as a kid or a small child, you didn't know.  You didn't realize it but the older people, or our teachers or whoever said, "Nathan, you're supposed to drink from this one."  And, and I said, "Naw, I wanna drink from that one."  They said, "No, you drink from this." And so--and all--the restroom, or going, going to the theater.  We had a theater there at one time, in Boston.  And, the blacks came in through a separate entrance, and we sat upstairs, okay.  But, that was what we grew up in.  So, you say, where you didn't think much of it.   And, you didn't--and we didn't have fights and we didn't have riots in the street.  We didn't have any of that kind of activity going on.  Even throughout I can remember, all these years, you know.  We never had that because people just made an effort to get along.  I will say this, that when I was, when I started working for the pharmacy, the drugstore, and again that was around '60 [1960], '61 [1961], when, you know, just before the civil rights bill [Civil Rights Act of 1964] was passed.  Well, I'll set the scene.  There was, there's a soda fountain there and if you, if a black person came in to use, or to take advantage of the soda fountain, you--we fixed it and they left.  If someone white came in they could fix it, and they could sit.  And, that I knew and I understood what was going on.  But, just before the passage of the civil rights bill, the pharmacist decided, Mr. Kromarty [ph.] decided to do away with the soda fountain, period.  Because--and then as I reflect on it, I said the reason I think that happened is that he did not want to have blacks being served and sitting in that, in that soda fountain area.  Even though I was there, and I could fix, I could prepare it for anybody.  I'll fix you your cherry-vanilla, or your, your root beer float, or whatever for anyone.  But, just sitting there was different.  So, I would say that was probably as overt.  I never heard name calling, or using the, the N-word, if you will, in Boston.  It may have happened.  It may have been in certain circles, but I did not hear that.  And, I didn't have it happen to me, personally.  And, so, as we grew up, that was not as big.  But, as a--you could start seeing change take place in anticipation of the passage of the civil rights bill.

Speaker 1: And, in other parts of Georgia, and in larger cities, in particularly, you know, in Atlanta [Georgia] where [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] was--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, and his father [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.], and Ralph Abernathy and all of, of those leaders, there was a lot of activity going on there; tremendous amount.
Speaker 2: Was there a little bit of culture shock when you went to Clark [College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 1: Yes.  A little bit.  And, my eyes really opened.  Maybe it started, you know, in my latter years of high school [Magnolia High School, Thomasville, Georgia].  But, it really opened when I went to, to Atlanta, to the big city, to the bright lights.  And, to experience sitting in Ebenezer Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia], you know, the home of Dr. King.  Or, to be on Hunter Street which was in Reverend Ralph Abernathy's community, and where his church was, [West] Hunter Street Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia].  And, we attended there as a, as a college student, I attended, you know, some of these churches.  And, you became very immersed in what was going on.  And, this, this was in '65 [1965], '66 [1966], you know, that I was at Clark.  And, and there was the marching, and there were some of the riots, and things that took place.  Not big time, you know, and did I participate?  Well, I may have gotten on the fringe of it in a couple of instances.  But, I was not right in the middle, you know.  It was, it was something that I watched from somewhat of a distance.  So, I was not in the middle of what was going on.  But, it was there.
Story_ID: 290887
Speaker 1: And, what were your experiences at Clark [College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] like (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Were you involved in any organizations or fraternities or anything?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, my, the freshman year was a, was a rude awakening.  And, I say rude because, and this is again, my first venture outside of home [Boston, Georgia] and staying away from home for a long period of time, even though it was only about three in a half or four hours away from my hometown.  But, it was, it was a different environment and then there were kids that came in from all over the U.S. to go to Clark.  So, I, I got really involved in the--what was going on socially.  I wanted to see what Atlanta [Georgia] was all about.  And, so, you know, I get out and find out, would go with the guys and we'll check it out.  And, in my sophomore year, I got attracted to one of the fraternities there.  And, we had them all.  We had all the fraternities there; the Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], and the Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity], and the Omegas [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity], and the Sigmas [Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity].  But, I went with Alpha; Alpha Phi Alpha.  And, and then one of the reasons is because I think, you know, with my personality and with the, and with the people I met who were members of that fraternity, it seemed to be consistent with what I was looking for.  And, that's not any, anything against the others.  It's just that, I seemed, I felt comfortable in that.  And, so, I pledged.  And, pledging was an interesting (laughter)--that was an interesting experience too, to say the least.  But, I made it through that and had a very good, good time at Clark those first two years--
Story_ID: 290888
Speaker 1: My sophomore year [at Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] also is when I met Laura Hill, well at that time Laura Vines.  And, who came from Alexander City, Alabama, to Clark.  And, this was her freshman year.  And, I was attracted to her.  She not to me (laughter).  It reminded me of my father [Napoleon Hill]--
Speaker 2: You, your parents (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's right (laughter).  And, I had to work, hard.  But, but that was my sophomore year.  And then, we could talk a little bit more about what happened then.  But, that was when I met her.  And, then I went to, at the end of my sophomore year, went to Mercer Southern School of Pharmacy [Mercer University College of Pharmacy], which was downtown Atlanta [Georgia]; in the middle of the downtown area.  And, I started at Mercer.  And, I also worked as an intern, as a pharmacy intern at Grady [Memorial] Hospital [Atlanta, Georgia] there.  And, that was to kinda to give me a feel for what it would be like to be in hospital pharmacy.  And, after I worked there for maybe a couple of semesters or so forth, I then went to a community pharmacy which was out in another part of Atlanta.  And, that was to give me a feel of what it was like to be in a community pharmacy.  But, I didn't like pharmacy as much as I thought I would.  I was taking all of the courses and I was--we were having to do a lot in the laboratory, like making ointments and making different kinds of medications and suppository and things of that nature.  And, it was an art and a form to it, but it was also a process that you needed to understand, in addition to your classroom work.  But, when we get out, when you got out into the real work environment, especially in the community pharmacy, and to some degree in the hospital pharmacy, it was not the same, you know.  A lot of it was pre-packaged, you know.  Or, you were counting the pills.  And, then you started--then there was this name given to you as a pill counter, rather than a pharmacist.  But, I still think it's a good profession.  But, I decided, that was not for me.  And, so, that was after my second year, beginning of my second year there.  And, then I--
Speaker 2: So, was this 1968, or 1967?
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1968.  Beginning of 1969.  And, so, I decided that I'm going to go back and just--I had enough, enough hours in biology and chemistry, I said, "I'll get a degree in biology and chemistry."  And, maybe I'll go into research or I'll be a pharmaceutical salesman, I don't wanna be in pharmaceu--pharmacy.
Story_ID: 290889
Speaker 1: So, I wanted to take a semester off, which would've been the summer of--fall of '69 [1969].  Well, as soon as I left school [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] in May or June of '69 [1969], I got drafted for the, for Vietnam--for the [U.S.] Army, not Vietnam [War], but for the Army.  And, that was a shocker.  That, that was that quick.  But, I should've had--if I had been thinking, I had a student deferred classification up until I left school.  And, I didn't get into a school and hadn't formalized my intentions to go on, so the draft, the selection board, my number came up.  And, so, I had, and I tried--I appealed it but I had to go.  So, I got drafted.  Went to Fort Benning, Georgia, and we can talk about that later.  But, I had also at that time--Laura [Vines] and I had developed a very good relationship.  I finally got her to see that this guy was something that, someone who could be, you know, a positive influence in her life.  So, we got married in December of '69 [1969]; December the 23rd of '69 [1969].  And, then I went off to Fort, Fort Benning, Georgia to do my basic training for the Army.  And, from there, I went to Fort Gordon [Augusta, Georgia], and we can talk about my military career later.
Speaker 2: Sh- no.  Well, why don't we talk about it now?  So,--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  In chronolog--
Speaker 2: You went from Fort, Fort Benning, did your basic training--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And, from there you went to where?
Speaker 1: I went to Fort Gordon which is in Augusta, Georgia.  And, and something happened on the way, if you will, in that at Fort Benning during the enlistment process, I realized that being drafted you only had to serve two years.  But, what was also happening at that time, those young men who were drafted and decided to serve the two years, when they finished basic training many of them were going into--were selected to go into infantry and/or artillery.  Not a place I wanted to be.  So, in order for me to get out of get--going there, I needed to sign up for an extra year.  And, if I signed up for an extra year, I could choose where--what service, part of the service I wanted to go into.  And, what occupation, if you will, military occupation, they call it.  So, I picked, I picked pharmacy.  Ah, so it comes back, right.  Of course, I had had some training.  So, I said, I could go into pharmacy.  Well, when I did that, the pharmacy, all of the people in pharmacy, they had gotten all they needed.  So, I went into the [U.S. Army] Signal Corps, communications.  And, was supposed to spend now three years.  So, that's how I ended up at Fort Gordon because Fort Gordon was a, a base for training people in the Signal Corps.  When I got to Fort Gordon, I then took some tests and was able to get into the [U.S.] Army Security Agency which required me to get a top secret clearance.  So, I was able to get that.
Story_ID: 290890
Speaker 1: And, then I took some encryption and decryption of, of transmissions over the networks and the airwaves.  And, by this time too, Laura [Hill's wife, Laura Vines Hill] was expecting.  And, so, I--Tonya [Hill GoKita] was in the making (laughter).  But, I took all of those, those different disciplines in the signal school [of the U.S. Army Signal Corps] and in '70 [1970], in 1970 around August, I was told that I needed to go to Vietnam.  I had to go to Vietnam.  So, I thought I was gonna be able to get out of it.  First, here I have, you know, I'm married, I have a young one on the way, actually she was born July 3rd and I said, "Wow." Is there a way I could get out it?  Well, they, they gave me a couple of months or what have you.  But, I still had to go.  And, I spent one year in Vietnam.
Speaker 2: So, that was from 1971?
Speaker 1: From 1970 to--
Speaker 2: To '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-one [1971].  Yes.  Right.  That was a very humbling experience.  Yes.  But, it was also one that made me really appreciate the little things, you know, in life.  Things that as a young man, at that point, I'd probably taken for granted.  I know I had.  Even if it was just good clean fresh water to brush your teeth, or to take a shower.  Or, the food you had to eat, or your living accommodations and what have you.  So, I really developed a high level of appreciation and sensitivity, you know, to, to that.  And, and you learn how to make do, you know, in that kind of environment.  I was blessed in the fact that I was in a occupation that didn't require me to go out into the field.  I didn't have to pick up a gun and shoot anyone, which I was fortunate that I didn't have to do that.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, were you in communications in Vietnam?
Speaker 1: Yes.  I was in kind of an intelligence there.  All right.  And, I worked in three or four different locations when I was there.  But, I spent the full year.  And, it was tough on Laura at that time--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --but, she's a strong lady and she persevered.  And, then I got--I came back in July of '71 [1971] and I was at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and--with the airborne division there.  And, I was in a support role until I got out.  I was able to get an early out.  So, I didn't put in the full three years.  I only had to put in two and a half years because I got six months early.  Because I wanted to go back to school and finish up my degree requirements.
Story_ID: 290891
Speaker 1: And, that's when I went to Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, Tennessee.
Speaker 2: How did you choose that school?
Speaker 1: It was local.  It was close.  And, I wanted to get in school right away.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so, I checked it out and they had student housing, you know, for Laura [Vines Hill], and Tonya [Hill GoKita], and me.  And, like I said, it was convenient.  So, that's, that's how.  And, then after interviewing with, or at least checking out the, the biology and chemistry departments there, I felt good about the curriculum and what they had, so.
Speaker 2: And, you earned your degree in biology?
Speaker 1: Biology and chemistry.  Yes.
Speaker 2: What year?
Speaker 1: That was in '73 [1973].
Speaker 2: So, what were you thinking you were going to do with your degree?  I--here, you know, you have like the strong intelligence communications background.  And, then on the other hand, the whole biology and chemistry experience as well.  So, what were you thinking that you wanted to do?
Speaker 1: Well, I thought I would go into medicine, some form of medicine.  At one point, I thought maybe I would be a dentist, you know.  Or, I thought I would be a physician, and they had some excellent schools in Tennessee.  So, I filled out applications to, to do that.  And, I send--and then, while they were being processed, I finished my undergrad degree requirements and started taking some advanced courses in biology because I wanted to make sure I was well prepared for that.
Story_ID: 290892
Speaker 1: Well, while I was taking those additional courses [in biology at Austin Peay State University, Clarksville, Tennessee], I needed to work.  I wanted income for the family.  Laura [Vines Hill] was working and I said, "Let me go down to one of the stores here and get a part-time, seasonal job."  That's when I started working for Sears, Roebuck and Company [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] in Clarksville, Tennessee, in their credit department.
Speaker 2: And, you were like a management trainee or something like that?
Speaker 1: Not at first.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No, at first I was work--because I was working part-time, and again this was in '73 [1973], you know, I was only doing that until one of these schools say, hey, yes, you come on down, you can get your degree in pharmacy or in dentistry or what have you.  And, but, Sears kept talking to me, the people there kept talking to me about getting into their management training program.  And, I kept saying, "No."  I said, "I don't want to waste all of the time that I've spent in chemistry and biology labs by going into some store selling something or being behind a counter in a credit department."  Not what I was looking for.  They said, "We think--." And the people are talking to me are all white.  The timing, if you think about it, it was doing a period where affirmative action was very prevalent in many corporations around America.  And, and so, companies like Sears was looking, was looking for someone, or people that they could bring in who they felt would help them satisfy their objectives in supporting affirmative action.  Well, the long and short of it, they finally talked me into trying it.  They said, "Give it a shot.  If you don't like it after a year, then you still have time.  You're young."  And, so, Laura and I spent some time talking about and understanding the fact that we would have to relocate and move around.  So, I got into their management training program.  And, you sup- I suppose you can say the rest is history. But, there's a lot, a lot of history in being in that program.
Story_ID: 290893
Speaker 1: But, I spent some time still in Clarksville [Tennessee], and then we relocated to Nashville, Tennessee where I was a supervisor [for Sears, Roebuck and Co.].  And, that was a role I played as my early stages of management training.  But, after six months, they said, you know, "You've done well enough, we wanna promote you and we want you to relocate, again."  And, at that time, I relocated to--we relocated to Memphis, Tennessee where I was on the, on a regional credit staff as a credit field representative, which is what it was called.  And, I had the, the privilege, I had the privilege of working with a lot of people throughout Tennessee, and Arkansas, and Mississippi, and that was--and Louisiana, so that was part of our region.  And, you--keep it in mind too, this is around '74 [1974], and things are still interesting when it comes to races and race relationships.  Again, I--you know, as I, as I sit and think about it, the fact that I used to drive throughout Mississippi.  Places like Hattiesburg [Mississippi], and Laurel [Mississippi], and Greenville, Mississippi, and Jackson, Mississippi, and Biloxi [Mississippi], and Pascagoula [Mississippi].  And, then in places in Alabama, Mobile, Alabama, and parts of Arkansas.  And, out of all of that, from '74 [1974] until about '8 [1978]--'78 [1978], I'd travel throughout all of these pla- and in some parts of Louisiana, Louisiana, I did not have any problems.  So, I said, "There's someone watching over me," you know.  And, but, I, I also think too, you know, the way I approach people, the way I approached the job is not with a chip on my shoulder, not with drawing attention to race.  I didn't look at someone sitting or standing in front of me, or that I was supporting or helping, I didn't focus on color.  I focused on them as people.  And, I would hope that that would be returned to me as a person rather than a black or an African American person sitting in front of them.  And, I do think that helped.  Again, along with a supreme being watching.
Speaker 2: Absolute--.
Speaker 1: --and, guiding.  And, so, so I did that for about four years.
Story_ID: 290894
Speaker 1: And, then you went to Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: No, from there, I went to Little Rock, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Another hotbed of activity.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And, I was the first African American to head up the credit operation there, which was also interesting.  And, it was interesting whenever--being a credit manager, whenever you had to--you declined someone for credit--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and, they didn't know, out on the floor or in the Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] store, you know, that you were of this, this ethic group.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, so, it was a shocker for someone that came back.  And, then I had a couple instances where people were kind of rowdy.  But, again, keeping a calm head, a cool head, and, and working with the situations as they occurred.  And, then traveling throughout parts of Arkansas, up in Mountain Home, Arkansas, up in the Ozarks [Ozark Mountains], and down in southern part of Arkansas in the Hot Springs area and what have you, it was, it was still a very positive and very successful experience I had there.  And, great people, I, and ended up developing and cultivating some very good friends; both, African American and, and of one to, white and other.  And, then I moved from there to, to Atlanta with the family.  And, so we moved in, it was around '81 [1981], '82 [1982] to Atlanta, Georgia.  And, I was working then in our territor- that was a promotion.  Each one of these moves with Sears was a promotion and which is something they did.  And, a matter of fact, on average, at one time, Sears would move those persons who they felt were capable of handling more responsibilities and additional duties anywhere from eighteen to twenty-four months in most instances.  And, sometimes a little bit longer if you would ask that you, you know, to kind of postpone it.  But, you would take advantages of those opportunities.  And, Laura [Vines Hill] and I made the sacrifice.  And, especially her, being in a very supporting role, made this sacrifice to say, "Hey, we will move" to be able to take advantage of this new opportunity.  And, as I look back, I would say it was worth it, and I would say it was very valuable experiences and relationships that we created over those years.  And, in Atlanta that was a great assignment as well.  And, then we moved from Atlanta after about three years to Chicago [Illinois], where I was at Sears Tower [Willis Tower] and now here's our world headquarters for Sears.
Story_ID: 290895
Speaker 1: You had just been relocated to Chicago [Illinois], corporate headquarters.  Can you kinda tell us a little bit about--and, this was in the early '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What the climate was like?  Working corporate headquarters as an African American for such a major company which really was a fixture, and probably still is, in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I would say even before we get to Chicago, the, the road or the journey that I traveled and the road that I was on, in each of the locations, I just so happened to have been the first African American to travel that road.  So, early on, it was, it was--and maybe more pressure was put on me by myself, than others.  But, the thing that happened, as you can imagine, there were others, other African Americans who were employees of the company.  They're now looking at this guy named Nathan Hill and watching to see what happens to me.  And, what do--what will I do, and how will that either enhance or hinder, you know, their opportunity to advance, you know, beyond where they were.  And, so, that was very much prevalent in my mind everywhere I went.  And, I, and I also made sure that people understood and realized that I'm not wearing any chip on my shoulder.  My head is still the same size it has always been, and what you see is what you get.  Day in and day out, week in and week out, because that was important to me.  I'm still a human being.  I'm still Nathan Hill.  And, I made a point for people to appreciate that.  Although, I was aspiring to go further in the company.  And, again--but in Clarksville [Tennessee], Nashville [Tennessee], and Memphis [Tennessee], and Little Rock [Arkansas], I had been the only one in our organization in those roles, ever.  And, then I go to Atlanta [Georgia], and I was the one--only one there.  In Chicago, a little bit different because there were others, which was great, you know.  And, it was, and it was a larger environment and there were many wonderful, talented African Americans who were in various roles throughout Sears [Roebuck and Co.].  And--.
Speaker 1: And, did it take a little bit of the pressure off because here, and even though you're very modest, but you really were a role model for many African Americans in the company who were watching you and hoping that it would increase opportunities for them.  But, now you have an opportunity to kinda watch some African Americans yourself.  So, did it kinda take a little bit of the pressure off?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Very, very much so.  And, you're absolutely right on.  And, that now I'm able to watch others.  And, I'm able to develop maybe, you know, some mentoring relationships.  Someone to, you know, to say, Nathan, you know, you may want to do this.  Or, this is how you might approach this particular situation.  And, I did start getting a little bit of that in Atlanta.  Because in a ter- in that territorial environment, again, it was a little bit more presences of African Americans in other roles.  So, in Chicago, it was, it was great, you know, in that particular instance.  However, I was in the, the credit, I was in the credit side of our business, financial services side.  And, there were not as many African Americans in those--in that role or in a very senior roles, as it was in the retail or the merchandising side of it, okay.  So, there were still a little bit of pressure in that particular segment of Sears, okay.  But, I, I felt, you know, privileged in the fact that I was given that opportunity to be able to show that we can do.  We can do things, and we can perform.  And, we can excel, and we can be successful in these various roles.  And, I think, you know, the, the fact that I wo- I never posted, if you will.  In companies you post for positions, or you ask for positions or roles.  I never posted or asked for any role until my very last one.  But, but, all through that time, I was tapped on the shoulder, and said, "We would like for you, we would like for you to consider this position."  And, and each time Laura [Vines Hill] and I said, "Yes."
Story_ID: 290896
Speaker 1: And, when you went to Chicago [Illinois] in the early '80s [1980s], how was the company faring at that particular time?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was a great time in the company.  That was in '84 [1984], '85 [1985], and it was an excellent period for Sears [Roebuck and Co.].  And, Sears was trying a lot of new different things.  Stretching itself to be even more diverse in the offerings to, to the customer.  And, you probably can remember some of the commercials where Sears has everything, and stocks, and socks, and insurance, you know, we sold it--pretty much all.  We did a lot of--we covered the waterfront, if you will.  Which also may have been a challenge to try to keep, keep your focus and your energies up across, across that waterfront.  And, sometimes that's difficult.  We even had Sears World Trade [Inc.] at one point.  And, that didn't make it, unfortunately for a lot of different reasons.  But, that's, that was a great time at Sears, to, to be a part of what was going on, especially at our headquarters location.
Speaker 1: And, I'd like to fast forward a little bit if we could.  Just to talk about the current financial situation of the company.  Did you ever think that Sears would be where it is today, where--actually, what was your reaction--?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --when you heard that Sears was being bought by Kmart.
Speaker 2: I didn't believe it.  As a matter of fact, I to--my wife heard it first on the news.  One morning she was listening and she said, this had come across.  And, I said, "You gotta--Kmart bought Sears, no.  No way."  I said, "If there was any buying going on, Sears would've bought Kmart."  And, she said, "No, I believe I heard it correctly."  And, then shortly after that I started really listening and that's what came out in the media, and in the news, and that came out in print media.  And, I said, "Now, this is--this beats all."  And, you know, when I--when we first joined Sears, I--and I'll say we, you may hear me say that, because it was family thing.  You know, Laura [Vines Hill] and I made the decision.  She said, "I'm going to make the sacrifice in my career for you to be able to further yours."  And, and I thank her for that today.  That she, she made that sacrifice and it's paid off for us I think.  But, I never thought I would see the day that Sears would be bought by Kmart.  That Sears would fall up under times that it has experienced over the last eight to ten years.  It's unbelievable.
Speaker 1: And, do you--what do you think it means for Sears?  Does it mean that Kmart becomes a little bit more upscale?  Or, does it mean Sears kinda gets knocked down a notch?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, some of the inside scoop is, whether you believe it or not, is that each one is going to try to stick to its own knitting, if you will.  But, they may be able to comingle certain aspects of their, of their merchandising.  They may be able to take advantage of geographical locations where maybe there's a Wal- I mean, a Kmart and not a Sears, or the Kmart is in a better location, they may decide to do a little bit of comingling of activities and merchandising.  But, you know, the thinking right now is that they're going to take advantage of being as they have been.  I would have to think though, especially organizationally, there will be some changes.  Structurally, I think there has to probably be some.  Because they're gonna have people doing some very similar jobs.  I think they're gonna have to look at that.  I think they're gonna have space, store space, retail space, they're gonna have to take a very close look at.  And, say, hey, how do we manage this, and leverage this so that we're not top heavy with space?
Story_ID: 290897
Speaker 1: And you know, Mr. Hill [HistoryMaker John Nathan Hill], I'd just like to get your perspective as a businessman, from a business perspective.  What are some of your thoughts about the future?  You know, we just recently heard about the May Company stores [May Department Stores Company] being bought by Macy's.  And, then even today Toys "R" Us saying that they just can't compete with the Walmarts in terms of selling toys and video games.  Do you think that we're getting to a point where, there's really gonna be one store?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I think we're in a cycle of tremendous consolidation, you know.  And, I think we will continue to see that over the next few years.  Where companies--first of all, it--we're in a very highly competitive environment.  And the, the ability to survive is very, getting very difficult for a lot of companies.  The talent that they need as far as people, not only at the top but also, you know, in middle management and other parts, is not as, as abundant as it, as it has been, for whatever reasons.  And, again, we have the new entrance into the market; bring in new technology, new ways of doing things, and some of the older stores that has been around for a long time have not been able to keep up with it.  So, I think we're going to see more consolidations.  However, I think, we'll still be able to maintain a competitive environment where you won't have just the one store.  We'll have at least three or four (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 290898
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you left Sears [Roebuck and Co.] in 1987 and became the national operations director for MasterCard and Discover [Discover Financial Services].
Speaker 2: Actually, not MasterCard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At that time, that was part of Sears, that was a time where Sears was, was diversifying itself into financial services.  And, as a part of that diversification, we acquired Dean Witter [Financial Services Group Inc.; Morgan Stanley].  Dean Witter was a brokerage firm that was out, headquartered out in [San Francisco] California.  And, part of that financial services entity was Dean Witter.  And, then Sears said, "Well, we wanna issue a credit card that is outside the Sears store credit card."  So, therefore, Discover was born.  And, that was launched in 1986.  And, I started working for Discover actually in 1986, but I was still under Sears payroll, and we launched the Discover card.  We did it in January of '86 [1986] during the Super Bowl [Super Bowl XX, New Orleans, Louisiana].  That's when the Chicago Bears won the Super Bowl that year.  And, then that became then the financial services arm; Dean Witter and also Discover card.  As a matter of fact, we became--developed the name Dean Witter, Discover [Dean Witter, Discover and Co.].  Then, Sears spun that part of us off in '93 [1993].  There was a spin off or an I--excuse me, a individual--I mean, an IPO, [initial public offering], that was done in '93 [1993].  Sears also spun off Allstate [Insurance Company] subsequently.  And, they spun off Coldwell Banker [Coldwell Banker Real Estate LLC] which was also part of the big conglomerate.  And, all of that to try and get back to its core competency which was merchandising and retailing.  To compete with the likes of a K, of a Kmart and a Walmart and others--
Story_ID: 290899
Speaker 1: So yes, I joined the Discover [Discover Financial Services] team in--as a national operations director [for Dean Witter Financial Services Group, Inc.; Morgan Stanley].  And, I was the, again, fortunate for me and there (unclear) maybe others, that I became the first African American in that particular role.  Again, in our credit side of that business.  And, that was thanks to, again, some people, not of color, who were looking out and sponsoring me and mentoring me throughout my career.  And, then one gentlemen who is now passed away is Bill Martin, who is from Alabama.  And, he became, he and I became very good friends.  And, he was one who took me kind of under his wings and said, "Hey, I want you to come over and work with me on this new venture."  And, I believe in him and had a lot of confidence in him, and I did, I came over.  And, then we had others who came over and other people who had been a part of that operation before I came there in other parts of the business.  Yes.  Then, I left there, that role and went into the strategic planning area for the company, working with the president of the company.  At that time whose name was Tom Butler [Thomas R. Butler].  And, that was around 1990, I believe.  And, again, it was a first time for, you know, an African American to be in that role.  But, as I looked around our company which was growing at that time, I think it was an important one, again, for that to reflect in the eyes of other employees of color that, hey, you know, we can grow and we can aspire to be at higher heights in this company.  And, because there is a, there's proof that there's the opportunity.  And, there were others who were in similar roles but they were in other parts of our business; in IT [information technology], if you will, and in human resources.  As a matter of fact, just as a side, the lady who replaced me in Delaware as head of banking operations there, Kathy Roberts, is the person who helped process me in to Discover.
Speaker 2: Through human resources?
Speaker 1: Through human resources; getting me in and getting all of my paperwork and making sure I got processed, processed in.  She left human resources, went into the operations side of Discover.  Subsequently, became a general manager of one of the units, moved around.  She's now in my role that I left in, in Delaware, Kathy Roberts.  And, she's the one who called me up to say, we want you to be a HistoryMaker that is interviewed.
Story_ID: 290900
Speaker 1: You know, you continue to move through the ranks again with Discover [Discover Financial Services].  And, I wanna ask you, do you, do you ever think back and, how significant do you think your success with both Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.], and Discover was in terms of creating more opportunities for other African Americans?
Speaker 2: I think it was very important.  And, I may have touched on it earlier in the fact that, it was important for me, one, to be successful; to accomplish something in each of those roles.  Because then it left a positive image in the minds of everyone and not just, you know, the African Americans but everyone to say that, hey, it can be done.  And, and maybe there are oth- there are persons in the organization who did not look at it as being just maybe an African American here.  You know, maybe someone said, well, maybe you're the token. You've heard that word before.  And, I said, many times, and this--and I was quoted in several of my moves when I was tapped, I said, "I want this to be a move that you're making because you feel that I am qualified to do the job.  I don't want to make any move if I'm just gonna be a number."  Understanding the reality of things, yes, I am a number, yes, I'm going to be looked at as African American when you, when you sum it up.  But, I did not want to be a number.  And, that was important to me.  That you move me and you promote me because I can do the job and I have shown you that I can do the job.  And, I think, that was very important for others to see.
Speaker 1: And, what about African Americans pursuing careers in the world of financial services?  Do you think that there, there are enough or would you like to see more?
Speaker 2: I'd like to see more.  I'd like to see more that are in, in senior, senior positions that are CEOs, you know, like [Kenneth] Chenault who is the head of American Express [Company].  You know, we wanna see, you wanna see them in financial services, and the head of Merrill Lynch [and Co., Inc.; Merrill Lynch Wealth Management], you know.  I mean, there're, there're quite a number around.  But, we don't, we don't see as many.  And, we don't see as many women especially in those roles.  And, I think, it's important for us to continue to press forward to do it.
Story_ID: 290901
Speaker 1: And, let's talk about when you went to Delaware, your job in Delaware as president and COO.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Interesting.
Speaker 1: How did that opportunity come about?
Speaker 2: Well, I was--well, my first couple of assignments in, in Discover [Discover Financial Services] was in, in the Chicago [Illinois] area.  But, I, I really had a desire to be out in the field, as we called it, away from headquarters.  I'd been in headquarters in Atlanta [Georgia], and in Chicago, and now in two different locations in Chicago, and I wanted to be out in the field.  I called it, that's where the rubber meets the road.  That's where you get down into it, you know, the nuts and bolts of the operation.  And, I wanted to get into that.  So, I kept asking for it.  And, that was one of the times, I did ask.  Not for a particular role but I wanted to have that experience.  So, I went to Columbus, Ohio to head up our merchant operations [for Dean Witter Financial Services Group, Inc.; Dean Witter, Discover & Co.].  And, and that side of the business is, it was responsible for signing up merchants and businesses to accept the Discover card.  We had about a 950 person operation there that I headed up.  And, I was there for about three years.  And, I get a call from, from my boss about December of, of '93 [1993] asking me if I would like to go--no, if I wouldn't mind going to Delaware.  And, I said, "For what?"  I said, and this, this is my response.  I said, "I did not lose anything in Delaware."  He said, "Well, we would like for you to go."  We have a person resigning, resigning--retiring there.  And, he was the first one that they had in that role for the company and we'd like for you to replace him.  We think you're the person qualified for it.  So, what's your thoughts?  I said, "Well, give me a little time to think about it." And subsequently my family and I moved to Delaware.  As president of, at that time it was Greenwood Trust Company [Discover Bank], was the name of the bank.
Story_ID: 290902
Speaker 1: And, we had a credit card operation there [Greenwood Trust Company; Discover Bank], and card member services, and we had a payment facility there too in Dover, Delaware; quite a number of people, about 1,900 employees in all.  So, it was a, it was a huge step.  And, also a heavy involvement in the community was required and something that we needed to do even more of, in serving the community and giving back to the community from whence these people had come.  So, I, that was, that was a defining moment, you know, one of the defining moments in my life to be asked to go and take that role.  And, it was a very important role in that community, in the Delaware, in the Wilmington [Delaware] community, throughout the State of Delaware.  And, being the, the, among the first African American to head up a bank in Delaware is--was significant.  And, many people looked at that as being significant.  And, I cherish that and I was proud of the fact that I was in a position on behalf of our company [Dean Witter, Discover & Co.; Morgan Stanley] to represent us in so many different ways.  But, also, to make a big difference in the community in which we were in.  And, to be sensitive to the needs of the community.  Whether it was in housing, whether it was in extending certain loans, or whether it was in the credit card operation, whether it was in employment, or helping people get through the ranks, you know, within our own company.  Or, to work with other minority businesses that were aspiring to develop and to create something of their own.  Like, one company advanced staffing.  We needed temporary help and, so, we started working with a young lady named Pat Troy [ph.] at that time, to try and help her get her business up.  But, and she was a minority business lady determined to make it work.  And, we just happened to be in a position, and we could help her.  And, now she's doing extremely well.  But, it was that kind of environment that I was fortunate enough to be in and to be helpful.  And, there were quite a number of others that I won't name.  And, then I became selected on the Delaware Bankers Association board of directors.  First African American for that.  And, subsequently became president of that organization where there are no other African American presidents of banks in Delaware.  And, as you may know, Delaware is kind of a capital for banking.  And, so that was also significant and I did that for a year and that was, that was out--extremely important for that move to have been made.  And, guess what, Kathy Roberts is now slated to be the next president of the Delaware Bank Associ [sic. Discover Bank]- so, now, she will be the first African American woman in such a great role.  And, it's, it's--these are the kinds of things, I think, that are so, so important for our people to be able to see and understand and appreciate.
Story_ID: 290903
Speaker 1: Do you think that African Americans have, and just in general, good knowledge about, like the world of banking and how banking works and that kind of thing?  Or, would you like to see more involvement and participation from African Americans in that aspect of banking?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I think African Americans in general have a very good understanding and appreciation about banking and the role in banking.  And, many of them are even more highly educated and experienced in it than I am, and that I probably ever will be.  I think what needs to happen is the opportunity.  The opportunity for them to rise above, and arise--to rise up to some of these senior level positions.  And, be recognized for the performance and the abilities that they have to be successfully and to lead a great organization such as in Discover [Discover Financial Services].  I think the opp- it's the opportunity.  And, what we need are more persons like a Kathy Roberts and others in the, in the other races to be supporters and advocates for getting more people the opportunity in--to be in those roles.
Story_ID: 290904
Speaker 1: And, speaking of opportunities let's talk about your next opportunity to work abroad, in Scotland.  How did that opportunity come about?
Speaker 2: I think earlier, I mentioned that I, I hadn't asked for many positions.  And, somewhere around maybe '97 [1997], I knew that we were looking to venture in the international arena with our credit operations [through Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover and Co.; Morgan Stanley].  And, that came from my time in strategic planning when I was in Chicago [Illinois].  So, I asked our president at that time to, and my boss, to consider me.  I said, "If there's a role that I can play in helping us to expand into the international area, I would love to.  And, just, just call me."  Again, that was about '97 [1997], and then a couple years later--well, occasionally throughout each year, I'd mention it to someone when I had the opportunity.  And, then I started thinking about retirement too, taking an early retirement because my--Laura [Vines Hill] and I had already decided maybe around age fifty-five, we're gonna call it quits.  And, we're gonna do something else maybe, transition into some other field.  And, but, about '99 [1999], early in that year, I received a call asking me if I was still interested in the international arena.  And, Laura is always adventurous, so she said yes, and we didn't have the children at home; Tonya [Hill GoKita] was in Japan.  John [Hill, II], our youngest had graduated and was working for the agency here, in the government here in the [Washington] D.C. area, in Virginia.  So, it was just us.  So, we said, "Hey, we'll be interested."
Story_ID: 290589
Speaker 1: So, we left off talking about your international opportunity.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, so, you got the opportunity to go where?
Speaker 2: Right.  To go to Scotland, and first I was asked if Scotland would be okay.  And, ironically enough and maybe coincidentally, my wife and I had taken a European vacation early that year.  One of the stops we made was in Scotland without knowing that, hey, you may have the opportunity to come back.  But, we had such a pleasant experience with the people.  We liked Scotland; beautiful country.  They do get a lot of misty rain there and they get a lot of cloudy overcast skies.  But, occasionally you do get sun and the temperature does get up to about 70 [degrees] a couple of days out of the year.  Most times, most of the time during the year it's in the 60s, mid to low 60s.  And, but, we said, "Yes.  We'll do it."  And, that was a interesting, rewarding, and challenging experience, all in one.  Challenging in the sense that it was the first time we'd ever lived outside of the U.S.  And, also, the housing, European housing, which Scotland is part of the U.K. [United Kingdom] as you know.  It's different from what we as Americans, you know--first of all, we're, we're used to big.  Big houses, big closets, walk-in closets.  Over there you have wardrobes--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --(laughter) not big walk-in closets.  And, I'm sure there are places, some that have gotten a little bit more westernized.  But, wardrobes, and so, we carried a lot--too many clothes than we, (laughter) we needed.  So, so, we ended up having to keep a lot of them packed up and stored in luggage that we took over and things of that nature.  But, barring those little inconveniences, it was a great experience.  And, the Scottish people like Americans.  They, they may recognize and see color but, we didn't feel that way.  We became very good friends with so many people there.  We found a church there in Edinburgh [Scotland] where we stayed, which is the capital.  And, Edinburgh is a wonderful city.  We stayed right in the heart of the city near Edinburgh Castle.  My wife, Laura [Vines Hill], was part of the women's group, American Women's Group, which gave her a strong base socially and intellectually to work with.  They had bible study and they would go on cultural trips around Scotland and other locations.  And, they would go to teas, and coffees, and they also had fundraisers.  So, that was good for her.  And, then in my work environment; one, I was the only African American there.  I was the most senior person in our business in Scotland.  And, that also put a little bit different weight on what I needed to do.  And, then again, this was their first experience in the Scottish environment with someone from Morgan Stanley [Morgan Stanley Consumer Banking Group International], in this role.  So, that was significant.  And, it was significant to, to make sure that it was a very good positive experience that they also had in working with me.  And, understanding me as a person and an individual but also, as a professional in this organization.  But, it, in my opinion and based on feedback I've received, I think it worked out extremely well.  We were there about three and a half years.  And, traveled extensively throughout Scotland, as well as in other parts of Europe.  But, it was a rewarding experience, excuse me, professionally and personally.  I think you mentioned earlier about, in our conversation about how important it is for we, as Americans, to develop an appreciation and a better understanding of all the other cultures and how other people live.  And, some of the challenges that they have, you know, in their day-to-day.  And, we learned a lot about the Scottish and somewhat the Irish culture, and also the British culture in that, the time we spent there.  So, that was very important for us and something that we will always treasure, and that we'll keep, keep those memories forever.
Story_ID: 290590
Speaker 1: Mr. Hill [HistoryMaker John Nathan Hill], what advice do your have for someone, particularly African American, who is interested in a career in financial services or banking?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, maybe twenty years or so ago, 'cause I was--got into it with Sears [Roebuck and Co.] thirty-two years ago--I would've said, you know, get a college education, you know and get that degree and that's about all you need.  And, then maybe in some instances that might be, even today.  But, I, but I think it's important if a young African American person is interested, they should start developing their skillset, and develop their awareness, and develop their learning in college by taking courses associated with financial services.  And, particularly international finance.  Or, and, having an appreciation for that, and being willing to venture outside the borders of the U.S. And, sharing that desire and interest with companies that you either are working for or ones that they aspire to work with.  So, I think, there's a need to develop that discipline and to acquire that learning if you can now, while they're in undergrad, or in their graduate years.  Because I think it'll be better for them, and it'll be--allow them and afford them the opportunity to compete maybe even better.  You know, I was fortunate because I had worked up through the ranks and I learned it as I went along, and it takes, takes longer to do it that way.  But, I think, if someone who has that base to work from and that knowledge to work from will, should be able to do much better.  But, be willing to take some risk.  You know, I believe sometime, we as people of color, do not want to step out and take that risk in something like this.  And, maybe we feel that we're gonna--the fear of failure.  And, the fact that something else has happened to us in our past that keep up from doing it.  But, I think, it's important for us to, to find someone who can mentor us.  And, it doesn't have to be necessarily another African American, if can be someone else that you can develop that relationship with.  And, who have been successful in their career and who's willing to kinda take you under their arms and give you some guidance and some thoughts and suggestions about how you maneuver through the corporate, big company pha--maze that's there.  So, those are, that would be some of the things that I would recommend--
Story_ID: 290591
Speaker 1: And, when you look back at your life, what stands out the most to you, and why?
Speaker 2: I think it's people, you know.  It's, and that's--it seems like a simple word, but it's, it's really not.  It's people that go all the way back to my childhood that, people who have touched me in so many different ways.  Whether it was in the community, whether it was in church, or whether it was in school, the elementary [North Boston Elementary School, Boston, Georgia] or the high school [Magnolia High School, Thomasville, Georgia].  My family and cousins, and as I got older, you know, the people that I encountered when I was in the [U.S.] military, college, people I--in my work environment who not only helped mentor, and coach, and counsel, with me but also ones who I had some impact on.  And, who've been able to give back to me and share with me, you know, their thoughts and ideas.  And, I've been able to see them grow, and develop, and mature in their part of the business, or in their profession, or in their lives.  So, it's, it's been a people thing.  And, it's one of those things that I don't forget, the people who have been so supportive of me throughout my life, both professionally, and personally.  And, they are still doing it, you know.  And, the connection is still there.  So, that's so important, so critical.
Speaker 1: Do you ever regret not pursuing that career in pharmacy, or dentistry, or medicine?
Speaker 2: Honestly, no.  You know, and first of all, when we made the decision to, to do it, to get into it, I told Laura [Vines Hill] at the time, I said, "I'm gonna give it 150 percent.  So, hang on."
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And, and we haven't looked back to, to overanalyze our decision.  We've, you know, we've said, "Hey, it was a great decision.  We've made, we made the best of it."  And, every location we've been in, we've done that.
Story_ID: 290592
Speaker 1: And, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I think, I'd have to go back to the quote that I gave early on, is that, you know, wherever I've been, and whatever I've done, and whoever I've met, I've made a, a committed, concerted effort to leave the person, or the place I've been better than the way it was when I first got there.  Or, the way they were when I first met them.  And, hopefully, I can, that would be something that people would remember.  You know, that he did make a difference in the lives of others.  And, he did make this place a great place to work.  He did make this community a little bit better than it was, when it was--before he came.  That's how I'd like to be remembered.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 290593
Speaker 1: And, is there anything else that you'd like to add that perhaps we didn't touch on?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't think so--you know, you did an excellent job, and (laughter), getting down deep into my thought process.  Things that I didn't think that I would, would be able to come forth.  And, my wife asked me, she said, "Do you need to make some notes?"  And, I said, "Well, maybe I should write down a couple of things like, that's not a part of my resume."  I've never done a biography. I said, "Well, this'll be great 'cause maybe it help now bring one together."  You know, like being part of a fraternity [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], I didn't put that in there.  And, being Baptist, and a very strong believer in my faith because I know for a fact, that it's helped me in my life.  It's been a steadying influence.  It has helped me stay grounded.  And, then as, as well as I say, the people.  You know, I think of, like in Wilmington [Delaware], people like Deacon Addy [ph.] and Frannie Cole [ph.], who were deacons in Eighth Street Baptist Church [The Resurrection Center, Wilmington, Delaware] that I belong to, and they are very close friends of ours.  But, we feel like, we are family.  And, they've been a steadying influence.  But, I, and, the pastor of our church, you know.  And, but, I go back to my, my parents, Napoleon [Hill] and Blanche [Hollis] Hill; owe them a lot.  Tremendous amount, that I can't ever repay them.  And, I thank them for what they've done and what they've been able to do and all the other people that helped me to get where--and I certainly have to give thanks to my wife, Laura [Vines Hill], and our kids, Tonya [Hill GoKita] and John [Hill, II].  Because, you know, they've been very supportive.  And, they've allowed me to do my thing and yet they've also been successful.  So.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much, Mr. Hill [HistoryMaker John Nathan Hill], and thank you for being so gracious with our time.
Speaker 2: Wonderful.  Thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Great.
Story_ID: 290594
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you wanna tell us--
Speaker 2: Well, that's, that's our family reunion group photo.  This one, I believe is, is our forty-third, maybe forty-second family reunion that was help in Boston, Georgia where I was born.  And, this is on the Hollis side of the family which is my mother's side of the family.  And, there was, there was approximately 60, 60 or 70 people that attended the event.  And, I am pretty much--no, a little bit to the, to the right.
Speaker 1: That's you right there, right?
Speaker 2: That's me.  Yeah, that's me, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you can see it in the monitor there.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yes, that's me with, with my mouth open.  I probably was talking.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And, about what year was that one taken?
Speaker 2: That would've been, let's see, would've been about three years ago.
Speaker 1: So, about 2000?
Speaker 2: Two thousand [2000], yeah, 2001 maybe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I can help you out with this one.  This one was '99 [1999].  Ready?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna have to hold it.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Great.  Go ahead, sir.
Speaker 2: Again, that's, that's a family reunion photo.  Again, on the Hollis side of the family.  I think that was our 40--fortieth, no forty-first family reunion.  We took a cruise.  It was cruise down to the Bahamas, and there were fewer members of the family who were able to, to attend.  But, we had a wonderful and a great time.  It--.
Speaker 1: About what year was this one?  And, this one was '99 [1999].
Speaker 2: I think this was in '99 [1999], yes.
Speaker 1: And, that's you right there?
Speaker 2: And, it would've been about the July time of the year.
Speaker 1: Is this right?  This is you, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that is me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Great.  Next.
Speaker 1: Next.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Go head.
Speaker 1: Yes, that's another family photo.  Again, the Hollis family.  And, actually, I think that was, that was on that same cruise.  We just had different, different attire on.  I don't know why it came out as, as '94 [1994].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't know--.
Speaker 2: So, you think this was 1999 as well?
Speaker 1: Yes.  I think that was 1999 as well.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, we--because it's, it is the same group, same group of people--.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and, it's, and it look like it's in the same location on that ship.
Speaker 2: You using that one?
Speaker 1: Yes, that is my grandmother and grandfather from my father's side of the family.  And, that's John Hill and Gussie Baker Hill.
Speaker 2: Do you know about what year that one was taken?
Speaker 1: Excellent questions; honestly, I do not know.
Speaker 2: If you had to guess, what would be your best guess?
Speaker 1: My best guess would've been, would be probably 1960, maybe in the late '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Late '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 1: I would say late '50s [1950s], yes.
Speaker 2: Sure.  That's fine.  That's fine.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, that's my father, Napoleon Hill.  That was taken at our home where my mother currently resides in Boston, Georgia.  That one would have been sometime in the mid-'80s [1980s]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --with him all dressed up.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That one is my mother who is sitting, and that's me standing right behind her.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, your mother's name?
Speaker 2: And, my mother's name is Blanche Hollis Hill.
Speaker 1: Okay.  About what year?
Speaker 2: And, this was taken last year, as a matter of fact, at my retirement ceremony.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, 2004?
Speaker 2: Two thousand and four [2004].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, that's me, [HistoryMaker John] Nathan Hill.  And, that one was taken in the office of the president of Discover Bank [Greenwood Trust Company; Discover Bank] and that would've been about 1995.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's Laura, Laura Vines Hill, who is from Alexander City, Alabama, my wife.  And, that's me, Nathan Hill.  It was, I think that was taken in 2003.  And, Laura and I by the way have been married as of December of last year, thirty-six years.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful.  And, one says 1955.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, that's charming young fellow there, is me in the raw (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But, it was taken in 1955 and I think that would've made me about eight years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, that's when I was a, a wee lad as they might say in Scotland.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But, that's, that's me in one of my baby pictures and I think I was about three or four years old at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that--
Speaker 2: So, that means that would've been about 1950.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is the same but just a different pose.  So, we'll go ahead and get it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Right.  And, that's me again.  I look like I'm in a little bit more cheerful mood in this one.  I'm smiling a bit.  But, it would've been in 1950 as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, that's a photo of our son, John; John Nathan Hill, II.  That's his graduation photo from the University of Delaware [Newark, Delaware] where he had a major in electrical engineering.  So, that was 1999.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's another photo of me from my high school days [at Magnolia High School, Thomasville, Georgia].  And, I think that one was, was taken in 19--
Speaker 1: Look like, it say '59 [1959].
Speaker 2: Maybe it's '59 [1959] to '60 [1960].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that means, I was about twelve or thirteen years old.
