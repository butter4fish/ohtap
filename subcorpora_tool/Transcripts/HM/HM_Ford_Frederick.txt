Speaker 1: Okay. When something comes to you (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: All right. (Laughter) okay.
Speaker 1: That is the saying. Okay.
Story_ID: 81222
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you some questions about your family roots.  What do you know about the origin of your family, how far can you go back in terms of your ancestors?
Speaker 2: Not too far, I know the names of my mother's father and my mother's mother.  We have a record showing what plantation my mother's mother was born on and when.  But on my father's side, I know the names, but we have no record of their dates of birth, and so forth. My mother was from New Orleans [Louisiana].  My father was from Mississippi; Tupelo, Mississippi, to be exact; a farm outside of Tupelo.
Speaker 1: Um, mm.  Now, in terms of your mother's, in terms of your mother's history, family history, do you know the name of that plantation that your grandmother was born on, or...  Was it your grandmother or grandfather?
Speaker 2: It would have been my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I don't have that committed to memory, I'd have to look it up, um, mm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Sir, are there any stories that are attached to that situation in New Orleans, though?
Speaker 2: Well, one is interesting, the one that I remember.  And that is my mother told me that her father, they didn't know anything about his background because he had been a stowaway on a ship that came to New Orleans from France.  So, we've always understood that he was of French descent, but he was arrived in New Orleans when he was about twelve years old and that some family took him in and raised him and so that's all we know about my grandfather on her side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And know that's an interesting story.
Speaker 2: Um.mm.
Speaker 1: Now what was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Victor Ellis, E-L-L-I-S.  And as a result of that, I have a brother who was named Ellis Victor. (Laughter)
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 81223
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any, any stories from your father's side of the family, about, about, you know, pre-Civil War times, or what they were doing, slavery free, or what, you know, anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know much about my father's people. I understand that his mother was part Indian and I have seen a picture of her and she's very much Negroid in that picture.  But I don't know anything more.  I did meet his, two of his sisters, who after he had left the farm in Mississippi they stayed and farmed for a number of years and then they sold the farm and moved to Beloit, Wisconsin. And by that time I was in Chicago [Illinois] and I went and visited with them prior to their death.
Speaker 1: Um, mm.
Speaker 2: I don't know much about them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But your father's people owned land in Mississippi.
Speaker 2: They did.  Right.
Speaker 1: That puts you in a bitter position, I guess, in those days and if you didn't, so many people were sharecropping in Mississippi, so.
Speaker 2: Well, the rest of that story is that when my father's sister sold the farm, someone actually bought it and they found some sort of clay on it that's used in cosmetics, (laughter), but it was too late for the Ford Family to benefit from it. (Laughter)
Speaker 1: That's unfortunate.
Speaker 2: They had a long time too, a long time in the family, yeah.
Speaker 1: I never visited the farm.  My sisters and possibly, my brothers had visited, but they would go and stay down there during the summer sometime.  But I came along too late in the family.  I'm the youngest of six children.  I came along too late in the family to do that.
Story_ID: 81224
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you give me your mother's full name and spell it for us and give us the, her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Florence Lucille Ellis, and of course, her married name is Ford.  And she was born on January 30, let me see, probably 19, 1892 [1892].
Speaker 1: She, was she born in New Orleans?
Speaker 2: She was born in New Orleans, yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Um, mm.
Speaker 1: And tell us about it, how did she grow up, and what was she like, what, what did she do?
Speaker 2: For by training, she was a seamstress, and she had some relatives in St. Louis [Missouri] and so she left New Orleans [Louisiana] at a pretty early age, I guess, in her, around twenty, something like that, may be before, and came to St. Louis   and supported herself by being a seamstress while living with this aunt.  And then, somewhere along the line there, she met my dad and they got married in 1913, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have any idea why she left New Orleans?
Speaker 2: No, she never really discussed it, other than, I just presumed for better opportunity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she never talked much about why she left New Orleans, um, mm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did she talk about how she and your dad met?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't. (Laughter)  I do know that my dad had previously been married before he'd married my mother and interestingly enough, the, his first wife's name was also Florence and then they were divorced and subsequently, he married my mother.
Speaker 1: Um, mm.  Okay.  Well, what was she like, I mean when you were growing up, did she continue to sew and ...
Speaker 2: Well, she had six children so she continued to sew, but she continued that sewing mostly for the family and of course, by the time I came along the depression was getting under way.  I was born in 1926, so you could see by the time I was three or four years old we were into the [Great] Depression.  So she made clothes, she quilted quilts, she mended, and she washed and she took care of the family.  She was a pretty stern woman, who, and had a strong will about her and growing up, we children understood very early, that no meant no (laughter).
Speaker 1: It didn't mean "maybe", huh?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's right.  So, I don't know if there's too much more to tell.  I just, you know, knew her as Mama, and that she loved us all, and she took care of us of all, as best that she could.  We were pretty poor during that time, except that my father was lucky because he had a job throughout the Depression, he just didn't make a lot of money, so we never went hungry; although, we had to wear the hand me downs from one child to the next.  And we had to wear patched clothing.
Speaker 1: Um, mm.
Speaker 2: That's how people got along during that period of time.
Story_ID: 81225
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell me about your father.  Can you give us his full name and his date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His full name was Lafayette Ford, and he was born in Tupelo, Mississippi in 1870[1870], excuse me, 1874 [1874].  He used to teach school in Mississippi, I understand and then he decided to move to St. Louis [Missouri], even though the --His sisters stayed on the farm.  And he, then ran on the road, as a Pullman Porter for a number of years and one of the interesting things I remember him telling me he used to study Latin and when the train would stop at various cities, he had his Latin book and after his duties were finished, he would sit on the train steps studying Latin, and the other Pullman Porters would laugh at him for studying Latin, like: "What are you going to do with that, Lafayette?"  But he had a desire to learn and a desire for knowledge.  And I think he passed that on to us.  He subsequently passed an examination for post office clerk and for the rest of his life; then until he retired he was a postal clerk in the St. Louis Post Office.  He was a, took lots of leadership positions and I think that's part of where our family, boys and the girls got it from.  He was President of the National Alliance of Postal Employees for a number of years.  I remember coming to Chicago in 1939.
Speaker 1: Um, mm.
Speaker 2: We drove here to the city.  (Clearing throat)  Because the National Alliance was having a convention here.  And um, mm this is a memory that we then left and went to visit his sister who, at the time, was living in Beloit, Wisconsin.  He was active in the YMCA.  He was a member of what they called the Board of Managers of the YMCA of St. Louis.  As a result, my brothers and I, and sisters, too, all were either active in the YMCA or the YWCA.  And we went to the YMCA camp.  I went for many years, started out when I was nine years old.  Eventually, got to be in leadership positions and even when I was in college I came back to the camp in the summer to be the Program Director, and so forth.  It's a fond, fond memory of mine.
Speaker 1: Um, mm.
Speaker 2: Also, learned a lot about working with people, learned a lot of leadership skills in that way.  My father was also interested in business.  For, for years he was busy doing these other things but he still had an interest in business.  I remember that there was a lodge called the "Odd Fellows" in St. Louis, it may have been other places and he was a member of this lodge, and in any event (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: There are other places, yeah. There is one in Dayton, I've been to Dayton. (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Did you?  I see. (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Okay, well, the Odd Fellows got together and they were going to set up cooperative grocery store and the grocery store didn't work over any long period of time.  But I just remember, the, this was like in the early 30's [1930's], again, during the midst of Depression.  But he had this interest in business and I think that's where my brothers got it from.  And they, then when they finished high school and junior college began to get involved in the business.  So, that in essence, the boys in the family all were involved in business, one way or another.
Speaker 1: Well, that's wonderful.  That's, I mean that's interesting.
Story_ID: 81226
Speaker 1: They, your brothers got involved in this Odd Fellows Grocery Store?
Speaker 2: No, they weren't in the Odd Fellows Grocery Store.  They, they started out buying Snickers and Milky Ways by the box and selling them retail in high school,(laughter) when they were in high school; that was their beginning of being in business.  And then sometime, during the mid 30's [1930's], they borrowed enough money to start a restaurant called the "The Turf Grill" in St. Louis.  And eventually, they had three of those... (Simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Um, mm.
Speaker 2: Turf Grill restaurants.  And then they opened up a restaurant, it was like a carry out, like fast food for French Fried Shrimp, called "Ford French Fried Shrimp". (Clearing throat)  I had a cousin, we had a cousin here in Chicago, whose first name, I don't really know what it is, but we called him "Sonny" and it was White's French Fried Shrimp, here in Chicago...some nights(simultaneous).
Speaker 1: On 71st Street, White Shrimp on 71st St?
Speaker 2: Uh, huh.   Yeah, that's not the same family now, but, it, that's where it started, right.  And, my sister came up and spent, I don't know, maybe a month or so, learning how to prepare it and so forth.  And, she came back to St. Louis and they opened the "Shrimp Emporium". (Laughter) And it did very, very well for a time.  One of the problems is, of course, the fluctuating price of shrimp, and that became a problem.  And so, eventually, though they got out of the restaurant business and, and had an opportunity into being insurance brokers.  And that was in the early 1950's, [1950's].  And so they then stayed in the insurance brokerage business. Until the, when the first, one of my oldest brothers until he passed away and my next to the oldest brother until he retired about ten years ago.
Speaker 1: But, it all started, they all, well, I'm trying to get to the Odd Fellows Grocery Store didn't have any connection with (unclear)
Speaker 2: No, other than I think that it illustrates that my dad had this, you know, ongoing interest in, in business and particularly, in Negro businesses getting started.  One of my brothers, for instance, was the head of the Negro Business League and in St. Louis.  And, I think, those inclinations came from my dad.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now, and is this Negro Business League associated with the old Negro Business League, founded by Booker T. Washington back then?
Speaker 2: Well, it may, may be, but I just don't happen to know the history of it, and that brother passed away here in December of, of 2001.  And he was the one that was very active in it.
Story_ID: 81227
Speaker 1: So, you think that, that, well, I know in those days, people had to be, had to be proactive about trying to get some income, you know, because of the Depression.  Your mother was a seamstress and knew something about business, I guess, because of your father, you know, was involved...  I mean do you think that your parents, I mean did your parents teach you all to get involved in business?
Speaker 2: Well, I wouldn't say "teach."  I think they encouraged them.  I think my dad was very encouraging to my brothers, to go out; he'd help them, and you know, if necessary, sign the note for them, to borrow the money.  And, you know by today's standards, this wasn't a lot of money, I think it was, you know, maybe $500.00, but, in the mid 30's [1930's], it was hard to get a hold of any money, particularly to get a loan.  They were able to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, are all your siblings brothers or?
Speaker 2: No.  I have two sisters, all my brothers now are dead.  I had three brothers and two sisters.  And, now there just left are my two sisters and myself.  My sisters live in the Los Angeles [California] area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your brothers started out selling candy bars and--
Speaker 2: That's where they started while still in high school, and then they had another business that they promoted after they got out of high school.  At Christmas time they would, oh say, start in September, October go around to the grade schools and take orders for hard candy and then they would buy it wholesale, in big boxes and then they would put it in the cellophane bags and then the cellophane bag would go into a little Christmas box that had a little handle on it.  They would deliver it to the teachers at Christmas time with the teachers that would then give it to the children, because there would always be a Christmas party and they may still do it for all I know. Though, again Christmas Party at Christmas time.  So, in effect they bought the hard candy wholesale.  I remember we were around the kitchen table, we would have a scoop and fill bags fairly well and we had boxes all the way down the hall for later delivery to the schools.  At the same time, (clearing throat) they had, they sold Christmas candy, chocolate candy and there they the manufacturer would do what they called a "sample box."  The sample box had this layer of beautiful candy on top of this tissue paper underneath, on the second, so, but that's what you went around and showed that to people and you would take orders.  And, as a matter of fact, while I was still in school, I sold candy, and they had, I don't know, five or six salesmen working for them who sold candy and so go around and sell this to you.  So, you would go around and just like the four brush men, and take your order and come December 1st, or whatever, the 10th, or whatever, and deliver the candy and they would get some sort of deposit and collect the balance of it when they delivered the candy, which reminds (laughter) also, see what I mean about them having this business inclination (unclear).  They also, somewhere along the line, made and sold pies to the school children (laughter).  I remember, it's vague, now.  But I remember going over to the pie factory, so to speak, I'd forgotten about the pies. (Laughter)
Story_ID: 81228
Speaker 1: What about the juke box, I saw the ad for the juke boxes, too?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They, they knew the juke boxes, I don't know how they met him, I think they met him through ... well, let me back up a little bit; next door to the shrimp shop, they had opened up right after the war ended.  There was a huge pin up demand for domestic appliances, refrigerators, and ranges, and so forth.  So, they opened up this appliance store.  And in the appliance store, they also sold records and they got the records from this music distributor, who also controlled the juke box business in St. Louis or much of it and some kind of way or another, he made them a distributor for juke boxes in the negro, black neighborhoods, and so they had this, they must have had, I don't know, 100 juke boxes in taverns and restaurants, and wherever they could put them, and that time, juke box plays was a nickel (laughter).  So, you know, they, you had to buy records in which is how they got into this in the first place and keep the music up to date  and they had to service the juke boxes and so, my third brother, the one Ellis Victor, that I mentioned, named after his grandfather, he ran the juke box business.  And, now, all of these things, you know, eventually passed off the scene of Ellis Victor, my brother, not my grandfather, in the early 50's, [1950's].  Um, mm, he got out of the Juke Box business and began teaching at the Washington Technical High School and then he eventually moved to Hawaii about 1950, [1950] or thereabouts, where he was a civilian employee of the Navy, in charge of training for civilians.  And, so they were, they ran a program up until his death over in Honolulu of training civilian employees of the Navy.  And, so, as you can see, (laughter) my, my; I wasn't intimately involved in all of these things, but my family has been involved in a lot of entrepreneurial activities (laughter).
Story_ID: 81229
Speaker 1: Now, sir, let me rewind back I guess to when you were a little kid in the neighborhoods that you lived in (simultaneous)...
Speaker 2: Um, mm.
Speaker 1: I don't, did you live in the same place all the time or did you
Speaker 2: Lived in the same place, all the time, 4419 Aldine Avenue in St. Louis [Missouri] .  It a part of the city known as the "Ville", Ellisville, and they just called it the "Ville".
Speaker 1: Now, what was the neighborhood like?
Speaker 2: Um, mm, the neighborhood was mostly single family homes, some six and eight family buildings.  We had a single family home there.  All, well I was about to say all black, but that's not true because in the early days, there were like, I can remember, at least three white families who lived in the neighborhood. They eventually moved and the neighborhood became all black.  But it was one block from the grade school that I attended and I lived in the 4400 of Aldine and the grade school was in the 4300 so, you know, one block to school.
Speaker 1: Sir, what was some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: That's kind of interesting, I don't, I have no idea about what kind answer you are expecting to this question.  But, in those days, there was a, there was a man who sold bacon skins and he would come around at night time and he would call out, "Skin Man" (laughter) and he sold skins and in those days before refrigeration, you had to buy ice where you keep our food cold.  So we had a real ice box, meaning you had to put ice in them and so there was an ice man and (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Did he sing too--
Speaker 2: He would come by, and well, they had a sign usually you'd leave in the window, you would turn it around at 50, or 100 so that he'd knew what size piece of ice to bring and he knew where the ice box was and he'd put the ice in the top and then this is like during the Depression and people had to make a living however, they could.  So there was another man who collected rags and he was the rag man.  And he would come by and say: "Rag Man"... And if you had, you know, old, tattered and torn clothing that could no longer be used for anything, you would give it to the gentleman (unclear).  But, we would do it, my mother would gather a cork a sack, like potatoes or something. And you would put the rags in there.  So when the rag man came by you'd give him this sack of rags.  So, of course, he would go out and sell and just like you recycle newspapers today, he recycled cloth in those, those days. It's interesting, before the, before electric lights were put in, there was, we had gas lights and they had to be lit every night and so the guy with the lighter stick, I guess it must have been powered by gas or something, you know, he would come by and stick this up in the light, gas light and light the light for the night.
Speaker 1: Did he have a lantern or something?
Speaker 2: No, it was a long stick.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you would stick it up through the hole and at this point, I don't remember how they turned the gas on and off.  But, at any event, he would light the gas lights
Story_ID: 81230
Speaker 1: I remember when Joe Louis beat [Jack] Sharkey and we were, were youngsters and we all turned out in the street and marched up and down the streets, it was a wonderful occasion (laughter).
Speaker 2: And those fights, I've heard they were a big deal in....
Speaker 1: Well, we all gathered; there was no TV, we all gathered around the radio and listened to the fight, and I guess you use your imagination but it was, was a sense of great pride that we all had in those days.
Speaker 2: So, the kids actually marched around the neighborhood (laughter)?
Speaker 1: We marched up and down the street, right, yeah; (laughter) celebrating the fact that Joe Louis had won.  So, I don't know those are some of the sounds and smells of the neighborhood there. (Laughter)  And also had a watermelon man in the summer.  He would come by and he would announce: "Watermelon Man" and in those days, what he would do, to prove them, the, his fruit was good, he would plug the watermelon, cut a, he would cut a triangular piece out of the melon and would take it and show that it was a ripe melon that he was about to sell.  And the milk man, (laughter) he'd deliver milk every day and set it on your doorstep and then go to the grocery store and buy milk; it was delivered.   And then in the early days, where the milk man had a horse drawn wagon, but then later he got, he got a motor driven vehicle, and then eventually, as you well know, it got too expensive to have milk delivered, you went to the corner store to get it.  I hadn't thought about these things until you asked me. (Laughter)
Speaker 2: Any way, you know, it was interesting, you know, people nowadays, you know, can't imagine a milk man, or a bakery man or any these kind of people...
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Insurance man would come by your house, right?
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Basically.  Lot of other people, dry cleaning would be delivered door to door?
Speaker 1: The dry cleaner, well, the, the, this dry cleaner delivery came later and those times we had to take our things to the dry cleaner, but he wasn't far away.  He was, you know, a small businessman, who had a business, a block or so away on a business street.  Ours was a residential street. (Clearing throat)
Speaker 2: None of those things are hardly done any more, you know, so people, it wouldn't be unusual, to see someone sitting in your living room, you know, one of these guys delivering something or trying to get a form filled out or showing brushes or--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Oh, I forget to tell you that my brothers also sold Fuller Brushes for a while (laughter).  And they would come in the house, and they would, I re... let's see, they would, they were older than I and my brother, Alfred, was 11 years older than I and my brother, Lafayette was twelve years older than I.  So, you know, I was a little guy when they were out of high school.  But, they would practice their sales pitches in the living room, they would come out and lay the brushes out and go through their sales talk and so forth.
Speaker 2: Um, mm.
Speaker 1: Interesting.
Story_ID: 81231
Speaker 1: What, uh, so as a little kid, you saw all this entrepreneurial activity going on around you, but what kind of little boy were you, what did you like to do?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see, I wasn't much of an athlete, when I went to camp, I learned how to swim and so I was a pretty good swimmer all my life.  I did, a lot of I wouldn't say a lot, but I used to like to read quite a bit.  But, I started going to camp when I was nine, and I really took to that, and the first year or two,  I went for a couple weeks until I was able to get a position, like a cabin leader, in which case it then didn't cost me any money to go to camp.  And so I would go and stay all summer. (Laughter)  And it was really, you know, a wonderful experience, a wonderful part of my life.  And then, as I, when I got to high school, I used to work at the YMCA.  I was a desk clerk, because this was a YMCA building that had rooms, where the Pullman Porters and others; as a matter of fact, you know in the early days, their hotels and what not were segregated and so this was one of the nicer places for Negroes to stay.  So I worked at the Y and I taught swimming, and I, I ran the lobby, sort to speak, for kids in the After School Program.  Kids play games and shot pool and they'd pick up games of basketball in the gym, that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: That's an enviable position for those days.  I mean, I mean, I can, somebody who could work at the Y desk, everybody knows you. (Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And sees you as being responsible.  That's a--
Speaker 2: I knew everybody from both sides of the town, sort to speak.  There were two Negro high schools, one was Vashon High School and the other was the Sunrise School.  I lived in the neighborhood of the Sunrise School, but the YMCA was downtown, so it was pretty, in the Vashon neighborhood.  And by virtue of the YMCA and the camp, I knew guys and girls from both schools, so it was sort of an advantage to be because it was a certain amount rivalry and what not between the two schools.  My wife went to Vashon and, as a matter of fact, I went to Sumner, I ended up, ended up marrying up into the rivalry (laughter).  I took her to a football game, early in our courtship, which was before I finished high school and I tease her now because she was hoping that the game would end in a draw, so that she wouldn't have to be on the either side. (Laughter)
Story_ID: 81232
Speaker 1: Well, when you were in grade school, what, what grade school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Went to grade school, called John Marshall Grade School.
Speaker 1: Is that the one right down the street?
Speaker 2: Right, Um, mm.
Speaker 1: John Marshall, all right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what were your favorite subjects in school?
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess, I would say, that I liked Geography best, and then I liked Mathematics and I liked English.  It's, it's a pretty well list.
Speaker 1: Um, mm.
Speaker 2: The subjects. (Unclear)
Speaker 1: Now, was any teachers that really took a particular interest in you, and or that you remember and really learned something from?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't guess I can say any teacher. To, to me, I was treated pretty well by all the teachers that I went through.  And I, you know, by the family was pretty prominent in St. Louis and so, I kind of did not go in as an unknown, so to speak.  And, many of the teachers, were in fact, contemporaries of my brothers and so forth. And some others were members of the church that my dad belonged to.  And so anyhow, I got to be known as one of the "Ford Boys." (Laughter)
Story_ID: 81233
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, in, in high school, when you had this great experience in camp at Sumner.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, which had a lot towards shaping your sense of responsibility, I guess.  And you're at camp all summer, you feel really kind of independent, don't you, when you get back, I mean that's a lot of freedom when you're at camp all summer long.
Speaker 2: Well, it was a wonderful experience, I enjoyed it.  I'd still, I'd still go out there today, if it existed  (Laughter)  You know we had our routine and we had the nature study classes and various competitions the kids would enter into and earn emblems and stars and so forth.  It was a, I think it was probably the most important experience in my life, really.  I think you learn the leadership skills, you learn how to get along with people from, you get to mix with people from all walks of life and some of the campers that camp would always have youngsters from the orphans' homes, they would have some from the juvenile homes that would come to the camp.  And so you had a complete mixture of kids from all sections of the city.  So, you know it's not just a matter of getting to know a lot of people, but you got to know people you would not ordinarily meet.  So it was a, a, I call it a wonderful character building experience.  I got to observe the camp director and how he got things done and how he enthused the crowd, sort to speak.  I used to lead the singing at the camp.  We would sing before each meal and then we would have programs in the evening for  where we'd have (unclear) singing of all kind of camp songs, some spiritual songs, crazy songs (laughter).  We took canoe trips to the down, the camp was on the river, called the Merrimac River.  We took trips down the river to the State Park and then we took one trip.  There were nine of us, we had three canoes and we took a trip from, this river ran sort of northeasterly from mid-state Missouri up to just outside of St. Louis.  And we took a canoe trip from the camp to Valley Park, is the name of the town, where we got off, which is right close to the confluence of the Merrimac River and the Mississippi River.  And as a matter of fact, I went to Sumner High School Reunion last year and there were two fellows there who had been on this canoe trip.  One of them is a retired Navy man, he lives in Dallas now.  And the other one is a lawyer there in St. Louis.  And it's, it's still a very fond memory of all, of those of us who remain, I think it took us four or five days on the river, camping on the overnight, in the woods (laughter).
Speaker 1: It sounds like a great experience.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, it was, it was a wonderful experience.

Speaker 1: Now, in high school, what were you focused in high school, what subjects and what activities?
Speaker 2: Well, some way or another, in high school I discovered fun. (Laughter)  So, I don't know exactly how the years fit together, but I ended up for instance singing in the A Capella Choir.  And I ended up being president of the choir.  And then I became a member of the student council, and I ended up being president of the student council.  Then I joined "the High Wi", High Wi was the high school YMCA and then I ended up being the president of the High Wi.  And each of these, excuse me, organizations had something going on. Like the High WI published, what we called a buzz book, was a directory of the school, students and we sold ads, you know and what not.  And to this date, you know, people all remembered the buzz book, and it went on, I don't know, three or four years. After we were gone.  Then, by virtue of being in those organizations, I was in the city wide HI-Y, which included St. Louis and the suburbs.  And so, that was then my first exposure to predominantly white community and I ended up being president of the city wide HI-Y. And the same thing happened with the student council, I was in the city wide student council, where the black schools, you know, were in the minority because took in St. Louis High Schools, of which they were maybe five or six and schools in the suburbs as well.  And, I ended up becoming president of the city wide student council.
Story_ID: 81235
Speaker 1: So, you know, I got a lot of exposure again, a lot of hands on experience, I would say, in leadership techniques and ability, and what not.   In that same period of time, the YMCA had a national conference in Miami, Ohio, at Miami University.
Speaker 2: Um, mm.
Speaker 1: And I went there, I don't know when this was, probably around '40, '43, [1940], [1943], or something like that maybe.  But, anyhow, it was like one of my first experiences out from the home, out from the city, out from people who knew you.  And on this long trek by bus seemed like a long trek.  We stopped in Indianapolis, Indiana, and then, and I remember the person in charge had to make special arrangements to make sure that there was a place where I could eat.  Because in the bus stations over in Indianapolis was-- --was not one of the places where Negroes could eat at the time.
Speaker 2: Segregated, (Unclear)
Speaker 1: That's right, I can't remember where I did eat at the time, whatever.
Speaker 2: Was St. Louis segregated?
Speaker 1: St. Louis segregated, right.  And the high school I went to was all black.  There were two all black high schools in St. Louis.
Speaker 2: There are no white, black students going to the other high schools, at all?
Speaker 1: No, no.  St. Louis was totally segregated.
Speaker 2: Totally segregated, all right.
Speaker 1: So, anyhow, you know, and then these things tend to fit together because the A Cappella choir that I was a member of and the president of actually participated in this "Y" circus that I mentioned to you.  The first half of "Y" circus was local acts, so to speak.  And the second half of it was the professional acts by artists, like [Nat] King Cole and Duke Ellington and so forth, and Jimmy Longford and his Orchestra and whatnot.  And so, the choir was one of the acts so to speak at the "Y" circus.
Story_ID: 81236
Speaker 1: An interesting, an interesting event along the high school was the, I was elected to the National Honor Society, and the principal of the school thought that I was going to be elected the President of National Honor Society, and so they black balled me.  This was like in September, and I would graduate the following June.  So, they had two election periods.  So, then they, so they, then so I didn't get in at the time I was supposed to get in.  So, then comes March, April or something of the following year, 1944 [1944] then they admitted me to the National Honor Society, so, I turned it down. (Laughter)
Speaker 2: And if you had gotten in on time, you would be the President, (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: I'd be the president.  So, they, they waited until the second go around and then I decided that I'd fix 'em'.(them) (laughter)  So, so, I was not a member of the National Honor Society on account of I turned it down.
Speaker 2: You may be one of the few (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (laughter)
Speaker 2: Obviously, who turned it down?
Speaker 1: (Laughter)
Speaker 2: But, did you have the feeling, that you were, how did you feel about yourself, you know, being selected for that, you know?
Speaker 1: Well, I felt like I deserved it, my grades and everything, you know.  I just felt like these adults were being pretty petty, and I talked to my dad about it. And I talked to some of the teachers that I was close to and I told them what I was going to do. They said: "Well, if that's the way you feel about it, that's what you ought to do."  So, that's how I did it.  The principal of the school, is George Brantley and, he just thought I was getting too big for my pants (laughter).  He was probably right.
Story_ID: 81237
Speaker 1: But then I went away to the University of Illinois in 1944 [1944], Fall of '44 [1944].  And I made Honor's Day at the University of Illinois that following Spring, and I got a very nice letter from, that school notified the high school that I had this achievement; and so I got a very nice letter from him, saying how proud they were and he had a real good letter from the school, from the University of Illinois that had been read to students who were there and so forth.  So, there was no lasting animosity.
Speaker 2: Okay.  How did you end up choosing the University Of Illinois?
Speaker 1: Well, that's an interesting story.  We just acknowledged that the schools in St. Louis, and in fact, in all of Missouri were segregated at that time and the University of Missouri, at Columbia did not admit Negroes.  The designated Negro school was Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri.  Well, by that time I had decided the best way to learn business was from the inside.  And that the inside meant being an accountant, so I decided I was going to study accountancy, but Lincoln University had no curriculum in accountancy and that set of circumstances, the state of Missouri would pay the tuition of a Negro student at another institution, another state institution. So, the University of Illinois had one of the best accounting programs in the country.  And so I decided to go there, and the State of Missouri then paid my tuition.
Story_ID: 81238
Speaker 1: What was Illinois like when you started going to school there?  Was, did you find Illinois much different from Missouri?
Speaker 2: It was somewhat different.  The University of Illinois, itself was pretty much fully desegregated, so to speak.  Although, I believe in the fall of '44 [1944], when I started was the first time that the University dormitories were opened to all students.  But the town of Champaign-Urbana still had its problems.  For instance, if we went to the movie, we were expected to sit up in the balcony and not on the first floor.  And, some of the restaurants were not willing to serve blacks.  And, so I appreciate the fact that this is early on. But, some of us from the Kappa House and other places had sit-ins in some the restaurants back in 1944 [1944] and '45 [1945].  And did in fact end up making you know some changes (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Now, this is significant. Because most people think that there were no sit-ins until 1961 or so.
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't you know I would certainly acknowledge There wasn't as big or probably wasn't as effective but we managed though to get places like Steak N' Shake, opened up to serve everybody.  And so other restaurants along Green Street there in Champaign-Urbana.
Speaker 1: Well, what was the response, what did you, you all just sat down and .....
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: What was the response, did they try to arrest you or?
Speaker 2: No, they did not.  They didn't call the police or anything.  And I think what they did, they closed the restaurant.  But after we left, they opened it right back up and again (laughter).  But, there were several student committees and what not, that had been formed interracial groups and to help open up the restaurants and theaters and I don't really remember all the details, but they did eventually come around to during some places and that four or five years that I was there.  They eventually came around to serving everybody.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How many times did you all do that, do you remember?
Speaker 2: I don't know I would say may be uh, uh four or five times, the people at the Steak N' Shake, there were several restaurants, one was a drive-in and it happened to be very close to the Kappa Alpha Psi House, where I lived.  We were at Third and John and, this Drive In was at Third and Green Street, something like a block away and it was a favorite place of ours to go get chili and hamburger at 10:30 at night when those hunger pains strike. (Laughter)  But eventually, you know, they came, they came around the same way with a restaurant that was a few blocks from there, you know.
Story_ID: 81239
Speaker 1: Now just a detail about that, was your sit in movement, though small, call it a movement because it actually was, even though you may think it was small--But was it organized by, did any national organization play a part or just a local, I mean a campus generated?
Speaker 2: I would say it was, it was campus generated.  I can't remember the names of the groups, but there were several interracial groups who were interested in this, but my recollection of the sit-in at Steak N' Shake that it was just the guys from the Kappa House who decided enough was enough, you know, and that we would close it down.  You see Illinois had on its books the State Of Illinois, on its books a law requiring, you know, equal services, they had it on the books for many years.  So, technically, you know, these people were in violation of the state law, the only thing is that, as you know, the state laws are enforced by the local prosecuting attorneys and so if the prosecuting attorneys didn't prosecute, you know, the law went on.  But I think the Steak N' Shake was mostly people from, guys from the Kappa House.  It was some other places around, a couple of the favorite drinking holes that at one time or another early on didn't want to serve blacks and I think that there's where the some of the broader organizations on campus got behind it and opened it up pretty quickly.
Story_ID: 81240
Speaker 1: Now, did you get involved with the Kappa Alpha Psi right away?
Speaker 2: Yes, you see one of the things was it was a place to live because they had a fraternity house so I went, I went there in September, actually I went to visit in August of '44 [1944].  Then I went in September, '44 [1944] to enter in school. And I had made arrangements to stay at the Kappa House and then that eventually led to pledging and to the Kappas.  And you know I got involved in the fraternity thing, so, then it turned out to be a very good experience and some of were talking that it was good for us because it gave us some attachment to the campus and to life in this big humongous university. I most tell you though at that time, the University had 8,000 students that's compared to, I don't know, 40,000 today.  But it gave us a foot hold, it gave us some immediate social contacts and it gave us some discipline also that a student going away to school today might not, might not have available to them.  The fraternity was, was, I would say sort of a caring organization at that time anyhow, because the youngsters coming down would get lectured, so to speak, on you know the need for studying, the need for having a schedule, and a need for sticking to it and the need for getting enough rest and, I mean you know it's like do this, do this, and do this. Also, provided resources, like past examinations so that you'd have some kind of idea on what's coming up on the next exam and how to do it.  And, tutoring, so to speak, if somebody is in Engineering School that was ahead of you that can help, you know, a youngster coming along.
Story_ID: 81241
Speaker 1: So it was, for us, it was a good experience.  I don't know that the fraternity experience today, has, still has those same features.  Particularly, where they don't have a fraternity house.  I think it was the living together, which made the experience unique.  So the things that I read that are happening at, in fraternities and what not, today at some of the schools, you know, are pretty sickening.  And, so I can't necessarily recommend it today (laughter), but when we went to school, it was, wasn't that bad.  It was an advantageous situation.
Speaker 2: It's interesting that, the people that you talk to in your group had a more positive experience with the fraternities and sororities.  I think it was the sororities that remain pretty much, you know, true to their original--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Um, mm.
Speaker 2: But with some exceptions, you hear some other things (unclear) every now and then.  But, the fraternities, and I guess there are still some good chapters, they don't seem to be quite what they used to be.
Speaker 1: No, this thing of beating people and that sort of thing, is beyond belief and it had no relationship to the..., we used to have fun. But, you know, you never hurt anybody. And that's the thing which I don't understand today.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think coming along in the later generation, I saw them, somewhat as, a way to divide black students, because the rivalries were so intense, that, you know, you didn't want to get caught up in.
Speaker 1: You mean between fraternities?
Speaker 2: Yeah, between fraternities.
Speaker 1: I see, um, mm.
Speaker 2: They'd have shoot outs in some schools in Ohio.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Almost gang type presence, which, I know that was not....
Speaker 1: No, that's right.  You know, we had rivalry and you know between the Alphas and the Kappas.  But, you know, really we were all friends.  Those who played bridge, they played bridge together.  Those who played poker, played poker together. (Laughter)
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's interesting.  I don't know, that's something that's really needed, I don't think there's, I guess people are trying in different forms to provide that kind of comradery on campus and help.  I think all students probably need it.  You know, yeah, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, it's pretty hard, you know, most of the big state universities are 40,000 and 50,000 students, you get thrown into the midst of all of this, you just come out of high school and just left home and  you went off and it's like what do I do now, sort of thing.  And that's what I found that the fraternity did.  I had a friend, Doctor Edward Cusack, of course, he wasn't a doctor at the time, he lived in Alton, Illinois, which is not far from St. Louis and I met him at a, at a dance at this little teacher's college.  I don't know, someplace during, before I went to Illinois.  And then, he was the one that told me about the Kappa House.  I didn't know anything about Kappa because he lived there.  He had--he was like going into his sophomore year and I was just coming in and so.
Story_ID: 81242
Speaker 1: Now, your brothers were entrepreneurs.  But had, had  any of your brothers attended college?
Speaker 2: They went to junior college there in St. Louis [Missouri].  I think the Stowe Teacher's College was a junior college that's all the college that they had, the two older ones. And the third brother, Ellis, he came here to Chicago, to study radio.  RCA had a radio technical college here.  He was the one that was mechanically inclined and so that was the extent of his advanced training.  Um, mm.
Speaker 1: So, you are the pioneer for the family.  The first time, you know, full, this full time major institution
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  My sisters went to college, when the oldest sister went, graduated from Lincoln University and my second sister went to School Teachers College and then to get her Master's Degree at Atlanta School of Social Work.  Um, mm.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Um, mm.
Speaker 1: So, you weren't just the only one, a pioneer--
Speaker 2: Right.  No, I wasn't the only one in the family (laughter).
Story_ID: 81243
Speaker 1: But you really didn't have a road map about how to negotiate against Illinois?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Uh, huh--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, you know, when we look through the yearbook, we see you on every page.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Speaker 1: So, tell me what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, you know I had been involved in all of this stuff in high school and so when I got to the University of Illinois, you know I had some inclination to get involved again, so I got involved in student politics and ran for something, I don't, maybe president or what not, maybe president of the freshman class.  And, then I stayed involved in student politics most of the time that I was there.  And in my, I guess it was my junior year, I was elected to the student senate, which is the student organization that over practically all the activities and what not.  And then finally in the second half of my senior year I was elected president of the student senate.  And I think, probably the first black to be the president of the student senate, and maybe the first black to be a member of the student senate.  I'm not, I'm not sure.  So you know that was interesting.  I was also in the Kappa Fraternity, the president as known as the "Pole Mark", and so I was elected "Pole Mark" of the, of the Kappas for a year.  And, when I was a pledge, which is prior to joining the fraternity, the pledgers are called the Scrollers Club, and so I was president of the Scrollers Club (laughter).  So, I don't know, it seemed like it was a habit, so to speak (laughter), to get into, get involved.  So, I don't know, I, I enjoyed being in college.  I had to, you know, I had to work my way through, I had a job waiting tables.  We called it a "meal job," you worked to get your meal, that's, that was your pay and so I had worked at several fraternities and sororities so while there.  I made little money during the summer as a counselor at camp, so I wasn't completely broke.  But my folks just didn't have resources to send me to school and send me an allowance so, but I enjoyed college, you know, enjoyed the friends elsewhere (unclear).  I meant a lot of people from Chicago because there were a lot of Chicagoans at the University of Illinois and we would come to Chicago, you know, during breaks and Thanksgiving and so forth; particularly, when Illinois played Northwestern football game. And go to the parties and so forth.
Speaker 1: Now, who, who were some of the people in Chicago that you met when going to school in Illinois?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see, one was Bob Kelly who had been on the Illinois track Team, [HM] Earl Strayhorn, who was just recently retired as a judge, here in the city.  [HM] Bill Cousins, who also just recently retired as a judge here in the city.  [HM] Earl Neal, let's see, I don't know, I guess they'll, they'll come to me in due time. (Simultaneous)
Speaker 1: We've interviewed most of those people, I think, except one of them.
Speaker 2: Is that so?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Strayhorn and Cousins was here last week.
Speaker 2: Is that so, um, mm.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: We were filming. (Unclear)
Story_ID: 81244
Speaker 1: Now, what did you major in college?
Speaker 2: I majored in Accounting.
Speaker 1: That's right.  You (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I got a, I had a Bachelor of Arts, a Bachelor of Science in Accounting and then I got a Master's of Science in Accounting.  So I stayed there five years in total.  And then after that, I studied for the CPA exam and I passed the CPA exam in 1952 [1952].  And by that time, I had gone over to Draper and Kramer, Incorporated.  But when I first got out of school, I went to work for Mary T. Washington; but then that firm is now known as Washington and McKeever, it was subsequently prior to that, was known as Washington, Pittman and McKeever.
Speaker 1: Um, mm.
Speaker 2: Hiram Pittman was CPA and a partner of Mrs. Washington.
Speaker 1: Lester McKeever is a--
Speaker 2: It's a firm that Lester McKeever is with, right.  Um, mm.  Have you interviewed Lester? (Laughter)
Speaker 1: Not yet.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Well, you should, he has a lot, lot to tell.  Lester lived at the Kappa House.  You see Lester was like maybe four or five years after I had gone.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now well, so, so you were with Mary Washington?
Speaker 2: Right, I worked for Mrs. Washington close to two years.  See, the, the issue with most black economists, were finding someplace to get the experience.  She was good enough to take a lot of the young fellows and let them work with her, because when I first started with her, I just worked on a commission basis.  So, the accounts that I did, the tax returns that I did, but in any event, I was getting what I needed most, was the, the, the experience.
Story_ID: 81245
Speaker 1: And then this job came along, during that, during that time I came to Chicago [Illinois] from Champaign-Urbana [Illinois] in December of '49 [1949] and then I went to Draper and Kramer in May of '51 [1951].  During that period of time, I was around talking with people about job opportunities and so forth.  And one of the people that I talked to was Robert Taylor, after whom Robert Taylor Homes are named.  And he introduced me to his nephew, John Freeman, and Freeman was interested in business and I was interested in it and he thought we'd find something to do together.  Well, we didn't find anything to do together but the, the interesting part of this story is that I was rooming at 63rd and Champlain and I would eat breakfast in the Walgreens at 63rd and--
Speaker 2: South Park (unclear)?
Speaker 1: No, no, next street, Cottage. 63rd and Cottage, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: And, so, I was in there one morning and John Freeman says, "My uncle wants to see you."  I said, "Yeah, what about?" He said, "Something about a job."  Well, he had forgotten where to find me, Bob Taylor had.  But he and Ferd Kramer were on some sort of housing council here in the city together, and Ferd [Ferdinand] Kramer had decided to hire a Negro in his downtown office, of which there were none in any real estate office downtown at that time.  And he had asked Bob Taylor if he knew anybody and Bob thought about me. And so I went over to see Bob and he gave me the reference and I went down and talked to him and sure enough, they hired me.  Now, it wasn't quite that simple because I wasn't that sure that I wanted to leave the opportunities at Mary T. Washington and Company. But, anyhow, I decided to go and so I've been there for fifty-one years now (laughter). But it was just interesting, you know, that sitting there having breakfast, I mean it's like, it's about as casual as you can get (laughter) toward finding a job.
Story_ID: 81246
Speaker 1: How's it been?  I mean how was it being the first black employee over at Draper and Kramer?
Speaker 2: It wasn't (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: And tell us what Draper and Kramer does.  Tell us what they do?
Speaker 2: Oh, Draper and Kramer, Incorporated is a real estate firm and they develop some real estate and they manage a lot of buildings.  For instance, Draper and Kramer is a developer working with a New York Life Insurance Company.  They're the developer of Lake Meadows, and Prairie Shores Apartments.  And the (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: And these are high rises?
Speaker 2: Right.  Lake Meadows was 2,000 apartment units in ten buildings.  And, Prairies Shores is about 1,650 apartments in five buildings.  They all, we all, the company also developed 4800 Chicago Beach Drive, which is now a condominium known as Newport, that developed in the University area, at 5550 Dorchester in order to provide housing for the University of Chicago. And 56th and Hyde Park apartment building, which is now a condominium, the idea there was to provide housing for and in the university. Ferd (Ferdinand) Kramer was a trustee of the University of Chicago and very much interested in helping the university to meet the housing needs for faculty and for students.  And also developed 1130 South Michigan, and 1356 Lake Shore Drive, the list goes on and on.  We were also intimately involved in the development of Old Orchard Shopping Center, Oak Brook Shopping Center, River Oaks Shopping Center, Hawthorn Shopping Center.
Speaker 1: Big Shopping Centers.
Speaker 2: Right.  We worked with (unclear) interest in developing those properties.  So, today many of the rental buildings have been converted to condominiums.  But, just looking at a report recently, the company manages about 21,000 condominium units.  So, it's a big factor in real estate management, here in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Great--(unclear)
Speaker 2: And so we're developing, we're in the process now of developing 500 housing units between 40th and 42nd Lake Park, be known as Lake Park Crescent and this is to be a mixed income housing development, where you'll have market rate housing, affordable housing and some public housing level residents.  So, that's our latest.  We're also in the process of converting the Palmolive Building to condominiums, so we have a lot of irons in the fire, lots of things going on. (Laughter)
Speaker 1: Now, the project that gets the Draper and Kramer is most associated with, I guess is Lake Meadows, that one of the high rise apartments for urban professionals.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The main staple for the last, uh, huh (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: the Lake Meadows was the first urban renewal project in the country and Ferd (Ferdinand) Kramer, who just passed here in last July of 2002, would have been 100 years old, if he had lasted three more weeks.   But, anyway, he had got the New York Life Insurance Company to build Lake Meadows as a part of trying to renew and preserve the south side.  And in particular, he was at the time, Chairman of the Board of Michael Reese Hospital and the neighborhood around it was deteriorating. So, that, that he, to his credit, saw a need for revitalizing the neighborhood, and that's how Lake Meadows came about.
Story_ID: 81247
Speaker 1: Now sir, you were explaining to us about urban renewal and the whole process of urban renewal.  We were talking about the Lake Meadow Development, the history of that.
Speaker 2: Yes, well, as I mentioned Lake Meadows was the first urban renewal project in the United States.  And the issue, which was important in urban renewal was does the government have the right to take property from an individual, private individual and resell it to a private individual or company and that's the heart of urban renewal argument and the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois decided yes, the government has this power.  And so, that's the essence of urban renewal.  Everybody has known that the government had the power of eminent domain which is to take property, but to take the property and to resell to a private individual was a new concept and so--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: So, kind of a tricky concept, too.
Speaker 2: Well, but the idea was, if for the good of the city, for the good of the public, it is necessary that the government has this power that's kind of the way that it got resolved.  So, Lake Meadows was 100 acres with before streets and so forth, of land. And the reason it was as big as it was because it was necessary to do something big enough so that the blight which still remained around it, would not come back and re-encompass it.  And the, uh, huh
Speaker 1: The high rises, just for the sake of those who are listening, the high rises of Lake Meadows are surrounded by grounds, by spacious grounds, (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Spacious grounds--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The buildings are separated from the others, which unlike a lot of other development in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Am I right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's correct.  There are five twelve story buildings, and there are four twenty-two story buildings and then there is one twelve story building that was built to be a luxury residence.  And, so Lake Meadows now is fifty years old.  I moved, my wife and I moved into Lake Meadows when we were first married in 1953 and when the, one of the twelve story buildings had just been completed, so it's pretty easy for me to keep up with the age of Lake Meadows. (Laughter)  And recently, in the last four or five years that we've built some additional single family homes on some of the vacant land at Lake Meadows and that's turned out to be a very, very nice compliment.  And, uh huh (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Those, those homes on Cottage Grove, around Cottage Grove?
Speaker 2: There on Rhodes, there on east 31st, east 32nd Street and Rhodes, going east, um mm, thirty-nine townhomes.  So, they'll be some homes to be built in Lake Meadows as time goes on, sort of returning the land to the people, so to speak.

Speaker 1: Prairie Shores was also urban renewal development, not, not covering so much land area, but covering almost the same number of units, about 400 fewer units, 350 fewer units in Prairie Shores.  Prairie Shores is just north of Lake Meadows on King Drive and then it goes east over to the IC tracks.  Prairie Shores goes east, over to Michael Reese Hospital, Lake Meadows goes from King Drive over to the IC tracks.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Illinois Central tracks.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, did you play a major role in that development project when you came on at Draper and Kramer?
Speaker 1: No, I would say a major role because, you know, I was all of 27 years old and I just started at the firm a few years before that.  But, I interfaced with the New York Life Insurance Company's Accounting Department to get the accounting set up and to follow their wishes and what not.  Eventually, they set up their own office and ran it themselves.  But we did all the leasing for them, so as I said, I wouldn't call it a major role, but I certainly was involved.
Story_ID: 81249
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how was it for you to be the only, the first black employee at Draper and Kramer?  I mean how were you received?
Speaker 2: I was received well, I never had any problem from Day One.  And, I never felt like there was any particular pressure and I think that the experiences that I related earlier in high school and with mixed groups; whites, blacks and being in a leadership position and so forth.  I think all that helped me a great deal to know how to work with people and to see everybody as an individual and to not carry a chip on my shoulder and not to carry any inferiority on my shoulder either.  And even the experience I had with Mrs. Washington, who was a stickler for detail and a stickler for having it, to get things exactly right.  Let me give you an example of that. In those days, there were no computers, so everything had to be typed, financial statements had to be typed.  And her rule for the women, the secretaries, no erasers, "you make a mistake, you'll have to start over."  And I have seen some of the people, women typing the statements and get down to the bottom and make a mistake and break into tears (laughter) because that was her rule.  Well, but, eventually if you work under that kind of a rule, you learn how to do it that way.  And, so I learned how to do, you know, the word right the first time.  And when I got down to Draper and Kramer, I had a supervisor that was a CPA, he was Vice President, financial Vice President of the company and he was a stickler for detail.  And I had this wonderful training, I never had a problem whatsoever.   And so I was doing what he'd like to have done; and, I was it the way he liked to have it done. So, it was liked everything worked fine.  I had no trouble with any of the people.  I understand that before I came for the first day of work, that Ferd Kramer, who was president of the company called together the people in the office, which at that was at 33 West Washington Street, told them that we were going to have a new employee that he was a Negro and that if there was anybody here who felt that they were uncomfortable that they could leave and I always, I don't know whether that's true or not.  He never told me that, but I felt with that kind of leadership and that kind of backing and that kind of strength on the part of the guy that owned the company, there would not be a problem, and there was no problem.  I remember being sent down to Peoria, Illinois, where the company had purchased a housing development from the Caterpillar Tractor Company and they, I went down there with one of the other people.  They did what they thought they had to do.  They called the hotel to tell them that a Negro was coming and then, at lunch time, they called down to the restaurant at the bottom of the hill to tell them that this Negro was coming.  So, they were aware and they were, you know, concerned that I might you know be embarrassed some kind of a way or another, but I never had any trouble at all.  And, as you can see, I've been there a long time.  Now, that doesn't say that there haven't been people who coveted my job (laughter), but that part I can handle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 81250
Speaker 1: Now, do you think that your appearance helped you?  I mean because just being lighter and, and--
Speaker 2: I don't think th at, I think if it's anything, I think that being, you know, 6'2" and having a you know a pretty commanding voice probably is more important than you know skin color.
Speaker 1: You know you might be right. (Laughter)
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, again, having come up through the camp, and what not, you know, I know how to use the voice so to speak.  And, again, you know, through all these experiences you learn how to treat people and people respond to being treated fairly, not always nice, okay, I've been in a position where I had to hire and fire people.   And my philosophy has been, you know, being fired, know, is not the worst thing in the world: "if you're unhappy here, you know, you ought to, for your own benefit, go someplace else, you know, and I'll help you."  And you have to chastise people when you are in a leadership position from time to time, and my philosophy on that is your feelings will heal.  Okay, people's, people's feelings get hurt from time to time.  Sometimes, you can't help it, okay. But time will take care of that, you know, it will pass away.  So, that's kind of my philosophy of life. (Laughter)
Speaker 1: So, your philosophy of management then is to be honest and be fair (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I would say, I would say that's right.  You don't need to, to holler, raise your voice at people.  No need to scream, you just need to be sincere and you have to be right, that's important in the first place.  So, that means whatever it is you need to get the facts before you start doing whatever you think you need to do.  And, you know, going through life, the first story you hear may not be a true story, may not be all of the story, so but you know that's just everyday living.  You learn that growing up in any situation.
Story_ID: 81251
Speaker 1: Have you ever made a mistake in terms of personnel decisions, where you acted and found out--
Speaker 2: Yes, I find that I'm much better at hiring professional people than I am at hiring clerical people.  And, so that I've made some mistakes in you know hiring clerical people. Made some mistakes in hiring professional ones, too, for that matter. (Laughter)  But, when you find out you made a mistake and you had to move to undo it.  And even there, you can be honest.  You can tell, um, mm, "I thought 'so and so' when I was talking to with you.  But here is what I need and , and you really can't do that, I don't believe and so, you know, you need to find another job more closely allied with where your skills are and I'll help you."
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, it's, you know, and do you actually follow up and try to help them, you know finding another--
Speaker 2: Sure.  Most of the time it's not helping them find another job, but it's, it's without being dishonest giving them a decent referral and, and letting their employer know what their good points are and what they can, they can handle and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I've had, I've had several past employees come back and thank me.  They didn't understand at the time.  But as time went on, they, they did understand what I was trying to tell them and what I was trying to do for them.  And years later, sometime come back.
Speaker 1: And what's the, can you think of a particular tough situation in terms of managing people that you're in.
Speaker 2: Um, mm. Well, I don't know whether if it's particularly tough, but I had like a young lady who worked for me, who was a very good accountant, and so when you find somebody who's had good skills you try to put them in a leadership position.  Some people aren't leaders.  For instance, she would say to one of the people working for her: "You did this wrong."  Well, there's a better way to say it than that. (Laughter)  And so, people won't follow that kind of harsh leadership, okay.  And so what I found is I had to take her out of the leadership position and put her into a narrower position where she was, in fact reviewing things for accuracy and so forth.  Because she always, she would find it. If something was wrong with it, so that it was a great relief because I knew if she said it was all right, it's all right. And I don't have to go back and check it.
Speaker 1: So, good at finding fault.
Speaker 2: That, that's right.  But but, but, you can't you can't supervise people by always finding fault with what they do. (Laughter)  You know, so, I mean that would be one, one situation.  I don't remember, I just remember a young man who worked for me, I don't remember the details but he, he just came back and he said: "You know, you were right and I apologize."  Um, mm I think that he was trying to tell me I run the business when he was there and I wouldn't let him (laughter).  But, I thought, you know, it was nice of him, he didn't have to do that.  I wasn't looking for it, didn't need it.
Story_ID: 81252
Speaker 1: So, have, have most--what have most of your duties at Draper and Kramer consisted of basically, management or has it been (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, no, well it's been mostly accounting and then into management.  When I first started the company was in the town of Park Forest, Illinois, out south here, was being developed and our company and another company called Dovenmuehle, which no longer exists, were making all of the loans on the homes being built out there and they were building, this was right after the war, and they were building homes and selling homes as fast as they could build them.  And one of my first jobs was setting up loan closing statements, so I did that.  And then the company had just completed the building at 1350-60 Lake Shore Drive, you may know that building, twin brick towers.  It had 740 apartments in it.  At the time, it was the largest apartment building in the city and it's built on the old Potter Palmer estate.  And, it, the mortgage there was insured by the Federal Housing Administration and our people had heard that the people who had trouble with the Federal Housing Administration were those who didn't keep good records, and that was one of the reasons for hiring me in the first place, was to make sure that they had somebody there who was dedicated to this job.  And so, I first started keeping, excuse me, those records and the records of some other properties that the company had. And then the Lake Meadows and the Prairie Shores Buildings, going, came along. And then eventually, I became the head of the Accounting Department and had to hire an assistant, you know, and more and more, I became treasurer of the company and then eventually became a director of the company. And then I became tr- financial vice president and so by that time, I had under my supervision, all the manual accounting and all of the IBM equipment and accounting and Burroughs Bookkeeping Machines and you know, about fifty people and so forth.  And, then, eventually, I was in charge of all the recordkeeping for the entire company and for new properties coming on and so forth.  So, I really, I was in charge of it all, so to speak (laughter) and I enjoyed it.  And then I began to back out of it as I had other general management duties.  I sort of became the executive vice president and assistant to the president.  The President was Ferd [Ferdinand] Kramer's--by this time, Ferd Kramer had moved up to chairman of the board and the president was Douglas Kramer, his son.  And Douglas Kramer stayed as president for about thirty years, sometime in the 70's [1970s] up until '95 [1995]. And '95 [1995], the grandson, whose name is Forrest Bailey, Ferd, one of Ferd Kramer's daughter's child, he became president and so, frankly I've been kind of hanging around helping him. Which is what keeps me there fifty-one years.  But, I'm thinking, I'm thinking about hanging it up (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, I heard about the Kramers, but is there a Draper in Draper and Kramer?
Speaker 2: Well, there was, but the Drapers were bought out many years ago, although there is one young man still associated, who is in the Draper line.   But, it's frankly--it's mostly, it's all, it's all for the most part, it's all Kramers now, um-hm.
Story_ID: 81253
Speaker 1: Sir, now you've been involved with civic activities on a high level, as well.   And now, I want, to talk about the biggest one, I know, is the Gary School Board.
Speaker 2: Um, mm.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I became active in school affairs in Gary when my children were in grade school.  So, I just...
Speaker 1: You moved to Gary [Indiana], right?
Speaker 2: I moved to Gary in 1954, [1954] because my wife started teaching school over there and we decided it was better for me to be the one who was commuting to Chicago [Illinois] rather than her commuting to Gary.  So, we moved to Gary in 1954.  The children are born in 1957 [1957] and 1959 [1959] respectively.  So when they started school, grade school, then I began to get active in the Parent Teachers Association and you know, again calling on some of the experiences and what not that I had had coming up in life myself.  Well, just to give you an example, they couldn't get parents to come to the Parent Teachers Meeting.  I said: "Let me at it." (Laughter)  So, I prepared a letter for the kids to take home to their parents. And, I can't remember the details of it, but it arranged for some sort of competition, as to how many parents came, what class had the most parents.  And, to the surprise of the principal and the teachers, you know, they had to go out and get extra chairs and so forth.  And then, you know, they're not so smart, as you know, it's like that's another trick you had in your bag, you reach you pull it out to....but what was new to them, wasn't new to me. But, I knew you can get the people out, you just have to find, you know, the right tool, so to speak. (Laughter)  So, I became interested in that, lead to then being, it was at the time then Richard Hatcher was elected Mayor of the City of Gary.  But before that, I had been up for consideration for an appointment to the school board and then finally when Hatcher was mayor, he appointed me to the school board.  The school board was elected at the time.  So, then on the school board, at the time, a new superintendent named Gordon McAndrew came along and so, we proceeded to try to energize the school board.
Story_ID: 81254
Speaker 1: One of the things that came about, at that time, was ,we were out in San Francisco [California] to a meeting  of the National Association of School Boards and we met the people from Behavioral, Behavioral Research Laboratories, called "BRL".  And they had this idea of doing of a private company running a school, and this is 1960 [1960], around '70[1970], so it's like thirty years ago or more.  The reason I go back to talk about the time is, as you know, there is a lot of conversation talking about private companies running public schools.  And so, we decided to make a deal with this company and try to and so we had to work our way through that, negotiations with the teachers union and figuring out how we were going to do it.  It lasted, I think for I think about three years, three or four years maybe.  And the final analysis, I think, you'd have to say it didn't work at that time.  But, anyhow, it was, a, an interesting experiment to try to improve the learning in the poor schools, so to speak.
Speaker 2: Why didn't it work, do you have any thoughts?
Speaker 1: Well, teaching is really a skill and I don't know if you can necessarily apply business principles to teaching, which is one of the things they were trying to do.  Um, mm.  The other thing is that Gary had a, was one of the first schools in the country to have a Teachers' Union that belonged to the AF of L [AFL-CIO].  And, and the teachers union was not taken away with the ideas of private contractors coming in from outside, some without teaching knowledge and credentials to try to run a school.  We were trying to marry the two and so I think that was very, very, that was an undertaking so to speak. (Laughter)  But I think, I think that was probably, probably the reason that it didn't work out because there wasn't enough education expertise on the part of the company.  What did come out of it though was a school for the gifted; in which my wife ultimately became the principal of the school, called the Banneker School in Gary, Indiana for the Gifted; and I think it still exists.  She's been retired from there for twenty, more than twenty years now.
Speaker 2: So, was that a private school, is that--
Speaker 1: No, no, it's all part of the Public School System now, similar to the Magnet Schools that we have here in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: This is at the elementary school level.
Story_ID: 81467
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask, you what, what, I guess what are the highlights of your career at Draper and Kramer?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say that, probably, I'd, my title now is Vice Chairman and the Chairman of the company is Douglas Kramer, the son of Ferd [Ferdinand] Kramer. And, as such, I'm kind of the mentor to the now up and coming president and I have been pretty much the balanced wheel in a family company, because families have problems getting along, position, who should be in charge of what and I could be the independent party in many of the discussions. And, so, I guess, being, being close to the heartbeat has been (laughter) has been probably the most important and maybe, the most interesting thing to me in my whole career.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's interesting, because I can see how that could, how you would play that mutual role.
Speaker 2: And family businesses are an animal into themselves as some of the academics have discovered, and now in universities, like Northwestern, and so forth, offer courses in family business, in running family businesses and there are a lot of books that have been written about family businesses.
Speaker 1: Um, mm.  You come out of a background for family business.
Speaker 2: Well, I guess that's right. (Laughter) Yeah, and I've seen within my own family the arguments, so which way, we should be doing this, that or the other (laughter) and that's some of what comes out of family business.
Speaker 1: I have, now have you, have you been able to work with your brothers on any of these business enterprises during your career?
Speaker 2: Not very much, because when they were in there heyday of the restaurants, appliance stores and juke boxes and so forth, I was in school.  And then when I came out of school, I was in Chicago [Illinois] and they were in St. Louis [Missouri].  But we were always pretty close and we you know talked on the telephone and I sort of became the advisor to the rest of the family so to speak, yeah.  So, but so far as actually working with them, I never had that opportunity.  I worked at the restaurant off and on, from time to time.
Story_ID: 81468
Speaker 1: Okay.  Sir, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess, my great hope is that the black community would become independent.  And before I left Gary, Indiana, I helped to found the Gary Educational Development Foundation and got its first grant money.  Incidentally, the foundation now has about $3,000,000.00, and that money is professionally managed by a money management firm.  But, my mantra was that this is Gary's statement of independence, this having capital resources under your control and being able to direct them.  And, in fact to me, it spells independence, and I guess that what I see as, as being what the black community needs most.  If you don't have financial resources being in a position to direct capital resources and so that to me is one of the important things about, let's say having a bank like Seaway National Bank.  Mr. Kobe Dickerson, was the head of that.  I knew his predecessor, Ernest Collins directing these resources.  I think the fact that there is black town that is a head of American Express and of Merrill Lynch and now they own Time Warner.  I think being to direct the resources, is what's of the greatest importance to the black and finally, with the idea, not of becoming rich necessarily, but of becoming independent so that you can do what you want to do, when you want to do it, say what you want to say, when you want to say it.
Speaker 1: Well, that's extremely important.  I mean that's made a difference, a lot of times, it just been the balance, lot of times in a lot of crucial junctions in Black History,  being able to say what you want to say, when you want to say it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do what you want to do.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Without being threatened or being fired. Or, hushed or something.
Speaker 2: Right.  And you were asking me about my experience at Draper and Kramer, because Draper and Kramer is in the Mortgage Banking business as well as real estate, finance and so forth.  My experience was that you don't have any problems when you're the guy who's handing out the money. (Laughter) So, I still think that having control over capital resources is the road to independence for the black community.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Does, is there anything that looks promising on the horizon now for the black community?  You mention so many black CEO's and be in charge of directing some resources.  But, I mean, should, you know, what do you, anything promising?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I would just say that all of these things are promising in themselves.  I don't know that any one of them, you know, makes a, makes a great difference.  But I think it's, you know, one more step to this idea of being independent.  So many problems go away when you're the guy in charge.  And, so I think that that's true on all levels and being in charge, of course, means that you're competent and technically competent, competent to express yourself; have leadership ability; and you know how to deal with people; know how to handle people.  All of these things go, go together, you can't have one, you can't have one of them and expect that you're going to be a rocket ship to the moon.  But, I, in my own mind, I am sure it works.  You have a hard time convincing other people that it works (laughter), sometime.  But I believe it works. (Laughter)
Story_ID: 81469
Speaker 1: Okay.  Sir, now, what would be your advice to young people going into business, you know, black people going into business?  Would you advise them to work for a corporation or start their own business, or what would be your advice?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that, first of all, if one has an interest in business, okay.  Because business isn't everything we need, society needs people in all kinds of endeavors.  But if your interest is in business, then you got to get some experience in what you're doing.  None of know how much we don't know.  I remember when I went away to University of Illinois, and I first saw the Library Building and looked at the Library Building from the front.  And there's this nice colonial looking building that's maybe three stories high.  But you go around and look at the back of it, and behind it over there is ten or twelve stories, what they call the "stacks" and that's where all the books are.  And for you to contemplate that you don't know anything about what's in (laughter) all those books, really lets you know how insignificant you are, and how much there is to know and how much there is to learn.  And, that was, that struck me, okay.  Because you can stand outside this building and see this, and realize all that book after book.  So, I guess I just think that being, you have to get experience and that's the only way experience is not just learning how to do something, it's finding out what you don't know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And there's no way to think through what you don't know.
Speaker 1: Um, mm.
Speaker 2: You can't, can't think about it, you can't think about what you don't know. (Laughter)
Speaker 1: A lot of businesses experiences, I mean, you know, knowing how to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot of it is training.  You can short cut the issue through training.  But you still have to have some experience to make it, to make the training stick... Otherwise, it's so many words, okay.  And, my son is in Banking with Bank of America and he tells me that he, because he worked in little business that I was interested in at one time and then he tells the clients, well, one I've made a payroll, I know how it is to not know whether or not you're going to have enough money to pay the employees.  And, that I understand accounts receivable.  Well, what does that mean, so figuring the book of what people owe you?  But, guess what you can't pay bills with accounts receivable, you got to have cash.  Well, those are things that you can read about, but it doesn't make an impression on you until you've been standing at the door. (Laughter) So, I think we, the schooling, the learning that we get, even an MBA, it's, you know, it's good, it's important but you really need the experience that goes along, along with it.  Because they can't teach you in school all the things that you need to know to be successful.  You got to spend some time doing.
Story_ID: 81470
Speaker 1: Now, do you think it's more important to have a native entrepreneurial instinct or to be educated in school?  I mean could you, could school turn someone into a businessman who really (unclear).  Can you learn how to be a businessman, (unclear) or do you think you really have to feel it?  Or what's more important?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I think that the spark has to be there.  Now, the individual may not know it's there and it'll get revealed to him sometimes in, in school or in some other experience that he has.  But I don't know that you can make a businessman.  You got, got to have some, some affinity for business.  For instance, there are some people who (pause) well, they don't, they don't believe in money.  (Laughter)  And, so I don't think those folks will ever make good business people.  I don't, well, just couldn't do it. (Unclear)   You need to believe in that, that money does a lot of things and that you need more than just hand to mouth money.  So, but if you're training, let's say, well, in social work; social work is a good thing, we need it.  Because a lot of people don't know how to handle themselves and they need a helping hand.  But, for instance, in Gary, Indiana when were there, Mr. [Richard G.] Hatcher first became mayor, a lot of money went into programs and it sounded very good.  But, guess what when the money ran out, the program ran out.  No program, it's all gone.  Once more, no more money. So, the businessman realizes that you have to renew, you have to keep renewing.  I mentioned Ernest Collins, who was the Chairman of the Board of the Seaway National Bank.  And Ernest and I were very good friends.  And Ernest used to say, because he used to run our grocery store in uh, uh before he got involved with organizing the bank.
Speaker 1: Was he, was he part of the Collins Brothers--uh, uh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right. (Simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know they say the brothers were famous in Chicago for running (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: That's right.  He has a grocery store now, I think or in this, I don't know whether he still has it or not.  But, anyhow, Ernest would say then because, "hire him, hire him"; Pittman who was a partner of Mrs. Washington, did his accounting and we would be over there sometimes and he says to me: "Fred, I don't know anything about accounting, but I know if you sell all those groceries over there that are on the shelf, you ought to have enough money left to buy some more."  Now, now that's pretty elementary.  But, what else can you say, he's right.  And if you're running a business and you sell all your merchandise and you don't have enough money to put some more merchandise back on the shelf, it's something wrong with what you're doing in your business.  It may not be your fault, but it's something wrong.  So, I've never forgotten that, that Ernest must have said that, you know, 40 or 50 years ago.  (Laughter)
Speaker 1: Now did the Collins run the Fruit Basket?
Speaker 2: Fruit Basket, that's right.  And then they also had some, some barbeque places that they ran.
Speaker 1: Um, mm.
Speaker 2: I don't remember how many.
Speaker 1: Laundromats
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Quite a few sundry stores, yeah. Um, mm, that's interesting.
Story_ID: 81471
Speaker 1: Tell me, did your parents ever see you become successful in business?
Speaker 2: No, my father died in 1947 [1947]; which was a year before I finished my undergraduate work.  It was an accident crossing the street one night.  But my mother lived until 1972 [1972], I think it was.  So, she did in fact, live to see her youngest son do well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm sure she's proud of all of you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Such a wonderful family.
Speaker 2: Uh, huh.

Speaker 1: Now, tell me sir, what do you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Explain that. (Laughter)
Speaker 1: Well, I mean what are the works (unclear) that you left behind that you're proudest of; or, or what do you think you left behind for future generations?
Speaker 2: Well, this issue that I spoke about with regard to Gary, Indiana and the idea of becoming independent.  To me that's an important concept, not just for Gary, Indiana, but for all of us, any place. To be able to call your own shots, be able to go when you want to go, and come when you want to come; and to have this knowledge, and the resources to do that.  And resources, again, doesn't just mean, necessarily hoarding money; being able to help some other people is, is I think, part of being independent.  Now, you choose those who you want to help and you can't help everybody.  But, I think that's, I think as we pass through this world, it's important to be known, important for people to remember that he tried to help others.  Years ago there was a group of black doctors, not all of them were black, I guess.  But in any event, they built a shopping center, over at 51st and State Street.  And, it was right in the heart of public housing.  And the facts are that because it was in the heart of public housing, it didn't do well.  But, I worked with these fellas to try to bring this about.  We got the New York Life Insurance Company to put a mortgage on it.  And we got the grocery store, we had the Walgreens, and so forth come in.  But it wasn't very much appreciated in the neighborhood at that time, and, and it didn't, and it didn't work.  Well, but the idea was to try to help the neighborhood, you got to bring something.  They knew because I had told them in advance doesn't look like much of a return.  Well, it turned out to be much worse than we thought.  But they went into it you know trying to help the community and so that may be, you know, coming up in the YMCA and so forth that may, in fact, be my legacy.  That I, I, I still have this desire to help those who may not have been as fortunate as I, may not have had the experiences and what not, that have helped me along and to try to pass some of those along to others.

Speaker 1: Okay.  And this is slightly different.  How would you liked to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I don't know, (laughter) I hadn't thought that much about that.  I know I have to go. (Laughter)
Speaker 1: (Laughter), I'm not suggesting that.
Speaker 2: I haven't really given a lot of, a lot of thought to that.  How would I liked to be remembered?   I think it's all part of that same question.  He tried to help others as he went along.  I think if that's the way I got remembered, I would be, that would be very, very nice.
