Speaker 1: What's your favorite food, Mr. Taylor?
Speaker 2: Well I'm from Louisiana.  Gumbo I like and red beans and rice and turnip greens.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What's your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I would guess-- I think the fall.  I like it because things are changing. The foliage begins to change.  Has a certain wistfulness about it and yet a certain delight.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Color?  Red I guess.  Maroon at the least.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What's your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Oh there was a time, Jamaica.  I loved to go to Jamaica.  I haven't been down there in several years.  But I used to go every year and I like Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what's your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: My favorite--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] phrase.
Speaker 2: Phrase?
Speaker 1: Saying, right.
Speaker 2: I guess, "Don't you know.  Don't you see."  In an attempt to get people to understand what I'm trying to say.

Speaker 1: What were the names of your parents?
Speaker 2: My father was named Washington Monroe Taylor.  Born in 1870.  My mother was named Celina.  Her maiden name was Celina Gesell, G-E-S-E-L-L.  She was born in, I think 1880 or something like that, 1881.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you tell us something about your father?  You know, can tell us about your father and the --
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Well my father was a pastor.  Was not highly educated but read voraciously.  And I got my habit I guess of reading from him.  Though he was gone by the time I was thirteen.  But he made a profound impression on me.  And in his preaching he was talking about the Battle of the Mopoli and [Thomas] Cardinal Wolsey [Roman Catholic cardinal under Henry VIII] and the London Tower [sic, Tower of London] when I was a kid.  This would've been-- this would've been the late [19]20s.  Mid [19]20s.  Late [19]20s.  Made a great impression on me.
Speaker 1: Was he a-- was he a reverend in--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yes.
Speaker 1: Baton Rouge [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He pastored the Mount Zion Church in Baton Rouge, which is really the first African Baptist Church in Baton Rouge.  And I later pastored it.  But not--I did not succeed him.
Speaker 1: Was that a large church?
Speaker 2: By our standards, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So he was a person who--I guess of some rank in town but--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yes.
Speaker 1: [Unclear] pastored [unclear].
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you remember--?  What was your relationship like with your father?
Speaker 2: Well I admired him intensely.  I had some fear of him also.  I think my father took a great interest in what I might turn out to be.  I remember the Nick Carter detective stories and pulp magazines and Jeff Clayton [detective stories] and all of them were very popular things.  And I remember as a little boy being asked what did I want to be?  What did I --?  Everybody asked back then, "What are you gonna be?"  And I said I wanted to be a detective.  And my father--I remember that distinctly--said, "Aim high boy."  I've never forgotten that.
Story_ID: 13850
Speaker 1: Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Speaker 2: No.  I'm an only child.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was it like growing up as an only child?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] There's a certain loneliness.  Particularly, evening in Louisiana where I grew up as a--  Night comes as an almost melancholy atmosphere in around-- in the atmosphere.  And I remember leaving what we call the commons, the playground.  Going off to my own house and leaving the fellows with whom I played football or whatever.  And I remember a certain loneliness in that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've often always wished for brothers and sisters.  But I didn't have any so--You make do.
Story_ID: 13851
Speaker 1: When did your mother [Celina Gesell Taylor] and father [Washington Monroe Taylor] meet?
Speaker 2: My father met my mother I suppose in the Mount Zion Church [Baton Rouge, Louisiana] where he was-- began pastoring.  I guess 1901.  And she was a member of that congregation.  They met that way I'm sure.
Speaker 1: Were they around the same age or--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] No, no, no.  My father was far older than my mother.  I guess my father was fifteen, eighteen years my mother's senior.
Speaker 1: I've read that you were born thirteen years after they were married.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yes, this is true.
Speaker 1: And this has some significance, right?
Speaker 2: It had some significance for my father I'm sure.  Because I was born and I don't tell this often.  But my left thumb goes back like that.  Yours too?  That far back? Congratulations.  But my father had a fallen bone in his thumb--  I think that was the cause his thumb went back.  But he was always pleased to see my thumb go back.
Story_ID: 13852
Speaker 1: Can you tell us some more about your mother [Celina Gesell Taylor]?
Speaker 2: Well my mother grew up in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] which was unusual back there in that day.  Town blacks were not as frequent.  As not as numerous as rural blacks.  My father [Washington Monroe Taylor] came from the country.  My mother from the little town.  And she went to normal school there.  And later, of course, after my father died [ca. 1931], went on to Southern University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana] where I'm going this Friday.  And got her degree and taught in Baton Rouge.  Finally moved here out to New York [New York] after I had been here.  Because she was an only child.  And she had only an aunt [Gertrude Gibbens] who was almost her age.  And when that aunt died, she had nobody there.  So she came here.  I'm sure with great misgivings.  But got along very well those eight or nine years that she lived after she came here.
Speaker 1: So after your father died it was just you and your mother?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And this aunt.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Who was almost my mother's age.  But the three of us.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Could you, I guess describe your relationship with your mother and your--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Aunt--
Speaker 2: Well my mother and my aunt shared the responsibly of being mothers I think.  My mother was a pensive sort of person.  My aunt was a disciplinarian.  And one of the books I've tried--  I've written-- whatever.  I've dedicated it to that aunt and said--  Well it's really the sixth volume of my work coming out in June.  And in which I've dedicated to her and saying that, "She put steel in a little boy's spine."  She did that for me.
Story_ID: 13853
Speaker 1: Can you describe some of your childhood memories for me?
Speaker 2: Well my earliest memory, of course, is that of playmates.  We--  I was reared in a section of Baton Rouge [Louisiana] which was called Goose Hollow.  And there were a number of young people there with whom I grew up.  And some of whom-- some of whom were a little older than I was.  And I greatly admired them.  There were people of Creole background.  I was not.  But they were.  Some of them were.  And so I played with them and learned a lot from them.
Speaker 1: Are there any events in your childhood that really stand out that you would like to talk about?
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: Like school or--
Speaker 2: Well I went to--We lived on what was called Europe Street.  And two blocks from my home was a school.  The Asia Street School.
Speaker 1: The what? I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Asia Street.  Asia, A-S-I-A.  Asia Street School.  And I was puzzled why I had to pass that school and walk another ten or twelve blocks to the Reddy Street School because of segregation.  That bothered me even as a child.  Though I was reared on a block were there were white families also.  It is interesting in the patterns in this country that residential segregation belongs to a later time.  And has-- was more pronounced in my earlier years in the North than in the South.  Many neighborhoods in the South were interracial.  And in my own block there were white lads.  The Hortons.  One of whom went to [United States] Congress, Frank.  And I could not go to libraries as a child.  And Frank would bring books home to me from the library.  And I--There were other young fellows,  black and white with whom I grew up and--I had a good experience with them.
Speaker 1: And how did it feel sharing the neighborhood with other youths that had privileges that you didn't have?
Speaker 2: At first it was not-- it was not so discernable.  It was not so clear.  Dawn came gradually that there's a difference.  And the Hortons who lived across the street from us were very nice people.  No question about that.  The father was a deacon in the First Baptist Church, which was the white baptist church.  But they were advanced for that day in their outlook upon race.  And I did not early on have a sharp understanding of what was going on.  I knew I couldn't go to the library.  I knew I couldn't go to the playground, the city playground.  I knew all of that.  And gradually these things dawned on me.
Speaker 1: What kind of a young man were you as a youth?
Speaker 2: I guess I was typical young person.  I wanted to go to the movies.  Couldn't go on Sunday.  Because my father [Washington Monroe Taylor] was a pastor.  That irked me.  But I lived with it.  I loved to shoot marbles and play softball-- baseball.  We didn't have softball.  Play baseball and football and that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 13854
Speaker 1: How did you feel about school?  Can you--  And how did you do?
Speaker 2: I did pretty well in school.  As a matter of fact, there was an IQ test.  A very primitive one I'm sure, carried on by a professor at Louisiana State University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  And I--  When I got home that evening, people were unduly nice to me.  I just had candy and whatnot.  And I found out that I'd had a fairy high IQ report.  I didn't find out until much later the meaning of that.  But I knew something special was happening when I got home from school.  The principal had called and told my people.
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of the school that you attended and can you spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Reddy Street [School].  R-E-D-D-Y.  That was the first school.  And then there was another school.  Perkins Street School to which I went.  And then McKinley High School which was the--  Was not only the high school for young black people in Baton Rouge [Louisiana].  But it was also the only high school for oh, three or four parishes around Baton Rouge.
Speaker 1: Do you remember who administered the IQ test for [unclear]?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] It was a professor from Louisiana State University.  His name I have never known.  I do know--  I remember sitting in the last desk of the fourth grade and he sat there with me and talked and gave me little things to look at and all that.  And he came back a second time.  I remember that.  But other than that, I don't have any recollection of it.
Speaker 1: All right.  It must have been troubling to people in a segregated state that a young--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] It was trouble.
Speaker 1: Black--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] It was troubling.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was very troubling.  The black principal who was a wonderful person, supervising principal of all the elementary schools--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Do you remember his name?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Professor Frazier.  J. M. Frazier.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you spell it?
Speaker 2: F-R-A-Z-I-E-R.  Was elated by this.  And it sort of followed me.  A man came down, named Milton Froyd,  when I was in college.  Came down from the American Baptist Home Mission Society.  And somebody told him about the scoring I'd had in this IQ test.  And that kind of got around.  Of course, I've said that-- Supposedly, it was the highest IQ score in Baton Rouge.  But I have said that the IQ was pretty low in Baton Rouge anyhow.  So it didn't make much difference.
Speaker 1: Excuse me just a second.  I'm going [unclear] lost or somebody [unclear].  Okay.  So you did fairly well in grade school.
Speaker 2: I did better in grade school than I did in high school.  I didn't do well in high school.  I got along pretty well in college.  But high school was a kind of low point.  I've never known quite why.  Yes, I do know something of it.  I was not interested in a lot of things they were teaching.  I didn't know I was not interested, but I wasn't interested.  I took great interest in history, civics and that kind of thing.  Social studies.  But the other things just did not interest me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were your activities in high school?  Did you play sports or--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you play an instrument?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I played some football.  Not high school football.  Because it was the Depression [1929].  And the team had been disbanded.  That form of athletics had been suspended.  I had a wonderful coach there named Kraft.  J. L. Kraft, K-R-A-F-T, who built a tennis court.  The young fellows helped him building it and whatnot.  And I learned to play tennis there.  And that was a great past-time.  And I also came to know a lot of people.  I was a kid now remember.  But a lot of the men--  Not a lot.  So a number of the men from Southern University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana] including Felton Clark who was the son of the founder of the school.  I remember another man named Wiggins who was registrar came down to play with Coach Kraft.  And I was a youngster.  And I got the inspiration of being around those men.
Story_ID: 13855
Speaker 1: What sort of influence did Southern University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana] have on the people in Baton Rouge?  I mean on you in?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Well generally in Baton Rouge, this may be a kind of local prejudice,  I don't know, but there was a high level of expectation in Baton Rouge.  There was a radio commentator, talk show host, in Baton Rouge named Carl Stewart who did a graph on the young people who came out within a mile radius of where I was born.  And it's amazing the number of physicians and lawyers and-- who came out.  And I think, that was due largely to the level of expectation which the people of that community and particularly teachers gave to young people.  I think a great deal of that had to do with the fact that both Southern University, the little baptist college to which I went, Leland College, L-E-L-A-N-D, were both located in the Baton Rouge community.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me when Charles--can you spell Charles Stewart's name for me?
Speaker 2: Carl Stewart was his name.
Speaker 1: Carl Stewart.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: C-A-R-L S-T-E-W-A-R-T.
Speaker 1: Okay.  About what time did he do the survey?
Speaker 2: Oh he did this survey in the, I guess the 1980s.  But he was looking back.  He himself had grown up in that community.  He was looking back on what had happened.
Story_ID: 13856
Speaker 1: You attended Leland College [Baton Rouge, Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Could you spell that for me?
Speaker 2: L-E-L-A-N-D.  It was a little Baptist school.  I think maybe we had maybe 200, 250 students.  There was not a single teacher on that faculty as I recall who had a PhD degree.  But these were, to us anyhow, highly educated people.  And the atmosphere was conducive to intellectual stimulation.  No question about that.  Now our library in that college was not more than the size of a classroom.  But it had more books than any of us could read.  And early on, I took an interest in periodicals like 'The Nation.'  Haywood Broun, B-R-O-U-N, was writing then for 'The Nation' magazine.  And Oswald Villard, who was the grandson of William Lloyd Garrison, the abolitionist, was writing and people like that.  And I took an interest in that.
Speaker 1: Leland College was a black school?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Of course.
Speaker 1: And how--  Do you have any memory of how it was founded?  Or [unclear]?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yes.  It was founded in about 1870 I guess, by a man who--  For the central figure in the founding of it, and financing of it was a man named Holbrook, H-O-L-B-R-O-O-K,  Chamberlain, C-H-A-M-B-E-R-L-A-I-N, who incidentally came from Brooklyn [New York], though I did not know that.  It was the wave of New England people coming into the South and some of them financing schools in the South.  To give some kind of educational footing to the freed men.  And all of the schools--  Oh no, not all. But all of the private schools in the South were-- almost all of them were founded by such people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I might say, I don't think that--  I'm not aware of that having been documented as it should have.  And looking back now, over what is it? Sixty years and more--What are--How infinitely more difficult would have been the plight of black people had these people not come into the South and had begun schools.  Because the public authorities had no interest.  And that's putting it mildly.  They had hostility toward black education.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me what your ambitions were at this stage?  And we're talking about--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] I wanted to be a lawyer.
Speaker 1: And what year is this?  This is--
Speaker 2: Oh this would have been 1930s.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] I graduated from college in 1937.  I wanted to be a lawyer.  A family friend of ours, Mr. Joe Williams--  When I said I wanted to be a lawyer, he said, "Where you gonna practice?  In the middle of the Mississippi River?"  There had been absolutely no black lawyers admitted to the Louisiana Bar in all of our history.
Speaker 1: So did the curriculum at Leland College-- did it address your needs?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yes.
Speaker 1: As a student?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Very much so.  I came out of there with a fair education.  When I went--  I went to Oberlin [College] after that in [Oberlin] Ohio.  And I realized certain deficiencies.  But generally, I was ready to go on to graduate school.
Story_ID: 13857
Speaker 1: I've read that you sort of agitated the other students [at Leland College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] on some level.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  I did that.
Speaker 1: Can we talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My father [Washington Monroe Taylor] was a pastor.  And had, for that day, what was considered not a library but a fair number or books.  One of them was a book by a man named Robert Ingersoll, 'The Mistakes of Moses.'  And I had read through or glanced through that book.  There was some young fellows at college who were declared for the ministry.  And I would bait them with Ingersoll's doubts about biblical events.  I later on did not feel very proud of that.  But I did do it.
Speaker 1: How did they react to that?
Speaker 2: Well they did not know anything about Robert Ingersoll.  I didn't know much about him myself.  But I had read this book.  Or read through parts of it.  And they did not have good answers.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was the social life like at Leland College [unclear]?
Speaker 2: Well you could call on the girls.  But you were in the presence of the matron who was named Miss Steptoe, S-T-E-P-T-O-E, I think.  Sunday afternoons  we could call and sit and talk with the girls.  Other than that, you had athletics, of course.  I played college football.  Dormitory life was--I found it interesting.  I enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: What position did you play?
Speaker 2: Center.
Speaker 1: Center.
Speaker 2: As you--
Speaker 1: I might add we beat Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] one year.  But it was a different Grambling.  They were not nearly--Eddie Robinson, who later coached Grambling and became quite well known, and I grew up together in Baton Rouge.  Played sand lot ball together.  But when we beat Grambling, twenty-seven to nothing, as I remember, it was not nearly the football giant that it became, under his leadership.
Speaker 2: Was there a lot of-- Was there a lot of enthusiasm about the games?
Speaker 1: About football?
Speaker 2: Yes, football games?
Speaker 1: Oh yes.  Yes.  It was a good deal of --  both in high school [McKinley High School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  Before I got to high school, I said that athletics was suspended during my time in high school.  And after my time in high school--Oh yes.  It was a kind of football fever.
Speaker 2: Were other sports popular as that at that time?
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] No.  Basketball was just beginning to be played.  But there was no formal basketball team.  As a matter of fact, at that little college where I went, I don't think there was any basketball at all.
Speaker 2: Was there any gyms around that could even accommodate it?
Speaker 1: No, indeed.  There were no gyms.  You played outdoors.
Speaker 2: Okay.  We're at the end of this tape I think. Do you have--Is there anything outstanding about leaving college you'd like to tell us?
Speaker 1: Yes.  I think the high level of, again of expectation.  Our president was named Bacoats, B-A-C-O-A-T-S, Dr. J. A. Bacoats.  Who had gone to Virginia Union [University, Richmond, Virginia] and had gone to Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio] and really was instrumental in my going to Oberlin.  And I had never known anyone.  I was chauffeur for him during my college years.  And his sense of his character and sense of purpose in being a black person, profoundly influenced me.

Speaker 1: She was a handsome woman.
Speaker 2: Miss--
Speaker 1: My aunt [unclear].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Could you spell her name?
Speaker 1: Her name was Gertrude Gibbens, G-E-R-T-R-U-D-E, G-I-B-B-E-N-S.
Speaker 2: Was she the same age as your mother [Celina Gesell Taylor]?
Speaker 1: Oh she was a little older.  But she was an aunt.  But she was a little older.  But she did not have any pronounced religious persuasion.  I never knew her.  I didn't-- not ever know her to worship in a church.  But she taught me the Lord's Prayer.  The twenty-third Psalm.  But she had a great deal of steel in her.  And she did not like a lot of foolishness.  I remember as a boy, if I would sometimes have my mouth open, "Close your mouth boy."  It was that kind of thing.  And she did not tolerate your not being ready to do things.  And that's followed me through my-- through all my years.  Don't sit around and wait.  Be ready.  It was that kind of thing.  And she had a complete fearlessness of people in that neighborhood.  White and black.  She was a strong woman.
Speaker 2: Can you--So she had a profound influence on you then?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.  She--As a I said earlier, this volume coming out in June.  I've dedicated it partly to her.  That she put steel in my spine.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  There was no foolishness about her. And yet, with her own, she was very tender but demanding.  And sharp spoken.
Story_ID: 13859
Speaker 1: Can you tell us something about the sights, sounds and smells that come from growing up?
Speaker 2: Well I used to be --I was sent often to the grocery.  And there was a market-- a meat market.  A Mr. Gallagher,  I think he must have been Irish, on the corner from us.  And I remember the smells or scents that came out of that meat market.  And they're peculiar smells, peculiar scents in the bayou sections of Louisiana.  And I was in that low land.  And those things I remember.
Speaker 1: Then is it--Oh it's hot there but--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] It's, yeah.
Speaker 1: --gives a sense of that?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] It's very hot in the summer.  Temperature hovers around 100 degrees [Fahrenheit].  And in the winter, very damp and therefore, searching.  The cold was very searching.  But I was profoundly impressed.  I wasn't conscious of it.  By evenings in Louisiana which, certain melancholy about them.  And with the moss hanging in the trees it's a--I'm very thankful for having grown up in that environment.
Speaker 1: When you go back there do you--What do you feel?
Speaker 2: I feel a certain nostalgia, of course.  And I feel an enormous appreciation for the people I knew as a child.  Some of whom had gone through slavery.  Not many.  But some who still survived.  There was a man, Mr. Ike Johnson who worked at the electric company.  And he had--He was a slave.  Gave me the first $600 I ever had.  Not any kin to me.  Almost the last.  But the first $600.  And he bought me the first little Waterbury watch I had.  He just took an interest in me.  I went to his funeral.  I was here then.  And then there were other people there.  Aunt Molly we called her who'd been a slave.  The thing that impressed me about those people and their children, the younger people would--My father [Washington Monroe Taylor] born in 1870, people of that generation.  The sense of dignity of all of the things that had happened to them.  They were not crushed.  And I marvel--I'm gonna be talking down at Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] about this very likely.  I'm sure I will.  The resiliency that they had and they refused to be humbled.  But they refused to be humiliated.  They would not--they would not be crushed.  I think it's one of the most gallant chronicles in all of history.
Speaker 1: Did they tend to stick together?
Speaker 2: Yes.  But not unduly.  Talked very little about slavery.  I think they felt a certain shame.  And they did not talk about it much.  But they came out of that awful experience with a pride and a courage and a determination.
Speaker 1: I read in my research that your father encouraged the community to help raise money to send you to school.  Do you recall that?
Speaker 2: I remember a popularity contest in elementary school [Reddy Street School], where he raised money in the church as I remember.  I didn't win the pop-- the contest.  A young fellow named Bucksell, B-U-C-K-S-E-L-L, as I recall.  And there was talk in my family that the-- some of the teachers had put in a little more money.  Put in $20 or whatever.  The whole thing maybe $20, put in a little more money to make him win.  I don't know what happened to.  But I heard that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 13860
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Celina Gesell Taylor] do for a living when your father [Washington Monroe Taylor] died?
Speaker 2: She began teaching.  Professor [J. M.] Frazier whom I have mentioned and my father were friends.  My father bought Studebaker cars which are no longer produced.  The head of the Studebaker company was named Perkins.  I forget his initials now.  And he was head of the school board.  So when my father died in what--1931, I guess, Mr. Perkins and Professor Frazier, the black supervisor and principal and the president of the school board arranged-- allowed my mother to teach.  So she began teaching.  Now my mother's salary was $52 a month.  White teachers in Louisiana were getting $104 a month.  It was that kind of disparity.
Speaker 1: So she had to struggle [unclear].
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  She was a struggler.  My father had some property.  But it was heavily mortgaged.  Remember, this was just after the Depression, 1929, 1931, he died.  And everything was heavily mortgaged.  And bit-by-bit she managed.
Speaker 1: Do--Does your family still have land there?
Speaker 2: We have no--I have a little land there.  All left from my father.  But not much, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's go back to Leland College [Baton Rouge, Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Larry, can I ask one question please?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Sir, I'm just wondering--Who was doing--?  And this sort of ties into Leland.  But it ties into--Who was doing your-- Who was your father figure after your father passed away?
Speaker 1: Dr. [J. A.] Bacoats, the president of--Dr. Bacoats succeeded my father as pastor also of Mount Zion Church [Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  And he was a father figure.  Coach [J. L.] Kraft I mentioned.  Professor Frazier.  We had wonderful role models in that little town.  Physicians--whatnot.

Speaker 1: And you were fixed on going to law school.  Did you--I mean were you, I mean, so--I know you later went to Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio].  But did you--Had you made any overtures towards going to--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Oh indeed.  I--As a matter of fact, I had been admitted.  And this is a strange thing.  I had been admitted to the University of Michigan Law School [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  I don't know whether they knew I was black or what.  But I remember the admission certificate or whatever they sent out.  I remember the little X in a box, because the school [Leland College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] was unaccredited.  My school was unaccredited.  I remember that.  But I had been admitted to the University of Michigan Law School.
Story_ID: 13862
Speaker 1: Well I was chauffeur for Dr. [J. A.] Bacoats [president of Leland College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  Had a horrible accident on a 1934 Dodge he had.  Two white men cut across the road in front of me.  I went toward the ditch. But they both died.  One was bleeding from the head and whatnot on it.  The only people who gathered were two whites I saw.  And later one or two black people.  One black man whose face I can still see who came there and just stood there and.  But these white people, one was named Jesse Sharkey, S-H-A-R-K-E-Y, who was a local Baptist preacher.  A white Baptist preacher.  They testified honestly what had happened.  Now it was almost unheard of in that day, for whites to testify in favor of blacks.  No matter the circumstance.  You could not be right.  But these men came forward.  I've never forgotten that.  And testified the next day at the inquest.  And I had no problems.  My whole life could have been radically altered had these men not come forward.
Speaker 2: What happened immediately after the accident?  Were you injured?  Or--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] No.  I was--There was a lad in the car with me named Leons Lock who is gone now.  And we got in the ditch.  But I got out.  Now remember, this was a Model T Ford we hit.  And this was a heavy 1934 Dodge.  And I can--That little Ford must have bounced, it looked like, a foot off the ground when it was hit.  But those you know--A Model T Ford was perhaps the lightest car ever produced in the world.
Speaker 2: So were you allowed to go home or--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Yes.  I went on back to the school [Leland College] that night and my mother [Celina Gesell Taylor] I'm told, stayed up all night mopping the floor.  To do something, I guess.  I guess I was in shock.  I didn't realize what jeopardy I was in.  Yes.  I realize it more now looking back on it.  Far more than I did then.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: So just for the record then, this is a grave situation.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Grave!
Speaker 2: Two white men are dead.
Speaker 1: That's putting it mildly.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In Louisiana on a country road in 1937, it was not grave.  It was almost fatal.
Speaker 2: But as you say two local white men--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 2: Testified on your behalf?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: [Unclear].
Speaker 1: I remember going to the inquest the next morning.  Now I had no men in my family.  But Mr. Joe Baker came to the inquest.  And it was back there--It was something for a black person to venture into that venue.  He came and Dr. Bacoats, of course, came.  And it worked out.
Speaker 2: Did this event change you in any way?
Speaker 1: Profoundly altered me.  Though I was not aware of how much it changed me, as it was changing me.  I wasn't aware of it.  But I do know that I just--I was groping for some meaning--What I wanted to do with my life.  And so I ended up doing what I did.
Story_ID: 13863
Speaker 1: After that accident--And how close was that accident to you-- your decision to go to Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Right away.  I-- Within weeks certainly.  Because it was the spring of my senior year [of college, Leland College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  April, 1937.  I would graduate in May of 1937.  And so it was pretty sudden.
Speaker 1: No doubt.  How did that--Did the accident affect your decision to go to Oberlin? Or did it at all?
Speaker 2: I'm not conscious of any deliberate transition I made.  But I know after the accident I went to Dr. [J. A.] Bacoats [president of Leland College] and told him I wanted to go to Oberlin and prepare for the ministry.  There was a lot of laughter in the boy's-- men's dormitory too that night.  When he announced in the chapel that I was going.  But--
Speaker 1: [Unclear] So some of the, young men that you had--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yeah.
Speaker 1: taunted earlier--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yeah.
Speaker 1: thought this was--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yeah.  Yep.  They--It was a certain surprise.  And then there was a lot of joking about my going.  I--But I went on.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Could you tell me about how your family and friends prepared you to go to the North, to Oberlin, Ohio to school?
Speaker 2: I think I was not aware of what a trauma it must have been for my mother [Celina Gesell Taylor].  She had one aunt [Gertrude Gibbens] and me.  That's all.  Nobody there had gone out of the state [Louisiana].  And here I was going to Ohio.  And my daughter [Martha Taylor] who lives in California now, left to go to school.  I think it was only then that I began realizing what this woman might have--must have gone through.  And a far more trying experience for her.  Because I was here in New York [New York] when my daughter went.  And she was there in Baton Rouge [Louisiana].  And hadn't been exposed to nothing else.  And there was no coming home for Christmas or anything like that.  And I--But I do remember them giving-- preparing. You could not eat in the dining cars.  I didn't know anything about dining cars anyhow.  You know.  She prepared I guess, a box this high of food.  I ate all the way to Ohio.  Okay.
Speaker 1: But I don't--You know, young people--I wasn't aware of what I was doing.  And I didn't have any fear about going.  I was going.  I do remember that--And I'd never been out of the state except to Bay, St. Louis [Missouri] which was just across the border.  I remember taking the longest route around I could to get to Oberlin.  I went by St. Louis, Chicago [Illinois].  Yeah.
Speaker 2: How long a trip was it?
Speaker 1: Oh [chuckle]  I guess it was a couple of days nearly.
Speaker 2: Alright. How did you know you go again? On the-- by--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] By train.  The Illinois Central [Railroad] up to Vicksburg [Missouri] and then up to Chicago and then over to Cleveland [Ohio].  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Was your impression of--What was your impression of Ohio before you went?
Speaker 1: Some wonderful place far off.  Where there was not segregation I thought.
Speaker 2: Did--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Because I hated the patterns of the South.  I hated them from as far as I can remember I hated it.  I hated it.  I loved the people there.  My people there but I just--Patterns I hated.  I had a far more optimistic feeling of what Oberlin was, of what Ohio was about than it was.  But, when it contrasted with what I had been through-- had grown up in.  It was still a paradise.
Story_ID: 13864
Speaker 1: Can you tell us something about Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio]?  What kind of a place was Oberlin?  And when was it founded?
Speaker 2: Well Oberlin was begun in 1834, I guess at an abolitionist school out of Lane [Theological] Seminary in Cincinnati [Ohio] which divided over the--the school divided over the slave issue.  Oberlin had had that long, wonderful tradition.  One of John Brown's [abolitionist] troops was an Oberlin lad.  Langston I think was his name.  And I had a wonderful experience at Oberlin.  I think it was the soundest, the most thorough theological training in America.  Now that's a prejudice real likely.  But I thought that way.  I do know and I have said publicly that it made me--Coming out of that Oberlin experience, I never felt ashamed, embarrassed, or hesitant in any intellectual environment.  Never.  Never.
Speaker 1: What was the-- what was some of the highlights of the course of studies at Oberlin?
Speaker 2: One was meeting my seminary roommate whose name was Jim Cayce, C-A-Y-C-E, who died early.  Had one of the most brilliant minds I've ever met.  Came from Louisville, Kentucky.  Far more sophisticated if I want to use that word than I, coming from Louisiana.  But Cayce did a good deal for me.  He had a brilliant mind.  I was not able to take notes.  I never could take notes very well.  I'd listen to the professor.  But I couldn't take notes.  I read Cayce's notes all through seminary.  Got through seminary on his notes.  So he really got two degrees.  But the teachers were wonderful.  Thorough, scholarly and yet, reverent.  Was not a scoffing about the faith.
Speaker 1: So did you--Were you permitted to do any preaching at all or--?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] As a matter of fact, I preached.  Whatever I did.  My--They had what was called a trial sermon before I went to get my license to preach.  I had preached in my home church at Mount Zion [Church, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  And I went to Oberlin.  And the first two or three weeks I was there, I got an opportunity to go speak in a church.  Because some of the fellows did not--Had something else to do.  And so it got around.  I got the chance to go.  The man's name was R. M. Cayvah [ph.] and it was the Bethany Baptist Church in Cleveland [Ohio].  And I guess I tried to preach the same sermon I tried to preach when I left Baton Rouge [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: You were ordained in Baton Rouge?
Speaker 2: No.  I was--In our-- my denomination, one is licensed.  Becomes a lay preacher.  And then one becomes a full minister by ordination.  I was ordained in Oberlin at Mount Zion Church.
Speaker 1: But you were licensed in--
Speaker 2: Baton Rouge.
Speaker 1: In Baton Rouge.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you developed a relationship with Bethany Church in Cleveland?
Speaker 1: Oh they did.  I didn't have any relationship.  I was just there.  This pastor was very forward looking.  Many of the pastors took no interest in the students out there at Oberlin.  We were thirty miles away.  And I guess they just--But this man reached out to students, which was a wonderful thing.  And it made me sensitive about theolog students for the ministry all my life.  That those of us who were settled, owed them something.
Story_ID: 13865
Speaker 1: Were you the only--Were there other black students [at Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio]--?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Oh yes.
Speaker 1: At Oberlin and in that class?
Speaker 2: Yes.  There were other black students.  Not many.  Maybe eight, ten.  I must tell you this.  I had the first disillusionment about the black intellectual within four or five weeks after I got to Oberlin.  A boy, young fellow named Bill Murphy who was a son of the [John] Murphy Publishers, the Afro-American in Baltimore [Maryland] danced with a white girl.  And the dean of the college, not of the seminary, had called him in and then he'd quoted something to him from the Apostle Paul.  "All things that are lawful are not expedient."  Well it created a furor.  And the students from the [Oberlin] Conservatory [of Music] and from the College of Arts and Science and the seminaries all came together in Mount Zion Church.  Now do you know that whole protest was impeded.  Because it was difficult to decide who was gonna lead it.  Whether it was gonna be the College of Arts and Science in which Bill Murphy was a student.  The Conservatory people thought they--And then the seminarians.  I got my first taste of the problems of the intellectual community.
Speaker 1: This would have been in--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] 1937.
Speaker 1: 1937.  When you first--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Um-hmm.  Hadn't been there but a few weeks.  Maybe three or four months.
Speaker 1: And how did they react--?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] But I tell you, when I went to that meeting--And these were privileged young black people.  Oberlin.  And I'm from Louisiana.  I was awe struck until I began seeing the machinations and the immaturities.  Of which I had my part I'm sure.  But mine excusable.  I was from Louisiana.  They were privileged young people.
Speaker 1: Was there any black faculty members at Oberlin?
Speaker 2: Oh no.  No.  No.  No.  No.
Speaker 1: What about the community?  That would be pretty--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Well there was a substantial black community.  A black church.  The Mount Zion Church.  My first wife [Laura Bell Scott] was a member of that church.  And I met her at some kind of supper they had.
Story_ID: 13866
Speaker 1: Now there's an interesting story about you seeing her [his wife, Laura Bell Scott] picture before you had met her.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yes.  Laura had made Phi Beta Kappa [honor society] the year before.  Had been--Her picture was carried in the 'Pittsburgh Courier.'  I had a dear friend, Dan Nash, who lives in Los Angeles [California] now.  And sitting on my mother's [Celine Gesell Taylor] porch I said I was gonna go to Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio].  I said, "I'm gonna meet that girl."  And I did.  Married her.  Fifty-four years until she died.
Speaker 1: Just for the sake of the readers, the Courier was a--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Oh my--
Speaker 1: --pretty popular newspaper.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] goodness, yes.  Much of my sense of who I was and of the whole black purpose in America came from the 'Pittsburgh Courier'.  It was circulated all through the South I'm sure.  Certainly in Baton Rouge [Louisiana].  And I read it avidly.  Horace Keaton was writing for it who later did a thing with somebody else--St. Clair Drake or somebody, on the black metropolis.  Chester Washington was writing.  George [S.] Schuyler, whose name may have been forgotten, but whom I met when I came to New York [New York] later.  But Schuyler was writing with his city tongue, pen.  And I read all of those things.  Joseph Bibb was a writer for it.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were reading the Courier in Louisiana before you [unclear]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  I would-- I could hardly wait until the weekend came and the Courier--We'd get the 'Pittsburgh Courier.'
Speaker 1: So you saw your wife-- your future wife's picture in the 'Pittsburgh Courier'?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And how long did it take you to meet her?  And--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Oh I guess I'd been there a few weeks.  Maybe toward the winter. She'd graduated Oberlin and had not got a job.  And they had a supper at the church [Mount Zion Church] and I met her.  And I went on from there.
Story_ID: 13867
Speaker 1: So you meet your future wife [Laura Bell Scott] at Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio] after seeing her picture in the 'Pittsburg Courier'.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you get along with her right away or--
Speaker 2: Well actually there was a fellow from Newark [New Jersey] named Charlie Walker who told me that he was fond of her.  And actually had asked me a strange thing, asked me to say a word for him.  Why--I was going to speak at a little girls' missionary meeting, The Vashdi Club.  And he asked me to, you know, tell her he was interested in her.  So I asked as quiet as I knew how--was, you know, was she interested, and she said, "No I just know him."  That's all I needed to hear.  And that was the end of Charlie Walker [chuckle].
Speaker 1: Poor Charlie.
Speaker 2: Poor Charlie, yeah [laughing].  Ah me.
Speaker 1: So you all became--
Speaker 2: [simultaneously] We started going together and went on--She went on to teach at Avery Institute in Charleston, South Carolina.  And we kept in touch and corresponded and finally in the year of my graduation [1940] we married.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she move back to Oberlin?
Speaker 2: No, she--her people lived there.  And then she went back to Charleston to teach.  And I had a little church then, Bethany [Baptist] Church in Elyria [Ohio].  And I left that church.  And my mother [Celina Gesell Taylor], bless her memory, I think was afraid I was never gonna come back.  And persuaded me to give up my church.  So I did.  And I went back to Louisiana.  And Laura and I were separated then for eight, nine months.  Because I later was invited to pastor a church--whatever I was doing there in New Orleans [Louisiana].
Story_ID: 13868
Speaker 1: Let's go back to Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio] for a minute now.  You--What year did you graduate from there?
Speaker 2: 1940.
Speaker 1: 1940.  We have a note here that you were the third African American to graduate?
Speaker 2: Oh no.  Oh no. There had been many that graduated.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: From the seminary?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and from the college--many.
Speaker 1: [unclear] Baton Rouge? [unclear].
Speaker 2: Mary Church Gerald whose name you may not know--very prominently mentioned in W. E. B. DuBois', [David Levering] Lewis' treatment of DuBois, had been a graduate of Oberlin way back.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you--what were your aims when you graduated from--
Speaker 2: [simultaneously] I wanted to pastor.
Speaker 1: Oberlin?
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact I wanted to pastor before I graduated.  There was this--there was this--I--it was nothing conscious or verbal.  But I wanted to be at it.  And I wanted to--really wanted to quit school.  And my mother [Celina Gesell Taylor] wrote a pastor in Washington [D.C.] who had been a friend of my father's [Washington Monroe Taylor], Dr. Jernigan, who wrote me a--not a stern letter, but a very poignant letter about my need to prepare myself.  And so I wanted to be at it.  And I can't quite explain that.  It was nothing verbal.  It was just this urge to be doing it.
Speaker 1: Did you have a sense of a particular mission that you had as a pastor that you wanted to accomplish?
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't have that.  I guess preaching.  I wanted to be preaching.  I--but I didn't have it--I didn't have--no.  I didn't have any-- It wasn't clear-cut.  I just wanted to be a--But I have often pondered how different my life would have been had--I guess I wasn't gonna do it.  But had I quit school, what was I going to do--what--?
Speaker 1: So you pondered quitting school at a certain point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was--I don't know if I wanted to quit.  I wanted to be pastoring and I wanted to be preaching.  And then last year I was invited--toward my last year, to pastor a little church [Bethany Baptist Church] in Elyria, Ohio and I went.
Story_ID: 13869
Speaker 1: So that you eventually went back to Louisiana?
Speaker 2: Yes, without a place. And I was so embarrassed.  I'd been around this relatively small town.  Everyone knew I'd been away to school, had no place.  And I became embarrassed to go out of my mother's [Celina Gesell Taylor] house, really.
Speaker 1: Had Louisiana changed much since you'd been gone?
Speaker 2: Between the time at school?  No, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Then had you changed any?
Speaker 2: Sure had.  Yeah.  I think I'd had the Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio] experience.  And I came back to this whole pattern of segregation and was uncomfortable in it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So could--so you didn't--Did you feel that you still could fit in?
Speaker 2: I didn't feel I could fit in before I left.  I didn't like it, never did.  And I don't know how I--I don't know how that deep distaste for the whole pattern--Because in the South, you could live in a segregated community and except when you had to go to downtown or uptown we call it to a store or something, you could live almost completely within the black community.  But I just hated it, hated it.
Speaker 1: What aspects of it were worse?
Speaker 2: It.
Story_ID: 13870
Speaker 1: How did you--how did you become a pastor of a church?
Speaker 2: Well a man in New Orleans [Louisiana] named A. L. [Abraham Lincoln] Davis who later became the first [African American] city councilman in New Orleans interceded for me and got me an opportunity to preach in this church, Beulah Baptist Church in New Orleans and I was--I became pastor there--whatever.
Speaker 1: Was Beulah a large church?
Speaker 2: No.  It was a sizable building for that day.  But it didn't have that many members.  But I went there and things went along well, yeah.
Speaker 1: What are the--were the challenges for a young Baptist minister in that community?
Speaker 2: Well one--in New Orleans you mean?  Well one was to find one's place, to find what one was going to do. You--All right.  You're called to pastor.  You're invited.  But then you've got to find your own niche and nook in the community.
Story_ID: 13871
Speaker 1: I tell you an experience we had.  Laura [Bell Scott, his wife] went down when school was over and came--born in Cleveland [Ohio], schooled at Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio], she didn't know.  She saw in 'The Times-Picayune'--that was the daily paper--an announcement for an examination for some civil service position.  She went down to take it and she--Oh no.  She took it by corres--sent the examination out I think.  And she finished second in it, something like that.  She was told quite honestly it wasn't for a colored person.  That was her first experience with this kind of thing.  But she came down.  We had finally got a little shotgun house, you might call it, straight through, and started off.
Speaker 2: Now what kind of temperament does Laura have and how did she--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] She was--
Speaker 2: --react?
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] She was--she had more maturity than I had.  And I think saw something in me that I didn't know about.  But she educated me culturally and gave me a feeling of fair competency in different circles.  Introduced me I think to the theater.  And I guess more than anything on earth, shaped my ministry.
Speaker 2: So she provided sort of a critique of you?
Speaker 1: She had majored in English, and as she was listening to me every week and--
Speaker 2: So this sounds like a valuable partnership to me, you know.
Speaker 1: More than that.
Speaker 2: [softly] All right.
Speaker 1: More than that.  It was a great thing.
Speaker 2: How did she adjust to it?  Take your time.
Speaker 1: That's all right.
Speaker 2: How did she adjust to a life in New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 1: Did better than I did.  Of course, New Orleans had--the black New Orleans community was a fairly diverse and a literate community and, of course, had been for many generations. The culture of New Orleans--black culture was pronounced.  No question about that and she fitted in.
Story_ID: 13872
Speaker 1: And there's a--I know there's a sizeable black middle class in New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  But much of it was concentrated downtown which is the Creole area.  We were uptown.  And interestingly enough each--I don't know about this last election the other day.  But every mayor of New Orleans, black mayor, has been a downtown person.
Speaker 1: Is there a real sharp stratification of black people in New Orleans?
Speaker 2: Downtown has been Creole, light skinned, Catholic.  Uptown has been darker, Protestant.  Much larger population uptown.  But they have never been able to elect a mayor.  Because the downtown section, the Creole section, and the white community have joined together.  Because the pattern in Louisiana, I don't know about the rest of the South was--That next to being white, you were light skinned and that was the descending order.
Speaker 1: Just out of curiosity, was the society in Oberlin [Ohio]--black society in Oberlin stratified?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  It was stratified more on the basis of education and property.  The most influential woman and black woman in Oberlin was named Mrs. Barnes.  She was in the Ohio Women's Club back there, Mary Gerald, Church Gerald had the national club and all that.  And she was a prominent Republican as I remember.  No.  And she was a very dark skinned person.
Story_ID: 13873
Speaker 1: As you start off as pastor of this church [Beulah Baptist Church, New Orleans, Louisiana], how did it go?  I mean how did things go for you?
Speaker 2: Well I got along all right.  The church developed and there had been a debt on that church for twenty-two years.  It wasn't much, $2300, $2400.  But I was new, young and all like that and I wasn't there at that church but two years I guess, two and a half.  We got rid of that debt.  But it wasn't any genius on my part.  I was new and young and all like that.
Speaker 1: Now this is 1941.  World War II is raging.  Do you have any experiences you want to share about the war or the atmosphere, you know?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Two things. I remember being called to go out to the--talk to the black troops who were stationed at maybe Fort Jackson [Buras, Louisiana] it was called.  My--One of my seminary roommates, William Cash, who later became one of the vice presidents of the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], had entered the Chaplain Corps, and he came to visit us in New Orleans [Louisiana].  Laura [Bell Scott, his wife] and I were then settled in our little house.  And he had on this snappy uniform and I said, "My God, this is something I ought to do." And I got ready to apply and the next thing I got a letter from him.  And back in the Second [World] War they wouldn't tell you where one was--somewhere in England.  And that cooled my passion about the chaplains.
Speaker 1: Were you--you weren't drafted then?
Speaker 2: No.  Because ministers were exempt.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.  Anything else about World War II you'd like to share or--
Speaker 2: No.  I remember Laura and I drove up to St. Charles Avenue [New Orleans, Louisiana]--the Japanese Embassy--it wasn't an embassy I guess--Consulate was up on St. Charles, the night of [the attack on] Pearl Harbor [Hawaii, 1941].  And I remember our driving up there just--We'd heard about the, December 7th, I guess it was--about the attack and  people--a few people were milling about.  I remember that.
Story_ID: 13874
Speaker 1: Were you politically interested at all [unclear]?
Speaker 2: Well yes I was.  There was a leader of the black community, political community, named Ernest Wright.  And we would have protest meetings in Shakespeare Park [New Orleans, Louisiana].  I learned to do political speaking in open air there, and marches, not marches, going to the registration office to try to register and all like that.  I remember that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Trying to register to vote?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I finally registered in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] and I remember going to the fire station not too far from my home.  Both of us.  Laura [Bell Scott, his wife] and I went together.  And the misgivings, the uncertainty, maybe the fear of what was gonna happen.  But we were registered.  Now you could register as Republican.  But I mean as a Democrat.
Speaker 1: And that was the period of time when people were making a transition.  Black folks were making transitions from Republican to Democrat.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Well were wanting to.  This was during [U.S. President] Mr. [Franklin Delano] Roosevelt's tenure and there was no problem registering as a Republican.  Because there was no Republican party in the South. So it [chuckle] didn't make any [chuckle] difference about you being registered.  But to register Democrat was a different matter.  And this question--this was the big question and--But we went on to that fire station and we registered and had no problem about it.
Story_ID: 13875
Speaker 1: How did you develop your public speaking style?
Speaker 2: Well I was what was called a 'boy orator.'  They had--when I was a little boy, they had a little secret orders up and down the bayous [of Louisiana].  My aunt [Gertrude Gibbens], my mother [Celina Gesell Taylor] and father [Washington Monroe Taylor] never took an interest in that kind of thing.  But my aunt  Gert--was a big society lady and they had one group, 'High Sounding'. They had 'The Knights and Ladies of Honor of America.'  And they would have juvenile programs for little--juveniles would speak.  This is a marvelous form of education and I would speak in that.  And then the Masons would come to Baton Rouge [Louisiana].  The [unclear] Fellows and have their annual meetings, the Lodges.  And they would have welcome address and they'd have kids make them and I started doing that.
Speaker 1: Were you pretty good at it?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I guess so.  They kept asking me.  Maybe I wasn't good.  Maybe that's why they kept asking me to see if I could get better.
Speaker 1: So as a minister, were you--did you consider yourself a typical minister in the terms of your delivery and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes and no.  Back then, black ministers--black preachers were not dealing with--directly with social issues.  And I don't remember a time when that was not a part of what I've tried to do.
Speaker 1: So you differed in content?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I read--one of the--some of the research I have indicated that you differed in style as well.  And one writer said that you are not a "whooper."
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that's true.  Yeah, that's true.  There was the intonations that I did not have.  I later found out an answer to the whole thing that--And really, if there's been any secret to my work, it's been that--and this is almost unlearned, but a part of it is learned.  That there is a music in the language.  And I have been blessed to--I don't know how it came about.  But to have some sense of that music.
Speaker 1: And this was--this style was satisfactory to your congregation?
Speaker 2: They put up--Yes, I think so.  I think so, I think so.  But it had also, all through the years, enabled me to fit in more or less in almost any circle.

Speaker 1: So you stayed in New Orleans [Louisiana] then?
Speaker 2: Two years thereabout.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how did you come to leave New Orleans?
Speaker 2: Well Dr. [J. A.] Bacoats whom I met--mentioned, was leaving Leland [College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] to go to Benedict College in [Columbia] South Carolina.  And he took an interest in my succeeding him and at twenty-five--I guess I was twenty-five years old.  I was invited to my home church in which I was reared in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] and I went there.
Speaker 1: Okay. This is Mount Zion [Church].  Okay.  So how did you feel about going back to--
Speaker 2: Very wonderful.  It was one of the leading churches of the state.  And I thought it was a great opportunity.  And I appreciated it.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were there--What were the  challenges of the Mount Zion [unclear]?
Speaker 2: Well it was a more diverse congregation than I'd had in New Orleans.  The--and I guess one of the greater influences there was a presence of Dr. J. S. Clark, Joseph Clark.  Who was founder of Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], who was a member of that church.  And had been for--a friend of my father's [Washington Monroe Taylor] too.  But he encouraged my ministry at Mount Zion greatly.
Speaker 1: So it was a more educated--
Speaker 2: [simultaneously] Yeah.
Speaker 1: --congregation?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Seemed to be a little sharper?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] And that meant that my own efforts had to be--had to be studied.  And I was driven.  No, I wanted to also.  But I felt called upon to deepen and sharpen my approach and my delivery.
Story_ID: 13877
Speaker 1: Other than pastoring the church directly, specifically, what other activities were you involved in?
Speaker 2: In Baton Rouge [Louisiana]?
Speaker 1: No--yeah, in Mount Zion [Church.]
Speaker 2: Well I was--As I said, it's been a marvelous life.  I again came there just as the agitation was intensifying about equalizing salaries for teachers.  I told you what my mother [Celina Gesell Taylor] got, $52.  And this was all the teachers.  And black teachers got half of what white teachers got.  There was a man in Louisiana, J. K. Haynes who was the leader of the Forces of Black Liberation.  And he and two or three fellows who were with him took an interest in me and sort of enlisted me in the whole thing.  I remember going to the Louisiana state capitol [Baton Rouge].  A huge capitol had just been built.  And on the sixteenth floor.  I never have forgotten it.  Thurgood Marshall was there, first time I'd met him.  And whites and blacks were talking about salaries.  Black teachers getting half of what white teachers were getting.  And I remember a fine looking white-thatched gentlemen named Ford Clayburn who was a United States Attorney or something over across the river.  We talked about oh three or four hours about equalizing salaries.  And he said, "Let me ask you boys something." he said, "You're not talking about Negroes getting the same salary as white people are you?"  And Thurgood Marshall--I've never forgotten it--said, "I don't like the way you pronounce the word Negro."  "Oh," he said, "I don't mean any harm.  I call all Negroes, Negroes."  But I think this old man was sincere, I think he was sincere.  I think it was just beyond his comprehension that black people would be asking to get the same amount of salary as white people.
Speaker 1: So what role did you play in this thing?
Speaker 2: Well I was the young pastor.  And I went around with them.  You had to meet surreptitiously with these teachers.  Because there was no tenure and a teacher--a black teacher, I guess a white one too, but a black teacher couldn't be--If a superintendent didn't want you, you went.  And these people were scared to meet about equalizing salaries.  And I was a rash, brash young fellow so-- And J. K. Hanes I think wanted some clergyman to sort of be in the thing and I got in the mix.
Speaker 1: Do you think that a clergyman because--black clergymen because they have their own church and economic base are freer to engage in social agitation than somebody like a teacher that you just described who's got to worry about the salary?
Speaker 2: Oh I think that traditionally, not so much now.  But back then, the black preacher was the only free person there was who had no sanctions against him. What could they do other than physical harm?  They couldn't penalize him.  His living did not come from the white community.  I have said many times that the black church--It had its faults. God knows it has.  But it was our General Motors, our U.S. Steel, our Enron too.  But it was the one place that blacks were really free.  And I don't think--I don't think really a fair assessment has been made of the black church with all of its faults, or what it meant to people in terms of religious teaching, yes.  But--and along with that and a part of that, a term of dignity and purpose and protest and information that it gave to black people.
Story_ID: 13878
Speaker 1: Did your wife [Laura Bell Scott] like Baton Rouge [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Much better than New Orleans [Louisiana].  She did not like New Orleans very much.  But Baton Rouge was--it was a closer community.  It was a community of somewhat higher training.  She began teaching at Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], because the Clarks [Joseph S. Clark, the founder of Southern University] were our friends.  And she liked it much better.
Story_ID: 13879
Speaker 1: Oh, Channing [H.] Tobias had a meeting in Harlem [New York, New York], at the Harlem Y.M.C.A [Young Men's Christian Assocation] and Herbert Miller was very prominent over here and he headed the Carlton Street Y.M.C.A. [Brooklyn, New York].
Speaker 2: Just to interject here--Tobias, now can you tell us who he was?
Speaker 1: Channing Tobias was the chief black executive of the National Y.M.C.A.  And when I came here I decided that I would not go to things on Saturday.  Herb Miller offered me--he was an enormously influential person--Some connection offered me a chaplaincy at the Raymond Street Jail--it was going to pay something.  And--But you had to have service on Sunday morning.  And I was not gonna have--I was not gonna make any attempt to do anything before I went to my own church and pulpit. So I refused it.  So I--he knew that.  And Mr. Tobias was having this meeting in Harlem and Herb Miller told him that I would not come because it was on a Saturday.  Well he said, "I'll get him. He'll come." And Mr. Tobias called.  I did go.  And Mr. Tobias said to Herb Miller in my presence said, "I told you'd he'd come."  And Herb said--I said, "Oh but I'm not preaching tomorrow."  I remember that.  And I wasn't.  I wouldn't have gone if I'd been preaching.  But I--somebody else was--So I remember that about Channing Tobias.
Story_ID: 13880
Speaker 1: How did you get involved in the National Baptist Convention?
Speaker 2: Well my father [Washington Monroe Taylor] had been vice president at large of that convention.  So I was sort of suckled in that convention. Though I did not know it intimately, but--And in Shreveport [Louisiana] I guess, the executive board of that convention was meeting in January of the year of the United--founding of the United Nations [1944].  And my friend Marshall Sheppard, again, who took an interest in me and did worlds for me in introducing me to the country.  And he did it through another man named [George] Russell Barber.  Who was head of the National Baptist Voice [newspaper] and who took an interest in me and said, you know, Cincinnati [Ohio] Fish House, years ago.  "I want you--" and--talking about Sheppard and me.  He said, "I want you two fellows to be friends." And so when the matter came up of what observers were going to the founding of the United Nations, Sheppard was offered and he said he couldn't go and he proposed my name.  And I went.  And I saw W. E. B. DuBois.  I didn't talk with him.  One did not talk with Mr--Dr. DuBois, you know.  And Madame [Vijaya Lakshmi] Pandit [India's U.N. ambassador] was there and [Jawaharlal] Nehru [Prime Minister of India] and Edward [Reilly] Stettinius was [United States] Secretary of State and [Vyacheslav] Molotov was the Foreign Minister from Russia.  And I sat in a red plush--red chairs of the [War Memorial] Opera House [San Francisco, California] and watched the proceedings to the United Nations.
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: [simultaneously] I'm a kid of twenty-eight, twenty-nine years old, yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you observed DuBois at a distance right?
Speaker 2: I was in the same room where he was.  He called--there would be interest groups, caucuses and whatnot.  Meetings to advance various things.  And DuBois was, of course leader of the  black meeting.  Walter White was there and people like that.
Speaker 1: What about Ralph Bunche?
Speaker 2: Mr--Dr. Bunche was undersecretary of something.  He was on the stage.  I later met him here in New York [New York].  But I didn't know him.
Speaker 1: So what was it like being a part of that kind of experience [unclear]?
Speaker 2: [simultaneously] Heady, heady, heady, intoxicating.  I remember going out on Pullman cars with people.  Very prominent black preachers, William Holmes Borders from Wheat Street Church in Atlanta [Georgia] was in that delegation.  And I was thrown in with those fellows and I was more--it was heady.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now can you tell us something about the scope of the National Baptist Convention?
Speaker 2: The National Baptist Convention was the hugest black organization that there was. It had two divisions in 1915, divided over the [National Baptist] Publishing House in Nashville [Tennessee].  My father was involved in that.  He was, well not in the actual division, but he was active.  And then, of course, in 1963, we had another great division over civil rights.  I was involved in that.  I preached at the National Baptist Convention in Minneapolis [Minnesota] last September.  And after forty-three years or whatever.  And I was saying that--I told this, and it did happen.  That my father was involved in some sense in the first great schism, first great division.  I was involved in the second.  And my wife, Phyllis [Taylor] now, said, she was glad I didn't have a son.  'Cause they'd have another division.  I told that out at Minneapolis.
Story_ID: 13881
Speaker 1: Well the--My predecessor, Dr. Adams died in September I guess.  And he had invited me to come here to preach in the 100th year of this church.
Speaker 2: And which church is that?
Speaker 1: Concord Baptist Church [Brooklyn, New York].  And he came home and died.  And then I was later invited to come here.  Partly through the instrumentality of Marshall Sheppard and then a marvelous preacher here, William Milanda Carrington, who was at First AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Zion Church.  And who had come down to Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] to preach to the Baccalaureate sermon, because of Martin Harvey who was  prominent in that denomination and was Dean of Students at Southern.  And Martin brought him to Mount Zion Church [Baton Rouge, Louisiana] that morning.  So he heard me and he spoke kindly of me when he got back.  And so I was invited here to preach.
Speaker 2: How did it go?
Speaker 1: Well I had a marvelous experience.  Because I came in February.  The Sunday I was first to come, with great fear of heart, I told him I could not.  It was my Lord's Supper day.  I couldn't--I never--I don't think I have ever hated to mail a letter as much as I did that letter telling him I couldn't come. Because I wanted to come here.  But I did it.  The Sunday I would have come--that first Sunday in February the worst snow New York [New York] had had in twenty years.  Nobody was in church.  And I came two or three Sundays later.  It was a marvelous, warm day like this in February.  And people hadn't been in church for two or three Sundays.  They were ready to hear anything.  And so I was there.
Speaker 2: So how did you decide to become permanent here?
Speaker 1: Decide?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was a question of them asking me.  It wasn't a question of [chuckle] if I decided.
Speaker 2: So you really wanted to [unclear]?
Speaker 1: [simultaneously] This was one of the great places of America.  I mean that church was--
Speaker 2: Had you ever been to New York before?
Speaker 1: Only as a student.  I came here.  I was telling you about Charlie Walker and my lady Laura [Bell Scott].  He was from Newark [New Jersey] and I came here once.  A Christmas I guess, and tried to see everything in New York.  I remember her telling me, "You can't see New York in one day or two."  But no, I hadn't been to New York at all until I preached in that church.
Speaker 2: Well how did the people--your congregation and friends and relatives in Baton Rouge feel about you leaving?
Speaker 1: I think they realized that this was an opportunity.  I'd like to think that they had some regret about my going.  But I think they were understanding.  I do remember a fellow with whom I'd grown up, George Harwood saying to me--he was manager of a service station--a gasoline station there.  He said, "It's better to be a big fish in a little pond then a little fish in a big pond."  Well I might become a big fish in a big pond.
Speaker 2: So you accepted a position here.  And came here--?
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] More eagerly than the people thought.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you arrived here in what year?
Speaker 1: June 1948.
Story_ID: 13882
Speaker 1: Well there had been an eighteen month lapse--eighteen month period between my predecessor's [Dr. Adams] death and my coming.  And it was a huge congregation.  And there were parties.  There were groups that had developed.  There were divisions.  And my first year, I guess, here, many of the night--many of the nights I wished I was back in Baton Rouge [Louisiana].  There I was a fair haired boy.  Everything was on my side and all like that.  And I was being tested. Tested, really tested.  And it was strenuous.  And then in 1952, 1953 I guess, we had a fire in 1952.  Wiped out everything.  Best thing ever happened to me and the church.  Best thing ever happened to the church.
Speaker 2: Did [unclear]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  First, this was the oldest black Baptist congregation in Brooklyn [New York].  And with reason there was a certain pride.  Well that fire wiped all of that out.  And we had to start over from scratch.  And it did worlds for us.  Never again after that was that--did that congregation tremble or shrink from any challenge.  Never again.
Speaker 2: Now how did the fire occur [unclear]?
Speaker 1: There was a funeral--there were night funerals in New York then.  I think they had begun because of the [World] War [II, 1939] when people could not get off during the war effort.  And I think they began night funerals so that people could work, and still go to a funeral.  Well there was a funeral in the church that night.  It was an electrical storm.  Nobody ever found out whether the lightening struck the building, what happened.  But it was--the whole block was wiped out.  The length of a block.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: So how did you manage to recover from something like that?
Speaker 1: God--To tell you the very truth, I don't know.  I do know that we started back and there was a secretary of the Council of the Churches in Brooklyn named Henry Carpenter.  A wonderful man, who had been a friend of my predecessor's.  And he came to me and counseled me about fundraising groups.  Marts & Lundy [fundraising firm] would raise funds for the Y.M.C.A. [Young Men's Christian Association].  I had never heard of a professional fundraising organization.  I never heard of it.  But they came in and they helped us to stagger the gifts, the money raising.  We got some money, 200-some thousand dollars,  I guess it was from the insurance.  Another providential thing happened.  When I came here this was a magnificent brick structure.  But it was all wood on the inside from one end of the block to the other.  And I got them to raise that insurance.  Should have gotten them to raise it more.  But we raised it maybe $100,000.  It's been a charmed life so-- And I had no notion we were gonna have a fire.  But we did.  And we--so we collected $283,000, something like, that from the fire.  But then I remember when the architect Daniel Merrill, who was a wonderful man-- I said to him--We lived on Hodges Street then. "How much you think the building is gonna cost?"  He said, "Oh it'll cost a million dollars."  My heart went straight down.  How in the name of God were we gonna raise a thousand--a hundred--a million dollars?  My wife Laura [Bell Scott] comforted me, bless her memory.  She didn't know either though.  She said, "Oh it won't cost a dime over $700,000."  I traveled in that illusion happily for a year and a half.  The thing finally cost nearly two million dollars [chuckling].  But I couldn't have taken it.
Story_ID: 13883
Speaker 1: Now how did she [his wife, Laura Bell Scott] adjust to the life of [unclear] and did she enjoy it?
Speaker 2: Very well, very well.  She--'cause she'd grown up in Cleveland [Ohio] and Oberlin [Ohio] and it wasn't nearly the distance--difference or distance that I experienced.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she drive here [Brooklyn, New York]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  She was--This was her element.
Speaker 1: Could you please tell me--talk about maybe what--Did you have to come up with any innovative ideas here?  For New York [unclear] new programs?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I do remember a blood bank we began there [Concord Baptist Church, Brooklyn, New York].  And people surrounded me and took interest in me.  I came to know a rabbi, at Temple of Beth Elohim [sic, Congregation Beth Elohim, Brooklyn, New York] Eugene Syke, who was very influential in Brooklyn.  And, you know, really, people have taken an--just a--all along the line an incredible interest in me.  And so they've just pushed me along.
Speaker 1: Now all the while you're still involved in National Baptist Convention?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well I was as involved as I could be.  I would attend meetings and I was involved.  And then our civil rights struggle came.  And I got thrown into that and [Dr.] Martin [Luther] King [Jr.] came into prominence and all of that.
Story_ID: 13884
Speaker 1: Now I've got a note here that you went to Australia in 1959.
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Now how did that happen?
Speaker 2: Well before I left Baton Rouge [Louisiana], the Baptist World Alliance met in Copenhagen [Denmark].  And those people sent me over there.  I remember going to the Paddle Inn Hotel in Grand Rapids [Michigan].  And Dr. Jernigan whose name I mentioned earlier, was very prominent in that alliance and he talked about carrying a group over.  So the people got together and got our expenses and Laura [Bell Scott, his wife] and I went.  And I went--I don't know how I went to the--what was called the Koeben Kirke Second Church of Copenhagen that morning.  But a very prominent white preacher from Atlanta [Georgia], Louis Newton was to preach.  And they asked all the ministers to come back in the study or whatever before the service.  And he said, "I want--" I don't know what he said, "Our colored brother."  I don't remember that.  But anyhow he wanted--He said--Asked me if I would preach that morning. And I did what I could.  That afternoon there was to be a meeting in the stadium--city stadium.  And six or seven of us were to have a few words, six or eight minutes something.  The thing ran out of time.  And Dr. Jernigan said to me, "Taylor, we won't be able to have you say anything."  And I said, "It's alright Dr. Jernigan."  But it wasn't any breadth of spirit on my part.  I'd already done what I could do that morning.  But somehow Dr. Jernigan was impressed with that.  Though heaven knows it was not any great breadth of spirit on my part.  But when the Alliance came to Cleveland [Ohio] in 1950, and I'm amazed when I tell you this.  He somehow was influential in leading--in arranging that I would do--preach the Sunday morning sermon.  It's in the auditorium in Cleveland in 1950.  People in Australia heard it--from Australia heard it.  And a man named Phil Hayes who was over there, invited me to come to Australia.  And I had that experience.  But it's been that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Now what audiences did you preach to in Australia?  Did you preach to, you know, white audiences?
Speaker 2: That's all there was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Except Aborigines.  And I remember being in Sydney I guess and I got a note.  I was gonna do a radio broadcast.  I got a note from--saying we would--the Aborigine Fellowship would like to meet you after the service.  And I never forgot--in a place called Sun Cove.  I was staying with people in Australia, whites, of course.  And so I went off with these Aborigine people after the radio broadcast.  My host said they were bothered about what was gonna happen to me.  But that was the first time I felt at home in Australia.  With the Aborigines.  I had a wonderful evening. Yeah.
Speaker 1: What did you all talk about?
Speaker 2: The Aborigines?
Speaker 1: Same thing we all talk about.  Race, problems of color and the problems the Aborigines had in Australia.  Because they poisoned their waters, you know, in the early days.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: [unclear] Australia not [unclear].
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.  It was tough.  It was tough. They had the white Australia policy and all that.  I talked about that when I was over there.  And they--you got different reactions from them.  Some people tried to justify it.  Say they were sitting there underneath that huge population and they didn't want to be overrun.  It was just--some understanding I guess.
Story_ID: 13885
Speaker 1: Well Dr. [Martin Luther] King's [Jr.] grandfather [Reverend Adam Daniel Williams] and my father [Washington Monroe Taylor] had been friends in the National Baptist Convention.  I did not know Dr. King.  He did not know me I'm sure.  But Dr. Sandy Ray was pastor of Cornerstone [Baptist] Church [Brooklyn, New York] here, had been in school at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] with King's father [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.].  And he brought us together. Then in the convention, whites in the South particularly were saying--Well let me say this--the convention--The National Baptist Convention took a position not favorable to Martin King and--
Speaker 2: Who was the leader of the National Baptist Convention?
Speaker 1: [Dr.] Joseph [H.] Jackson.  Who I think was my friend and I preached for him in his last days.  He preached for me at Concord [Baptist Church, Brooklyn, New York].  I think he sincerely had questions about King's methods. But whites were saying that Dr. King did not enjoy even the support of his own people.  And this was not doing us any good.  And so we'll--some of us younger fellows I guess got involved in agitation and whatnot.  And finally it came to that awful division in I guess 1963, in Kansas City [Missouri].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now this is the annual convention of the National Baptist Convention?
Speaker 1: It started in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] the year before.  And it was an awful exchange.  And we were put under injunctions and--
Speaker 2: Now let's go over what happened.  You were nominated for office in Kansas City, right?  Okay.  Can you talk about that and how that happened?
Speaker 1: Yes.  I was nominated in Philadelphia.  And the convention was stalemated. It was just--We couldn't move.  Nobody could move.  Marshall Sheppard was a member of City Council in Philadelphia.  So he secured our safety.  Whatever you want to put it.  But--And so we went on to Kansas City.  And my daughter [Martha Taylor] was then twelve or thirteen years old.  It was so bitter.  I wrote a note to telling her, "I might not get back here." And I meant it.  It was that bad.  One man did die.
Speaker 2: Who was he?
Speaker 1: A man named Wright from Detroit [Michigan].  But it was accidental I think.  He was--there was a curtain at the back of the stage in Kansas City.  But there was no protection.  And he went back as that curtain, fell down.
Speaker 2: Now I think there was some pushing and shoving--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Well yes. There was pushing and shoving. No question about that.  I really thought I would not get back.  But--So we had that.
Speaker 2: Were you threatened?
Speaker 1: Hmm?
Speaker 2: But were you threatened out there?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was threatened.  Oh yeah.  Oh it was rough!  It was rough.  But--
Speaker 2: And you all represented the faction that was favorable to Dr. King basically?
Speaker 1: Yeah. In fact, Dr. King helped to get me to run.  I haven't talked about that.  But he was in the meeting in Hot Springs [Arkansas] when they--I guess I was willing.  But they also drafted me.
Speaker 2: Now can you cut the issue for us?  What was the major difference between Dr. Kings' philosophy and Joseph Jackson?
Speaker 1: Jackson did not believe in mass protest.  He believed that by negotiation and consultation that we could get through it.  And I think he was sincere in that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Was he really--I know that I've read that he may have not even been concerned about civil rights.  Is this true?
Speaker 1: I don't think that's true.  But I do feel strongly that he felt Dr. King's methods were wrong.  And perhaps the rise--sudden rise of this young man also had some part in this.  Though I don't know that.
Speaker 2: So what happened?  Did--The election took place right?  After that big row and, or during it. And what was the outcome?
Speaker 1: I was defeated.  There was an attorney in Kansas City.  Her name was Pouncy, who called me over to her home the night before the election and said that the election was gonna take place.  And nobody knew what was gonna happen.  But I might have a chance of winning.  I don't remember.  But the next day when the election took place, there's no question about it.  Dr. Jackson's forces prevailed.  Adding insult to injury to the whole cause, Dr. King was then put out of the office he held.  L. V. Booth in Cincinnati [Ohio] called together a group of people.  I did not attend that meeting.  King did not attend it.  We talked--King and I talked.  Neither of us wanted a division.  Neither of us.  But after this meeting in Cincinnati, things started snowballing.  And, you know, you can get into a situation where for a while you may control events.  But at last they control you.  And I'm not--I'm sorry for the division.  But I'm not sorry--I'm not at all sorry that we made the stand we did.  I thank God that when the crucial time came, I might have crumbled and welched.  And I'm glad I didn't.  I'm glad I didn't.  That's one of the prouder moments of my life.
Story_ID: 13886
Speaker 1: Well after the Kansas City thing [rift in National Baptist Convention at Kansas City, Missouri], there was just--it was a combination of political unrest, civic--the question of civil rights, distress.  It was a combination of things.  And so [Dr. L. Venchael] Booth called a meeting of people across the country.  Anybody who wanted to come.  I did not go.  [Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] did not go.  But a number of men did go.  And women too.  And the idea of a new convention was begun.  And the first session was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  I did go to that.  I spoke there. And I think King came too.  But he and I would talk about this intermittently on the telephone.  Neither of us wanted a division.  But as I said events get a hold of you and they carry you along.  And I'm now advocating to reunion the conventions.  And I think it will happen--won't happen in my lifetime, but it's gonna happen.  Almost all of the men and women who were involved in this are gone.  I'm one of the very few left.  And there's no reason to keep hearing that the civil rights agitat--I'd want to think the people of the National [Baptist] Convention are as interested now in civil rights as the people in the Progressive [National Baptist] Convention.
Story_ID: 13887
Speaker 1: You taught at two schools here in New York [New York], from what I understand.  And what is your philosophy of theology?
Speaker 2: Well theology is really the reflection upon people's experiences of God.  That's really what it is.  And there--out of those experiences and out of their beliefs and notions, what do they see as the meaning of the dealing of God with people?  That's what--all it is to it.
Speaker 1: What is your--
Speaker 2: [simultaneously] My argue--
Speaker 1: Personal theology?
Speaker 2: My personal theology comes out of the whole sweep of the Hebrew-Christian Bible and tradition that God has created us.  We have wandered away. This way or that.  Because we are seduced by what appears to be real.  And an illustration of that is the fanfare that you see in public officials.  The motorcades and buntings and bands and translate that into business. Translate it into the church.  A lot of pomp and circumstance.  And God is out to get back what belongs to him.  I think that's what the whole--that's what all of history is about.  And--but the banishments [?].  The temptations of the gaudy appearance of power.  I've said publicly--I was saying down in Gatlinburg, Tennessee this last weekend.  All these things pass very quickly.  Who was secretary of state during the Warren Harding Administration?  No you don't know.  Somebody said, "Who was Warren Harding?"
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Because these things look like they're so wonderful.  Gone.  Gone.  But it--when they're happening, it look like that's what all the world is about.  And look like that's what it'll be about forever.
Speaker 1: I think all Harding's gotten is trouble too.
Speaker 2: Yeah because he was an Ohio man wasn't he?  Yep.  Yeah. Yeah.  But  these and everything seems to emphasize that this is what it's all about.  They all disappear.
Speaker 1: So what do we owe to God?
Speaker 2: Ourselves.  He has made us in his image.  And as Augustine said, "We are restless until we find rest in him."  Because this is our native habitat. But there are so many other habitats that in one way or another imitate him.  Job, health, family, race, nation.  And we are likely to put in the place that belongs only to him any of these other things.  Or a combination of them.  And make or see gods in these other things.  Which is idolatry.
Speaker 1: What do you want to make sure that your students learn from you?
Speaker 2: Well teaching preachers, I want them to understand the difference between what is apparent and what is real.  And I've just touched upon what is apparent. All of the gaudiness of this.  And what is real are things that we don't look upon much.  Let's take the word love.  I'm taking it out of its Hollywood context.  But it is the most persistent thing in the world.  It just goes on anyhow.  Take reconciliation.  We are not at ourselves separated from each other.  But we keep thinking that we can make it by ourselves.  Our little group can make it.  It can't.  This is the problem the nation faces.  No nation has ever been able to reconcile, to have power and humility in proportion brought together.  My friend William Jones here has given me a wonderful thing on that.  And I have condensed it into this.  Conscience without power is helpless.  Power without conscience is hopeless.  Because--but power is deceiving.  We can do it.  And we've seen it in our foreign policy in this country.  Up until and even bits of it now until the last few months.  The new administration has wanted to go it alone.  We don't need nobody.  We're gonna do it.  And you still get dots and dashes of that.  But we can't go it alone.  And I'm afraid--How do you spell your last name?
Speaker 1: C-R-O-W-E.
Speaker 2: C-R-O-W.  I think Mr. Crowe I'm afraid that your lifetime--it'll be far into your lifetime before you see the end of what we're in now.
Speaker 1: What do you think that people need to make a difference in--you know, to make a change?
Speaker 2: Well I think we need--You mean as a country, as individuals or what?
Speaker 1: I guess we're talking about individuals within this--
Speaker 2: [simultaneously] The country.  Yeah. Well I think the first thing we need to do is to recognize our common humanity.  It is so easy and almost inevitable to divide off into little groups, nations, races, regions. And it won't work.  And I think the first thing that every individual needs to do is to recognize his or her creatureliness.  We are close enough to being God to fool ourselves into thinking we are.  I can do it.  I can make it.  I'm my own man.  I don't need anybody.  And even when we don't express it, it's in us somewhere.  I've got my health.  I don't--I can--But you won't have your health forever.  What then?  And to recognize our creatureliness.  Our ultimately our helplessness.  But a helplessness which ought not produce in us inertia.  It is a danger to say, "Well I can't do anything.  I'm helpless."  But we're not helpless.  We're not helpless.  But that not being helpless may fool us into believing that we can do anything.  And we can't.  I think that's one of our human problems.  The Greeks had an idea of hubris, pride.  And the center of their Greek tragedies is that the hero and heroine gets caught in toils and circumstances.  They can see their way out or think they can.  But every effort to free themselves ties them deeper.  And they get caught more and more.  It's the tragedy of human life.  And unless that tragedy is redeemed by some other power, by God, we are in miserable condition.

Speaker 1: When did you receive the award from President [William Jefferson] Clinton?  That was in?
Speaker 2: 2000, I guess.
Speaker 1: 2000.
Speaker 2: And what was this award and when was it?
Speaker 1: It was the--It was the merit certificate.  What is it called?  Huh?  Medal of Freedom.  You're right.  You're right.  Thank you.  The Medal of Freedom.  It is the highest civilian honor.  Now I have not been anything but a preacher.  I've been in these other things.  But interestingly enough, the New York Times had an article about the different people who had received the Medal of Honor [sic].  Mr. [Daniel Jackson Moynihan], Jesse Jackson.  One or two others.  When it came to me, I'm a preacher.  The article said that it was perhaps because Mrs. [Hillary Rodham] Clinton was running for Senate here, which is--I didn't like it.  But it also is a kind of assessment of what America thinks not of me so much, but of what I represent.  Of what I try to do.  Les Payne who writes for Newsday did an editorial about it.  But the things of the spirit are not honored in our society.  I knew that when I started out.  And I've said it over and over again that when I came along, in order to have prominence as a black person, we were not in politics.  You either had to be an entertainer, an athlete or in civil rights.  I was in neither.  I knew.  I couldn't be an athlete because I got old.  And I wasn't in civil rights.  I was a preacher.  And I know, and I still know that that's looked upon it's all right. But you know, it's not that important or it's not--it doesn't claim a lot of public attention.  It is not the way to what we call fame.

Speaker 1: What is the importance of a pastor, a minister today?
Speaker 2: If he is or she is halfway faithful, it is to represent God to people.  I have--I talked with--Johnnie Cochran comes from my native state [Louisiana].  I didn't know him then.  But I have said to him that I wanted to be a lawyer. But I've got a better client.  And I've argued his case through the years.  That's what my job.  To argue the Lord's case.  That's all.

Speaker 1: You mentioned earlier--I think you had a story about Howard Thurman you want to tell.
Speaker 2: Oh, a wonderful story about Howard Thurman.  I don't know this.  It may be apocryphal. Someone is supposed to have asked Thurman, "Is a lie--are you ever justified in telling a lie?" to which he said, "I don't know.  But it can be an ever present help in the time of trouble."  Thurman was the, I think, the most authentic mystic we've ever produced in this country.
Speaker 1: What do you mean by that?
Speaker 2: His apprehension of what life was all about was based upon a sense of our being mysterious beings.  Being joined to what he would call reality to God.  Not by reasoning but by intuition.

Speaker 1: You mentioned earlier that the black church had its faults.
Speaker 2: [simultaneously] Very grave faults.  Very grave faults.
Speaker 1: But it's also the number one institution.
Speaker 2: It has been our only institution.  Completely owned.  Well we have had others.  Our sororities, and fraternities.  But they are our smaller groups.  But the church has cut across all of our classes and groupings.  And it has been the one thing that we've owned in this country.  We haven't owned anything else.  People are Deputy so-and-so, and Second Vice-President.  And now we're getting people, Mr. [Kenneth] Chenault in American Express and people there.  But still black people are not in control except in that place.  That's the only place.  Where nobody can beyond that grouping, that fellowship can determine, can decide, can decree what's gonna happen. Now that's not altogether good because democracy is a dangerous thing.  It's not for fools or children.
Speaker 1: So in light of this what do you--What does the black church have to do that maybe--what's the particular mission I guess of the black church you know, in regards--
Speaker 2: [simultaneously] One thing I think to represent God in this aspect.  That nothing is worked out until it's worked out right.  And I think that's been our insistence through the centuries.  That this whole matter of race in this country will dog this nation in one way or another.  Haunt it, taunt it, and could destroy it.  Because this is of God.  When one looks at the Civil War for instance.  These people were united North and South.  The best brains of the country were trying to hold it together.  [John Caldwell] Calhoun and Henry Clay and Daniel Webster up in Massachusetts.  But there was another voice in this.  And all the economics.  But they said, "No, no.  No freedom, no union."  Missouri Compromise [1820], Kansas Comp [Kansas-Nebraska Act, 1854]--No freedom, no union. God's voice.  And it's sometimes very indistinct.  Sometimes so mixed in with the other things that we can't detect the singularity of that voice.  And I think that's the church's job.  And to enlist people in that purpose.  Now the black church has not been--As I said it's been our U.S. Steel, our Enron also.  It's been corrupt because it's human.  Human beings are self-centered, pretentious, priest-ridden, all of that.  But that's the human contract.

Speaker 1: What do you think your legacy has been?
Speaker 2: My legacy?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And what do you see as the future?
Speaker 2: I think the most gratifying thing of my eighty-third year is young ministers around the country, not all of them but those who say that what I've tried to do and be means something to them.  That's--and I get that again and again.  That is deeply gratifying to me.
Speaker 1: I've heard that they're fascinated with the fact that you don't use notes when you--when you lecture.
Speaker 2: Well yeah.  Of course that's one of those things.  But I hope it's deeper than that.  I hope it's--I haven't done all I should have done.  God knows I haven't.  But I've tried to keep my public integrity.  And I might not have--You know in that National [Baptist] Convention thing I--there were temptations that, you know, "To get along, you go along.  And you got a bright future.  You can--don't hurt yourself."  I heard that over and over again.  "You're killing yourself.  You're killing yourself." And I might have been seduced by that.  And I could've been.  Because I had personal ambitions and whatnot like everybody else.  I might have been seduced by that.  But I thank God that when that hour came--And if you don't make it in that hour, you've got to live with that forever.  When that hour came by God's grace, I stood up.  I'm very thankful for that.  And young pastors out there--and across convention lines, across denominations that--I hope that's my legacy.
Speaker 1: What do you see for the future?  You were saying a little while ago, it's probably a long time before things will get straightened out.
Speaker 2: You mean the country?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh I think so.  And it is a liberal notion of democracy, a liberal notion of theology and what democracy and whatnot that we get over this hump and everything will be all right, but it won't.  Because as long as human beings are around, you're gonna have problems.  And if there are no problems--if there are no apparent problems, they'll create problems.  It's a part of our humanity.

Speaker 1: Is there a difference between a theologian in the traditional sense and black theologian in your own mind?
Speaker 2: Yes.  The difference is in the angle of vision.  Everyone brings to his or her theology seeing or her seeing of God his own or her own experience.  The black experience in this country has been different.  And when I was younger, the great theological consideration among black people, those who were thinking people, our leaders, how to explain the horrors through which we had passed?  What was the meaning of it?  Is there a God anywhere?  And if so, how could these things happen?  And early on in my youth, there were still people very thoughtful people, who thought that we were put through all of this in order to redeem Africa.  So the missionary enterprise.  Then that faded.  Then the idea was education.  That we could educate.  Build schools.  And when public authority was indifferent and even hostile toward education, churches of different denominations built their little schools here and yonder.  I knew them in my childhood.  I saw them.  Built their little schools.  Education. Then, of course, the question of our civil rights.  Rights of human beings.  What in this time and what in the next fifty years will be our outlook, our theological outlook? I don't know.  I think it maybe to rescue ourselves from this me-ism.  This self-centeredness that one sees on television.  And which is very popular.  Because these things are seductive.  And it's prosperity.  "I can get it."  And all that kind of stuff.

Speaker 1: Of the mega churches that are developing, what are your thoughts about that?  You know, except you with your church actually developed, you know, a lot of programs, a lot of ministries. You're almost a predecessor for what we see as these mega churches.
Speaker 2: But in our--in my instance and in the instance of you say like mine, it was not personality-centered.  These things are long coated people now.  And with a little smattering of religious, the Gospel, but all about me.  In my time it was about 'us.'  It's not to say that 'me' was not considered. But it was a group purpose.  Now it's--And it's gaudy jewelry.  All that stuff.

Speaker 1: Do you--what do you think he [his father, Washington Monroe Taylor] would think if he saw you now?
Speaker 2: I think he'd feel very good.  And sometimes I think he does.  Yeah.  I think he does.  We have never--And thank God. We have never been able to understand the mystery that lies beyond the veil of this life.  But it is interesting that wherever people have lived, they have some how believed--somebody calls it wish-fulfillment, whatever.  But somewhere how they have believed that this is not the end of us.  And if it is, and I have said publicly, that God is the most wasteful being imaginable.  That all of the dreams and hopes could be that he puts into human being, all to be snuffed out in seventy, eighty, ninety years.  That's wasteful.  It doesn't make sense.  And when you see spring come again, it looks like everything dies.  Then the little green sprout springs up life. Life is stronger than death.  It is.
Story_ID: 13896
Speaker 1: Are there any works by--What theological works would you recommend to students of theology?
Speaker 2: Well, Paul Tillich.  Tillich is a little dated now I guess.  I frankly don't know who is the--Well the people I'd recommend Ryan Oneiborn [unclear] and Paul Tillich.  But they belong to another twenty-five years ago.  The people who are writing now--Cornell West is doing tremendous work.  No question about it.  And I greatly admire the work he is doing.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite passage sir?  A Biblical passage?
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: What is that?
Speaker 2: "That God so loved the world that he gave--" And I think if you take that passage, 'so' means 'extent.'  "So loved."  And, of course, there's no word in all any language stronger than the word love.  Even his basest forms. When its highest forms, it stands alone.  The world.  That means the whole creation that he gave.  And that's the secret of life.  Of giving not getting.  Yeah.  I think that's my favorite passage.
