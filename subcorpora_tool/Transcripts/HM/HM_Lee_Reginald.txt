Speaker 1: Before we go into depth there are five lightweight questions we always ask as sort of a warm up and they only require a short answer.  The first question is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, do you know what it is though (laughter)?
Speaker 1: No, (laughter) what is it?
Speaker 2: Gumbo.
Speaker 1: Right that makes sense, all right gumbo.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, blue.
Speaker 1: A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Fall.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: That's a tough--Paris [France].
Speaker 1: And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: A favorite phrase or saying.  I have a favorite quote that I stole from someone else, it's: the two most important days of your life are the day you're born and the day you understand why.
Story_ID: 641760
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Tommie Lee] side and then we'll bring them together.  But we'll ask about them separately so we don't get them mixed up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Eva Elnora Jefferson Lee [Eva Jefferson Lee].
Speaker 1: Okay. Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, E-V-A, E-L-N-O-R-A, J-E-F-F-E-R-S-O-N, L-E-E.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: November 2nd, 1923 in Wharton, Texas, which is Wharton like the business school [Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], W-H-A-R-T-O-N, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Outside of Houston, Texas.
Speaker 1: What can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing and what are the stories?
Speaker 2: Well we can trace my mother's family at least as far back as her grandparents, and her grandmother, Susan Jefferson, was born in 1862 in Louisiana as a slave, freed at the age of three.  At some point was married, moved to Wharton, Texas and in 1899 she and her husband [James Jefferson] purchased land in Wharton, Texas that still remains in the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we have a whole family tree in the Bible that, in the family Bible, that gives names of the various relatives starting with Susan Jefferson.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're only three generations, as you count them, out of emancipation?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's interesting 'cause a lot of people think it was so long ago, it was a long time ago but it's only three generations.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay so any stories on that side of the family about emancipation itself 'cause she was a little girl, I guess three years old, when war was over, the Civil War.
Speaker 2: Exactly, not a whole lot of stories.  On my mother's side most of the stories came from my grandparents, my mother's parents, not from their parents per se.  My grandfather owned little country stores, little neighborhood stores.  They were pretty enterprising people, my aunts and uncles were enterprising.  I had an aunt who was a model once who was very, very fair and at some point passed for white.  I have another uncle who was an accomplished business person which was sort of all sorts of business very entrepreneurial.  So that family was an enterprising family, very proud, very family oriented but also very private.
Speaker 1: Okay. And they lived basically in Wharton.
Speaker 2: Lived in Wharton but when my mother was a very young child they moved to Houston.  So she did not spend many years in Wharton, but she was born in Wharton.
Speaker 1: So you're sure there are no other stories from that side that you could share with us?
Speaker 2: We had a very colorful aunt, one of my mother's sisters who supposedly was married, she thought she was married, she told us that she was married eighteen times and my parents could attest to thirteen of those.  So she was a very forward thinking woman who had some husbands who died mysteriously, others who she when she married them they were in jail, and all these stories that you aren't supposed to tell about the family but she was clearly the most colorful.
Speaker 1: Okay. she's not in jeopardy now I guess.  Okay, married eighteen times, was there an army base nearby (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Perhaps, perhaps she was, I mean these were just stories that we heard and it was interesting because we thought they were just made up but my parents confirmed.  They went through their memory and they could name thirteen of her various husbands.  I remember even when I was in college she would marry so often that when I was doing my annual Christmas cards, I'd have to call my parents and say what's her last name now.  She had many different husbands, and, husbands (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It might be interesting for someone to look up one day.
Speaker 2: Well, her name was Wilhelmina [ph.] but she changed it to Willie Mae and her nickname was Moot [ph.].  So she was Aunt Moot to us.
Speaker 1: That's an interesting story.  I would suspect at some point writers, you know, if they're not doing it already are going to look at this collection for inspiration to write.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know.  So all these stories you can't make them up because they're stories--they are real stories (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know.  It's interesting, things that you kind of forget until someone asks you the question.
Story_ID: 641761
Speaker 1: How old was she when they moved from Wharton [Texas] to Houston [Texas]?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to remember, I know she was a child.  She was probably eight or nine years old, pretty young.  She was the youngest child so my aunts and uncles are older than her, grew up more in Wharton than she did.
Speaker 1: So now, did your mother [Eva Jefferson Lee] have a chance to finish school in Houston?
Speaker 2: Yes, she finished high school in Houston.
Speaker 1: Which one did she go to?
Speaker 2: She went to Phillis Wheatley High School.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. I know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Both she and my father [Tommie Lee] graduated from Phillis Wheatley.
Speaker 1: Okay now did your mother ever share with you any stories of growing up, about what race relations were like there or what the community was like?
Speaker 2: It was interesting because my mother had such a shielded life growing up that if you ask her about the Depression [Great Depression], she couldn't really tell you about the Depression as the Depression.  Her brothers and sisters cared for her.  She always dressed nicely, she was the baby, and she was a beautiful woman and a beautiful child evidently.  So she was spoiled.  So her memories of growing up were always quite wonderful, always getting gifts, always dressing well, doing well in school just a very good childhood.
Speaker 1: Did she share with you what she wanted to be when she grew, an aspiration that she wanted to achieve whether she did or not, did she have something in her mind?
Speaker 2: Her biggest aspiration always was to be a wonderful mother and wife.  That's what she aspired to do and I think she was.
Speaker 1: So she didn't want to go any further than high school?  She had no plans?
Speaker 2: Not that she talked about, I mean it was difficult in those days as you could imagine.  But, to hear her talk about her life and her aspirations, she never talked about things she would have liked to have done that she didn't get to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In her life, she lived through her family and through her children and of course she was very proud of her children and the many things we did and she joined in those experiences.
Speaker 1: Okay now did she come from a large family herself?
Speaker 2: She had five brothers and sisters.  So for Texas that's not so large.
Story_ID: 641762
Speaker 1: Now we'll go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Tommie Lee: T-O-M-M-I-E, L-E-E.
Speaker 1: No middle name?
Speaker 2: No middle name.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: July 1, 1924 in Waelder, Texas, which is W-A-E-L-D-E-R, Texas, which is a town not too far from San Antonio [Texas].
Speaker 1: Now what can you tell us about your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: My father had a very different upbringing than my mother.  He was in a family where they struggled to some extent, he has the typical story of shining shoes on the corner at the age of ten to make money to buy food for the family.  His father, my grandfather was an entrepreneur as well but wasn't always most the responsible caregiver in the family.  He was entrepreneurial, he owned a cafe at one point, and he owned a taxi limousine service.  Every year he had a brand new Cadillac but he spent his money in those ways and so there were times when my father had to really, being the oldest of three children, had to care for the family and provide food and that sort of thing. So they never starved but they did have some tough times and he had to step in and be the breadwinner.
Speaker 1: So your father was the oldest?
Speaker 2: He was the oldest of three.
Speaker 1: Okay. What was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Hilda [Hilda Lee].
Speaker 1: H-I-L--
Speaker 2: H-I-L-D-A, no middle name, last name Lee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandmother, my father's mother, Annie Mae Lee [Annie Harris Lee], M-A, A-N-N-I-E, M-A-E, Lee was a hardworking woman, very religious and eventually became a minister and founded a dozen Pentecostal Holiness churches [International Pentecostal Holiness Church] all over Texas.  A very interesting mix in the family, and eventually my grandfather converted to become religious and responsible and those sorts of things.
Speaker 1: Okay. So he changed his behavior?
Speaker 2: He changed his behavior.  He was never a bad person he was just a free spirit and liked to have a good time, liked to spend money and dress well and drive in a nice car and therefore his priorities were not always in the place where one would think they should have been.  But as he got older that shifted and certainly when they became really religious he became sort of her second hand in the churches, and in helping to create those churches and grow them.
Speaker 1: Now what denomination was your grandmother?
Speaker 2: As I remember she was Methodist initially but then when she converted she was as I said Holiness Pentecostal.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. So, now, I take it your father at some point before he graduated from high school got to Houston [Texas], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, so he was born in Waelder but also at an early age moved to Houston.  I could research the actual times, but they both grew up in Houston and went to the same high school eventually, that's how they met.
Speaker 1: So your grandfather and grandmother moved to Houston with your, along with your father, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  All right. So, your (unclear)--and, and they, your, both your mother and father came out of Phillis Wheatley
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: High School [Houston, Texas].
Story_ID: 641763
Speaker 1: Did your father [Tommie Lee] serve in the war [World War II, WWII]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was in the [U.S.] Air Force, served for three or four years.  As a matter of fact, my parents were married, you know, weeks or months before he was, was shipped off. And, I say shipped off, he never went overseas, he was stationed in various places in the states and my mother [Eva Jefferson Lee] for the most part followed him to where he was.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now did he have any stories about the war, about service, I know that was a segregated army then?
Speaker 2: Not many stories about the war.  He certainly talked about his childhood and having to shine shoes and that sort of thing and may have mentioned once or twice something in the war but not a lot about that.
Speaker 1: Okay. What did he say about growing up?  You said he had it rough; he had to take care of his family for the most part sometimes when times got rough. But he had, did he have any stories about what it was like?
Speaker 2: Not so much himself but they certainly told stories about some of the challenges in our family.  His grandfather was shot by a bunch of white men who, my, his grandfather saw them stealing a horse and just the fact that a black man would witness them stealing something, they shot him.  So my grandfather, by grandfather's, my father's grandfather rather was returned back home over the back of the horse.  The horse sort of found its way back home and there he was shot and eventually found out what the story was.  So stories like that they would tell us to sort of punctuate the challenges that one could have in life and how in spite of that one has to rise above it.
Speaker 1: Your dad's grandfather, that would place him like somewhere in the 1870s, '80s [1880s] or something.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So it was wild west time in Houston [Texas].  Now anything else from that side?  That had to be a devastating blow in the family (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah it was.
Speaker 1: --agricultural kind of, I imagine they lived in an agricultural community where you need a man to do the work.
Speaker 2: Right so the grandmother had to fend for herself, of course had the family around her to help but it's not the same when you don't have you know a husband to provide for you.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, so your father was only in Air Force during the war, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, just during the war.
Speaker 1: Now did he learn some kind of a skill in the Air Force?
Speaker 2: He was a mechanic on the airplanes and came back to Houston wanting to continue to be a mechanic and I would think mo- mainly for racial reasons could not get that type of job.  So the first job he was able to get was actually loading and unloading furniture from a truck for like a furniture company.  Eventually he went to work for the government in the postal service and retired from that after thirty years or so.
Speaker 1: So he was a veteran so he was able to get a job with the U.S. Postal Service [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service].
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So he was a mail carrier?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. Which in those days and even, well today even is a good job (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --for a lot of people.  You had benefits and, you know, some kind of guarantee.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Story_ID: 641764
Speaker 1: Now, when, when you consider your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their habits, their hobbies, talents, looks, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I think I'm pretty much a mixture of, of my two parents.  My father [Tommie Lee] was very loving of his family, very giving and a caregiver in general to all people he met, a jovial person, joked a lot, fun loving, you know.  My mother [Eva Jefferson Lee] was the serious person, studious, always wanted to be very professional and so I think I, I have a little of both of those, more so than my sisters.  My sisters have a tendency to be more like one or the other; but I'm, I think I'm a pretty decent mixture of the two.
Story_ID: 641765
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you have like two sisters, is that it?
Speaker 2: I have four--I had four (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Four, four.
Speaker 2: --older sisters, we lost one four years ago to cancer, but, so I have three living sisters now, but I have four sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. Can, can you name them and tell us a little about them?
Speaker 2: Yes, so my oldest sister, Carolyn Ann Lee Conner [Carolyn Lee Conner], C-O-N-N-E-R, her married name.  She is a retired school teacher and administrator and taught for thirty, thirty-five years, American history, went to Texas Woman's University to college for a year and then went to Texas Southern University in Houston [Texas].  Texas Woman's University is in Denton, Texas near Dallas [Texas] and Texas Southern University is in Houston.  She graduated from there and got her master's and actually started on her Ph.D., I don't think she ever finished the Ph.D.  But she is a very prim, proper type person that's how she takes after my mother [Eva Jefferson Lee].  Very dedicated to education and children, was a really good teacher, was teacher of the year just about every year and students loved her, just a really delightful person and a religious person as well.  My second oldest sister, Eva Elnora Lee Watkins [Eva Lee Watkins], so the Eva Elnora was from my mother and the Watkins was her married name and she's the sister that deceased now.  She went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and then met her husband when she was a junior at Howard and got married.  She finished off at Howard, they moved to Houston, went to the University of Houston [Houston, Texas] and got her master's degree in history and was a teacher for a while and eventually was a college professor and then eventually was an administrator--hospital administrator with MD Anderson cancer hospital in Houston [University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center].  My third oldest sister, Tommye Jean Lee Szafarz [Tommye Lee Szafarz], and that's T-O-M-M-Y-E, my father's name was T-O-M-M-I-E [Tommie Lee], so since she was a girl they put the Y in there to soften it and her last name S-Z-A, F as in Frank, A-R-Z, which is a Polish name, her husband [Mark Szafarz] is Polish.  She went to Ohio Wesleyan University [Delaware, Ohio] that's where she met her husband and I think they were married after graduated.  I think they waited until they graduated to get married and then went on to Duke University [Durham, North Carolina] to pursue a Ph.D.  Eventually had a child, didn't finish the Ph.D., she and her husband moved back to Houston and her husband is a psychiatrist and she basically was an entrepreneur.  She created a word processing business doing medical transcriptions from doctors and things and now she's retired.  My, my, all of my sisters are retired at this point.  Then my youngest sister, Anita Lee, named after an aunt, my father's sister whose name is Anita, no middle name.  She went to Ohio Wesleyan following my third oldest sister, graduated, came back to Houston and went to the University of Houston and got a master's in mathematics.  Eventually was married and then was divorced and now she's retired after thirty some years of teaching, teaching math and Spanish.  I don't know if you want to know about nieces and nephews or?
Speaker 1: Well we don't need to get, get, go that deep into it not necessarily right now.  But you have an accomplished set of siblings here.  All of your sisters have done a lot, two are history teachers.
Speaker 2: At some point all of them taught something and that was actually a challenge for me growing up because my sisters were all very smart, they were all valedictorians in high school and so teachers would say, "Oh you're Anita's brother," "oh you're Carolyn's brother," or, "are you smart too?" And then of course the sexist people amongst us would say, "You're not going to let those girls beat you are you?  You have to do better than those girls."  So I had a fair amount of pressure not to the negative, but it was a challenge for me.  It didn't intimidate me or anger me but I did have that sort of competitive nudge going on because it was an accomplished set of sisters that I have.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. So when you were growing up I guess you couldn't get away with too too much with four sisters.
Speaker 2: Exactly. Well I'd tell people I had five mothers so, and I really did 'cause my youngest sister is still four or five years older than me so even she tried to play mother at some point.
Story_ID: 641766
Speaker 1: We always ask this question: do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I think one of my earliest childhood memories would be when I was, at least when I was four and we took a family trip to--a summer vacation trip to California.  We called in our station wagon and drove from Houston [Texas] to San Francisco [California] where my Aunt Eva, who my mother's named after, lived.  I remember the stop in El Paso [Texas] and seeing different things.  I remember the Golden Gate Bridge; I remember the record that my great aunt gave me, 'I Left my Heart in San Francisco,' which is my favorite song for the longest time.  So those I have vivid memories of when I was four years old.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, did you grow up in the same house or the same neighborhood?
Speaker 2: I grew up in the same house.  My parents [Eva Jefferson Lee and Tommie Lee] moved in that house I think a couple of years before I was born and we lived in that house until I went to college and even afterwards when I was in college my parents stayed there and eventually when I moved back to Houston in, what year would that have been, 1980? Nineteen eighty [1980], I purchased a house for them that they moved into.  And the house that I grew up in now my niece, my oldest sister's [Carolyn Lee Conner] daughter lives in.  So the house is still in the family.
Speaker 1: Where was it and can you describe it for us?
Speaker 2: It was in South Houston [Texas].  People know of Southwest Houston [Houston, Texas] because that's where The Galleria is and people know Southeast Houston [Houston, Texas] but this is in due South Houston, south of the Astrodome [NRG Astrodome, Houston, Texas] which is a landmark.  And it was an African American neighborhood, sort of middle class.  Most of the people were, people who lived there were postmen, teachers, nurses those sort of professions which in those days were decent professions.  Most of the houses were two or three bedrooms houses.  It was a ranch style house.  We had three bedrooms, one bathroom which was interesting, living room and dining room and a garage and a decent front yard and backyard.  So it was a typical sort of neighborhood.
Speaker 1: What ward was in?
Speaker 2: No wards, it wasn't in a ward.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The area was called--the area was actually called Reedswood [Houston, Texas].  Reedswood was part of a larger community called Blue Ridge [Houston, Texas] and actually the church I went to was Blueridge United Methodist Church [Houston, Texas].  But Blue Ridge is right next to Sunnyside [Houston, Texas] so most people know the wards and then there was Sunnyside.  So if people aren't as familiar with Reedswood or Blue Ridge, I would say Sunnyside but basically we grew up Reedswood.
Story_ID: 641767
Speaker 1: We always ask this question this way: tell us about growing up, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds. You know, the--Texas is a green, very green state and there was no real downtown living in Houston [Texas], so everything was the suburb.  So I grew up in what one could call a suburb.  We had as I said a front yard, backyard.  There were always trees and flowers and my mother [Eva Jefferson Lee] was a pretty good cook.  There was always a good smell of food in the house.  My mother was very, very clean and believed in perfumes.  There was always a nice smell in the house, freshness.  In the springtime we would open the windows, do the spring cleaning, and let the fresh air into the house.  So it was a real pleasant memory of the smells and the sights and birds in the morning.  You'd wake up and the frogs at night when you'd go to bed. So it was almost living in the country but not quite.
Speaker 1: What did you like to do when you were a little kid growing up?  What were your favorite activities?
Speaker 2: I was a pretty studious child, I liked to read, I liked, you know, school work, I enjoyed that and when I got to the age where I could do things beyond just school work, I was very involved in extracurricular things in school, especially academic things.  So I was a member of the debate team, I was a member of the theater arts forensic society, I was a member of the number sense math club and the chess club, I sang in the choir both at church [Blueridge United Methodist Church, Houston, Texas] and at school.  So I was really involved in, in things like that and that filled all my time.
Story_ID: 641768
Speaker 1: Well tell us, I mean, tell me about school, where, where did you start school?
Speaker 2: So elementary school was James R. Reynolds Elementary School [Houston, Texas] which was half a mile from my house, not very far.  I always did well in school so I had the advantage of being liked by the teachers because I was well behaved and I did well in school and I had a legacy of my sisters who, we all went to the same school.  So by the time I came along the teachers were familiar with me or at least my family.  My mother was very active in the Parents Teachers Association [sic. Parent Teacher Association] so they saw her a lot and my mother was always well dressed and very professional looking and so there were times when she would come.  I'll never forget once in elementary school she came to school to bring me something I had left, lunch or a book or something and evidently our teacher was absent that day and they were waiting for a substitute teacher to come.  So she walked in and they said we're so glad that you're here and they started, she said, "Oh no I'm not the substitute teacher," but she had that kind of look and that sort of presence so elementary school was great, I enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: So you started elementary school in 1962, I guess it was.  Did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: I always liked the math and science things, math in particular.
Speaker 1: Okay. So elementary school did you have a favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: Probably my kindergarten teacher, Ms. Theresa Terry [ph.], I still remember her.  She was sort of fair skin with freckles and red hair and I just, I never had the, "I don't want to go to school, I'm afraid," crying.  The minute I saw Ms. Terry I was just so comfortable, she was a sweet person, a good disciplinarian as well but still a sweet person.  So probably Ms. Terry, Ms. Theresa Terry was my favorite in elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Now, was there a, did you get a lot of literature in your house, magazines, books and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: A lot of books, I was required every summer to read a number of books by my mother and my sister read and I got books passed down to me from my sisters as well.  We read the encyclopedia; we were readers, big readers in the house, not so much magazines.
Speaker 1: Okay, but a lot of books.
Speaker 2: My parents [Eva Jefferson Lee and Tommie Lee] were very careful about things that we saw, so you know magazines may have who knows what in them so they were censoring the things that we saw.  We couldn't watch television all the time, there were only certain things we could watch and later I'll tell my 'Star Trek' story, but that was one of the few television shows we were, you know, allowed to watch.
Story_ID: 641769
Speaker 1: We're talking about television now, now did you, growing up as a, at elementary age did you have a favorite TV show?
Speaker 2: Probably things like 'Captain Kangaroo,' there was a similar program in Houston [Texas] called 'Kitirik' on Channel 13, KTRK [KTRK-TV, Houston, Texas] was the station and it was one of those little kitty shows and she was the cat with the ears and the, you know, little costume on.  I have memories of things that were like that but not much more than that.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. So most of your associations when you come back from school [James R. Reynolds Elementary School, Houston, Texas], you're there in a suburban neighborhood.  You had friends, I guess, that would play (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, it was homework first, get the homework done, and then I could go and play with the kids but as I said my parents were quite strict, and I couldn't go further than my mother [Eva Jefferson Lee] could see me if she stood at the front of the house.  So we couldn't go into other people's houses, I couldn't go too far down the street and she would have been happy if my sisters and I just played together, we didn't play with anybody else.  She was very sort of, insular like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what about church was that very important?
Speaker 2: Very important, I grew up in Blueridge United Methodist Church [Houston, Texas] and to this day when I go to Houston that's the church I visit and all my life I grew up in that church always.  My mother was quite active, she was one of the stewardess sisters that served the communion on Sunday, and a member of the United Methodist Women and eventually she was the president of the usher board and the United Methodist Women and stewardesses with all these various organizations she was president at some point.  My father [Tommie Lee] was not unlike my grandfather [Hilda Lee]--his father initially, not that into church, but eventually he became very involved in the church and was eventually the treasurer of the church and actually helped drive the building of our new church.  We moved from a small church in the neighborhood to a much bigger church further down the street.  So they were both, you know, very big in the church.
Speaker 1: Who was the pastor when you were coming along?
Speaker 2: Well we had, I was United Methodist, I'm United Methodist, and Methodists every year have an opportunity to have a new minister.  We do our annual conference and unlike other churches, we don't keep people forever.  So we had many, many ministers.  I remember Reverend Huey [Hilton Huey] was the minister I think when I was born and first, early on, Reverend Albuddy [ph.], Reverend Williams [Homer D. Williams], Reverend Graves [Rodney L. Graves] currently we have a woman minister, Reverend Wanda Bess.  So we've had many, many ministers, Reverend Larkin [ph.], I can go through the list.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So you sang in the choir and you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I sang in the choir and I eventually directed the youth choir at my church and in college, when we get to that, I eventually directed the gospel choir at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, did you play an instrument?
Speaker 2: No instruments.  We grew up with a piano in the house and most of my sisters learned to play the piano, I just never did.  It's one of the things on my bucket list that at some point I'm going to take piano lessons and learn how to play.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now did you all go to summer camp and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No we stayed at home, my mother believed in that.  We took vacations together but we never really did, now we had vacation bible school in church and so we did that but other than that we didn't really do summer camp.  My mother was not big on having us away from home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember we went to spend one weekend with an aunt, her sister, on a Friday for the weekend and two hours later my mother came and said she changed her mind and brought us back.  She--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --she loved her children; she, you know, couldn't imagine being without them or entrusting them to others for extended periods, so.
Story_ID: 641770
Speaker 1: Yeah she seems very protective.
Speaker 2: She was very protective.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very protective. Which I think I'm fortunate that it has not had a bad impact on me, because sometimes overly protective parents can have a bad impact on you, but.
Speaker 1: Now did you have friends come over and play and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: They could come and play, people were not allowed in the house and sleepovers, we didn't do that.  I think one of my neighbors once slept over once and once I slept over at their house, I mean right next door neighbors.  But where some people say, "Oh kids they are in and out of the house all the time," my mother didn't believe in that not in her house or us in other people's house.
Speaker 1: Do you have any idea why, did she have, was there ever any clue in her upbringing that, she was just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No because I wondered if there was some bad experience that happened or something and perhaps there was but we never learned it.  It was just her being, that's the way she was.  She was very family, but close family, to that point that when just the immediate family, she, my father and my sisters and I were doing things together, others were not really invited.  Her sister who she loved was not invited for Christmas.  We would open our gifts Christmas Eve at midnight as a family and people would like to come over, she was like no no, just the family.  Eventually as we got older she let some of the aunts and uncles come but for the most part she was happy with just the immediate family, very protective, very insular.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Now you're talking about family trips, would you take family vacations together?
Speaker 2: The only vacation I really remember us taking was that trip to California--a real vacation like that.  Now we would go to Galveston [Texas], to the beach or go out to Wharton [Texas] to the country to visit an aunt or something like that but like some people take these trips two or three days a week away, I don't recall us doing that (clears throat).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My parents were not social people in that way.  They were social with respect to church, and that's about it.
Story_ID: 641771
Speaker 1: So as you were progressing in grade school, now did you have a middle school, or--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--a junior high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went to junior high school, Carter G. Woodson Junior High School [Woodson PK-8 School, Houston, Texas].  Actually, actually, now that I recall, for the seventh grade, which was the beginning of junior high school, I went to Crispus Attucks Junior High School [Crispus Attucks Middle School, Houston, Texas] because that's the high school, junior high school rather, my sisters had gone to and my mother [Eva Jefferson Lee] was intent on me going to the schools they had gone to.  At the end of my seventh grade year was when they did all the sort of bussing in Texas where you were assigned to the school that was near where you lived.  Carter G. Woodson was closer to me than Crispus Attucks so eighth and ninth grade, I went to Carter G. Woodson and graduated junior high school at Carter G. Woodson.  That was a little bit of a transition for me to go first from elementary school [James R. Reynolds Elementary School, Houston, Texas] and to leave people I had gone to elementary school, most of whom went to Woodson, and for me to go to Attucks and to develop new friends and that sort of thing.  But it was good growth for me and then to end up back at Woodson anyway, back with the people I had been with but a year had passed when we were in school together.  So some of those transitions were thing I learned to be comfortable with and actually learn from and enjoy.
Speaker 1: Okay. So taking by the name of these schools these are both black--predominantly black schools.
Speaker 2: Yes, I went to all black schools.
Speaker 1: The teachers were mostly black in these schools?
Speaker 2: Teachers were mostly black until when I was in the eighth grade and was transferred at the same issue of bussing and desegregation that caused me to have to go to the school nearest me; they mixed up the teachers as well.  So my first real experience with white teachers was in junior high school and some wonderful white teachers.  We were really lucky to get some teacher who was very interested in teaching us that didn't have an attitude or condescension or any of that sort of thing.  They were just there to do their jobs.
Speaker 1: Okay considering that you went into engineering, did you like to take things apart or put things together as a child?
Speaker 2: I liked puzzles so I was an engineer, I thought like an engineer not in a mechanical way but in a sort of theoretical mathematical way.  So I loved puzzles and games and word games and think, crossword puzzles, I liked that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: But you never like took the radio a part or anything?
Speaker 2: No I was not, I never did that.
Speaker 1: Did you ever help your father [Tommie Lee] like build something or, or fix a car?
Speaker 2: I was, well he wanted me to, I was not very good at stuff like that, and not very interested; and I didn't want to really do things with my hands, I wanted to do things with my mind.
Story_ID: 641772
Speaker 1: Now did you, could you perceive that as a, as a distinction of status at that time--
Speaker 2: No I don't, I don't think so, well perhaps (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) when you were coming along, or did it, was it just an expression of personality?
Speaker 2: I, I think it was an expression of personality but some of it in the back of my mind may have been a notion of what I should be doing versus what I shouldn't be doing.  One other thing I remember about my trip to San Francisco [California] when I was five years old was our Aunt Eva, who my mother [Eva Jefferson Lee] was named after, was indeed a very prestigious, well educated, prominent type of person.  I couldn't tell you what she did for a living but you could just tell by the way she dressed and spoke that she was a prominent person.  I'll never forget there was a street cleaner in front of her house and I may have gone to grab the broom and she had a fit, "Oh no, no, no, no, you can't do that, you won't, you'll never be cleaning up, you'll never be doing anythings like that."  So that sort of shocked me but it also made me think, "Oh I don't want to do things like that."  But I think that my lack of interest in doing mechanical things was just a lack of interest, I don't think it had much more attached to it than that.
Speaker 1: Now considering the academic success of your entire family and your sisters are much older than you.  This has been going--by the time you came along this had been going on a long time, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This message of education and actually I would suppose the system of insuring that children got their homework and got--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --and did all of that was well established I imagine.
Speaker 2: Exactly. And that's why some people say, "Oh you're so accomplished and you should feel proud of that," I kind of felt like it was expected.  You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth, you eat your breakfast, you go to school, and you do your homework.  It was just part of life so it's not as though I felt I was doing anything exceptional, I was doing what you're supposed to do.  It was a rhythm that we were all in and I loved school so it wasn't much of a battle.
Speaker 1: So you didn't have to overcome any handicaps to do those kind of things 'cause it was part of a cultural pattern already established (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: So, did your mother have any particular, or father [Tommie Lee], have any particular message that she, that they would regularly give you all to, that you know of?
Speaker 2: Nothing in particular. I mean there was the general theme of achieving and having dignity and realizing that you represent more than yourself.  You represent your family, you represent your race and there is an obligation you always have to behave a certain way and to set a certain image, and at the end of the day all that you have are your reputation and your image, so that's something that you have to really protect and nurture and keep in the right place.  That was the general sort of theme for them but I don't remember any particular phrases or words that were said to us.
Speaker 1: That's signi- that's significant enough.  There are plenty of families that don't have that kind of instruction--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: As you might imagine (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah I can imagine.  My mother was so anal about it that it's seldom that you would find a picture of her smiling because she felt that we should always look serious and dignified and she would say things like, you know, "Black people smile too much," and, you know, "What are we smiling about, what's so funny," you know. "We need to be more serious.  If you want to be treated seriously, you have to, you know, behave seriously."  So she was really into that.
Story_ID: 641773
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Eva Jefferson Lee and Tommie Lee] discuss the Civil Rights Movement much when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Not much but certainly like most people, you know, I remember I was in first grade when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was shot--no John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was shot and I remember Ms. Willis [ph.], who was my first grade teacher [at James R. Reynolds Elementary School, Houston, Texas], who was a beautiful woman, she was very pretty, a black woman.  I guess they announced that he had been shot and she came into the classroom crying and we all started crying because we didn't know what was going on and all of a sudden there was this hub bub announcements and parents were coming and taking us home and all of that.  So I remember that, I remember Martin Luther King when he was shot and us being in the living room watching the television where they were showing, you know, things that had happened and my parents talking about the struggles that black people went through and being interested in us knowing the history of Martin Luther King, Frederick Douglass, you know, Rosa Parks all of those people.  So there was a desire for us to be fully understanding of our heritage and where we came from.
Speaker 1: So when Dr. King was killed you were at the beginning of high school [Evan E. Worthing High School, Houston, Texas] is that about right or were you still in grade school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I was still in grade school.
Speaker 1: In '68 [1968], yeah that's right okay.  You'd have been, yeah, okay, right, right--
Speaker 2: Eleven, so that was about sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Okay so, so, did you see the March on Washington?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep, but you know it's interesting because my family wasn't, and I don't think in Houston [Texas] there was much of that at all.  We weren't the type that marched or anything like that.  I don't remember my mother ever doing that, organizing anything.  I mean it was church sort of things that were important but other sort of--they were not civil rights activists or heavily involved in things like that.
Speaker 1: So they weren't members of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or anything?
Speaker 2: Not to my knowledge--actually not to my knowledge.  Interestingly enough my oldest sister, Carolyn [Carolyn Lee Conner], was a Black Panther [Black Panther Party]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and if you saw her now you wouldn't believe it because she looks like a, you know, retired school teacher, quiet, soft and she was that type of person, I guess she had her rebellious moments with her [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis Afro and all of that.
Speaker 1: Okay so she was a Black Panther in Houston or?
Speaker 2: Yeah in Houston.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When she was in college.
Speaker 1: At Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] or?
Speaker 2: Texas Southern, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 641774
Speaker 1: So in middle school, okay, so, so you had, your grades were, were good I would assume in middle school and high--I mean in both the junior high schools, right?
Speaker 2: Yep, yep. I--believe it or not I made all As all through school from kindergarten through high school.
Speaker 1: That's hard to believe but it's, I believe you, all As.
Speaker 2: All As.
Speaker 1: Okay K through twelve [twelfth grade].
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: That's a good record.
Speaker 2: Well, it may have been a comment on the schools as well.
Speaker 1: Did you have a rival in school for getting all, you know--
Speaker 2: There were other kids--five or six of us that were a little competitive but none other made all As all the way through.
Speaker 1: So you were number one.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: All the way through.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Now is there a lot of, did you take pride in being number one?
Speaker 2: I did but not--I was not a boastful person.  I learned at an early age, growing up in a house with four older sisters, how to negotiate getting things done, right and not being put upon all of the time.  I learned early on how to make others feel comfortable with themselves and how not to make them feel uncomfortable.  So it was better for me to be self deprecating at times and joking and that sort of thing so that you wouldn't think that I thought I was--we still had some people that thought I thought that I was all of that but I worked very hard from an early age to always make people feel comfortable around me.
Speaker 1: Yeah you know they say now that, you keep hearing this, I've, you know you hear different things in the black community about you know, if a kid is smart they say he is acting like a white kid all that sort of thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: Did you get any kind of?
Speaker 2: I got a little of that in high school [Evan E. Worthing High School, Houston, Texas] but not a whole lot.  I was always lucky enough to have others around me that were very protective.  All my life I've had these people around me beyond my mother [Eva Jefferson Lee] that were very protective of me, and I tell the story I never was in a fight ever, never been in a fight ever.  My sisters and I weren't allowed to hit each other and I was never, so I've never been struck really by anybody and there was one time in junior high school where someone, you know, started this sort of argument with me as if they were going to fight me and another friend fought them instead.  So I've never, I've never had to fight in that way.
Story_ID: 641775
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now did you take on leadership roles in--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) I know you were a leader in the choir at church [Blueridge United Methodist Church, Houston, Texas] and all that, now in school did you become class president--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I did.
Speaker 1: --and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's funny 'cause even--and I had forgotten about this, my sisters reminded me.  When I was in elementary school [James R. Reynolds Elementary School, Houston, Texas], in elementary school and maybe in junior high school, but certainly elementary school, in the neighborhood I would organize the kids in the neighborhood and we would get together and sell snow cones and take the money and then buy candy and have a little party or we would make, I know in vacation bible school we learned how to make these little things out of popsicle sticks.  You glued them together and make little ashtrays and little things and paint them.  We did that and then we'd go around the neighborhood and sell that.  So I've always been sort of an organizer and enterprising in that way.  I completely had forgotten that I had done that.  So, and one of my neighbors used to call me--one of the adult neighbors used to call me Captain Reggie [HistoryMaker Reginald Van Lee] because I was like the captain of all the kids in doing things like that.  Eventually when I got to school, I was editor of my yearbook.  I was president of my junior class [at Evan E. Worthing High School, Houston, Texas]; I was, you know, I took on roles like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were president of the junior class?
Speaker 2: I was president of my junior class and then editor of my yearbook my senior year.
Speaker 1: Now did you want to be president in your senior year as well?
Speaker 2: No.  One year was enough as a matter of fact I was kind of pushed into it junior year.  It is not anything I aspired to the mob just sort of like pushed me up and after I got a taste of that I said no.  Plus I really wanted to express a little bit of creativity around the yearbook and so I didn't want to hold too many positions at once.
Speaker 1: Now were you involved in sports at all?
Speaker 2: Not at all, I played tennis but that was just something I was sort of interested in but I never played in, I never ever played basketball.  I did some baseball with the kids on the street but nothing major.  I was not athletic in that way.
Speaker 1: But you were in the choir and you were in the music--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --but you didn't play an instrument.  Did you draw or paint?
Speaker 2: Yes, I drew quite a bit.
Speaker 1: Did you, were you able to--I know some places you can do this and some you can't.  Were you able to actually use oil paints or anything like that in school?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah we did some tempera paints, some oil but mostly water based tempera paints.  At home I know I had some oils because I remember I painted a bedspread once that I wasn't supposed to.  My sisters came and somehow they got it all out and dried it before my mother [Eva Jefferson Lee] found out about it, but.
Speaker 1: So you had allies at home too (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, my sisters always had my back.
Story_ID: 641776
Speaker 1: High school, now where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to Evan E. Worthing High School, senior high school; and, in Houston [Texas] and all these were you know, in my neighborhood or not too far from my house.  And, as I said sophomore year, I don't, I don't think I did anything in particular maybe I was in the science fair in my sophomore year but I really started doing things my junior year as far as participating in activities around the school.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now the school was in the neighborhood so it was within walking distance?
Speaker 2: It was a long walk, but yeah, to the high school.  A short walk to the elementary school [James R. Reynolds Elementary School, Houston, Texas] and long walk to the junior high school or the high school but walkable.  You could walk it in thirty minutes or something like twenty minutes.
Speaker 1: Okay so it was about a mile away maybe.
Speaker 2: Now something, I keep forgetting all of these things.  Something I should have mentioned when I talked about the science fair.  When I was in the seventh grade, I participated in the Houston science fair [Science and Engineering Fair of Houston] and actually won the big award that's given for the junior high school.  So all of the--they had different categories of awards but the, it was called the Houston Post Award for Excellence [Houston Post Grand Prize Award for Excellence] that I won in the seventh grade.  Eventually I won the high school version of that again when I was in the ninth or tenth grade and I think it was the first time a black kid had ever won the overall Houston science Fair.  One of the pictures that I found was me and my little trophy.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now what was your project?
Speaker 2: I knew you'd ask me that. It, it's, I can probably see it in the picture, it had something to do with one of these mathematical puzzles almost like a Rubik's cube sort of thing.  It was called the pharaoh's dilemma.  You had to get the things in a certain order and move them a certain way and I used the mathematical computations to figure out how to solve this pharaoh's dilemma--this Rubik' cube thing.
Speaker 1: Yeah I've heard of that, I can't picture it, but pharaoh's dilemma I've heard about.
Speaker 2: It's like a triangular thing with a hole in the middle and these things that come from it and you've got to move them around in certain orders.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was a long time ago.
Speaker 1: Okay who were the teachers in high school there that were inspirational to you or did anybody like serve as a mentor?
Speaker 2: I've probably had several teachers that were like that.  Mrs. George [ph.] was my English teacher; Mrs. James [ph.] was my math, algebra, trigonometry teacher.  We had counselors, Mrs. Gaines, Mrs. Freddie Gaines [ph.] who was my senior counselor.  I think those were the teachers that stand out most in my mind but we had a number of really dedicated--oh Mrs. Caller [ph.] who was the Spanish teacher but who was the sponsor for the yearbook.  So when I was editor of the yearbook, I worked very closely--long nights and weekends in the yearbook staff room with Mrs. Caller.
Speaker 1: Did you write anything in the yearbook that you remember now that, did you have a message in your journalism?
Speaker 2: No not in particular.  I've written all sorts of things since then but in high school there was no particular message I had in the yearbook that I recall.
Speaker 1: What about counseling, here you're making straight As and how high level of math did your high school go?
Speaker 2: Just to--we didn't really even have calculus; I think it went to trigonometry or something.  I was ill prepared to go to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  My physics class in high school was a joke basically and the highest math I had was trigonometry.  But I scored well on the SA- the PSATs and the SATs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I kind of figured it out.
Story_ID: 641777
Speaker 1: In high school had you figured that you were going to become an engineer, in high school?
Speaker 2: When I was in the eighth grade, I was watching 'Star Trek,' well actually when I was in kindergarten I told my mother I wanted to be an artist and she said, "Well artists starve so you need to be something else like an architect."  So from kindergarten to eighth grade I was going to be an architect.  Then in eighth grade my mother said, "Well the latest thing is engineering so you should be an engineer.  You can be an architectural engineer but you need to be an engineer."  I was very obedient, my mother said do it, made sense to me.  So I'm watching 'Star Trek' and this guy comes on the USS Enterprise who had gone to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Ph.D. MIT, master's [degree] MIT all this stuff and they were, Captain Kirk [James T. Kirk] and Mr. Spock were like bowing to this guy like he was a deity and to me Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock were deities.  So if they are bowing to this guy he must be something.  So I asked my mother, "What is MIT?"  Actually to my surprise she said, "It's a school of engineering in Massachusetts." And I said, "Well I want to go to MIT," and she says, "You're going to MIT," just like that.  So she called the school and they sent the bulletins. When the recruiters came from MIT they didn't come to my little black high school, they came to I think Rice University [Houston, Texas] or something.  My parents [Eva Jefferson Lee and Tommie Lee] put me in the car and we went over to meet the recruiters and I did the interviewing and everything filled out the forms and wrote the essays and then I went to MIT.  So that's what got me--my mother got me interested in engineering and at that time, once I really did my research, I discovered that MIT was the best engineering school in the world, highest rated.  So that's where I went to school.
Speaker 1: So counseling played virtually no role in this, I guess?
Speaker 2: No as a matter of fact not Mrs. Freddie Gaines [ph.], my senior counselor who is very encouraging, but one of the other counselors basically told me that I should go to University of Houston [Houston, Texas] or Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] or maybe University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] because while I was smart for Worthing High School [Evan E. Worthing High School, Houston, Texas], you know, I probably wouldn't be smart enough to compete with those other kids and she didn't want me to go and be disappointed, she didn't want me to feel failure.  So she felt she was protecting me.  As you can imagine once I got my MIT degree I went back and showed her the degree and said, "Thank you for the encouragement because I decided that I had to go to MIT and graduate after you were so discouraging to me."
Speaker 1: Now this is a white counselor?
Speaker 2: No this is a black counselor, black counselor, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Black counselor, okay, interesting so was Worthing High School mostly black since it was closer to the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yep, at the time I graduated because we'd gone through the majority/minority zoning sort of thing, we had probably twenty white students and maybe twenty or thirty Hispanic students, but it was more than predominantly black.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you graduated in what nineteen seventy- (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Seventy-five. [1975].
Speaker 1: Seventy-five [1975].
Story_ID: 641778
Speaker 1: Had you ever been to the East Coast before?
Speaker 2: I had not, I had not, and I applied to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California], Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] you know, all of the sort of ivy schools [Ivy League] and when I was accepted at MIT, decided I would go, I didn't take the trip, many times students go to see the school before, I didn't do anything, I just showed up.
Speaker 1: Okay well what was it like?  What was your impression of MIT?
Speaker 2: I loved MIT.  It was just--how could you not be in love with the sort of accomplishments that people from that school made to the world.  And when I went there all the ceilings were very high, the buildings are kind of sterile it didn't have the look of a Harvard or an ivy sort of school but there was something majestic about the place and something deeply academic about the place that appealed to me.  It's funny I always tell the story of--you were talking about the math classes I had and how ill prepared I was at MIT.  I'll never forget my first physics exam at MIT, freshman year out of a possible score of a hundred the class average was eight.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Out of a hundred (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) The class average was eight.
Speaker 1: The class average?
Speaker 2: The class average was eight.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think I got a twelve, I think ten was passing and freshman year is all pass/fail at MIT.  But it was such a lesson and actually it was a lesson that helped me because there are people there at MIT who were top of their class from the best schools, AP [advanced placement] calculus, the best physics all of that sort of stuff, and for me to have come from the school I came from and to be able to compete with that, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to compete.  So to discover that I got a twelve when fifty people in the lecture got zeroes and class average was at eight and the highest score anybody made was a thirty-two or thirty-four or something.  While it dismayed some people and almost made them suicidal, it let me know okay there is something that's a level playing field and MIT has, you know, leveled the playing field quite a bit and I ended up doing very well at MIT, very, 4.7 or 4.8 out of 5 [grade point average] or something like that.
Story_ID: 641779
Speaker 1: How were you able to make up the, the gap, you know, the education gap that you came there with from high school [Evan E. Worthing High School, Houston, Texas]?  Now some were worse than you apparently, but how--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, evidently.  It's funny 'cause I've always thought in a different paradigm than necessarily the one I'm placed in.  So for example I understood how multiplication is just a form of addition and how division is a form of subtraction, I sort of got that whereas some people didn't really get that.  They learn how to add, learn how to multiply but they never saw the connection between the two.  So from an early age I was inquisitive enough about things to go beyond just memorizing something and regurgitate.  I wanted to understand why is that that way, and that allowed me to have a different understanding than some other people did.  MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] prides itself on teaching people to think and to problem solve and to lead, but not just to be a civil engineer but rather to be a leader in the engineering field and to think of nonlinear, out of the box, etc.  So a combination of that sort of way of thinking already and just studying.  I, you know, I enjoyed studying, I enjoyed learning.  So for me to study a little extra was not anything that was a problem for me.  But I was lucky, I got concepts easily.  I worked hard but I played hard, I didn't study nearly as much as some other people did and I was able to still get it understand, comprehend what they were looking for.  I've always been very good at taking tests.  I can sort of figure out what question they were really asking and how to answer it and so that's what helped me through MIT.
Speaker 1: So you, did you utilize study group kind of thing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's interesting because MIT is not the most racially equal place in the world.  It's not as though it was a nirvana and everybody was treated wonderfully.  But there was I think less issues of prejudice at, at MIT because people were just interested in math and science and smart and that sort of stuff and a number of MIT people are kind of weird to begin with.  So they're accepting of other people that are different.  So I think we didn't have the same challenge that you'd have at a school that was more social or people were more socially mature than the people at MIT were.  But the way that the tutoring happened, we had a black student union group [Black Students' Union] there at MIT and we had a black student union tutorial program that was created specifically to have tutors and mentors for the black students.  So while I eventually did get into study groups with non black students, initially we had that infrastructure already there, that very welcoming infrastructure for tutoring and studying together.  I lived in a dormitory it was an all men's dorm and it had five floors and three of those floors were mostly black men, it was called chocolate city--we called it chocolate city at MIT.  And so there were always that, those affinity groups there, that network, that safety net that was there for me as a black student at MIT.
Story_ID: 641780
Speaker 1: Now what was, what's some of the history?  I know we, we've interviewed--was it [HistoryMaker] Valerie Jarrett's great-grandfather [Robert Robinson Taylor] I think was the first black master's degree student or Ph.D. student coming out of MIT in architecture.  He built Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and all of that but that was the first one I ever heard of.  Was there like a--when you went there, to MIT, you said there were three floors of black students (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well we had, had--
Speaker 1: --so.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: I'm just trying to set it up that I guess after 1970 or so a lot of the schools in, it was easier for black students to get in most schools.  The loans were there, grants and other things, for a minute anyway.  So were you coming in on that kind of wave?  I know you went there the all-A student (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was after that.
Speaker 1: --you didn't have to do that but--
Speaker 2: I came in '75 [1975] so I sort of came after the '69 [1969], '70 [1970], '71 [1971], '72 [1972] time period.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, yeah. That sounds like a lot of black students--
Speaker 2: Well not really because in my class of a thousand people, entering freshman there were thirty-two black people, eight women, twenty-four men, and if you add it up across the various years there, there were maybe 100, 120 black people.  It just happened this one dorm, it was a brand new dormitory when I moved in and a bunch of the students the year before, knowing this new dorm was coming in, organized a way to section off some rooms and so a bunch of the black guys got rooms and saved some rooms for other black freshmen coming in.  So that was an anomaly--chocolate city is an anomaly.  If you look across MIT you don't see a whole lot of us, it's just not that many of us.
Speaker 1: I would think in addition to the fact that you all were black that there was another big common denominator that really was probably exciting that you were all interested in science and engineering--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --'cause a lot of our schools don't have a lot of students that are interested or prepared to really discuss science and engineering.
Speaker 2: Exactly. There was a bond already based on people who were interested in what MIT had to offer and interested in coming to a place like MIT.  And some of my best friends now are people that I went to school at MIT with.  You go through that experience together and a bond is really created, a significant bond.  But I think we came there with a bond.  Many of us were not the norm in our schools, we were always a little weird, we were the eggheads, and we were the, you know, kids who talked like white kids, the whatever.  So it was so welcoming to come to the land of the misfits, to have a misfit come to the land of the misfits, and to therefore not have any of that pressure at all.  All of your energy could be focused on academics which was pressure enough with a class average of eight on exams it was tough.  But you always felt you were learning something, you always felt that you were expanding your mind.  It was never just memorizing and regurgitating; it was, it was intellectually stimulating, and it was an intellectual journey.
Story_ID: 641781
Speaker 1: Who were the, I guess, the faculty and staff that impressed you the most at, at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: There was a Professor Biggs [John M. Biggs] who was in the civil engineering department and I think he had a consulting firm [Hansen, Holley and Biggs, Inc.] on the side or something but I know that we did a fair amount of the analysis around the John Hancock building [John Hancock Center, Chicago, Illinois], which years before, due to wind vortexes, had windows up near the top of it to pop out and so they hired Biggs, or MIT, to do a struc- a bunch of the structural analysis and I know I was a part of that.  So basically we were paying our tuition and doing problem sets that then John Hancock was paying MIT to do the research over to fix their problem.  But, you know, professors like that were doing things that were not only teaching you in academics but were showing the application of that in the real world.  We had quite a few of those, quite of few of those.  I remember Professor Biggs in particular.
Speaker 1: Did you have any Nobel Prize winners teaching?
Speaker 2: Yeah, numbers of, well, at MIT there were bunches of them.  So, a number of them, I can't remember their names per se but in each year there was always one professor who was a Nobel Prize winner it seemed.
Story_ID: 641782
Speaker 1: Any good stories from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] from--I mean with all these brains coming together there's got to be some good stories, so.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Tons of stories at MIT, I mean it's, from the MIT Gospel Choir stories to late night problem set stories to, it's interesting because the first time I was called and heard the N word was in Boston [Massachusetts], actually in Cambridge [Massachusetts].  Freshman year a bunch of us walked from MIT down toward Central Square [Cambridge, Massachusetts] which was in the direction of Harvard Square [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I think we were going to a movie or something and then we heard someone shout, you know, the N word and we thought it was somebody we knew joking, we turned and of course it was a car full of white guys driving down Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge.
Speaker 1: Now you were there during the crisis point of the bussing--
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: --issue right in Boston.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  I was there and they told us, you know, "If you leave campus be careful where you go and don't go by yourself," et cetera.  I was there the year of that, the black guy who I think was an attorney was walking down the steps of the state capitol in Boston [Massachusetts State House].  I don't know if his colleague or girlfriend or wife was white but he was with this white lady and there were protesters about the bussing and this one guy had the American flag and stabbed the guy with the point of the American flag and the cameras caught that moment.  My mother [Eva Jefferson Lee] called and said, "Come home," I said, "No, I promise this is not happening on campus." And she said, "You've got to come home."  I didn't, they didn't send me home but it was a tough time.
Speaker 1: Yeah it's interesting I can just add this for whoever is watching this that was Ted Landsmark [HistoryMaker Theodore C. Landsmark] and he was, when we interviewed him in 2003 he was the head of the Boston school of architecture [Boston Architectural College, Boston, Massachusetts], he's an architect and he didn't get stabbed, the man swung the flag at him and the photographer caught it right at the point where it looked like he was being stabbed--
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --going to be stabbed with it but he was never stabbed with it.  But he, you know, shook off some of the guys, there was a fight and the cops came in--
Speaker 2: Oh my god.
Speaker 1: --pulled him out.
Speaker 2: I just remember the picture--the photograph in the paper (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right he's got a three piece suit on--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: He was heading--
Speaker 2: Was he walking with someone else is that the--
Speaker 1: It might have been a colleague of his and he was going, it wasn't his wife and he was going into the building.  He saw the busses out there and he saw the crowds but he didn't know--
Speaker 2: What was going on.
Speaker 1: --he was just going to work and they attacked him, you know.
Speaker 2: So yes, I was there that year.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Ted Landsmark.
Speaker 2: But I can tell you other than that incident with the people in the car yelling the N word, I don't really recall any issues, I don't maybe I washed them out of my mind or ignored them.
Speaker 1: Was Boston different though from what you had anticipated it would be?
Speaker 2: Oh yes coming from Texas, Boston is supposed to be so liberal and all of that and on the campus it was, I mean at MIT and even when we would go to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge,  Massachusetts] and other places pretty much that was the case.  It was just in Boston proper that the problem existed, but I was not that interested in going to Boston anyway.
Story_ID: 641783
Speaker 1: I never really considered this before but here you've got this population of, you, 'cause--when you, you mentioned the fact that the white kids felt like they were different where they came from.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The black kids had to really be different from where--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --where they came from, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So this bond, the, I guess was even stronger because of their (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly. Exactly and thank goodness we had the infrastructure due to the black student union [Black Students' Union], the Office of Minority Education, thank goodness we had those things.  We had a black student union lounge, that's another interesting story.  We had a BSU lounge that was in one of the main sort of buildings and evidently it was reserved for just black students and even though I didn't grow up with a lot of white kids around me and I didn't go to schools that were highly integrated, I always liked people because they were people, and at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], as I said it was sort of like a melting pot, you know, the land of the misfits.  So I had a couple of white friends in my freshman year and so there were two or three black kids including me at a couple of white kids and we would go into the BSU lounge and, it was two white girls as a matter of fact, naturally liked black men so that was the real deal.  But anyway we had gone to the BSU lounge.  So finally, you know, people were complaining that you shouldn't have these white people in the BSU lounge because this is supposed to be our haven to get away from things and to be ourselves, et cetera.  So they told me I couldn't bring my, the white people into the lounge anymore and I'm not a big protester or anything like that but I felt what type of friend am I to--how would I feel if my white friends were told you can't bring this black guy here and they decide, okay, tell Reggie [HistoryMaker Reginald Van Lee] you can't come in.  So I decided I wouldn't go into the lounge, I didn't make a boycott, I didn't make a big deal of it but I would not go into the lounge because I couldn't take my friends into the lounge.  And the head of the black student union called a meeting of the black people that, you know, were causing these problems so we were called into his dormitory room and actually somebody you may have interviewed, I won't call his name but somebody you may have interviewed who I've known since 1975 and I still know him as a friend and he proceeded to educate us on what it meant to be a black person in America and why the BSU lounge had to be a sacred space and all that sort of stuff.  It was just sort of interesting to me and if you see him now he is--I wouldn't say he has acquiesced completely but he's certainly not the militant person that he was back in those days.  Eventually I did start going back into the lounge but for a year, you know, I felt that it would not be right for me to turn on my friends in that way, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You talk about things I remembered at MIT.  I remember being called the N word, I remember the bussing drama that was going on, I remember my physics--first physics exam, I remember that Black Student Union lounge experience, the MIT Gospel Choir.
Speaker 1: Now that, yeah, that sounds like something you wouldn't expect at MIT, MIT Gospel Choir it sounds like a contradiction in terms of something but--were most of the black students religious?
Speaker 2: No, but there was a faction that were religious, so, I'll never forget when I first arrived a friend somebody I had just met, a black woman asked me if I went to church and I said yes, so she took me to church and then I met a bunch of the other folks that would go to this one church that was right down the street from MIT.  It was a Methodist church, I can't remember, I can't believe I can't remember the name of the church, anyway right down the street from MIT.  So they decided they wanted to put together a gospel choir, not true the gospel choir was there when I arrived, it already existed.  So they brought me in and eventually I became the director of the choir but we had all sorts of factions. We had those people who would never go to church, we had those people that were atheist because they were that scientific minded, we had the people that went to church and eventually had the almost fundamentalist, the really super religious black people that on Sunday would come to your dorm room and knock on the door and say you should be going.  Almost like Jehovah's Witnesses who would go around, they would do their mission work by trying to save souls.  We had the whole spectrum of that in that little small black community at MIT.
Story_ID: 641784
Speaker 1: So even amongst those that were different--they, there were differences in the different--
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) yeah, okay.  Like it is everywhere else, I guess.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, all right, so, now were there any particular teachers or people at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or upper classman that really mentored you and helped you with your studies?
Speaker 2: This guy Professor Wes Harris [HistoryMaker Wesley Harris] who headed the Office of Minority Education was a great mentor, whether he even realized it or not.  I became quite good at being mentored from people from a distance.  I would just admire them and watch them and study them and emulate them and maybe never even have that conversation with them.  So, Wes Harris was one of those people.  There was a dean of student affairs--associate dean of student affairs, Mary Hope, who was the mothering kind.  When I first arrived she was very mothering of us but a stern mother, reminded me of my mother [Eva Jefferson Lee] in many ways, and that was an inspiration.  There were a number of the administrators, Clarence Williams [Clarence G. Williams] who eventually was a provost at MIT who I mentoring from and Dean Turner [John Turner] who I took mentoring from and those were all black people.  As far as white administrators and others there was of course Professor Biggs [John M. Biggs] who I talked about before in civil engineering.  There was a professor; I can't believe I can't remember his name.  There was a professor when I was in graduate school at MIT, I cannot remember his name, I can see him, he was Hispanic, I can see him so clearly but he was an inspiration as well and just very helpful and inspiring as far as letting me know that I could do this, that, you know, I was smart.  He gave me A's in the class--not gave me but I earned them and he helped me to earn them.  Rosetti [ph.], I can't remember his name.  But there were people like that and I've learned over the years how to pull what I could from people for my inspiration.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now did, was, now you took calculus for the first time there?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: Was that like a milestone once you got over that you knew you were--
Speaker 2: No, I think that physics exam was something very telling to me and people say a twelve made you feel good really?  Well yeah it did make me feel good but I think part of what saved me was freshman year at MIT was pass/fail and so you didn't have the pressure of having to make--if there was any remedial time for me to make up, it was the fact that all I had to do was pass, right.  But other than that there was no pre calculus or freshman math.  The first class was calculus one, calculus two, physics one, physics two that was the curriculum at MIT.  So I think that the entire first year as I did well on the tests and I was passing everything, it gave me the confidence and it built my confidence that I can do this, I can do this.
Speaker 1: Now did you take any other leadership roles on campus, any other activities besides the choirs (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) With the black student union [Black Students' Union]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I may have been secretary once or vice chair, I don't remember in particular but I think the more prominent position I took was, you know, when I was the director of the MIT Gospel Choir.
Story_ID: 641785
Speaker 1: You graduated from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] with a, well, now, you worked on a master's degree--
Speaker 2: Yep, yeah.
Speaker 1: --too at MIT.
Speaker 2: So I was one of those zealots that didn't realize that I could have taken it a little bit easier so I had a friend who was in the class--a black woman, who was in the class before me who was in civil engineering.  So my freshman year I met her and I was doing all my stuff and so when it came time for my sophomore year I asked her to give me some advice on what courses to take 'cause I wanted to do civil engineering.  So she helped me pick my courses and I had a pretty heavy load because I just liked doing stuff.  Well as it ends up I had some advanced credit before I arrived based on scores I did and then I was taking these extra courses.  So by the time I was finishing my junior year and she was finishing her senior year I had taken all the classes I needed to take to graduate.  So I basically got my bachelor's in three years and then I stayed over--she stayed over to her graduate degree and so I stayed over.  Her first year in graduate school was my fourth year--her first year in graduate school was my fourth year and then I did my master's in that fourth year as well.  So in four and a half years I did the two degrees in other words.
Speaker 1: So you come out of MIT in 1979 with a master's degree in civil engineering.
Speaker 2: Yes, but I actually walked in '79 [1979] with a bachelor's and I walked in '80 [1980] with a master's.  I came back in March. I finished the master's 'cause I had to do my thesis.  I finished all the course work in the four years and then I had to do my thesis and the thesis took me into the next year.  So I think I got finished in January or so, went to Houston [Texas] and then came back in May to march in 1980.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now your thesis was about ways to solidify offshore oil rigs, right?
Speaker 2: It was called the 'Behavior of Grouted Pile Connections' [Reginald Van Lee] which sounds like some kind of intestinal problem or something.  But yeah the offshore oil wells that had tubular foundations and had problems with things falling over they wanted to figure out how to solidify the connection. So I did all the analysis on the grout that they put between them how to solidify and it was patented and Exxon [Exxon Mobil Corporation] made a lot of money off my patent.  I got a degree and they made a lot of money, millions of dollars and we've had no platform to fall over since.
Speaker 1: Gee whiz that's quite a story.  Now the magnitude of this, I'm not going to lose this.  Now this, you came up with an idea that you used for your thesis that was your thesis that was patented and has been used by Exxon ever since.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I just want to say it again, I know you just said it but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that's something that's got to sink in for a second here.
Speaker 2: I wish I had been a little smarter but you know they gave me a stipend for graduate school and, you know, employed me the summer before and the summer after, no the summer before, rather and I thought it was a pretty good deal.  I thought I was just doing a thesis, I had no idea it was going to have that sort of impact.
Speaker 1: So you didn't get--who patented the procedure, MIT?
Speaker 2: No Exxon.
Speaker 1: Exxon did.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right, so, it was as if you were working for Exxon?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  So they got the value, I got the learning, I got the degree--
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) they got the other value.
Story_ID: 641786
Speaker 1: You were hired when, I guess in 1980 by Exxon [Exxon Mobil Corporation], to--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: As a research engineer?
Speaker 2: As a research engineer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In the marine engineering department that did marine--the offshore oil wells.  We either designed analyzed or verified offshore platforms around the world.  So I got to travel to Tokyo [Japan], to Oslo, Norway of course the Gulf of Mexico and we did a big project in London [England].  I was in London for about eight or nine months--lived there for eight or nine months.
Speaker 1: Okay now this is exciting all of a sudden I guess too to travel like this.
Speaker 2: Yeah that I loved.  I already thought I had a love for travel but that experience as a twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three year old traveling like that was amazing and I've been traveling ever since.
Speaker 1: Hm. Okay.
Speaker 2: In those days those were the windfall profits of Exxon so I had--I flew the Concorde [Aerospatiale/BAC Concorde] from New York [New York] to London all the time.  The project I was doing had a lot of oversight from various senior people at Exxon in New York City.  And so twice a month I would fly to New York to report on the progress and I would take the Concorde back and forth.  I had a three bedroom mews house in Kensington [London, England] and a driver.  A twenty-two year old guy, black guy in London, with all, it was amazing, it was really amazing.
Speaker 1: That is, that is. The Concorde, for people who don't know what the Concorde is could you explain that?
Speaker 2: It's the supersonic jets that they don't have any more but it was a three and a half hour flight from New York to Paris [France] and New York to London.
Speaker 1: All right. Now this thing was huge and it looked like something you don't even see anything that looks like this anymore.
Speaker 2: Shaped like that anymore.
Speaker 1: It's shaped like one of those Strategic Air Command bombers.
Speaker 2: Exactly it looks like a bomber, it's amazing.
Speaker 1: It looked really like I guess you say in the vernacular, cool. They're really cool looking--
Speaker 2: And I think in those days a one way ticket was $5,000 or $10,000 something ridiculous.
Speaker 1: It had delta-shaped wings, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Supersonic all the way and (simultaneous) --
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Supersonic. They finally put them down because they had gotten old and the maintenance on them wasn't good.  I was actually on, this is an interesting story, I was on one of those flights that one of the engines went out in midair and we went from this (gesture) to that (gesture) in seconds and like plummeting and then it finally sort of leveled off again that was a little frightening.  But there are a bunch of situations like that that they went through in the later years and so they eventually just took them out of service.  There were also problems with people that lived near the airports and they were landing and the noise that they made and it was a problem.  But it was good while it lasted.
Speaker 1: Would it make a huge sonic boom?
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.  But it had great food, beautifully laid out, small planes because I guess at the speed they were going.  A tall person couldn't really stand up completely in the plane but all the other luxuries were there.
Speaker 1: Okay. From what I've read life as a research engineer though you're traveling a lot, you spend a lot of time in isolation--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --working on a project.
Speaker 2: Yep.  Even when I was traveling, I was always in a la- when I got there I was always in a lab.  I wasn't really interacting with people that much and so that got not much fun after a while, and, the more senior you got, the less you would travel 'cause you had to be out at the home base to manage people.  So I said, "Okay, I'm going to lose all the travel?  I need to get out of here," and that's when I decided I should try something different and was interested in business school.
Story_ID: 641787
Speaker 1: So you're moving fast, 'cause it didn't take long for you to figure this out?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: So you're only there about a year and a half before you figure out--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --how to get out of there (laughter).
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: Even though it's exciting--it's kind of amusing to me that you picked that up really quick, so, yeah.
Speaker 2: Almost the first day I started working I knew that I did not want to be an engineer, purely an engineer, forever, I knew that.  But I had school loans, I needed to work for a while, it was a good job, it was going to be exciting, so I, actually I applied to business school as I was finishing my master's [degree] at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and was accepted--I applied to Harvard and Stanford [Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford, California] and was accepted in Harvard and Stanford.  In those days you could defer 'cause they wanted you to work for a while so I deferred Stanford for a year, deferred Harvard for two years and if I couldn't stand working more than a year, I was going to go to Stanford.  If I can endure it for the two years, I would go to Harvard.  That's how I made my decision.
Speaker 1: Okay so you, you, how did they react when you resigned?  I mean here you are a young man in a position that, now, were you one of the first black engineers at Exxon [Exxon Mobile Corporation]?
Speaker 2: No, but one of the very few.  I may have been one of the first ones.  As I looked around there weren't a whole lot of others.  There were some other scientists there, but if there were some there were only a few, mostly in HR [human resources], in maintenance that sort of stuff that's where we were, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay so, so you enroll in Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In 1982?
Speaker 2: In '82 [1982].
Speaker 1: Your goal is to get a M.B.A.
Speaker 2: Yes, now that was interesting because a friend of mine from MIT who was with the class before ma at MIT finished MIT, went directly to Harvard Business School. So when I was getting my one year master's at--when I was doing my senior year at MIT, he was in his first year at Harvard Business School.  When I did my one year master's, he was in his second year at Harvard Business School.  So when both of us are graduating with our master's his offers were $20 thousand, $30 thousand a year more than mine.  I was like I got a master's from MIT what this big deal with Harvard Business School 'cause I didn't really know what Harvard Business School was.  I knew what Harvard was but I didn't get it.  And so, when he sort of broke it down to me, I said, "Well I need to go to business school," and that's when I applied; and then I deferred it.
Story_ID: 641788
Speaker 1: Well you were just explaining how you became interested in Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] in the first place and, and, so now in 19--
Speaker 2: So there was this difference in salaries, big difference so I decided I would apply and then deferred for those two years and the rest is history.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well it's good to have those options.  A lot of people that we interview who were scientists and engineers are so devoted to their research and the aspect of doing that they may not even consider doing it if they could.  You could do it and you know you did.
Speaker 2: One of my challenges in life is I have a short attention span.  So even if we talk about my career at Booz Allen [Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.], I've been there twenty-eight years but I've had five very different jobs in the twenty-eight years I've been there.  After every three or four or five years I get a little bored and want to do something different.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, well tell us about Harvard Business School?  Who was there--who were some of the teachers and fellow students at Harvard Business School?
Speaker 2: Fellow students, friends that I have now.  My friend Pamela Joyner, Ray McGuire [HistoryMaker Raymond J. McGuire], Debbie Wright [HistoryMaker Deborah Wright], some of the names you may know in the African American community.  My most favorite professor is a woman by the name of Barbara Toffler who is still a friend, came to my wedding and I actually had her to say a few words because she was another one of those people who encouraged me and confirmed for me that I can do this.  Because, you know, Harvard Business School is so pressurized, it's sort of institutional pressure where everyone comes in they feel they have to dress a certain way and sound a certain way and play politics a certain way and you can get wrapped up in that.  They can try and make you feel, unlike at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], they can try and make you feel like you're a have not when they are a have, and it ends up a bunch of those people were have not's as well but you know everyone does this puffing up to try to position themselves.  My very first grade at the Harvard Business School was from an organization behavior class and it was from Barbara Toffler and it was an E, the highest grade, so basically an A.  My very first grade was an A at the Harvard Business School from her, and not because she just liked me and was given me grace but she was fair, so she inspired me.  I had other professors that were interesting but she was my favorite by far.

Speaker 1: How many black students were, were, were there out of a class of what size?
Speaker 2: I think there were about eight or nine hundred students in each class, and there were probably forty black students.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: There was always 3 or 4 percent at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Harvard, there was always like 3 or 4 percent.
Speaker 1: So you were mentioning some of the other black students Pam--
Speaker 2: Joyner.
Speaker 1: --Joyner [Pamela Joyner], Ray McGuire [HistoryMaker Raymond J. McGuire] who is from my hometown, yeah, yeah--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, Ohio right?
Speaker 1: Dayton [Ohio], yeah, I don't know him, I've met him but I don't know him.
Speaker 2: Debbie Wright [HistoryMaker Deborah Wright] who is head of, CEO of Carver Bank [Carver Bancorp, Inc., New York, New York] and, in the class behind me, [HistoryMaker] Desiree Rogers, a good friend.  Wanda Felton was in my class she's the COO at the Import-Export Bank of the U.S.[Import-Export Bank of the United States, Washington, D.C.], appointed by President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama].  I'm trying to think who else was in my class at Harvard, Argelia Rodriguez who, she just talked about, she's a friend.  Who else was in my class? There are other folks after a while I kind of forget how I knew people right.  I say oh I went to business school; oh I went to MIT with him.
Speaker 1: Now was there a black student organization there at Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yes, AASU, African American Student Union, AASU which was there then and still is there and very much like the support network that we had at MIT.  It was there to help us with problem sets, they had old tests to study by, they had tutors, they did social things and tried to really enculturate you and make you feel comfortable with being at the Harvard Business School.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you all, are you and your classmates still in touch?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, the ones I named are the ones that I'm still, most of them were at my wedding so they are still friends.
Speaker 1: Does the, 'cause I know the law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] does, the black law school students do, but do the AASU students have reunions?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah. Well there's a conference we do every year and then they organize around the specific years, reunion years for that class to come together and do something special as well. But there's a conference every year.

Speaker 1: Now was there one aspect of, of, of your studies that you were drawn to the, you know, the most?
Speaker 2: My favorite class at the Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] was called power and influence.  So things around organizational behavior, change management, the psychology of people, those were all courses that I enjoyed the most. 'Cause you know the technical stuff I had that from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I didn't need that, but the how people behave, how do you motivate people to do the right thing and engender trust and build collaborations and all of that stuff that was most intriguing to me.  It's something that I had done sort of naturally growing up.  I sit in the house with the sisters and sort of stuff but I wanted to better understand positive techniques around that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Versus power and influence on the negative side.
Speaker 1: Now have, have you developed a professional philosophy that you can share with us around that, how to influence people and get employees to do things that need to be done?
Speaker 2: Some of it still is implicit and I'm asked this question often and I have to try and think about how, what am I doing, maybe subconscious what am I doing.  I think it begins with listening and really listening not only with your hears but with your eyes to reading the body language with people and wanting to engage with people.  I find people interesting so the worst person in the world, to other folks, I can find something interesting in them.  And then touching, finding that button, touching that button with them and engage in them in a real way and being as genuine as possible with people.  I found that really works.  That, you know, hopefully what people will say about me if you asked them is that I'm a genuine person and I'm not always nice sometimes you have to not be nice but it's never contrived or unfounded or unfair.  I'm an honest, fair, genuine person who genuinely likes people and likes to engage with people and takes the time to engage with people.
Speaker 1: Okay. Any other aspect of your studies pop out now as we look back?
Speaker 2: The power and influence class and the organization behavior which was the first one I got the highest grade in are the things that impressed me the most.  All the other stuff was interesting, you know, build skills, but didn't stand out like power and influence stood out.
Story_ID: 641791
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy five [1975] when you started Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts]--
Speaker 2: No, 1982.
Speaker 1: --Eighty two [1982], eighty, yeah, '82 [1982] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Eighty-two [1982] to '84 [1984].
Speaker 1: Right, that's right, in 1982 an M.B.A. was still relatively new, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah so I didn't quite know, it's funny I do all these sort of blind faith things, I didn't quite know what I would do with the M.B.A.  I knew that, I'd done some homework at Exxon [Exxon Mobil Corporation] and so I worked with Exxon and I was actually on educational leave from Exxon when I went to Harvard Business School.  So I had a job sort of waiting for me.  When I looked at the senior people at Exxon they were engineers with M.B.A.s for the most part and so I said okay this engineering and M.B.A. combination makes sense.  I had this friend Al Frazier [Albert H. Frazier] who had gone to Harvard Business School and had twenty thousand, thirty thousand dollars a year more in his offers than me so I said, you know, we'll try it.  And, a number of people said you can go to business school and discover what you want to do later.  I wasn't sure if that would be the case but it ended up that was the case for me.  I went to Harvard, I'd never heard of consulting as an industry, at all.  To me a consultant was either some old retired person that was consulting or some person who didn't have a real job and they were consulting until they had a real job.  That's, that's what consulting was to me.  I didn't know about Booz Allen [Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.] and Bain [Bain and Company] and McKinsey [McKinsey and Company] and BCG [Boston Consulting Group], I didn't know an industry like that existed.  And even though I knew about Wall Street [New York, New York] and stockbrokers, I didn't understand what investment banking was.  So, first minute at Harvard Business School it's all about investment banking and consulting, that's all people talked about.  So I did my homework and discovered that what I liked about consulting was it was problem solving.  What I liked about my job as an engineer was I loved problem solving; I loved interacting with people which I didn't get in my job as a research engineer.  I loved making a big change, having a big impact which I didn't feel like I was getting in engineering.  So I said where can I take these technical skills around problem solving and find a job that works for me.  And consulting sounded perfect, I interviewed, got the job for the summer with Booz, there is a whole story there.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's like a summer internship with Booz Allen Hamilton [Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc.], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: While you were still at Harvard [Harvard Business School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Between my first and second year and that was strange because I didn't know about consulting, McKinsey [McKinsey and Company] came on campus before we started recruiting and took groups of students to lunch and took myself and two or three other students to lunch.  Two guys from McKinsey and two or three students and I was impressed that they had taken the time to take me out to lunch didn't realize they had done that with multitudes of people, right.  They went through the resume book, they saw the Exxon [Exxon Mobil Corporation], they saw the MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], they said, "Okay maybe this guy would be good for our technology practice."  And, so then when the recruiting started McKinsey called and I set up an interview. Booz Allen called and I said, "Well you know, if I'm going to do consulting, I'm going to do it with McKinsey so I don't want to waste your time, I won't interview."  So I didn't interview with Booz at all and, not trying to be obnoxious, I just didn't know.  I didn't realize what turning down a Booz Allen interview was, how stupid that was.  So I didn't interview with any other consulting firms, I had an offer from Exxon for the summer, I interviewed with McKinsey, they made me an offer for the summer in Cleveland [Ohio], I didn't want to work in Cleveland.  Exxon said I could work in New York [New York], I wanted to work in New York, I turned down the McKinsey offer, which once again nobody turns down a McKinsey offer but I didn't know.  Then this friend of mine from Booz Allen, Albert Frazier [Albert H. Frazier] who had gone to MIT and who had the bigger offer than me he was at Booz, he called me and said, "I hear that you had an offer from McKinsey and you turned it down. Might you be interested in Booz?"  I said, "Well Booz called me and I wouldn't even take the interview, you think they want to be bothered?"  He said, "I know the guy who runs recruiting for Harvard, I'll get you in."  So in those days they did three rounds of interviews, now we only do about two rounds of interviews, and I was coming in the third round of the interviews.  So last minute, went in I was supposed to have an half hour interview with, a forty-five minute interview with, like a senior associate and a thirty minute interview with a partner.  I had a fifteen minute interview with the senior associate and seems like five or ten minutes with the partner and I felt the interview went fine but clearly I'm thinking well they must not like me they are pushing me out of the door so fast.  So they said thank you and that we'll give you a call.  The night they called me made me an offer for the summer and it was the highest paid, you know, internship, consulting paid the most, even more than investment banking, in those days.  They said I could be in New York, they would help me with housing.  So I went to Booz for the summer not knowing what consulting was or if I could do it.  Had a great summer, had a great mentor there this guy Joe Nemec [Joseph Nemec, Jr.] who was the partner on my job as a summer intern, was the partner who made me my permanent offer and was in my life at Booz Allen at various stages throughout my career and was the biggest proponent for me making partner in the firm.  He, I'm sorry, so I had that great summer; Booz made me an offer to come back permanent when I graduated.  Took their offer, and here I am.  I went there to work for two years, twenty-eight years later still there.

Speaker 1: Is there anything significant in terms of your graduation from Harvard (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 1: --yeah, that we need to talk about before we--
Speaker 2: I mean the graduation itself was, you know, majestic and my parents [Eva Jefferson Lee and Tommie Lee] were there, my whole family was there, friends were there.  It was all of that hallowed Harvard sort of thing.  It was the hottest day in the year in Boston [Massachusetts] with all those robes and all that stuff on but, you know, it was glorious, it was wonderful, great experience.
Speaker 1: Was your mother satisfied now that--
Speaker 2: She was satisfied, she was satisfied with MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] as well, but to have MIT and Harvard behind my name she was satisfied, and it vindicated everything she did in life.  So, not having us play with other children, not having me to pick up trash or do any manual labor, you know, not letting me go to any football games or baseball games or basketball games but instead do math stuff and speech and drama and all this stuff--
Speaker 1: She didn't let you go to any of the games?
Speaker 2: In my entire high school career [at Evan E. Worthing High School, Houston, Texas], I went to two football games.  The homecoming game my junior year because I was junior class president and the homecoming game my senior because I was editor of the yearbook that was it.  I went to no basketball games, I went to no baseball games, I didn't go out with friends, I wasn't allowed to go out wherever people--I don't know where they went during high school but to clubs or whatever, not allowed.
Speaker 1: That's a pretty strict upbringing.
Speaker 2: Oh she was strict but so, I mean I so loved my parents and honored and respected them that if they said that's not something you would want to do, I didn't want to do it.  It wasn't even like I want to do it but they won't let me do it, I didn't want to do it.  So I didn't feel like I was missing anything and then with time some of those people that were partying and having a good time, where did they end up in life, right?  So every year they were vindicated but, you know, she certainly felt vindicated after MIT and the Harvard degrees.
Story_ID: 641793
Speaker 1: You didn't think you'd stay at Booz [Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.] very long, maybe a couple of years.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But you ended up staying a long time.  Now, now kind of walk us through your, your--
Speaker 2: My career at Booz Allen?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I started with my engineering degrees and my M.B.A., I started in what was a general technology area at Booz Allen because my degree's in civil engineering, we didn't do civil engineering in those days.  Now we do transportation and energy and environment and there is some civil engineering disciplines in there but at the time we had pharmaceutical and telco [telecommunications] and engineered products and that sort of thing.  So I was in just a general generic technology space.  But, you know, did well, did well in my analysis, could present well to the clients, had enough confidence in the work I was doing so I could speak with confidence both in internal meetings, team meetings as well as client meetings.  Eventually there was a partner in the telco business who needed someone that understood how to do competitive analysis and I'd done a bunch of competitive analysis in pharmaceuticals where I could go into the income statements and balance sheets and figure out their cost structure and do some interviews and all that stuff.  So he needed someone, and claimed that you didn't have to understand telecommunications just understand how to go through income statements and balance sheets and do competitive interviews and get data.  So I started working with him on what was to be a six or eight week engagement and six months later I was still working with him and eventually I focused on telecommunications.  I eventually ran the telco business for Booz Allen then I migrated over to computers and electronics and eventually ran the computers and electronics business in the U.S.  Then media and entertainment, I ran the media and entertainment business for a while.  Then I ran the New York [New York] office, and then I was on loan to the government practice in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] for a year to help them with transformation stuff around public sector stuff.  I attached myself to healthcare, eventually moved over to the government business completely, I moved to D.C., and now I run the healthcare business.  So you may ask, "What's the common theme between telecommunications, computers and electronics, media and entertainment and running an office in health care?"  In all five cases those were situations going through change.  I started with Booz in '84 [1984] which is the year after AT&T [AT&T Inc.] was deregulated.  So telco was going through all that change, and I'm attracted to spaces where there are paradigm shifts and spaces where in spite of the fact that I haven't been doing this for years and years, I'm not disadvantaged.  As a matter of fact people with conventional wisdom were disadvantaged because they were stuck in that paradigm and I was able to think fresh, new because I had no history, no insight, I had to learn it as it was happening.  So telco's going through change and deregulation, computers and electronics going through the PC [personal computer] versus mainframe drama, where some of my clients said, "No one will ever have individual computers on their desk at home, personal computers, no that'll never happen."  So getting over that shift was important.  Media and entertainment in the days when all pirating was happening and people were doing stuff free and they were trying to figure out how can we make money, how can we sell records and make money when everything is online and free.  The New York office when we were going through our sort of identity crisis and we had morale issues in New York, and then healthcare, well you know what's through with healthcare.  So I've always been a change agent person that could deal with shifting paradigms, could deal with the human aspects, power and influence, as well as the substantive aspects, industry issues, economics, et cetera, so that's, and that's what's kept me at Booz every time I get a little bored they say, "Well, try this," right, and they let me try something different.  They let me have five different careers in my twenty-eight years.
Story_ID: 641794
Speaker 1: Kind of walk us through a scenario of a, of a case, I mean, that you had to deal with, I mean a situation.
Speaker 2: Which one should I take, oh at one point we did this work for Lucent Technologies [Lucent Technologies, Inc.] which is an outgrowth of AT&T [AT&T Inc.], now it's been acquired and moved on.  But we did a fair amount of strategy work for them but at one point they had balance sheet problems, they had real liquidity problems and they had to take something like thirteen billion doll- nine or ten billion dollars of working capital off of their books.  They had, like that fiscal year to get literally nine billion dollars of working capital off their books.  So that's accounts payable, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment all that stuff.  They hired us to come in and help them and what was so phenomenal about that work was it wasn't just us sitting in a room doing computer models.  We had to really help them figure out how to shift assets, how to, in the manufacturing context, not use all the equipment they would have normally used, not accept shipments from vendors in the way they had to help them clear out their accounts receivable.  We had people standing on docks refusing, Booz Allen [Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.] people refusing shipment from suppliers so they didn't have overstock inventory.  We had people on the phone helping them with their collections, doing their accounts receivable collections.  So that sort of real tangible thing and you know the impact of your work.  So at the end of that fiscal year, we got not nine but thirteen billion dollars of working capital off their books.  So this isn't some theoretical maybe it happened and maybe it was implemented and maybe it wasn't, it was actually done.  I've been lucky to have a number of real tangible, significant engagements like that, nontrivial engagements.
Speaker 1: Was there one that was the toughest one, hardest one to do?
Speaker 2: That was pretty tough.  I think one of the toughest things was when Unisys [Unisys Corporation], the computer company, was created.  It was the merger of Burroughs [Burroughs Corporation; Unisys Corporation] and Sperry [Sperry Corporation; Unisys Corporation], and Burroughs was sort of acquiring Sperry or that's the way it was seeming but the chairman of Burroughs said he wanted to take, it was Blumenthal [W. Michael Blumenthal] who was secretary of treasury before that, he wanted to take the best of the two worlds and keep the best of the world and get us in the other.  And the Burroughs people felt as though because they were the acquirer, they would be the winner.  In our analysis we discovered in many cases Sperry people were actually quite stronger.  So I had this one client that, seeing this was coming actually gave me a bunch of bad data and so we did this analysis with bad data that came to the wrong conclusion and he knew what the right data were.  So when I went to present the findings they were flawed and it caused embarrassment for the firm and all sorts of stuff and a tou- you know, digging myself out of that was difficult but the firm stood by me and gave me the chance, understood the reason behind it but still the client was always right.  So still I should have somehow figured out the data were bad or whatever.  So that was a tough situation and it was one of those, one of the few times I was brought to tears.  I had a job manager who yelled at me and all sorts of things.  My apartment was just three blocks from the office and so I went to the apartment and screamed and cried, got it together and went back to the office after that and then saw my way through it, but, that was probably one of the most difficult times I've had in the firm when, you know, you're doing work that wasn't right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you had no way of knowing?
Speaker 2: And no way of knowing until it was too late.  I was sabotaged basically.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I was set up.
Story_ID: 641795
Speaker 1: What would you consider, I guess, your biggest triumph; or what made you feel the best?
Speaker 2: I've been lucky to have a bunch of stuff that I felt good about.  Probably a fair amount of the pro bono work that I've done has inspired me the most.  Work we did for Habitat for Humanities [sic. Habitat for Humanity] to help them deliver more homes to people that need homes than they had before.  Work I did with Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] at Harlem [New York, New York], the Harlem Small Business Initiative [Urban Enterprise Initiative], to help small businesses become more competitive in Harlem so that as competition moved up into Harlem those businesses that had been the mainstay of the community for ten, twenty, thirty years could still survive. Those sorts of things you know that touch the human spirit in a real way have been my biggest joy.  But the Lucent Technologies [Lucent Technologies, Inc.] work to help them solve the liquidity problem and survive a few more years was something that I'm very proud of.
Speaker 1: The note I have here is in 1993 you were made a managing partner.  Now, were you the first African American to be made a managing partner with--
Speaker 2: Yes, I was managing partner of the New York [New York] office and I think that, I don't think that we've had s- I knew we didn't have it before and I don't we've had since a managing partner of a large office like that.  But also in '93 [1993] I was made senior partner in the firm and we have had three African American senior partners ever in the firm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So this is history making.  Now you worked with a lot of technology driven companies, right, and I know you've written about e-business and that sort of thing.  What's the major challenge today with e-business in terms of--
Speaker 2: E-business has become business.  It's sort of impossible to be any sort of business without having this whole electronic capability and that's part of what we wrote about.  That what seems like this separate thing is going to be just, e-commerce is just a way to do business now and I think with social media and with everyone's agility around using technology it really allowed businesses to be much more efficient and in some cases even more effective by being e-businesses.  So I think the challenge is what's the next wave of that?  How do you continue to do that?  How do you make sure those investments in technology are paying off?  How do you distinguish yourself from others since everybody has it what is your distinctive advantage in that context?
Speaker 1: Okay, so you consult with people about how to make that next--how to stay ahead of the--
Speaker 2: How to use technology to your advantage?  How to differentiate yourself from others whether it's by the way you do business or the products you serve or the services you offer.  But in all cases the electronic commerce piece of that is in there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not going anywhere.
Speaker 2: No, it's not going anywhere.
Speaker 1: In 2001, you spearheaded the Booz Allen Hamilton [Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.] 9/11 team, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: I was in New York for September 11 [September 11, 2001], as it ends up I was hosting a worldwide partners' meeting, so we had three hundred Booz Allen partners around world in New York City. Good news is we were at the Plaza Hotel [New York, New York], so we were far away from downtown, but still when this all happened I had to make sure everyone was taken care of. We had an office of people that had to evacuate our office at 101 Park [Avenue], 'cause our office is right, was when I was in that office was right next to Grand Central [Grand Central Terminal, New York, New York] and initially people didn't know what the targets were so all main attractions and offices near there were deserted.  So we had caravans of people who had to walk from the office to the Plaza Hotel and I had to deal with all that sort of stuff.  But once that was over a group of, well there was this concern of how do we rebuild downtown New York and how as that going to be funded.  There was a request from New York City to the federal government for funding.  There was a desire to justify that funding with some real analytics.  So the New York City partnership pulled together half a dozen, a little more than that, about probably ten consulting firms to help do that analysis pro bono and Booz Allen was one of the firms and each of us took certain sectors in New York City to do the analysis to measure the impact that September 11th had and what it would take to rebuild the city.  I was fortunate enough when we had various readouts to various important people around the city.  We drew straws on which meetings we would present and I was fortunate enough to present at the meeting where both former President Bill Clinton and then Senator Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] were in attendance.  And that began my relationship with the Clintons when they saw me make that presentation; and eventually the president reached out for us to help with his small business initiative in Harlem [New York, New York], et cetera, et cetera.
Story_ID: 641796
Speaker 1: Well tell us about the small business initiative in Harlem [Harlem Small Business Initiative; Urban Enterprise Initiative].
Speaker 2: When Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] moved to Harlem [New York, New York] there was great excitement and happiness over a former president coming to Harlem and then as some of the Harlem residents saw the real estate value increasing and they didn't own it, they were renting it instead of owning it.  Small businesses were concerned that all of a sudden a spotlight is on Harlem and businesses from downtown want to move up and take over.  They came to Bill Clinton and said, "Mr. President, we're happy you're here but you've got to help us, got to help us so that we don't lose what we've built over these years.  We were here in the hard times and now that things have gotten better we don't want to be pushed out."  So he--
Speaker 1: That's when former President Clinton was actually living in the--he was--
Speaker 2: His office, the offices of the foundation [Clinton Foundation, New York, New York] were in Harlem (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) His offices were in the Adam Clayton Powell Building [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building]?
Speaker 2: No, it, 125th, it's 7 West 125th Street.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, down the street?
Speaker 2: So it's down the street from Adam Clayton Powell Building.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 641797
Speaker 1: Yeah we were talking about the small business initiative [Harlem Small Business Initiative; Urban Enterprise Initiative] in Harlem [New York, New York], and--
Speaker 2: And, so the small businesses came to the president [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] and said, "We need your help so that we can continue to be competitive and live and grow in Harlem."  So the president went to a number of consulting firms to ask them if they would do this pro bono and we wanted to do this partnership as a collaborative approach.  So we had the Clinton Foundation [New York, New York], we had the Harlem Small Business Alliance [sic. Harlem Business Alliance, New York, New York], we had Congressman Charlie Rangel's [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] office, we had Columbia University [New York, New York], we had New York University [New York, New York], we had the National Black MBAs [National Black MBA Association], we had Booz Allen Hamilton [Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.] all working together with these small businesses to add different resources as we could deliver to them.  We did the technical assistance and the consulting thing.  We had attorneys to give them legal help on their leases, on their rent.  We had the M.B.A.s to give us some leverage of students doing analysis, et cetera.  And what we did was to create a program that actually changed the lives of many small businesses in Harlem. Several hundred have gone through the program now since 2001.  We started with ten pilot businesses and it's interesting because when we first started looking at who would be good candidates for this program we said well we want the program to run for almost two years so we have enough time to really help them and test the results and see the progress we've made.  So let's make sure that the businesses either own their building or they have at least a two year lease.  We discovered that some 80 percent of the businesses of Harlem at that time operated on a month to month lease.  So at any point a landlord could say, "I can get more for this, you've got thirty days, you've got to get out," right.  And they were okay with that in the lean years because they didn't want to sign a long term lease and go out of business in a couple of months and still be stuck with having to pay the lease.  So it was a good deal for them and it was a good deal for the landlords at the time.  But long story made short, we worked with the businesses to bring just modern management 101 techniques to them, inventory management, receptionists for people, marketing plans, business plans, analysis of their consumer base through surveys, just very simple things; and we turned some businesses around.
Story_ID: 641798
Speaker 1: What's the status now in Harlem [New York, New York] of the (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The program still runs--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --it's been expanded, it's gone beyond Harlem; it's in other parts of New York.  I think they did it, Senator Clinton--then Senator Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] did it in Upstate New York, we've done it in California, I think they've done of it in Chicago [Illinois].  So this whole notion of--it's called the Urban Enterprise Initiative now, so it graduated from the Harlem Small Businesses Initiative.  And they do, they assign mentors, business mentors with small businesses.  It's quite an extensive program now.
Speaker 1: This is one of the few times that small businesses had access to business consulting from a firm like Booz Hamilton [Booz Allen Hamilton Inc].
Speaker 2: Exactly and many times what they needed was money but they weren't fundable.  The bank wouldn't give them any money.  They had no business plans; they couldn't prove that they could spend the money the right sort of way.  So we also had banks associated with this partnership.  So once we had worked with them to get them to the point that they were fundable then they were able to get funds from banks.
Speaker 1: Just for the sake of our chronology about when was, when did this happen, this all happen?
Speaker 2: It was 2002, 2003, 2004, so we started it in 2002, like, I think it was March of 2002, and it ran for twenty-two months the pilot and then we went into full implementation and added more businesses in, so, in the 2003 to 2004 period was when we finished the pilots; and then they scaled it to touch more businesses.

Speaker 1: I don't want to like whiz pass things but, 2008 you were named Black Engineer of the Year I guess, by--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You were in Black Engineer magazine [US Black Engineer and Information Technology]?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And you've been away from engineering for a long time but, this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly, exactly but when we looked at the technology behind the things that I was doing, having run the computers electronics business and to some extent the media business, there's engineering things that we did.  There's, I shouldn't say this but what really sealed my application for the award was I had the president [Susan Hockfield] of MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] to write a recommendation, I had President Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] to write a recommendation.  The recommendations were just sort of amazing.  So black engineers said we're not going to miss this opportunity even though I haven't been doing pure engineering for a while.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, I had a question, okay, oh, yeah, in terms of MIT, you mentioned the president of MIT writing a letter for you, I was thinking when I was looking over this material that a lot of the publications that you--a lot of things you were writing were being published by MIT Press [Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And is there a connection there between MIT Press and (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It just happened that I'm an alum [alumni]; I'm a trustee now at MIT so I've always been involved in some form or fashion at MIT.  I think one of the things that was most impressive is that, you may not know this but MIT has a program called OpenCourseWare [MIT OpenCourseWare] where you can go online and get access to almost all of MIT's courses and study from them.  It's free online, OpenCourseWare.  Booz Allen [Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.] was part of the project team that created that.  We gave them pro bono help to create that whole thing so, and it's such a phenomenal thing that.  We will always be loved by MIT for having been a part of that program; and I think we will always be loved by Bill Clinton for having been a part of the Harlem Small Businesses Initiative [Urban Enterprise Initiative].
Story_ID: 641800
Speaker 1: Now in 2009 you were co-author of an article--now this is a book, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Not a bo- yeah, okay. 'Megacommunities: How Leaders of Government, Business and Non-Profits can Tackle Today's Global Challenges Together' and it features a hundred interviews with leaders from around the world.
Speaker 2: From CEOs, heads of state and heads of NGOs [nongovernment organization] around the world.
Speaker 1: These are pretty important people former President Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton], Henry Kissinger, you know, Ken Chennault [Kenneth Chennault] and others, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Dick Parsons [HistoryMaker Richard Parsons] all sorts of people, around the world too not just the Americans.  It was a partnership between--collaboration between myself and three other Booz Allen [Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.] partners.  One is an Italian partner [Fernando Napolitano], the other two were government partners [Mark Gerenscer; Christopher Kelly], and I was private sector and NGO given the not for profit work I'd done.  It was really started by the Italian partner who years before that approached me at a worldwide partners meeting and said, "Reggie [HistoryMaker Reginald Van Lee], what is the firm's point of view on globalization?" Because he had clients coming to him saying, "Can you help us with globalization?  What are the lessons learned from Booz Allen, is there a platform, approach, a technique, a point of view that you all have on that?"  I'd been at the firm for a long time and knew a lot of people and he said, "Maybe you can figure out who has the insight on globalization."  I did some studying around and discovered that the firm had several points of view depending on who you talked to but there was no one view with some real fidelity around it based on analysis.  So we thought maybe a white paper on globalization and sustainable globalization would be helpful.  But I said before we do that let's see what else is written out in the world about globalization.  So we read some seventy-five books on globalization and discovered that in most cases the authors did what I would describe as admired the problem.  How complex the problem is, dissecting the problem, but didn't say, therefore, Ken Chennault head of American Express [American Express Company] if you want to globalize in India how do you do it?  There was no how to.  So we decided to write a book and the working title was 'A Leader's Guide to Sustainable Globalization,' that's what we set out to do.  A hypothesis was that globalization only works when all the various stakeholders are involved in the right sort of way, private sector, public sector and not for profit, NGO sector.  So given that as the hypothesis, we said well let's interview people from all three sectors and since this is an issue of globalization let's interview people from around the world and that was our premise.  We did all those interviews like I said over 100 interviews, 4,000 pages of transcript and what we discovered was just about any complex problem these days required this collaboration across the three sectors and that you needed to pick up this problem like a mega community.  So you need to put all those communities together and create this mega community.  What we discovered is the approach we used with Bill Clinton in Harlem [New York, New York] in bringing together all those stake holders; we basically created a mega community. The work that we did for HIV/AIDS [human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency Syndrome] in India and China by bringing together government and private sector and citizens to solve the HIV/AIDS issue, not solve but begin to address it, was a mega community.  So we were able to look back at work we had done without realizing what we had done, and it was mimicking what we were hearing at these interviews from people of what really worked--what didn't work and what really worked.  So that became the book, 'Megacommunities.'
Speaker 1: Okay. Now in 2009 you wrote a--you co-authored an article called "Collective Leadership and Overlapping Vital Interests: the Unrealized Power of Megacommunities" in a publication of MIT's [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] called 'Innovations: Technology, Governance, Globalization.'  So this is continuing the conversation, this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) These were all spinoffs from this whole notion and I, just yesterday I spoke at Georgetown [Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.] to a bunch of diversity and inclusion professionals about the notion of mega communities and how in order to address the diversity challenge and inclusion challenge you have to bring together all these various stake holders. The book goes further, I mean the premise of bringing people together to collaborate on solving the problem, people say got that, it's not very insightful.  How you do it is what's so difficult. Why would different people from different mindsets, with different incentives want to work together?  So the book talks about how you create the common problem, how you determine who the stake holders should be, how you define the roles the right sort of way, how you create an infrastructure to, in an ongoing way, manage the progress of the group so that you one by one check off the milestones of what you want to do.  So, it's a real practical guide to how do you do it; not just, wouldn't be great if people came together to solve problems.
Story_ID: 641801
Speaker 1: Now also in 2009, [HistoryMaker] President Barack Obama announced his intent to nominate you to his Committee on the Arts and Humanities [President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities].  Now did he do this?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember the announcement, yep (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh you remember. Okay, now tell us about some of your activities in arts.  I know you're on the--you're the chair of the board of the Evidence dance company, and--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm chair emeritus now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You may have an old resume but I'm chair--we can get you a new one.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but just give us kind of an update on what your involvement with the arts are.
Speaker 2: I chair the board of the Washington Performance Arts Society [Washington Performing Arts]; I chair the board of Howard Theatre restoration project [Howard Theatre Restoration, Inc., Washington, D.C], which is with, the board of trustees which is to restore the Howard Theatre [Washington, D.C.].  I am appointee to the president's committee in the arts and humanities, I'm on the board of The Washington Ballet, I'm chair emeritus of the board of the Evidence dance company, I'm a trustee at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I'm on the board for Fight for Children here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]. I'm on the board and treasurer of the MAC AIDS Fund, it's a long list of stuff that I--and in the past I chaired the board of Dance of Harlem [Dance Theatre of Harlem, New York, New York], I'm on the board of the Studio Museum in Harlem [New York, New York], I was treasurer for almost ten years there.  I was on the board of the Abyssinian Development Corporation [New York, New York], I'm off that board now.  I was on the board of the New York City Center for Charter School Excellence [New York City Charter School Center, New York, New York]; I'm off that board now.  I chaired the board of the New York International Ballet Competition [New York, New York]; I'm off that board now.  So I've always been involved in the arts, performing arts, visual arts and things around diversity or education.  I was on the board of Thurgood Marshall College Fund [Washington, D.C.] for many years. So that's the kind of stuff that I do.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. You know, which is extensive, I mean it's a lot of stuff.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It may be surprising to some people that an engineer would be that involved in, in arts.
Speaker 2: I've always been a little schizophrenic.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, but it's a lot, this is a lot of (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A lot schizophrenic.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 641802
Speaker 1: Bring us up to date as to what your activities are now with Booz Allen Hamilton [Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.]; and what's your, what your future plans are.
Speaker 2: I currently am an executive vice president with Booz Allen (cough) excuse me, and I run our healthcare business and the not for profit business.  So whether it's federal side, commercial side, domestic, international healthcare for Booz Allen, I run that business and we provide IT [information technology] services, consulting services, analytical consulting services, clinical expertise in consulting, and strategy and organization consulting to the healthcare industry is what I do now.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you plan to retire from Booz Allen or are you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Only this year have I started to seriously think about retiring.  I've been there twenty-eight years; I'm thinking thirty years would be a nice cutoff point.  My thirtieth anniversary with the firm will also be the firm's hundredth anniversary.  It was founded in 1914 so that could be a nice little swan song time to be there through that.  So that's what I'm thinking, I haven't thought about seriously what I would do next other than I think I'd like to run a foundation, do foundation work.  I've created my own foundation which basically is just a flow through for my charitable contributions.  But I've interacted on the other side of the table asking for money of foundations and consulting foundations on how they can deliver against their mission more.  And so it may be time for me to sit on the other side of the desk and be the foundation person.
Story_ID: 641803
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done to this point in life, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could, if you go, could go back and change something?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't do anything differently. I wouldn't do anything differently.  I've had an amazing life, things I've could not have predicted and, you know, if I'd taken a turn here or taken a turn there maybe it would have been better, maybe it would have been worse but it's been a good life.  I've done so many unexpected things.  An engineer to do the stuff I do in the arts.  A black person from Houston, Texas to move to New York [New York] and do what I did in New York and now the things I'm doing in Washington [D.C.], it's just, it's just amazing.  It's such a blessing that I've had, so how could I even second guess the path I've gone; it's been fantastic.
Story_ID: 641804
Speaker 1: Once again when you look back at everything you've done what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think, I think the impact I've had on the arts in general especially in the African American space, Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York], Dance Theatre of Harlem [New York, New York], Evidence dance company.  All of those sorts of--those are things that now the African American museum, I'm one of the large donors to the, founding donors, to the African American museum--National Museum of African American History and Culture here at the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institute, Washington, D.C.].  I think having that impact on the arts so that the arts can be more understood, more available, more accessible to more people and not just to black people, but, so that black arts are available to more people in general because with that understanding of culture causes an understanding of how we interact with each other as individuals.  So I'm hoping that my hosting a dance company and underwriting that and the people that came and saw the dance and how they got a better sense of the African American experience through dance, through a museum, through interactions would enhance their lives and allow us all to collaborate better with each other on this earth.
Speaker 1: Okay. Who are some of the people in the arts world that have really made an impact on you and encourage you to do this?
Speaker 2: People like [HistoryMaker] Arthur Mitchell of the Dance Theatre of Harlem, younger people like [HistoryMaker] Thelma Golden of the Studio Museum in Harlem, [HistoryMaker] Lonnie Bunch at the National Museum for African American History and Culture. Tons of people. I, as I said I've always sort of emulated people, admired them sometimes from a distance, sometimes from up close.  [HistoryMaker] Susan Taylor is an amazing friend, and an amazing spirit and inspiration.
Story_ID: 641805
Speaker 1: We always ask this question: what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: A couple of concerns. One that we could as a people live up to our potential and not just as some individuals.  It's evident by the Tiger Woods, the Williams sisters [Serena Williams and Venus Williams], the, no matter where you go when we decided that we want to excel at something whether it's in business, Ken Chennault [Kenneth Chennault], Dick Parsons [HistoryMaker Richard Parsons]; whether it's in the arts, Alvin Ailey, [HistoryMaker] Arthur Mitchell; whether it's in sports and there are tons of sports examples but then there are you know huge numbers of our people that just quite aren't doing what they could do in life, aren't meeting their potential.  And I'm not saying they have an obligation to anybody other than themselves, but you know it's sad when you have the potential and don't live up to it.  So if we could just live up to our potential, (cough) no more than that.
Story_ID: 641806
Speaker 1: Tell us about your family.  I know you recently got married.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And it's an indication of a, of another interesting aspect to you that most people don't know.
Speaker 2: Exactly. So my then partner now husband, we've been together ten years and it's interesting how life has its things that happen.  It, had it not been for September 11th [September 11, 2001], I perhaps would not have met him because I'd gone to Milan [Italy] November 2001 after September 11th to speak in Milan about how the media handled September 11th in the states.  I was running the media entertainment practice at Booz Allen [Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.] at the time and when I was there a mutual friend introduced us.  I met him and that's how, you know, it all sort of started. And we kept the relationship going long distance all these years, he's still in Italy, living in Milan, I was in New York [New York] then, now in D.C. but every four to six weeks we'd find a way to be together.  We talk on the phone a lot, we use technology, and so when same sex marriage became legal in D.C. several years ago just, on the phone we were talking and he was saying we should do this and I said, "Well yeah, if you want to do it we should do it."  And so last November, November 26th [2011] we had a big wedding here in Washington, D.C. and it's been good being married.  Now he still lives in Milan, and I still live in Washington, D.C.; but it's a good relationship.
Story_ID: 641807
Speaker 1: Describe this wedding, 'cause i- you brought a book of pictures in, I've heard other people describe it.  What, seven hundred people there and it was a (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. It was sort of like a three day--it was almost like an Indian wedding or something.  It was like a three day celebration.  We did welcome reception on the Friday night the 25th I guess of November at this place here in D.C. called SAX, that is like a big almost like burlesque place.  It looks almost turn of the century, if you saw the movie 'Moulin Rouge' it looked like you stepped into a scene of 'Moulin Rouge.'  So we had four hundred of our--mostly out of town guests to come from that.  Then Saturday the wedding was at the National Building Museum [Washington, D.C.].  We had 750 guests and it was a series of reveals.  When the guests first came in they came through a tunnel with chandeliers and all these flowers, it was almost like my secret garden, you know, this flower thing.  They'd walk in and a chamber music ensemble is playing for them and they are served champagne and hors d'oeuvres.  The room is--in the middle of the National Museum is a big fountain, we built a bridge over the fountain adorned with all these flowers and then the seating was in the round around the fountain so it was like an amphitheater sort of seating.  Then we came in and the service was amazing.  A federal judge, friend of mine [HistoryMaker Vanessa D. Gilmore] officiated.  We had an opera singer from Washington, D.C., Samantha McElhaney to sing 'Ave Maria' [Franz Schubert].  We had recording artist Gordon Chambers who wrote 'I Apologize' for Anita Baker to sing the wedding song.  We had a Broadway diva Vivian Reed to sing, we had [HistoryMaker] Susan Taylor and her husband [HistoryMaker] Khephra Burns do a reading that they wrote.  And then when we were declared partners for life, we had confetti to fall--butterfly confetti to fall down, we had a singer to start singing "Joyful Joyful" from 'Sister Act' [sic. 'Sister Act 2'].  When they got to the chorus side the curtains opened we had a two hundred member choir from the rafters singing "Joyful Joyful".  It was just--in front of them was a forty foot tree--live tree with gilded bird cages with live birds in it.  It was sort of phenomenal then after the cocktails, we moved into dinner, a seated dinner for 750 with circular tables, rectangular tables, triangular tables, tables with trees coming out of the middle of it, it was just like amazing.  The bird theme I kept throughout.  We had aramis [ph.], limoges plates with bird patterns on it and bird cages on the tables.  The gift for the guests was a gold bird cage with chocolate birds in it.  The cakes--one cake was like Louis Vuitton luggage--stacked up Louis Vuitton luggage and if you went right up to it you would swear it was luggage but it was a cake.  The other was an aramis [ph.] cake with a peacock coming down the cake.  We had the Evidence dance company, who I'm chair emeritus to that board, to perform and then we said, "Guests we have one more surprise for you," I gave the microphone to Corey [Corey McCathern], my husband and he said, "Ladies and gentlemen, Diana Ross," and Diana Ross performed for the crowd.  It was really amazing because Diana Ross is fantastic and I knew people would love it and I thought it would be a great time.  But I had no idea that when she came out people would rush to the stage.  All these very dignified people went rushing--we had [HistoryMaker] Debra Lee and just all these amazing people, rushing--
Speaker 1: Debra Lee of BET [Black Entertainment Television]--
Speaker 2: Debra Lee of BET who could see Diana Ross anytime she wanted but people were just so excited.  The whole evening was just so exciting for everyone.  So we rushed up and she sang four songs.  She brought Corey and me onto the stage; we got to sing as well, it was just glorious.  Then when she left the band played on and people danced for several hours after that it was a great celebration.  The thing that was so refreshing for me was so many of my guests came to me afterwards and said as large as this wedding was it felt intimate.  That somehow you managed to make it feel intimate.  The way that you set the tables and who you placed at the tables and I did all the seating myself 'cause I knew 720 of the 750 people, about thirty were Corey's guests, and I knew some of his guests as well.  So I put interesting people at the table so you were so busy enjoying your table that you didn't realize that it was a huge room full of people that were there.  Everybody was so friendly and joyous and happy for Corey and myself and happy to be there it was really a joyous evening.  Then the next day we did a brunch on Sunday at The Kennedy Center [The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Washington, D.C.].  So I took the entire Terrace Restaurant [Roof Terrace Restaurant] at the Kennedy Center, we had four hundred people for a Sunday brunch. And the weather the whole weekend was seventy-five degrees in November; it was amazing, sunny, nice breeze, warm enough it was amazing.  So it was fun.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: So you probably heard a little bit about (cough)--'cause everybody was there, you know, has their story of some wonderful experience they had at the wedding.
Story_ID: 641808
Speaker 1: Yeah I just recently heard about it when we were doing this research, but--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you know, I said wow that's really a big deal.  Now you know in this country that we live in today gay marriage is big issue, and race is still an issue--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and for some being a nerd or engineer is an issue.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And so, I mean all these different distinctions, but you were able to do this and have a positive, you know, feedback from all the people that showed up.  I wonder when I hear the story of the wedding were you trying to expose people to a positive experience in terms of gay marriage (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I really wasn't and a lot of people took that away from it but I was neither trying to educate or convert people or expose people, I wasn't trying to show off by doing something glitzy.  I just wanted to have a nice event that I thought people would enjoy.  I mean I planned that for my guests as much as I planned it for myself.  And Corey [Corey McCathern] and I wanted to get married, we really just wanted it in front of our friends and these are all friends.  So I didn't invite dignitaries unless they were friends, these were just friends.  We just want to, in front of our family and friends, express our love and commitment for each other.  But I do things a certain way.  Anybody that knows me, there is a certain way I do things and so I'm going to do it the right sort of way.  When I knew the count was growing to 750 then I had to have the right space for it and I didn't want it to seem like we were in a big museum so I created this environment where you felt like you were in a cathedral with the up lighting of the columns.  You'll see from some of the pictures there that this was something I wanted to do.  But when we first decided to get married and decided that we weren't ashamed of being married, we had been together ten years so people knew that we were a couple, that we were going to go in and do a big wedding.  Our intention wasn't to say we're making this big statement now that same sex marriage is legal we're making this--that was not the intention at all.  A number of people, not in a negative way but in a positive way, took that away from it and saying wasn't that great of you to show that we're so proud, and that's not what we did.  As a result, no press were invited and press wanted to come--I had people that wanted to cover the whole thing and do like a reality thing, I said no.  I had press that came and tried to get in, I said no.  I had friends who were with the press that were invited and I said you're not covering this as press; you're coming just as a guest.  But still with YouTube--if people YouTube the Diana Ross thing, people would put pictures on Facebook and it turned into a thing and so we eventually had a website for the wedding.  We eventually put all the pictures on the website so anybody can go on the website and see several hundred pictures, can see the video of the wedding.  So it turned into a bit public thing but that was not the intention.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you have any thoughts about how the black community feels about gay marriage?  It seems like we're more conservative--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --than other communities which is surprising.
Speaker 2: But it's interesting because, and not exclusively because there are some people--some friends who do not believe in same sex marriage and did not come to the wedding and found a way--a nice way to say they love me, they're happy that I'm happy but their religion or whatever says this is something they can't support in that way by coming and being a part of it.  But I have always been treated like an exception by the world.  So I've quote unquote gotten away with things that other people seemingly couldn't get away with.  But I think it's because I've just always had courage, I've always been willing to do it and try it.  All I can do is fail and if I failed I learned something from that.  I think that started with my parents [Eva Jefferson Lee and Tommie Lee].  My parents told me that I was special, that I could do anything that I put my mind to, that if something didn't work out, it's because it wasn't supposed to work out not any fault of mine as long as I knew I tried my hardest.  They always told me I was smart and I was good and they made sure I was smart and I was good.  So with that, that confirmation and that affirmation from people that loved me and people that I loved the world couldn't do anything to me and what I found was other people would treat me the same sort of way.  Some admired me because I did dare to be and because I did it in a respectful way.  A number of people at the wedding said, you know I wasn't quite sure what I was going to see, I didn't know if it was going to make me feel uncomfortable they said but everything was done so appropriately, and it was a wedding--it was just a wedding.  It wasn't a gay wedding, it wasn't a black gay wedding, it wasn't a same sex marriage wedding, it was a wedding.  It was a celebration of love and so I think people have reacted to me for the most part in that way.  There are people that I'm sure have issues with me but they can keep that away from me.  I don't, they don't come into my space; I don't need them in my space.  But I have tons and tons of people that I think enjoy me being me, and encourage me to be me.
Story_ID: 641809
Speaker 1: We always ask about family in term- and I always ask about the parents if they are still around, but what would your parents have thought if they were around, I know they're not, they're not here now but they knew you were gay--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at a certain point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think my parents were always proud of me and they probably had their moments where they had to get it together and sort it out in their minds, but my father [Tommie Lee] said to me once that he would much rather have a gay son who is a productive citizen than to have a straight son who had illegitimate children, in and out of jail, not a good person, dishonest.  So if he had to choose--if he had his rathers I'm sure he'd rather me be a straight person who was honest and all that sort of stuff.  But, but he reconciled my choice himself and of course it was not a mystery to that.  I told you earlier that all the sort of manly, masculine things that one does, fixing cars and all that--doing sports, I didn't do any of that, right.   So always my parents knew I was not that type of man and my mother [Eva Jefferson Lee] would say that if anyone could make their child gay she probably did because I always had to speak a certain way, I always had to dress a certain way.  I never had a fight, she never wanted me to have a fight and I think my mother really--this is maybe horrible to say, I don't think she really liked men.  I think she grew up in a time where she fell in love with my father and a woman is supposed to have a husband and have children and that sort of stuff.  But I don't think she really liked men that much and I think she tried hard for me not to be one of those men that she wouldn't like.  And so, her conclusion was that may have been what made me gay but I never really spent a lot of time diagnosing, you know, why I became--I am gay maybe I was born that way, maybe I became that way, I don't really know.  But my family has been very accepting of me as being me, plain and simple.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, is there anything I have not asked you that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: You've been pretty thorough (laughter).
Story_ID: 641810
Speaker 1: The last question is similar to legacy it's just, just a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as a person that made an impact, that inspired and encouraged people to reach their potential, and that in some ways actually helped people to--substantively helped them to reach their potential.  A donation that if hadn't--I hadn't done it that wouldn't have happened, a conversation that I had, you know.  Letting them stay in my house as they were aspiring to be an actor.  It's just, I wanted to by virtue of the image that I project and the story that I tell and the life that I live, but also the things that I did to really help people reach their potential, black, white, green, orange, whatever.
Speaker 1: All right, thank you very much.
