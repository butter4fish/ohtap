Speaker 1: And we always ask five People magazine-ish questions.  So short answers, but I'd like to know your favorite food.
Speaker 2: My favorite food, I would say, is oxtail, prepared by someone specific, but oxtail, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, you have a unique place.  I have to go back through the archives and see if anyone else said oxtail.  A favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color would be navy blue.
Speaker 1: A favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: A favorite time of year I would say summer.  I love the heat and humidity.
Speaker 1: We're getting ready to head into it.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then, a favorite place to vacation?
Speaker 2: A favorite place to go I would say outside of Paris [France] is Giverny [France].
Speaker 1: And your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite phrase or saying would be God's will for me is my will for me.
Story_ID: 665651
Speaker 1: I want to start out by asking about your family background.  So, can you tell me, okay, can you tell me your mother's name?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I am protecting my family's privacy, of course, at their request, but I am from a family in Connecticut.  We are three generations in Connecticut on my mother's side and my father's family are from Florida, and they migrated to Connecticut.  So most of my family remains in Connecticut.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you grew up really in the North, then?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Your experience is a Northeastern experience?
Speaker 2: Northeastern experience for sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what town in Connecticut did you grow up in?
Speaker 2: So I lived in two cities primarily.  One is West Haven [Connecticut], which is a beach town at the time.  It's probably very different now, outside of New Haven [Connecticut], and then we moved to rural Connecticut, which is a town called Durham, Connecticut.
Story_ID: 665652
Speaker 1: And so what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I will say this of my family and--which is what my memories would be--we were a very active family so there was always something happening.  I mean, we had Sunday dinners every Sunday, you know, with aunts and uncles and grandparents and even great-grandparents.  So it was a very big, busy kind of active family.  So every christening, funeral, wedding, birthday was celebrated so we--lots of parties.
Speaker 1: But what is your earliest memory growing up?
Speaker 2: So, so I would say though that my earliest memory really would be, I always remember having family around.  Always remember my grandparents around and as I really think about it, you know, my first memory would really be that we were always surrounded by people.
Speaker 1: Okay, so at around holidays and weekends and things like that and eating and meals?
Speaker 2: Eating yes, yes, lots of music.  You know, since I can remember, you know, there's always been music played in our home and to this day, you know, the first thing I do in getting up in the morning is turn on music.  So, it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so, so what kind of music are we, you know, remind you of your childhood then?
Speaker 2: I would say mostly jazz and standards but we did listen to everything.  You know, lots of, just depending on what was happening in the mood, but for sure I would say the standout would be jazz and standards.
Speaker 1: So what songs, when you think about it, would take you back to that time?
Speaker 2: I think probably more artists than songs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Maybe I was too young to focus on a song but, you know, so, but as a kid to know who Ella Fitzgerald was or, you know, Billie Holiday, and those kinds of, you know song, [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson.  It was just understanding who those artists were in growing up.  On Sundays my mom would play Lou Rawls.  So, you know, it just depends on what's happening but those are the names that I grew up knew-ing even more than what the contemporary names were.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this music is sort of permeating the house in many ways (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: Always.
Story_ID: 665653
Speaker 1: The thing that we like to ask people is what sights, smells and sounds remind you of your childhood.  Can you take me back there and think, and I would--
Speaker 2: Okay, I would say, you know, sights would be, again, you know, especially being in rural Connecticut, so it was always about wooded and earthen and so on and so forth, and today I still love that kind of scenic, if you will.  Smell is always about food cooking, and I would say sound is, again, music and lots of people.  So, you know, we were--we are a very noisy family.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you say food, what kinds of food do you, do you think about?  I mean, I know you mentioned oxtails as one of your favorite, but what other, what kind of foods do you think of at the smell of food?
Speaker 2: And I would say oxtail came later in life and, you know, growing up my grandmother, for instance, baked a cake that she called one, two, three, four cake and it meant, one cup of this and two of something else.  So I can still remember what that would smell like if it's, you know, in the oven.  Somehow I remember the smell of coffee.  My mom did a lot of like sauces and so forth and so, you know, those are the kinds of smells that if I notice it now, take me back to growing up.
Story_ID: 665654
Speaker 1: What age were you when you moved out, the family moved to Durham [Connecticut]?  Is it Durham?
Speaker 2: Durham.
Speaker 1: Right, Durham.
Speaker 2: I was probably early teens.  So I would say maybe thirteen, fourteen.
Speaker 1: Okay, well I want to take you back a little earlier than--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, than early teens if you don't mind.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Because I'd like to--I'm, you know, wanting to know just, terms of a person's identity and formation and where you fit, where are you in the birth order?
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest, and, and much of what I'm sharing with you, actually, is prior to being age thirteen.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So I'm answering the questions based on as far back as I can remember, but I am the oldest.
Speaker 1: Oldest of how many children?
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest of five boys.
Speaker 1: Okay, oh, so all boys in your family?
Speaker 2: All boys, yes.
Speaker 1: So there's a lot of movement and everything with boys?
Speaker 2: Lo- and my first cousins are all boys so, for sure.
Story_ID: 665655
Speaker 1: And how far back do you know your family?  You mentioned you knew your grandparents?
Speaker 2: So I actually grew up knowing my maternal great-grandparents who died when I was--as an adult, really, a young adult, anyway.  And, and then I knew both sets of my grandparents, and particularly my paternal grandparents who lived very long, or my grandmother actually.
Speaker 1: That, now that is, that's a gift in that way (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Not many people have that, so the great-grandparents, do you know at what, great-grandparent, what their year of birth might have been?  Were they, do you know, were they right after slavery or right before?
Speaker 2: I would say, well the interesting thing about my maternal great-grandparents, I will share, is that they lived in Connecticut and so--and I am not certain in terms of year of birth as it relates to, you know, post or pre slavery.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they were in my lifetime, so I would think post.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm, and did they ever share stories?  Did you have, oh, you can't, we can't, it's just such a part of our interview, but did you have any stories shared about life in Connecticut among black people at that time?  And the time that would have preceded?
Speaker 2: You know it's interesting because I'm still curious about that in terms of how my great-grandparents, who would really have been perceived as an interracial couple for their era, lived in Connecticut.  So I don't know the answer to that.  I would say that I became more aware of that as an adult growing up because our family, you know, was very multicultural in the sense of who we married, et cetera, et cetera.  It never occurred to me that anyone was different.  I can really say that.  And then you become an adult, and you're in New York [New York], and you don't get a taxi and you realize there is some difference.  And so I became much more aware and committed to what those differences are as an adult.
Speaker 1: So you're saying you felt you were living in a colorblind society sort of or you were, there was so much diversity in your family that you didn't really notice difference as much, it's not just at what you're telling me?
Speaker 2: That is exactly what I'm saying.  That there was really not a focus growing up within my family by my parents nor our extended family that really talked about the differences between skin color and race.
Speaker 1: Okay, so who did you say would have been a multiracial or viewed or as a multiracial, you know, inter- you know, a mixed couple?
Speaker 2: My great-grandparents.
Speaker 1: Your great-grandparents?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, were they perceived or were they, where, or one was very fair skinned or what?
Speaker 2: One was very fair skinned.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, and you know, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's just that we don't have a lot of northern stories, you know, and so I'd like, I tend to like, you know, you have a lot of the southern migration stories but we--whenever, you know, we've done interviews in Portland [Oregon] and that was, you know, interesting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's interesting, that's north, yes, sure.
Speaker 1: --going back to the 1800s, you know, so you always try to take those opportunities where you can get them.
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: Hm, okay.  Got me handicapped here, okay.  So--
Speaker 2: Curve ball.
Story_ID: 665656
Speaker 1: I want to know who you are as a young boy and I'm looking at the ages like in, you know, seven to nine, you know, that, that, that time period.
Speaker 2: Seven to nine, okay.  You know what I remember in that period, one, is that having all brothers, and we are all very different, always have been very different, yet we are great friends, but just different.  And so even as early as seven and nine, I was kind of very individual in terms of my interest as a seven--you know.  My idea of sports, which hasn't changed much, is bike riding, as an example, so I remember that would be my sport, where my brothers played ball or did other things.  So, I don't know, I remember being very individual, being very different, sort of to myself, but not really.  I mean, I was not an introvert but I just had different interests for a seven or--to nine year old boy.
Speaker 1: Well you mentioned bike riding for sports, but what other interests did you have?
Speaker 2: So, I, even then, loved as I do, old movies.  So I guess I was born an old soul, you know, because I had this, I found old movies appealing.  Magazines, I went through all of my mother's fashion magazines even at that time.  I enjoyed school.  I enjoyed learning but, you know, but again, I was a very kind of private individual.  I also loved music so I remember even then loving music.  So it was a different way to grow up.  My mother teases me because she says that I would tell her, "Can you get these kids out of my bedroom?"  So, you know, somehow something was going on in my head.
Speaker 1: So you were sitting there looking at the old movies and I'd like you to sort of take it--so what are you seeing in those movies?  What's appealing to you?  What's drawing your attention?
Speaker 2: Well I liked the idea of watching black and white movies for some reason.  They were aesthetically appealing to me and what also was happening is my admiration for the fashion that is very much a part of those movies.  And so that was really what I found appealing although I may not have been able to intellectualize that at the time, but as I look back, that's what I enjoyed and, you know, it's still a very much--a part of me.
Speaker 1: So who were the actresses that you, you know, 'cause if you're watching black and white movies then, there's certain, and you're looking at people dressing or, you know, the fashion.  So who are the people that are appealing to you?
Speaker 2: So then it was Joan Crawford, of course, and Bette Davis, and you know, and then I remember knowing movies like 'Casablanca' and, and so forth and so it was a mix but I would say for sure I knew, I mean imagine you're nine years old and you know who Joan Crawford is.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's true (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Story_ID: 665657
Speaker 1: Where are you going to school then?  Where is elementary school and--
Speaker 2: So elementary school was for me in West Haven, Connecticut and then high school was in Durham, Connecticut, and my grandfather passed away and I went back to West Haven and graduated high school in West Haven because my [paternal] grandmother's home was in West Haven.
Speaker 1: Okay, so give me the, give me the school names, okay (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure.  I went to--I graduated from West Haven High School [West Haven, Connecticut] and the fun part about that is West Haven High School is one block away from the beach.  So, you know, that was always fun.  And then I went to school in Durham and my school there was called Coginchaug [Coginchaug Regional High School, Durham, Connecticut] and--
Speaker 1: Can you, can you spell that?  We would have a hard time.
Speaker 2: Yes, and I'm on the spot now and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --it's been many years but it is there to be found, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, Coginchaug (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Coginchaug, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's your elementary--
Speaker 2: A lot of the names in that area were named, you know, after Indian [Native American] associations.  So, the name was Coginchaug.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so what are--that's elementary?  Is there a junior high or--
Speaker 2: No, that's high school.
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: Both of those are high schools.
Speaker 1: Both of those are high schools?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, so I mean, I remember my middle school was Bailey [Harry M. Bailey Junior High School; Harry M. Bailey Middle School].  See, I do remember that, yes.  And so, yes--
Speaker 1: Do you remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and that was in West Haven.
Speaker 1: And the elementary, again, was?
Speaker 2: Carrigan [May V. Carrigan Intermediate School, West Haven, Connecticut].
Speaker 1: Was Carrigan, okay--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Carrigan, Bailey and then Coginchaug.
Speaker 2: Right, and we did things like, you know, my, you know, every year teachers would come to our home for dinner.  And, at the time, you know, there were some that I enjoyed and others not so much but those were sort of the traditions that in school at that time that my family did, invite teachers over for dinner.
Speaker 1: They did?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I've never heard of that.
Speaker 2: They did and they came, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 665658
Speaker 1: How large are the towns you're growing up in?  Just so I have some idea.
Speaker 2: I mean West Haven [Connecticut], at the time that we were there, I mean it was always a larger town but not as large.  And Durham [Connecticut] is a very small community and remains so.
Speaker 1: Okay, are we talking about like small thousands?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Durham is thousands and at West Haven is, you know--
Speaker 1: Hundred thousand, or a hundred--
Speaker 2: Maybe a hundred thousand.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And so what is the racial makeup?  Can I understand that--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --of the areas that you're living in?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, initially growing up in West Haven, it's hard for me to answer that question in terms of what that real ratio might be.  I would say that in the high school [West Haven High School, West Haven Connecticut], it was maybe, I don't know, at the time that I was there, 20 percent people of color.  And in Durham, I think my brothers and I, maybe one other family, were the only people of color.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.  So the teachers coming--invited to come are white teachers?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I've never had a black teacher.
Speaker 1: Why--that happened to me too.  I don't think I had a black teacher growing up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --but I, you know, but, okay.  So how, so these are the things that are sort of forming you.  What about holidays or vacations?  Let me ask church first.  Are you a churchgoing family?
Speaker 2: Not especially, I would say.  You know, I was confirmed Catholic and then I would go to church, which was not Catholic, with my grandparents and, you know, I went through a period of, you know, seeking religion for myself but I would say, but as a family, we are not especially--
Speaker 1: Okay, religious, okay.
Speaker 2: --religious.
Speaker 1: So, wait a minute.  So your grandparents were, where were they going?  They were not Catholic--they were Catholic?
Speaker 2: On my, well my maternal grandparents were Catholic and my paternal grandparents, I'm not sure what they were.  They were Christian, a more traditional church, but not necessarily Baptist.  I'm really not sure what they were.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And it wasn't a very strict environment but it was certainly different than Catholic.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now what, what about holidays, but--holidays?  What about holidays?  Are you, is Christmas a big holiday in the family?  Are all holidays or--
Speaker 2: I would say in our family, particularly, my maternal family, every holiday is a worthy cause for celebration.  And so, yes, Christmas, et cetera, are holidays but I think they were opportunities for everyone to get together.  So they were observed in that sense, but I will add, again, you know growing up, every Sunday was a holiday pretty much but certainly all the other holidays were observed but not for traditional reasons in terms of religious reasons per se, but I think as times to gather.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you know what, so, but you have all boys.  This is the thing.  You have all boys.  Okay, all boys (laughter).
Speaker 2: So my mom has all boys.  Her only brother, all boys, and her only sister, all boys.  So all first cousins are boys.
Speaker 1: That's highly unusual, too.
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: Wow, okay.  We had all girls.  It wasn't a boy in sight.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And so there you have it.
Story_ID: 665659
Speaker 1: Do you take family vacations or really it's the gatherings around?  Do you, does your family, is your family like summer vacations or things like that?
Speaker 2: I mean growing up, we would go to the Cape [Cape Cod, Massachusetts], usually.
Speaker 1: Oh, you would, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Where on the Cape?
Speaker 2: Mostly Dennis [Massachusetts] and so forth.  And we would also go to New Bedford [Massachusetts].  What I didn't mention is that my mother's father is Cape Verdean, and so you know, New Bedford is sort of the haven.  So we would also go to New Bedford--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for holidays and vacations.
Speaker 1: And that's your mother's, you said--
Speaker 2: Father.
Speaker 1: Father.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, Cape Verdeans don't always think of themselves as black people either.
Speaker 2: I know that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yes, you're on point, yes.
Speaker 1: No, because I, I, first became aware of Cape Verdeans when I went to school out East--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, so--
Speaker 2: I would say that's true.  I mean that is certainly true of my grandfather's family.  I don't agree with them but that is definitely their philosophy.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Yeah, which is interesting 'cause they've got all the--I don't know what they see when they see themselves.
Speaker 2: I don't know what they see and, you know, the Cape Verde island is, you can see Africa, so I'm not certain what that thought process is, but, anyway.
Speaker 1: Well, it's, it's the same concept around Creole culture too who don't, you know, they see themselves as a culture and not--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --African Americans.
Speaker 2: And, and even though I'm saying it's, to all my Cape Verdean cousins, I do love you (laughter).
Speaker 1: But what, what tell me about though Cape Verdean culture.  What is it?  I know there's the food.
Speaker 2: The food is a big part of the culture and family is a big part of the culture.
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2: I mean, I think a lot of the--when I talk about our family celebrating, I mean, a lot of it certainly stems from, from that within the culture, for sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause, you know, I've interviewed several people.  In fact, there's a judge [HistoryMaker George N. Leighton] in Chicago [Illinois], he's now 100, and he--okay, he's 100 but he--
Speaker 2: And he's Cape Verdean?
Speaker 1: He's Cape Verdean--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he actually went back and traced his family and they found out that they had, they were slave runners, like they had helped transport slaves, but he went on to a very prestigious--he went to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts]--
Speaker 2: Great.
Speaker 1: --not even having finished high school.  He used to work in the cranberry bogs.  Okay, enough.
Story_ID: 665660
Speaker 1: Okay so what other things are forming you?  Like, how are you doing in school?  I mean, I'm just trying to sort of, okay, I know you like bicycle riding, school you like, watching black and white movies but--
Speaker 2: Magazines.
Speaker 1: Magazines (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fashion magazines.  Well I liked--I shouldn't just limit it to fashion magazines.  I also loved looking at, you know, at that time it was called House and Gardens [sic. House and Garden], I think or something, so it seemed that things that were aesthetic, appealed to me, and so, I spent a lot of time doing that and I also remember even maybe as early as thirteen years old, I had an opinion on what my mother would wear or what my [paternal] grandmother would wear.  And at some point, they actually listened.  So I think that also is part of what I think your term was formed me, but certainly that helped.
Speaker 1: Now were you, you, did you ever draw or anything?  Where are you getting your aesthetic?  I mean, how is that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I did sketch.  I--what's funny that I remember is, remember the old, in biology you got the anatomy of the body?  I would always sketch over mine.  So, but the point is, I always sketched, at least from that point on, I should say.
Speaker 1: So you were, you would be maybe in class with your pencil--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, or in private times just sketching and keeping, so you--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --so the visual was actualizing in that way?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, for sure.
Speaker 1: And, and so how are you as a student?
Speaker 2: I think I was a good student.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I mean I was probably a, in some areas, a B student.  There, I had some As and I'm sure I had some Cs, but I'm sure that I was a good student.  I mean, I enjoyed learning.  I enjoyed the exposure and the activity that was extended with learning, for sure.
Speaker 1: And are there expectations for you as the oldest, you know?  Is there any messaging about what a role model or things you have to be?  Was there any of that?
Speaker 2: I would say that the expectation was not necessarily because I was the oldest, but the expectation was, you know, to do whatever it is you select to do and to do it well and that you can do anything.  So I don't think that I felt the pressure of being the oldest as much as I felt the pressure of excelling.
Story_ID: 665661
Speaker 1: I read also that one of your other favorite programs was 'I Love Lucy' and so, everybody loves (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Everyone loves Lucy [Lucille Ball].
Speaker 1: --Lucy, but that that had formed you, you know, in many ways.
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: And, you know, and so what, what attracted you to her?  And--
Speaker 2: You know, I like that question and I think that what attracted me to Lucy is, for one, her sense of humor.  I enjoy being happy and I enjoy laughing and even to this day, most mornings I start out by watching an 'I Love Lucy' episode or two, absolutely.  But I think growing up, you know, Lucy was--I loved the way she dressed and I loved--there was something very familiar, maybe because Ricky [Ricky Ricardo] was Cuban and, you know, it just, there was something about it that felt very familiar.  And so, it's just always been something very dear for me.
Speaker 1: Because he--they're like an odd couple.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And that, I mean, just odd in all kinds of ways.  She's got her red hair, you know, he's got his accent.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: And this--and this ends up being one of the most popular TV shows.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, and you know, they had music happening and, I don't know, it, there's something about it that resonates for me, still.
Speaker 1: And then when I think about it because the coup- their best friends were more classically American.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but they are the stars and they're not?
Speaker 2: And they're not, and they're interesting and they're funny and, you know, I love it.
Speaker 1: And so what do you have, since you're such a 'I Love Lucy' fan, do you have a favorite episode or anything or?
Speaker 2: Well, obviously, my favorite episode would be, one of my favorites, is when they're in Paris [France] and she wants an original couture garment and Ricky has someone make something for her in burlap.  Do you remember that episode ["Lucy Gets a Paris Gown"]?  So, I thought that was very funny and someday I'm going to find a way to use that in a show.
Speaker 1: That's cute.  No, I remember that.  I mean, it's just really good--and you know what in preparation for this, I was, I went, you know, looked and it's like Max Factor [Max Factor, Jr.] was her, you know her makeup artist, the original makeup--
Speaker 2: Yes, and probably Mr. Factor.
Speaker 1: Right, Mr. Factor, himself.
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: And then I think her stylist was--
Speaker 2: Something, Stevenson or something.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So I found that, you know, 'cause you're thinking, yeah, Edward Stevenson.
Speaker 2: Edward Stevenson was the costumer, yes.
Speaker 1: And then there was also Elois Jenssen and she got--

Speaker 1: In your household, because the time period that you are growing up is very heavy in the Civil Rights Movement, what is, what are the discussions occurring or are there discussions occurring?  I know you, you know, is that a subject of discussion in your household?
Speaker 2: It was not a subject discussion in our household in our presence.  So if it were a discussion that my parents and grandparents had, I think in their mind they thought they were protecting us from it.  And so, really, it wasn't until the movement crystallized with the assassination of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], et cetera, that I remember we were brought into that dialog.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so you're, by that time, you are--
Speaker 2: So that was in '68 [1968], was it?
Speaker 1: Right, '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: So, I was, I don't know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not twelve, but eleven.
Speaker 2: Eleven, yes, yes.

Speaker 1: In junior high [at Harry M. Bailey Junior High School; Harry M. Bailey Middle School, West Haven, Connecticut], there's still, you're still interested in drawing and things like that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: And, and what about, what about high school?  What is happening in high school when you go 'cause you go to the one high school, how many years?
Speaker 2: So, I, I went, I think it was three and one.  Three years in Durham [at Cognichaug Regional High School, Durham, Connecticut] and then went to West Haven High [West Haven High School, West Haven Connecticut] as a senior.
Speaker 1: Well that's hard.
Speaker 2: Well it was hard but it was okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For me.  I mean, I don't remember it feeling hard.  I mean the hard part was I didn't graduate with my friends in Durham, but my [paternal] grandmother was a widow when I then went to be with her and, you know, it was fine.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: And I had lived in West Haven [Connecticut] so it was not as though I didn't know anyone.
Speaker 1: Now are you particularly close to your grandmother?  The one you went to live with?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was--
Speaker 2: She--she passed away a few years ago.
Speaker 1: Oh, she did, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what role did she play in your life?
Speaker 2: She also, again when I mentioned that my mother and my grandmother would take my opinion, so this particular grandmother for certain, I remember her taking me as a young, I don't know, maybe I was thirteen and she would take me shopping with her to this store.  I still remember the name of it, called Kramer's [New Haven, Connecticut], and Kramer's was where, you know, at that time was the best store in the area where my grandmother lived and they had valet parking and you had lunch in the dressing room.  So she exposed me to that and models walking around and, (cough) excuse me, and I realized that that's, I still think that's normal but she gave me, as a young boy, that early kind of exposure.  And even though everything she bought was on sale, it was the idea and the style in which she did it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is sort of an important note.  So, I mean, since we can't talk about family, but the thing is you're being exposed--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you're not being taken to Sears and Roebuck [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] like me--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --in the Midwest.  You're not, you're being taken to a high end--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --store. And being exposed to the, the appearance, the presentation--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --the types of clothes--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --the service.
Speaker 2: And you know I remember that, you know, my grandmother being a person of color, obviously, there were not a lot of people shopping in the store and the other thing I learned from her was to be comfortable, even in that environment.  And so, I didn't know what she was doing at the time in terms of cultivation, but as I look back I, I give her credit for that.
Speaker 1: Now did you have ex- so you're grandmother liked nice things I take it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my grandmother's thing was, you know, even if you bought three dresses a year, they should be like the best you can do and so I learned that from her.
Speaker 1: So was your mother like that too?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mom also has great taste but my grandmother, you know, my mom was being a mom.  So, obviously--
Speaker 1: And she's got five boys.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  So those kinds of, you know, luxury outings were left to grandparents.
Speaker 1: That's right, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so, what, when you, what outfits, what did she tend to like to wear because she's really, she's articulating the same way my parents, you know, were stationed in France and it was always, you know, buy one or two out- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --buy a quality outfit, wear it, you know, it'll last longer--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --so, are you, this is the messaging you're getting.
Story_ID: 665664
Speaker 1: What is the fashion at--'cause the fashion also during this time, you have the classic fashion but you also, you're starting to live, but you're still young.  You know, but you're starting to see new fashions come on.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The miniskirt comes on, the pedal, we had pedal pushers back then.  They called them pedal--now they call them capri, right, or something like I think.
Speaker 2: Capri, I think, yes.  It sounds so much nicer.
Speaker 1: Okay, but so what are the things that are catching your eye and what, what is your--how is your eye developing?
Speaker 2: Great, you're forcing me to think about this, and I would say, you know my [paternal] grandmother and my mom always gravitated toward more classic, cleaner lines and things that were timeless.  And I, that's my aesthetic, even as a designer, and certainly I would have to say, you know, much of it comes from that kind of exposure.  So they were never people who liked garments with a lot of stuff on them.  You know, my--they always loved a great black wool dress as an example.  And, you know, and for me that's still my sensibility.
Speaker 1: Okay, and are you, so what are you thinking you want to be then?  Because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A designer.
Speaker 1: So you, when did you claim that you wanted to be a designer?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I was probably, you know, if I had to put a number on it, I may have been as young as thirteen.
Speaker 1: So, are you sewing at all?
Speaker 2: No, at that point I'm just really absorbing it all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, acquiring this opinion and becoming very opinionated and, but not, not manifesting it in terms of technique and study.
Speaker 1: Okay, so are you, are you, do you know about designers at this age?  At what point are you aware of any designer names?
Speaker 2: So at that age, I knew the name of Coco Chanel and I knew Edith Head because of the movies.  I knew Coco Chanel but also, you know, but I learned about them from books because it wasn't as though we had, oh my god, am I saying this out loud, but it's not as though we had access to the Internet where you Googled someone or put their name in and you can find out everything there is to know and see their work.  So, this was really a lot of knowledge that I acquired through books and reading.
Speaker 1: So, yeah, 'cause Edith Head was a big name back then.
Speaker 2: She was a big name back then and I remember, you know, seeing her name in the credits for some of the movies so then I would look her up in the library and then look at all her work and I can't even remember, I think I learned of Coco Chanel because of the perfume and then--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Yes, and just sort of did that research.  And I liked that she was radical, so.
Speaker 1: So you even knew enough about her as a person to know that she was radical at the time?
Speaker 2: Yes, because of reading.
Speaker 1: I see, oh, okay.  So, how was it decided, so who are you talking to that's like you?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: I mean--
Speaker 2: --basically no one.  So when I said I was a loner, it's like who do you have this conversation with?  You know, certainly not my dear brothers.  If anything, you know, from time to time, I would share something with my mom or my mom would say, "Oh, come watch this movie with me," you know, and point things out in terms of what someone is wearing or whatever.  But, but in terms of peers, really no one.
Story_ID: 665665
Speaker 1: What about high school [Coginchaug Regional High School, Durham, Connecticut]?  Is there anyone in high school?  Are you gravitating to the kids that are more artistic or are there, are there those that, in the school or--
Speaker 2: In high school, I made friends because I became part of the choral department.  And so, what I did in terms of interacting really was based around the music department.  And in terms of my own real passion for design, again, was something that I was very private about.
Speaker 1: So what, what role, what vocal, what range are you?  Are you tenor or--
Speaker 2: Then I was a tenor but now that I'm grown up, I'm a baritone (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's a range.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, so, would your choral group, were you a competitive choral group in high school?  I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We were, we were actually damn good, I should say, and we had our music professor was excellent.  You know, he was Juilliard [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York] trained and so I think that he saw us that way and he was demanding that way.  So you had to, you know, train if you were going to be in the chorus, et cetera, et cetera, and what do you call it when you--audition, so it wasn't just an elective that you could take.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so would you participate in choral competitions around?
Speaker 2: We did, we had state competitions and so forth, for sure, and we--then I graduated to the a cappella chorus which was, you know, so that was fun.
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you can sing a cappella, that's, it's so beautiful, a cappella.
Speaker 2: It's, it's, so you could imagine what he was like, but that was really my interest in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And no, was there a theatre department?  No theatre?
Speaker 2: There was a theatre department and I did participate, you know.  I remember I was in a play called 'Curse You, Jack Dalton' [Wilbur Braun].  It's funny that I should remember that, but, I didn't get the part of Jack Dalton, I got instead the part--I was the bad guy, which turned out to be more fun.
Story_ID: 665666
Speaker 1: What are you thinking?  Is your focus on going to college?  And what, I mean, are you gravitating at all to New York [New York] at that point?
Speaker 2: I'm definitely gravitating to New York at that point, in high school, and we, you know, as a family, we would visit New York, so I was very much aware of New York and found the energy of New York more appealing, more at home for me.  So, I knew that I would live in New York.  I, you know, always loved when we would come to New York and spend time.  We had family here and so forth, so, we'd come in and we'd go shopping or visit family.  It was always wonderful.
Speaker 1: Okay, so why, you end up going to the University of Connecticut [Storrs, Connecticut], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So why University of Connecticut as opposed to, you know, Parsons [Parsons School of Design, New York, New York] or--
Speaker 2: Well, the truth is, at that time, remember I'm in school in Connecticut and, you know, there really isn't a fashion curriculum in, you know, the schools that I attended.  So Parsons or FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York] was not really in their rolodex, so therefore it was never really advised, I would say, and UConn wanted me and so that's how I ended up at UConn.
Speaker 1: Now, UConn is how, how large a school is it?
Speaker 2: It's large.  It's one of the larger schools in Connecticut up in Storrs [Connecticut].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The campus is very large, although it's very rural.
Speaker 1: Oh, it's rural?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --very much so, but it's large.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, when you say large, ten thousand, twenty thousand?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, not that large.
Speaker 1: Okay, not that large.
Speaker 2: Not that large.
Speaker 1: That's what I thought (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean everything is relative because, you know, in my high school there was maybe two hundred people so, you know, that was large.
Speaker 1: Two hundred people in your high school in Durham [Coginchaug Regional High School, Durham, Connecticut]?
Speaker 2: In Durham, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's large.
Speaker 1: So when you, so when are you deciding you want to major in then?
Speaker 2: So I--
Speaker 1: You get a scholarship?
Speaker 2: No, I left school, I dropped out.  I majored in marketing, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Wait, you dropped out of--
Speaker 2: UConn.
Speaker 1: UConn?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: After how long?
Speaker 2: After, not long, and the reason is that I, I don't know, was not--
Speaker 1: It was not filling your desire?
Speaker 2: It wasn't, no.
Speaker 1: You couldn't see a purpose?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, and I then was sketching millinery.  I'm not sure how I got to that, but I was sketching hats and was offered a position which we'll get to, early, and so I decided to take that opportunity.  So I took that route.
Speaker 1: So what year do you drop out of UConn?  What year is that?
Speaker 2: Um, I don't know, sometime, it must have been late '70s [1970s] maybe.
Speaker 1: Okay, late '70s [1970s], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: And you, so you're sketching millinery?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I'm sketching millinery.  I dropped out of UConn, I went to--took courses at University of New Haven [West Haven, Connecticut], I think it was, just because I, you know, my parents were like, "You can't get out of school."  So, sort of to pacify that, I took courses at University, excuse me, of New Haven, UNH, and still studying business and marketing, was what I was studying, which you can imagine was not my--
Speaker 1: Your thing.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Marketing would be closer than--
Speaker 2: Closer, but the business, you know, it was a business, marketing curriculum.
Story_ID: 665667
Speaker 1: Do you finish there or do you then--you take these courses, then what are you doing at that point?
Speaker 2: I'm sketching.
Speaker 1: You're sketching, and how (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm sketching.
Speaker 1: And how, how long do you sketch and what is your book looking like after a while?
Speaker 2: It's, it's, it's getting big and then you know friends of, for instance, particularly my [paternal] grandmother's friends, some of the ladies would say, "Oh, can you make this hat for me?"  And so, I scouted and found a small factory [Albrizio, Inc.] in New York [New York] and actually had no clue what I was doing, really, but went into the factory with sketches and Ann, was the name of the woman who owned the factory, and she sort of guided me along and said, well, "From this, is what you have to do to get to the next step."  And so her name was Ann Albrizio, and she really was the person who took me from that point A to point B.
Speaker 1: So are you, you're eighteen or you're nineteen?
Speaker 2: I'm, no I'm probably then--
Speaker 1: Twenty (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Twenty-one, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So were you working like odd jobs in sketching?  Is that during--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that period of time?
Speaker 2: That is correct.  That is exactly what I was doing.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And living at home.  So it was, you know--living with my grandmother I should say.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, absolutely what I was doing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I came into New York, Ann took me under her wing and Ann was teaching as well at FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And so, under Ann's direction, I went to FIT for millinery.
Speaker 1: So that is, so that was a fortuitous find?
Speaker 2: For sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) divine order looking out for me and I didn't even know it at the time.
Speaker 1: So you, how did you find Ann?  You looked it up in the Yellow Pages?
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly, because, again, women in Connecticut were saying, "Oh, I love that picture," or sketch, whatever, the drawing, "and if you could make that for me, I will buy it from you."  So that was a challenge.
Speaker 1: But how do you think at that point, well 'cause you don't sew, you're thinking I have to find someone who'll make this?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have to find out how do you make a hat.  I mean I know how to sketch it but how do you actually make it?  How do you find the material and how do you mold it?  And so I found her company as a manufacturer in the Yellow Pages.
Speaker 1: So did, the other question I have is if you, if, she must have seen something--did she tell you what she saw in you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  She felt that, you know, she said, "Wow, I haven't seen sketches like this," and et cetera, et cetera, "and you have a knack for this."  You know, she was this little Italian woman and she was always very animated and, (gestures) "You have a knack for this."  But she insisted you have to go to school and, you know, so she was really my fairy godmother at the time.
Story_ID: 665668
Speaker 1: She made it possible for you to go to FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: She did.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did you have to apply or did you get, based on her recommendation instead?
Speaker 2: I think her recommendation, you know, was very influential in terms of me getting in so quickly.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so you entered, so do you enter as a freshman--how is--what--
Speaker 2: So, no, I had credits and, you know, she said, "You should just really go in for the two year course and study millinery," pattern making and, you know, the technical part of it.  So that's exactly what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how did you find the program then?  'Cause you're coming in and having done a lot of sketches?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and I found it to be--I just wanted to get what I needed.  I didn't feel like a student in the sense of, you know, finding my way because at that point I felt like I at least was clear about what it is I needed to do.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you had been doing all those sketches at that time?
Speaker 2: Right, and at that point, you know, with Ann's [Ann Albrizio] help, I had actually made millinery and sold it, so--
Speaker 1: Oh, so you had already sold the hats that people--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --were interested in you making?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you had already really become a milliner?
Speaker 2: Yes, a milliner, yes.
Speaker 1: Milliner, okay, and you were just fine tuning maybe a few of your skills?
Speaker 2: Exa- the technical part of the skill exactly, particularly pattern making.
Speaker 1: Uh-hm, and it's important to have, I think, that pedigree behind because--
Speaker 2: Oh, for sure.
Speaker 1: --the school is so well recognized.
Speaker 2: And it is important to have that, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Were there any other contacts there that were helpful or proved to be helpful later on or not?
Speaker 2: As it relates to the school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean, I think that when you are in a classroom setting like that that is particularly focused on a craft, that it's a great clinic.  So, I think overall the environment is stimulating and I remember thinking that, for sure.
Story_ID: 665669
Speaker 1: Now what happens next?
Speaker 2: So what happens next really happened quite quickly in that in terms of my professional life, what happened is that Nolan Miller, we're now in the '80s [1980s], and I had worked a few years on my own as a milliner, and--
Speaker 1: Now where are you working as a milliner?
Speaker 2: Out of Ann's shop [Albrizio, Inc.] in New York [New York], and, but selling primarily in Connecticut.  So I'd take the train, come in make it, and then--so Nolan Miller saw some of my work and in a shop in Los Angeles [California] called Lonette Millinery [Lonette Millinery Company], and Ann [Ann Albrizio] had connected me to Lonette Millinery because Lonette did a particular kind of manufacturing, which is where he would sew starbright, which is the name of a braid.  So, Nolan Miller saw some of those hats in Lonette.  Nolan was shopping for millinery to use on the television show, 'Dynasty' and Lonette said, "I can't sell you these hats, they belong to a millinery designer out of New York but I can connect you," and that was really how I got to meet Nolan Miller, and ended up doing millinery for 'Dynasty.'  So that was, again, divine order looking out.
Speaker 1: Divine order in a huge way because--
Speaker 2: In a huge way, yes.
Speaker 1: --because--so he, just this random, you know, exposure to your work, and then, the next thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --so, how did that work then?  I mean, he--you got a call, I'm just, tell me--
Speaker 2: So, so, yes, so, well Lonette said to me that, "Nolan Miller, who's the costumer for 'Dynasty' is interested in your work and I gave him your number."  And actually he gave him the number at Ann's, here in New York, "And he will be calling you."  And, indeed, he personally called and said that he was coming to New York like the following week or something and if I could make some samples to show him.  He arranged for us to meet at their New York office, which was on Rockefeller Plaza, I remember that, or Center [Rockefeller Center], whatever it is, and so I whipped up however many hats.  A friend of mine who was helping me out in Connecticut, a woman by the name of Audrey [Audrey Potts], assumed the role of my manager and Audrey and I, with my hats, run, took the train, we were wherever that office was, at the appointed time, which was in the morning I remember, and when we arrived, the woman who greeted us said, "Oh, Mr. Miller is going to be delayed.  If you want to just leave the hats, your samples, I will be sure that he sees them."  And Audrey said, "No problem, we'll wait, but we're not leaving the samples."  Very fabulous woman of color, as a matter of fact.  And she said, "No, we're not leaving the samples, but we'll wait, you know, no problem."  So we waited and Nolan walked in the reception area upon his arrival and the first thing he said was, "Oh my god, I'm so late and I'm meeting a designer.  Is he here?"  So I'm hearing this, which was a disconnect from what she had said to us.  Anyway, funny, but he took us in to the conference room, I took out all the samples and he said, "I'd love to give you the opportunity to work with us."  And it just really happened like that.  I mean, there were contracts that followed and so on and so forth.
Speaker 1: So what year is this?
Speaker 2: So this is '80s [1980s].  I'm not exactly certain of the year, but this is '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Okay, 1980.  So 'Dynasty' began in 1981, I think.  I think it's, I mean, I have it some place.
Speaker 2: Right, okay.
Speaker 1: It began in 1981.  Do you know what, what the, how long in its existence had it been, you know?
Speaker 2: I, you know, I--really, I don't remember prior to my getting involved where it began and how many seasons, for instance, it had been on the air.  You know, that wasn't something that I paid attention to.  And quite frankly, I didn't even realize even being associated with 'Dynasty' how big that was.  For me, I was just thrilled that someone liked my work and that I had this opportunity and, you know, then I was actually young (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, you know, it was for me more about the opportunity to work.
Speaker 1: Right, and you probably weren't--because it was a very popular program but the age group was a little--but it was a very popular--
Speaker 2: Very popular and what I--what did happen subsequently is that because it became such a big deal, and everyone wanted a piece of 'Dynasty,' you know, for every ribbon cutting and so on and so forth.  So, you know, I was at least among those that, at times, got sent out to represent the show in some little town somewhere to cut a ribbon or attend a charity event or something.  So, and even, you know, I was just like behind the scenes.  I mean, Nolan was the costumer.  He got the credit, not I, but it was still enough for someone in Kansas somewhere that someone like me would be there to be--participate in whatever the event was.
Story_ID: 665670
Speaker 1: What is the contract?  What is the relationship?  And what is the deal that you enter into?
Speaker 2: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because this is a major television program?
Speaker 2: Major television program and I certainly wasn't as sophisticated then as I am now, but fortunately Audrey Potts was very sophisticated and she really negotiated the deal and what was great about it is that we were allowed to produce a line called, I think it was B Michael for the 'Dynasty' TV series [ph.] and so that was a commercial line and it was a licensed line and that was really the source of our revenue.
Speaker 1: Now Audrey, her last name is Pott- Potts?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How had you known her and what was her background?
Speaker 2: So Audrey really supported a lot of nonprofits.  She was an art collector.  I mean a very, you know, sort of active woman socially and we met, I'm sure through one of her projects.  I think we had some shared friends that she did a project for in Connecticut and that was actually how we met as I'm thinking about it.
Speaker 1: So she, she was more, she had so- she was older, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so she was, she saw talent in you and she was hel- helping--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to negotiate the deal?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this deal, like are you producing, what were the deliverables?  Were you producing so many, I mean so many a season?  Or--
Speaker 2: There were, no, there were not constraints in that way and Nolan [Nolan Miller] really had the last word in terms of what was actually being worn on the air.
Speaker 1: So you would, you might put together (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right--
Speaker 1: --certain--
Speaker 2: --and he could decide that we're not using it.  However, what we were able to do was to reproduce millinery that was offered out of their showroom on 7th Avenue [New York, New York] and that was a licensed relationship with 'Dynasty.'
Speaker 1: That is amazing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was amazing.
Speaker 1: That's an amazing. I've never heard of anyone, I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, at--that was, that was the part that was great.
Story_ID: 665671
Speaker 1: So what comes next then with that given, I know the--I read about Mrs. Johnson, but this is sort of separate from?
Speaker 2: Well Mrs. Johnson sort of came along around--just after that time.  I--
Speaker 1: And we're talking about Mrs. Eunice Johnson?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, the Mrs. Johnson, for me.  Anyway, so one of these hats that was actually a 'Dynasty' hat, never worn on the show, but I, I don't know, Mrs. Johnson somehow, I think a store in Chicago [Illinois] maybe carried the line or something, and Mrs. Johnson called the New York [New York] showroom to say that every Easter season they do millinery editorial on the pages in the magazine, for instance in like the March issue or something, and could we send her some hats that she could consider as part of that editorial.  And that was really the opening of our relationship.  And she herself called and I spoke with her and that was like really very magical for me because I, of course, at that point knew very much who Mrs. Johnson was and Ebony.
Speaker 1: So what did she say?
Speaker 2: So she just said, "You know, I am putting together my editorial--." "This is Eunice Johnson," I'm looking at the phone, and she said, you know, "I'm putting together my editorial and I've seen some of your hats and I like them and can you put together some, an assortment, and send me, you know, maybe three or four hats and I will consider them as part of the editorial."  And she actually used all of the hats that I sent her.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: One of the hats became the Fashion Fair [Ebony Fashion Fair] poster and I think that, I don't know, we received over two hundred phone calls from that ad in the New York showroom.

Speaker 1: When you say recent, I know that it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was--
Speaker 1: --in existence in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: I know it was in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I, this is all around the '80s [1980s] we're talking about--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --'cause the '80s [1980s] are when you're, you know, designing for 'Dynasty,' so I, and you know, and then you get involved with Mrs. Johnson [Eunice Johnson] in the '80s [1980s].  So--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --so I just--because the reason I ask is I had read that she invited you to be her guest at Fashion Week [New York Fashion Week] and to--
Speaker 1: But, I was her guest but not for Fashion Week.  I was her guest for Fashion Fair [Ebony Fashion Fair].
Speaker 2: Oh, Fashion Fair, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So Fashion Fair you were her guest.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And so she introduced you to people--so where were you her guest in the, where--
Speaker 1: So she, at this stage, Mrs. Johnson and I have a relationship.  So she was coming into New York [New York] because Fashion Fair was doing their event here and she called to invite me to attend with her as her guest to the New York event and it was, you know, so exciting and so much fun to be there with her and all the attention.
Speaker 2: So you, you're in your twenties, right?  Your late twenties?
Speaker 1: I'm in my late twenties at that point--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --probably, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, and so her introducing you then, are there, you're, where is your clientele still coming from 'cause at one point your clientele was Connecticut clientele?
Speaker 1: Yes, and, and at that point, still the majority of my client--for millinery was from Connecticut, however, I started selling to independent stores throughout the country.  So, for instance, we were in Chicago [Illinois] as an example.  But we were really selling the millinery out of the New York showroom around the country.
Speaker 2: So what are you learning about the business of fashion at this point?
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: 'Cause it's production, it's the, it's--
Speaker 1: It is production and it was millinery at the time so it was a different kind of production and we did it all out of Ann's [Ann Albrizio] factory [Albrizio Inc., New York, New York] with the exception of the sewing which was still being done through Lonette [Lonette Millinery Company, Los Angeles, California], but mostly it was, for me, still about the art and about the opportunity to, to do it and frankly, I wasn't as focused on the business.
Speaker 2: So you, so, you were just happy because you were doing what you loved to do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: --and you were giving--
Speaker 1: I mean I'm in my twenties and, you know, although innately I knew that I would be a designer, I did not know that I would, you know, fast forward so quickly.  And so, all of that for me I remember feeling was like enough and to now think about it--the next step in terms of as a business, I hadn't gotten there yet to, to be frank.
Story_ID: 665673
Speaker 1: When do you get there?
Speaker 2: So, you know, I get there because after I left 'Dynasty,' I was offered a position in Montreal [Canada].  So I went to Montreal, designing millinery still, and I did that for maybe a few seasons and was wooed by a company [Aldo Hat Corporation] in New York [New York] that was maybe one of the biggest millinery manufacturers in the country and they did several, they did several, they did several licensing collections at the time.  So they were doing Adolfo and Mr. John and so forth.  So they offered me the position to come to be their designer and creative director.
Speaker 1: I see.  So who did you work first with in, in Canada?
Speaker 2: It was called the Canadian Hat Company [Montreal, Canada] and I forget the name of their label but I was, again, creative director there.
Speaker 1: Now did you feel that you had--that's your first time working for someone.  Now did you feel stymied in any way, you know, with designs?  Were--were they, were they allowing creativity in the way--
Speaker 2: For sure, they were allowing creativity and when I came to New York to work for the company, they were all about the creativity.  And now is when the idea of business sets in because this is a very large company and it's all about numbers and business.  And so as the creative director, I reported to the CEO and so I was always hearing what's selling and what's not selling.  So it was definitely exposure for the first time for me on the business side of fashion.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, okay, so this is what year?  What year about?
Speaker 2: So this is now maybe, because I wasn't with 'Dynasty' for their last season, so this is probably '88 [1988] maybe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah I would say '87 [1987], '88 [1988] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, no, but I thought you were two years--you were two years?
Speaker 2: So, maybe it's '87 [1987], I mean, in Montreal and I come back to New York like '88 [1988].
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Yes, two seasons.
Speaker 1: Two seasons, okay.
Speaker 2: Right, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Which is a year.
Speaker 2: Sorry, I think of things in seasons, yes.
Speaker 1: That's right, sorry, sorry.
Story_ID: 665674
Speaker 1: In this iteration, what is happening in New York [New York] in the fashion scene?  And I want--really want to talk about first milliner- millinery.  How many people of color are there in the New York scene that are in your position, like as a creative director?
Speaker 2: I am--I knew other millinery designers of color but not those with major companies with major distribution.  I think at that time I was probably the only one and, you know, because we were selling to Saks [Saks Fifth Avenue] and Nordstrom and, you know, Bonwit Teller [Bonwit Teller and Company] was open at the time, and so we were really mainstream and I'm not certain that there were any others doing it in that way, certainly others who were working as independent designers though.
Speaker 1: Okay, and who were some of those that were--
Speaker 2: Um, gee, good question.  I'm saying that and now I'm hard pressed to really think of names at that time because we were competing not necessarily with some of the smaller names, we were really competing with some of the larger designers and brands.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do, you stay there how long?
Speaker 2: So, I stay there, total for ten years.  What happened, however, is that that company [Aldo Hat Corporation], with an agreement that we created, launched my namesake millinery line, and that line launched in, I want to say '89 [1989] or 1990 maybe or something like that.
Speaker 1: Now how were you able to broker that deal?
Speaker 2: Well, the company that I worked for manufactured it so I had a two fold relationship.  So I was a salaried, creative director for the company and then there was a separate license agreement for my own namesake line which I also designed and that was a, you know, licensing royalty arrangement but it was under one umbrella.
Speaker 1: Well, that's like what they call intrapreneurship with, you know, when it grows, but how did you broker a deal like that?  Why were they interested in helping you?
Speaker 2: Well I think they were not so much interested in helping me, I think they saw it as a business opportunity because I really had become known as the designer behind the brands that they carried, and the relationship that I had with the stores at that time, I think they felt was very key and so to protect their business, I think they, they thought it was a great opportunity to also launch my namesake line, which really became the flagship lines, flagship line, for their company at the time.
Speaker 1: So you're talking about 19--so--
Speaker 2: We're talking in the '90s [1990s] now (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nineties [1990s], so this--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --this is the full time, the '90s [1990s]?
Speaker 2: Full time the '90s [1990s] and that was what I did.  You know, I traveled the country, doing personal appearances.  It was a huge major, major business and it was called B Michael millinery.  I mean, it was very simple.
Story_ID: 665675
Speaker 1: So what happens in millinery in those ten years?  What happens to the business?  And why do you want, why are you, why do you get out?
Speaker 2: Well, it's not that I got out, I grew, and what that meant for me is that I saw, you know, my vision went beyond millinery.  And so I said to my boss [at Aldo Hat Corporation], who was the CEO and a friend I thought at the time, that I also would like to do clothing, it's, you know, I have to.  I mean I was sketching it all the time and in creating the millinery, I would travel and do shows within stores and I'm pulling other people's clothing and I felt like this is not even the sensibility, it's not the vision that I see for this.
Speaker 1: For your hat, for your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For my hat, exactly.  And so they were very interested in partnering with me to do so and presented to me a deal that the CEO and his partner and myself would be partners for the clothing line in thirds.  And Audrey [Audrey Potts] said, "You can't do this because, you know, they will own two thirds of your business and you--of your brand, and you can't do that."  And so I was disappointed that they proposed that to me because these were people that I had worked for, for all these years, traveled with and trusted, and so I was very disappointed that's what they proposed.  And so on that basis, I left and decided to do my own thing.
Speaker 1: That--so they not only proposed that, they weren't going to negotiate around it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were not willing to negotiate it.  After I left, they called many, many, many times wanting to negotiate it but I felt, you know, how could I trust you if you presented that to me.
Speaker 1: So Audrey had continued to be an advisor during that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, she had.
Speaker 1: During the whole time then?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 665676
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now what else was significant about your time in those ten years in terms of your own growth, or sensibility or your exposure?  I'm just trying to understand the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I think that those ten years really--that was for me my college, if you will, because it's how I learned my way around the industry, how I better understood the science of it and the business of it, and also how I became known.  So it was definitely a formidable period for me and, you know, I, I can't imagine not having done it.
Speaker 1: What are you learning about the science and the business of fashion at this time in the '90s [1990s]?
Speaker 2: So I--what I learned for instance, what it cost me as an independent designer, to make one hat, you know, when you're working for the kind of company that I worked for, it's a joke, so it was hard to compete in terms of access for raw material, labor, and just having resources, because it's one thing to imagine something, but when you had the resources that enable you to produce that, that's what's special, and that's what I acquired.
Speaker 1: So they, they had buying, purchasing power?
Speaker 2: They had purchasing power, absolutely, major.
Speaker 1: And fabrics from all over?
Speaker 2: Fabrics--whatever I could imagine, I was able to have done and they were willing to do it.  I mean, they were really all about the creativity, I will say that.
Speaker 1: And you, as creative director [at Aldo Hat Corporation], how many people were reporting up to you then?
Speaker 2: So we were a large--we probably had, you know, including the factory, maybe a hundred employees.
Speaker 1: That's large.
Speaker 2: Oh, very large, and I would say that the heads of each area all reported to me, on the production and creative side.
Speaker 1: So what, what were you, you know you say you think in terms of seasons.  So what were your, I mean, how many, what volume are you producing with all those people?  And how many?
Speaker 2: Huge.  We were probably doing--for them, it was always about volume.  So they may have been, we had produced probably two hundred to five hundred units a day or something.  I mean, it was a very huge business but remember we were various brands under one umbrella as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how many--now what was the name of the company again?
Speaker 2: The parent company was called Durrell [ph.].
Speaker 1: Durrell.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And who were the two principals?
Speaker 2: So, a gentlemen by the name of Sal [ph.], I will share, and his partner's name was Ray, Raymond [ph.], yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, are they still in the millinery business?
Speaker 2: They have both retired.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So they were older gentlemen, too?
Speaker 2: They were older gentlemen, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now I--oh never mind, okay, so I was going--but they were Jewish descent?  No (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, they were, well I will say that the senior man who was the CEO at the time that I started working there was and then later Sal became the CEO but for me that was a v- it didn't matter.
Speaker 1: Okay, so in 1992, where I have you, you're thirty-five and starting a fashion label, that's under, that's on your own?
Speaker 2: No, that's, that's the millinery.
Speaker 1: That's the millinery, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you do that under the context of them?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: And '99 [1999] is when I launched my first clothing line [b michael AMERICA]--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and that was after I left, which is what we just talked about.
Story_ID: 665677
Speaker 1: See and during this time, a lot is changing about fashion and the business of fashion.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, a lot, okay, because you see the end of the, the Paris [France] fashion houses, you know, you see bridge brand, is it bridge brands that are starting to come into existence and there's more--what else?  You tell me what's happening?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that what was happening from my perspective in terms of fashion, was, you know, I saw everything at that time as opportunity and I studied less the fact that, you know, there may have been dynamics about the industry that were changing because those things actually at that stage did not affect me.  Everything for me was new.  So I focused more on what I saw as opportunity and what was new for me.
Speaker 1: And so what were those?  What were the, the things that you saw, that's what I'm saying?  So, what opportunity (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So for me--
Speaker 1: --and how are you building your opportunity, especially when you leave?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I think that what was new for me was very personal, it was my opportunity to now finally execute, you know, my total vision, or at least at that point what I considered my total vision.  And so, that was my excitement and that's what I focused on and that was, for me, what it was about.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how are you exploring your opportunity as--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --and how do you, and who's with you at this point that you set, set out?
Speaker 2: So I had savings and, you know, a relative, a family member and a friend who helped support the business [b michael AMERICA] initially, and that was really what I did and I at least knew my way around the industry now having worked in the industry for ten years, I had enough respect, at least, to knock on doors in terms of what I was doing because I continued to do my millinery, independently, but I now have a distribution following so that certainly helped support the business as well at the time, and I worked with a small sample house to create my collection of clothing.
Speaker 1: So, where are you located?  Where are you based out of at that point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So at that point I was mostly using the sample house as a base, although it was really not my location but they were generous to me that way.  And I commuted, you know, so it was that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, the, you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So very grassroots, in--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in the sense of the clothing aspect of it.  The millinery was established but the clothing was now the new--
Speaker 1: Now, the, your, your customer base, you're having to build a customer base.  Where's your customer base coming from?
Speaker 2: So, I relied on the millinery distribution as my captive audience, if you will, in terms of customer base and so because I was selling to several larger specialty stores like a Jacobson's, so if you're from Chicago [Illinois], you might know Jacobson's was maybe my number one account at the time.  So, it was really through that audience that I--or that became the audience that I approached, I should say, or was the audience I approached.
Story_ID: 665678
Speaker 1: What happens in the next, to 1998, because in 1998 you're, you're granted membership into the--
Speaker 2: CFDA [Council of Fashion Designers of America] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) CFDA, um-hm.
Speaker 2: So I applied for membership to the CFDA and--and I knew that I was planning to do a clothing line [b michael AMERICA].  So I thought it was important to have that validation, at least in my own head, I felt it was important to have that validation.  And Oscar de la Renta sponsored me and also LaVelle Olexa who was at that time the fashion director for Lord and Taylor, sponsored me.  And to have, to be granted membership, you had to be sponsored by a member of the CFDA and I think you had to have a retailer and have had some sort of press or something.  Whatever the criteria, I remember that that was really an important thing for me to do and I felt very good, at least getting through that process.
Speaker 1: Now how had you met Oscar de la Renta, that he was--
Speaker 2: Because Oscar, I designed his millinery, we were creating his millinery under this umbrella [at Aldo Hat Corporation] and so I was the creative director for the Oscar de la Renta millinery, which meant that I worked directly with Oscar to create the millinery.  So we had established a rapport because of that.
Speaker 1: Now that, that's, that's huge right there.  What, I mean I know you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that was huge.
Speaker 1: That's huge.
Speaker 2: Through that I became more familiar with Fashion Week [New York Fashion Week] because, obviously, Oscar showed during Fashion Week and, you know, there was the pressure of doing the millinery for Fashion Week.  So that was definitely huge.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you became, you start becoming aware of Fashion Week more in the mid-'90s [1990s]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: For sure, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, with someone who's extremely well respected.
Speaker 2: And someone who's extremely well respected.  And so, you know, working out of Oscar's studio on the millinery while they're building a collection, was an enormous clinic for me.  And then being a part of the back, of house, you know, design team during the shows, at that time they were at Bryant Park [New York], again, was, you know, a wonderful way for me to really see what goes on.
Speaker 1: And what did, what were you seeing what was going on 'cause that's a whole process itself even preparing the--the logistics of it and all that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes. You know, it's, it's pretty much what one would imagine in terms of developing the collection and the logistics and all of the, the art and the science of it.  It's, it's sort of what one would imagine but to be a part of it, was definitely a surreal experience, especially initially.  I mean, and because there's always, is the hat right and will he use it?  So I remember keeping my team up all night because Oscar wanted this group of vinyl hats, actually, and he wanted them in various colors and these little tiny little boaters.  So they were difficult and I kept the team up, my team, all night like maybe the day before the show, Oscar thought I would rather, I'd want them in these colors.  And then the day of the show, backstage, Oscar came and he put his arm around my shoulder and he said, "The hats are great, and thank you, but I don't that think we're going to use them."  And, you know, even though inside I was crushed, I could not, of course, show that.  And now, fast forward many years, I get that because I understand what that's like and you--you are that final look before you present on the runway and I've done it many times and so I'm actually grateful that he gave me that example.
Speaker 1: Right, right, 'cause you were devastated 'cause here you had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --you have this opportunity to showcase, and--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now--
Speaker 2: So, you know, if I'm working now with a jeweler or an accessory designer, I always tell them, "As long as you understand, in that last call, that last minute, you know there's a, it may not work."
Speaker 1: Right.  What was he like as a person?
Speaker 2: Generous of spirit and of, you know, of his knowledge.  Always wonderful.  I was in Paris [France] with him as well because he, for a few seasons, did the Balmain collection and so I was with him in Paris and I remember he'd take us, the team, to various shows.  So you always felt very special and everyone just loved and adored Oscar.  So even if you were in the shadow, you know, you felt very special.  But he was always very warm and very gracious and you can learn that from him.
Speaker 1: So was he the first person who took you to Paris or was the first introduction to Paris?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, he was.  That--that's a great way to find out about Paris.
Speaker 1: It's a great way to find out about Paris (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Story_ID: 665679
Speaker 1: CFDA is--the Council of Fashion Designers of America is, is the pinnacle of what is--is it in the fashion world.  So can you talk about that organization and what membership means and--
Speaker 2: You know, well I will, I will share this before and I will talk about the CFDA but it's first important that I talk about one of my mentors.  And I insert it now because of her role with the CFDA and that's Eleanor Lambert.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Eleanor Lambert's vision of the CFDA was really about being able to bring together the American designers and to showcase to the world, globally, that there, that the American designers are institutionalized and to be regarded and to be respected.  And she presented me my very first collection in 1999 at Bryant Park [New York, New York]; Eleanor Lambert was my press representative, and she really played a very important role in the development of my work at that time and the exposure and we can talk about that later but when I think of CFDA, I have to think in terms of her idea of what the CFDA is.  Today, as a member of the CFDA, I'm proud to say that we are attending the CFDA awards [CFDA Fashion Awards] this year and as a brand that we are a patron attending as a patron, and so I'm proud to say that but I say that because that is from our perspective, the way we would like to support it and to be there, but I think that the CFDA overall is a very political and very specific kind of organization today and I look forward to the CFDA embracing us more as artists and less as brands, I think is how I would say it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I see, so what you're saying is that it became, maybe, well what was Eleanor's role?
Speaker 2: I think that what I'm directly saying is that it is now very brand oriented and very commercial and very institutionalized in a very different way.  And, you know, if I am a young artist that's very independent, I would want it to be where I could go, and they had programs, for sure, that reach out to young artists but again you have to go through the program, you know.  It--it's not like it's your aunts and uncles who, you know, are in the industry.
Speaker 1: Right, am I hearing you right that you're saying that it was more brand and not as a crea- as creative, the creative part of it was having a hard, trouble finding--or the small designers?
Speaker 2: What I am saying now that it is more about designers as a brand than it is about designers as artists.
Speaker 1: Okay, gotcha, okay.  Now, Eleanor, what, tell me about her and her back--what role she played, not just with you but--
Speaker 2: So Eleanor Lambert, for instance, is the founder of the International Best-Dressed List, and Eleanor Lambert really gave birth to the idea of PR [public relations] in fashion.  I mean, she's really given that credit.
Story_ID: 665680
Speaker 1: So Eleanor Lambert, as the founder of the CFDA [Council of Fashion Designers of America] in the '60s [1960s], had a very different vision in terms of the CFDA as we now know it, and of course, there is, you know, as an organization you evolve and you grow, certainly from the '60s [1960s] until now that should be the case but I think that the underlining mission, which is to create a space for American designers and to say to the world that these are the American designers, is what's important.  And while the CFDA does do that, I, I feel, as a member, that it is definitely influenced by brand versus art.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you had all these people behind you?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I mean in your talent.  All these people that are very significant and--
Speaker 1: Eleanor learned of me because she called on me to do hats for an Easter event she was doing at the Plaza Hotel [New York, New York], and that was how she discovered me, and so, yes.
Speaker 2: And--and was that, was that when you were--at what point in the '90s [1990s] is that?  Is that when you--or in the '80s [1980s]?  Was that--
Speaker 1: That was, that was probably in the late, well in the '90s [1990s], actually, when she called upon me, yes.
Story_ID: 665681
Speaker 1: The other thing I have a question about around that, that timeframe is, who else is she gravitating to in, in the black community?  I mean, who's in the CFDA [Council of Fashion Designers of America] and who's hot at that time because we, you know, we went through the--WilliWear [Williwear Ltd.] was when?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Willi Smith was before me and, you know, I can't say as a fact that he was or was not a member of the CFDA.  I would want to think that he was.  He certainly was an American designer working at the time so, yes, so there is Willi Smith and also there--[HistoryMaker] Stephen Burrows, and Eleanor Lambert, again, it was her vision that took the American designers to Paris [France] when there was that battle on the runway, if you will.  So that was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The historical--so she was behind that?
Speaker 2: She's the brainchild behind that.
Speaker 1: 'Cause, 'cause Bethann Hard- [HistoryMaker Bethann Hardison]--lots of people--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --talked about that.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.  We're still celebrating that, and that was Eleanor Lambert's vision.  She launched people like Halston and Oscar [Oscar de la Renta] and Bill Blass.  So she really is, I would say, the most iconic figure as it relates to the American fashion industry.
Speaker 1: Now at that point in time, I mean that's, at that point in time, is Anna Wintour, is she who she is today?  Or is, because you wouldn't have had two people in that space?
Speaker 2: Well, Eleanor represented something very different in that she was unbiased in the sense that she represented the designers in the industry at large versus working for a specific publication or a specific company.  So that enabled her to be much more free, if you will.

Speaker 1: And so she was really an advocate of the designer?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, and she could make your career in that way?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I may have been one of her last projects, be- when, by the time I started, she was in her senior years, but she came out to my shows and she'd come for her weekly visit to the showroom and then I would visit her at her apartment and was very charming in that she would have food for our visits and then insist I take it home.  It was very, you know, special and very meaningful still, for me, that I had that time with Eleanor Lambert.  I'm quoted in her book ['Eleanor Lambert: Still Here,' John Tiffany] that, which we have, that was done as a tribute for her.  So I feel very honored about that.
Speaker 1: That's, that's special just, even in terms of your exposure to her and her investment in you.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And, you know, her being a legend.
Speaker 2: May I share my favorite Eleanor Lambert story quickly?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: It's the day before my very first show as part of New York Fashion Week at Bryant Park [New York, New York] and Eleanor said--
Speaker 1: What year is this?
Speaker 2: This was probably February of '99 [1999], I think, anyway, at that time, do you remember Elsa Klensch?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And Elsa Klensch was the voice of style on CNN, and Eleanor said to me, "I'm having Elsa Klensch come down on Friday afternoon to preview the collection."  So could you imagine what I felt?  It's like, crazy.  So, at the appointed time, which may have been like four o'clock on Friday, and actually my show was on Sunday, so it was two days, I had models, you know, Eleanor said, "You have to show on models and she's going to critique it and let her, listen to her opinion."  I was so nervous.  Anyway, Elsa shows up and Eleanor is not there.  And so, we're waiting for Eleanor and so Elsa is just engaging me in conversation and she's talking about, I think, family and a trip or something, just conversation, and I'm sweating bullets, really.  Where's Eleanor, where's Eleanor?  So finally Eleanor called and said, "I'm in traffic, you and Elsa get started."  So, anyway, somehow I managed through the presentation and Elsa was, you know, very generous in--of the collection and really sincere about it.  Later, what I really found out is that Eleanor really staged that.  So she planned not to be there to give Elsa and I an opportunity to create a rapport.  So that's thinking as a publicist on a, you know, just in a way that is, like does anyone do that anymore?  But she knew what she was doing in terms of orchestrating that whole--and, and until Elsa retired, she continued to come to my collection and, you know, we had a wonderful rapport.  I remember one show was late and the organizers at Bryant Park said we can't start--we can't open the house.  So Elsa came backstage and she said, "B [HistoryMaker B Michael], they'll listen to me, so do you want me to go outside and say, 'I'm leaving if you don't open the house', and obviously they'll open the house."  So I said, "Would you do that?"  And she said, "Of course."  And she did.  So, it was fun, you know.  At that time, it was really fun and you felt there was an openness and an opportunity as a new designer. So, you know.
Speaker 1: That, that is very--
Speaker 2: Isn't that?
Speaker 1: That's, that's wonderful.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 665683
Speaker 1: There are several stories.  Eleanor used to do during Fashion Week [New York Fashion Week], an open house in her apartment on Sunday from like twelve until four [o'clock] and she invited editors and, you know, very key people in the industry and we were required to be there because it was an opportunity for them to get to know us in a more intimate setting, and who's turning down an invitation to go to Eleanor Lambert's?  So, I mean, most of the senior editors all went through at some point and that was her way of giving us exposure and just letting them get a chance to meet us and see who we are and so forth.  She always had a press package that they'd take away but she fed them great food and it was very, you know, very special.
Speaker 2: So in her press relations, how did she get to know you at the beginning?  I mean because if she is going to work with you and decides that you're worthy of investment, is she observing you first from afar?
Speaker 1: She is.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She's observing me from afar and then her office called one day to say that they were doing the Easter Parade and it was ending up with this big tea at the Plaza [Plaza Hotel, New York, New York] and if I could do some millinery to go with some of the clothing.  So she connected me with a designer by the name of John Anthony, whose work was amazing, and that was really my first exposure to her.
Speaker 2: Okay, and what other things did you learn about her in the--in the industry from her during your, your little, even your little time periods that you're talking and getting to know.  Was she sharing any, any--
Speaker 1: I would say that she, in her way, was beginning to rebel against what was becoming modern about fashion and how it's presented and publicity and how that was being used.  I, I would say in her conversations with me, it was clear that she was not embracing of the way things were evolving because she believed that it should always be about the artist.  If that person is worthy, which is subjective, of course, but you know giving opportunity and showcasing that.
Story_ID: 665684
Speaker 1: Now your first show, I mean the first, your first Fashion Week [New York Fashion Week] show--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean that's even, that's hard because Elsa Klensch was big.
Speaker 2: Very big.
Speaker 1: She was big (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --and it's like, you know, 'Project Runway' but it wasn't 'Project,' but she--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but it was a first type of show that I knew--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, and people, you know, it had large viewership and everything.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But that seems that you have that coming in as your first show and it's two days before it.
Speaker 2: And two days--could you, it was just really something, totally, that I had not imagined.
Speaker 1: How long did it take for you to get ready for that first show?  How long had you worked on it?
Speaker 2: I, well, I will say that I worked on it--I can actually say from November until February, and I showed maybe fifty or sixty looks, I don't even remember.  I still have the very first dress that went down the runway.  And the thing that I learned from Eleanor [Eleanor Lambert] was to edit.  And so that was probably my longest show ever because, you know, she said, "Once you make your point of view, move on, because the editors are looking at a hundred shows and they get it quickly, so you don't have to define it ten ways."  So I, I still remember that in terms of editing.
Story_ID: 665685
Speaker 1: So the editing, the--so how many pieces do you typically now have in a show now (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So now I show, I'm up to forty pieces.  I--for a long time, I was showing, you know, twenty, twenty-five pieces, but frankly that also had to do with resources.  And so, but as we've grown as a business and as a brand, I am now showing forty pieces, which I would not show more than forty pieces, that's really enough.
Speaker 1: And in, are you saying the--I would like you to talk about the time period it takes and what the process is, you know, for each, you know each line that you develop.  I'd like you to take us through what, what your process is.
Speaker 2: So, my process is that I typically start sketching and then work with my draper and she creates the first muslin rendering from the sketch and then typically that gets manipulated.  We work together and I decide, you know, let's try this, let's move that.  And once we get that to where I say, okay, this is the garment, the first pattern is done.  And then there's the issue of fabricating and sometimes I can do that quickly, and there are times when the patterns are stacking up but I really haven't fabricated them yet because I haven't found the right textile for it.  So, that's part of the process.  And then there are times when I'm looking at fabrics and I see something that I love and immediately know what to do with it.  So there's not really a formula that one should come before the other but under the process, one of those things happens and the first sample is then created.  And we start working on a collection typically about two months before we present it.
Speaker 1: That's not a lot of time?
Speaker 2: No it isn't.
Speaker 1: So, a collection, are you doing, how many collections a year then?
Speaker 2: So we do, with the Couture collection, which is what we present during Fashion Week [New York Fashion Week], two collections a year and the ready to wear, which is a different animal, we actually present twelve new styles, ten months a year.  So we do ten collections a year.
Speaker 1: So that's b michael AMERICA?
Speaker 2: That's b michael AMERICA RED (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The RED collection.
Speaker 2: --collection, yes, exactly.  So we're working every day.
Story_ID: 665686
Speaker 1: I know we talked about Eleanor [Eleanor Lambert], but it's one thing to decide that you're going to expand beyond millinery--being a milliner, milliner--
Speaker 2: Milliner.
Speaker 1: Milliner, milliner (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: It's one thing to decide that, it's another thing to do it and it's, you know, when you were describing your, your hat designs, you had lots and lots of drawings.  And so what are you coming into, you know, how are you coming into your place as a, as a--
Speaker 2: Apparel designer?
Speaker 1: As an apparel designer.
Speaker 2: Well, again, because that first collection [of b michael AMERICA] was so long, I think it's like I had something there from a lifetime of sketching, and in many ways that initial collection still defines who I am.  Obviously, it has evolved and to mention resources, again, enable one to do other things with it, but the basis of it, which is what I consider very clean aesthetics with lots of architecture, I think is how I would describe the clothing.  I think that, that premise of that is still there, but I went into that collection with a very clear vision of what I would be doing.
Speaker 1: And that vision has stayed true the whole time?
Speaker 2: That vision has stayed true the whole time, and for the moments I would call, that I deviated, I, like in the moment that immediately followed, I knew I deviated, and I often say that a designer or an artist should be true to oneself.
Speaker 1: Right, so when, when did you deviate?  Did you ever deviate?
Speaker 2: Do you want to hear that story?
Speaker 1: Yeah I do want to hear that story (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My very first collection, like I said was my statement, and in the second collection, the like encore collection, if you will, where there was huge expectation, is when I deviated, and I deviated because I listened to everyone saying, "Well, you know, you should make the skirt shorter," or you should do this, and I really didn't know, and I listened and I was not even enjoying it as I did it.  And when I looked at it, I realized I had made a huge mistake, and I did.
Speaker 1: So this is your second collection?
Speaker 2: Second collection.
Speaker 1: So the first collection, what you're--is well received?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --and which I, I did with tunnel vision.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the first collection is well received, Eleanor comes back and says, you know, you don't have to show everything but--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --still you've got Elsa Klensch, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 665687
Speaker 1: Who else is hot that, that on that, at that Fashion Week [New York Fashion Week]?
Speaker 2: Who attended the show?
Speaker 1: Who attended the show?  Who attended your show?  Because, how are the show lists developed?  Is there also attempt to get the right--you have to get the right people and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You have to get the right people and that's what Eleanor's office focused on, and because I really had no clue, you know, with going into it for the very first time. But Eleanor's office focused on getting the right editors there and they invited--they felt that they wanted to invite the press that had an audience for, as a demographic for the work that I was doing.  So that was sort of their premise.  And so they comfortably said no to people that they felt were not reaching the right audience and I had to rely on their judgment.  But that first collection, you know, I had a write up in the London Times [The Times] and it was wonderful, I will say.  It was wonderful.  And so, you know, then it became overwhelming with the second collection with everyone then wanting to tell me, not Eleanor [Eleanor Lambert], but you know even within the people that I was working with mostly saying, you know, "You need to make this," do this, do that, have someone work with you.  So I acquiesced and it's, I will say, I, I left what was true to me.  I don't even enjoy looking at that collection now.
Speaker 1: That happens a lot of times when people are excited about something and they're going to come in and give advice and all of that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: But when you say the people were working with you--
Speaker 2: You know--
Speaker 1: --are you talking about on staff, no (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On staff, correct, yes, yes, and we hired another assistant designer and, you know, and I felt I had to give this person an opportunity as well and, you know, our fabric merchandisers and, I just allowed all of that dictation, and it's not an excuse, it was now, I look back and just say that it's very important to be true to yourself.
Speaker 1: And the line was the line, that line successful or--
Speaker 2: Not as successful as the first line and--the first line really carried the business so, fortunately.
Story_ID: 665688
Speaker 1: Designers are known to have muses and, and the first time I heard this phrase was, 'cause I'm still new to this area, but first time I heard it was with [HistoryMaker] Bethann Hardison, you know, 'cause she said, she, I forget whose muse she was, but, so your muse, can you talk about your muse?  Or who you have had as a muse?  Well, who--have you had a muse?  I should ask that.
Speaker 2: I would say that, you know, yes, I have had a muse.  I, well, my, firstly, I, I've often said that the muse in my head is Audrey Hepburn and if she were here today and, you know, so that's the muse that's in my mind's eye, always, and then I've had some really wonderful muses whose names I will not mention but I've had some really wonderful muses and still throughout my work.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, can I, I'm going to mention a name because--
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, your name, and I don't know who your muses have been but, you know, as I was preparing for this interview I was looking at what I, you know, could find, and I, you know, and it's interesting as I'm looking behind at Audrey Hepburn and I was just thinking about this but, Cicely Tyson has been a collector of yours, I mean a--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --an avid fan of yours.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you know you bring out Audrey Hepburn.  I mean, she, she, like when I was looking, I mean she looks so pretty and so like sophisticated and, you know, it was like in your clothes she sort of came alive.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: And so that's you know, so I was thinking, you know, she was sort of looking like Audrey Hepburn but I do, so--
Speaker 2: You know, I will say, thank you so much for saying that and certainly Cicely Tyson, you know, stimulates my creativity and we have had a wonderful collaboration.  She has, you know, shared very monumental moments in her career as we've known each other with me by way of allowing me to design for her for those moments (background noise).  But that said, I--it's hard for me to imagine referring to Cicely Tyson as a muse.  She's much too big for that.
Speaker 1: Though she's, she's big for it, no, she is big for it--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --I understand that, but there've been very big muses in other people's, other designers, like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, yes, and, so maybe historically, you know, [HistoryMaker] B Michael has Cicely Tyson as a muse is maybe like Givenchy [Hubert de Givenchy] had Audrey Hepburn as a muse.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: Why not?
Story_ID: 665689
Speaker 1: And the reason I'm saying that, both of you can be, I mean you said that you were somewhat, I don't know if you used the term introverted, but Cicely [Cicely Tyson] is, as big as her person, if you meet her in person she's very intro- introverted (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very much so, and very private.
Speaker 1: Very private.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so even though the ability to get in that space, you know, and to allow someone to bring glamor to her, you know, is, you know, that has to be a special relationship (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It is a special relationship.
Speaker 1: So can you talk about that relationship and how the interchange relates to this?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say that I really can't speak a lot about the relationship for the very reason that it is a relationship (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But--
Speaker 2: --because we trust each other and we, you know, sort of protect each other.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] B Michael, but B Michael I understand that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but let's talk about, not with specifics but let's talk about the process because there have, there is part of the design process (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you--
Speaker 2: The funny part of that process, if you were asking Cicely for instance, "What are you wearing to the Tony Awards [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Broadway Theatre]?"  She would say to you, "I have no idea.  I have no clue until B Michael is ready--calls me for a fitting, I actually have no idea what I'm wearing."  And it's because she does trust me that way and she has learned that that's my lane and she respects what it is that I do knowing that it's always about her and so that--that's really what works for us.  And I think as a designer for me to work with someone, especially such a big person, there has to be that trust where I can still be who I am and that you allow me to have a vision for you and she's able to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she's able to do that and I was just as you said that I got chills because that Tony Award dress was off the charts.  I mean, it made her, I mean, she was glamorous, she was young and she's this, you know, I mean she's eighty years old, I mean it's just like phenomenal.  I mean, just--
Speaker 2: And when she first saw the dress, 'cause she hadn't seen it, so when she first saw it for the fitting, you know, we have her specs down nearly perfect so the fitting was just a little tweaking and that's when she saw it for the first time and she screamed, actually.  I remember that we were in her dressing room at--behind the stage for 'Trip to Bountiful' ['The Trip to Bountiful,' Horton Foote] she was doing, and she, she actually screamed when she saw the dress.  And then, of course, that made me well loved because I wanted her to be happy.
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I mean, it made, I couldn't believe it.  I mean she looked, I mean just--it was beautiful so it got your attention.
Story_ID: 665690
Speaker 1: But I want to go back, you're not going to short shrift this a little bit--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --and whether you want to talk about her or not, there's a process of, of, and you, I would like you to describe your process.  Like, when you're getting to--you know, the only reason I mention muses, because there's a special relationship.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: For sure.
Speaker 1: --between, and it maybe even if you would talk about that, the relationship between a muse and a designer.  I don't even know the origin of that--
Speaker 2: I think it's something that just--it's a chemistry that happens.  It can never be forced.  It's really this chemistry and this, as a designer or as an artist, it is, you know, there's something about that person's sensibility and that person's, you know, posture or it might be, I don't know, it's hard to describe, but when it fits, you know it.  So it is a relationship.  It's, it's like, you know, how do you pick your partner?  Except that it's a chemistry.  And so it's in a way the same.  You know, that she embodies your vision I think is really how I would say it.
Speaker 1: So often muses--talk about the role of a muse, though.  Can you describe that as it relates to a designer?  Often, they're the ones who you're going to test things on--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, you, you, you test on your muse, you are inspired by your muse.  Your muse really becomes your laboratory in some way because, you know, you can just experiment and if it works, you know it.  So, there is a real collaboration in terms of the process between a designer and a designer's muse.
Speaker 1: Okay, so with, you said you've had a few.  Are these people that you've observed in a crowd or they've come into your studio and you sort of know?  It's, I--
Speaker 2: I mean I think that these--the muses that I refer to when I said I've had a few, are muses with whom I've had a real collaborative process and relationship with.  And so, they have been muses in the real sense of a muse.  So they're not just visible in your clothing but they play a role in terms of responding to what you're doing and giving you input in terms of what works for them and it's--it's a real relationship.
Story_ID: 665691
Speaker 1: Your client base really gr- grows quite quickly.  I mean you've--right?  It--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and can you talk about who your client--because you became, in many ways, a very favorite designer among, well, I know in the black community, you had a--you've had a very, you know, the upper echelons of the black community, you've had a very strong following and popularity, so I would rather you tell it rather than me.
Speaker 2: Well, what makes me the most pleased about that, aside from what that means to our business [b michael AMERICA], is what that means to the world because many of those women have choices in terms of their ability to purchase any world-class brand that they would like.  And the fact that they think enough of my work, and proud enough of it, I think, is a great message to the world that we indeed do support each other and we do recognize excellence in each other.  And so, I am, you know, on a--as a personal thought about it, most grateful for that.  But, and of course, these are women, some of them are very visible and that obviously they are, you know, trendsetters of their, in their own world and that, of course, so other women want to emulate their style and they find their way to us, which we love.
Speaker 1: And that's what the fashion bu- industry's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --really all about.
Speaker 2: And it really isn't limited, I would say, to women of color.  I mean we are--we have a very diverse business customer base, we're speaking now about the couture in terms of the women that I know firsthand.  But we have a very diverse customer base and, you know, we spend a lot of time in that world socially, philanthropically and, you know, that, that is definitely a significant way that we grow the couture side of the business.
Story_ID: 665692
Speaker 1: So let's talk about the couture 'cause you started with the couture collection.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And let's--and you're starting at a time with the couture collection when all this mass merchandising and even the couture--the well known designers, couture designers, are even doing some mass merchandising themselves.  Okay, this, and some people--so you're, but you're starting in--you're, you're in this process in 2000 and when you start now, money is plentiful, it only gets, you know changes around the dot-com bubble but money is plentiful and what are you--how are you, is it the Fashion Week [New York Fashion Week], what are the business aspects of your business that would, you know, and how as a, as a couture designer, how are you making sure that it's a successful business?
Speaker 2: And is that a question based on who I am today?  I mean, where are we in the process (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, I meant early--
Speaker 2: --to answer that question?
Speaker 1: This is from 2000, 2007.  I'm sorry, this is, this is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: So I would say that in 2007-ish, in that era--
Speaker 1: No, I'm talking about from 1999 with your first--
Speaker 2: Right, collection, yes.
Speaker 1: Right, I'm talking about the early to mid-2000s.  That's what I'm asking 'cause clearly at that point you are establishing yourself as a very strong couture designer.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's--right, that's why I'm--
Speaker 2: And I--but what happened is that on the heels of my first collection, we--I was given the opportunity to do a high end ready to wear collection that was bought by Saks Fifth Avenue at the time.
Speaker 1: And what year is this?
Speaker 2: And this was in maybe 2002, I want to say, somewhere in that era.  Two thousand two [2002], or so.  So that really was the fuel at the time for the business.
Speaker 1: I see, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, so the, the division of merchandise manager [Ron Frasch] of Saks at the time came to me, who attended our show, and, and offered us the opportunity to do a, like a bridge collection, really, for Saks and that really was what the foundation of the business [b michael AMERICA], became the foundation for the business.
Speaker 1: Because you couldn't really exist on couture alone, right, was that a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, that's correct, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's what I was saying that--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --couture was having--it was dying its own death in that way, you know, as a standalone business because couture had been around and it had--
Speaker 2: Yes, and it's all the variables that couture requires to support it like a show, as an example.  And so, for sure, you need to build upon that.  I mean, couture is about branding and it's about the visibility but you need to build upon that.
Story_ID: 665693
Speaker 1: So here, with the bridge collection [of b michael AMERICA], that's a business behind it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know, but still high end.  You're at least with a high end--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --outlet.  So--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --what's the opportunity that's presented to you?  And who presents that opportunity?
Speaker 2: So that opportunity came to me by way of Saks [Saks Fifth Avenue].
Speaker 1: But who at Saks?
Speaker 2: A gentlemen at the time by the name of Ron Frasch presented the opportunity.  He was, I think, the general merchandise manager or something to that effect and that was really how that door opened.
Speaker 1: So when you're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, and what Ron said was that if you can take what you're doing on the runway and sort of find a way to reproduce that at this price point, we're interested in that.
Speaker 1: So what is involved with that, you know to--because, you know with couture it's all very personal.  You know, you have a series of fittings.  You talk about the--you start with the mus- no--
Speaker 2: Muslin.
Speaker 1: --muslin.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know, and you have those, you have to take the measurements, it's designed to the person.  What is it when you are doing a bridge collection line?  You know, how, how are you, how do you go about doing that and how do you work with the store also, you know?
Speaker 2: So we had, what I did then was, attracted at the time partners, and one of the partners had experience in manufacturing.  So they, he, I should say, handled the manufacturing of the collection.  Therefore, you know, it was bringing his expertise to the table that balanced what I was doing at the time.
Speaker 1: And so who are your partners?
Speaker 2: So they, without naming names, I would say that these are people in the industry who had been watching my work and who expressed an interest in working with me and then when this opportunity came to me, I went back and said, "I do have this opportunity, here is--I have this offering, here's an opportunity where maybe we can work together."
Speaker 1: So how, how many, how many items were in your first bridge colle- you know, in the--now what was the name of this collection then?
Speaker 2: It was called, I think it was called the signature collection or something, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so how many items that first--the first go around?
Speaker 2: I actually don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We shipped on a regular basis and, but in terms of how many styles, I'm not certain.
Speaker 1: Is, 'cause maybe I was thinking about the RED collection [b michael AMERICA RED], twelve, twelve (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Which is the world I'm now living in, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. But--but before, okay.
Story_ID: 665694
Speaker 1: So what are you learning about that and is that providing a base for your, you know, your company [b michael AMERICA]?  Or is it distra- is it a distraction?
Speaker 2: Well I think it should have provided a base for the company, however, I can candidly say, and I like sharing this with young designers, that it's important that you partner, however, with the right people.  And so ideally it should provide a base for your company.  In my situation, unfortunately, it did, but it did from the standpoint of the interest of other people and not so much from the standpoint of my own interest.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was that the structure of the deal?
Speaker 2: That was the structure of the deal, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, and you know many artists go into deals if they're not represented properly and, you know, they are the least in terms of the deal.
Speaker 1: And this also, at this time, though I think, you know, company, you know stores, there's also a lot of changes in departments (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A lot of changes in stores and so, you know, those things at times influence the buy.  You know, if you have a relationship with one team and that team is gone and another team comes along, for sure.  I, I, that is true but I think that if you are an established brand, then you are not likely to be as much affected by that in terms of positioning, you know.  Maybe on a day to day basis you have to work through that but I think if you are a brand in the store, that's established, then you are.
Speaker 1: Right. How many, how many stores did you start in?  Was it starting at the New York [New York] store at Saks [Saks Fifth Avenue] or were you, was the collection in major markets?  I mean, how did they--
Speaker 2: I seem to recall that we had a distribution and I'm saying it that way because I really was not hands on in terms of that part of it.
Speaker 1: Were they paying you in advance?  Or was everything on sales generated?  Did they, 'cause see, this is--
Speaker 2: You mean in terms of with Saks?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: No, we, they paid our purchase order.
Speaker 1: On purchase, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: 'Cause, you know, I just think of a lot of times, you know, with minority designers, or small, just small designers, you know, you can't always upfront, you know, the cost (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --the production cost--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to wait for things to be, you know, to be paid back.
Speaker 2: Of course, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And depending on, you know, how things are going and retail and, you know, it's not--so a lot of times people look for bridge financing, you know, in other industries, you know, so--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --they can, they can--
Speaker 2: To--exactly, to fund what it is that they're doing.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And to fund the, sort of, the payment cycles--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --because they're not always paid on, you know, thirty days, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that's all inherent to the industry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But you need to be telling your story more than me.  I'm trying to pull out on you.
Speaker 2: Well I'm, what I'm actually trying to do is to--because some of your questions, which pertain to say 2007, could be relevant today.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: So I'm trying to be careful that I'm answering the question in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 2: --the right cycle.
Speaker 1: In that time.  Okay, so--
Speaker 2: So that's why I'm trying to--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --understand better.
Speaker 1: So I'm in this, I had gone to Cicely [Cicely Tyson] because I only had her name as a muse (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, 'cause Cicely was to fast forward and then you--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --took me back.
Speaker 1: And then I took you back because--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I couldn't, 'cause when I first mentioned muses, you were like, you know, and so that's when I brought her name up--
Speaker 2: Okay, gotcha, I'm with you, okay.
Speaker 1: So that's what, that's why I went back some years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The signature collection, how long did that relationship last?  And--
Speaker 1: So, that relationship was maybe several seasons, I--four or five seasons, at least.  It had become a very, was becoming a very respectable business and the partners that I had at the time did very well from it and retired.  And so, you know, so then once again, I had to figure it out and, you know, that, that's part of the cycle of being a designer.
Speaker 2: So what were the other things that are happening that are important in that 2000 to 2007 period because, you know, you started with the bridge collection so that bridge collection would have lasted maybe for two and a half years?
Speaker 1: Right, at least two years I would say.
Speaker 2: Two years, two years, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, yes, and during that time I continued to produce and show couture so that was a lot of how my time was spent but I also worked on that bridge collection.  So I was very busy and that was really the focus at that time was, you know, to manufacture that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And to be creative.
Speaker 2: Okay, so in two thousand--well, no okay I see, I'll go on, so in two thousand- I'm going to go to 2007, okay, that's okay--
Speaker 1: Okay, you have to remind me, I don't think in terms of--
Speaker 2: I know, that's the other thing--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --about fashion, people don't think, it's all so flu- I don't know if its fluid or people are doing--simultaneously, but--
Speaker 1: Right, so to say where were you in 2007, I, I, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Okay.
Story_ID: 665695
Speaker 1: What other things, though, are important to your success 'cause I'm getting ready to go to Mark-Anthony--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Edwards [Mark-Anthony Edwards], okay, which I have in 2007, is that right?
Speaker 2: That's about right, yes, okay, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, but before he comes in with you, you know I want to--
Speaker 2: So before (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I just want to--
Speaker 2: --the world that I now live in, let's say--
Speaker 1: Right, right, okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, I really experienced what I would say many designers have experienced and that is, you know, through business relationships, reinventing oneself, I mean, I used to think that I was being picked upon and then as you really study the lives of designers that we now know and love and respect, we realize that it's really a more normal process.  So I would say that I had, you know, my share of, you know, reinventing myself through business and through process to get to this.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I see it as a normal process.
Speaker 1: No, it is a normal process--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but [HistoryMaker] B Michael, could you just help me understand--you know that, I don't know that.  Would you be willing to share some of your reinventions along the way?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because, go on.
Speaker 2: Yes, I think that, you know, the example where we talked about the partner who did well and retired, is an example of the kind of, you know, what you run into or you, you know, are matched with people who, you know, who really just have a different agenda in terms of--because you know as a designer, we want to work, we want our work to be shared and distributed--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but there are people who have, you know, a different agenda and so it's getting through understanding that and all those relationships.
Speaker 1: Okay, can we stop a second, okay.  Can we turn on the air?  And--
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: --but--
Speaker 2: But.
Speaker 1: --you don't get.  But he told a lot, you know, he told a lot of what if stories, I guess at that point.  He wasn't what--the [HistoryMaker] Daymond John of today, I think that was 2001, okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Julie [Julieanna Richardson], I think we're rolling again.
Speaker 1: Are we rolling?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yes, we are.
Speaker 1: So I think that, well what I will say as an American fashion designer and going through that process and realizing that, one, you're not just an American designer, although that is how I see myself, you are an American designer that the world sees as a black designer.  And, so with that, the opportunities, frankly, are different in terms of how you are able to support your business and how you are, you know, attract the kind of resources for us to be successful because this is a business [b michael AMERICA].  And when I think in terms of who we are as a consumer relative to the equity we have in this industry, you know, those numbers are very disproportionate.  So for me, that has always been, you know, or certainly at that time in the mid-2000s or early 2000s, was certainly my biggest challenge and the kind of partners I attracted really had a different agenda or some simply lacked the experience because the fashion industry is a very specific industry and there was never the proper funding provided by these partners for us to really be positioned.  Even with Saks [Saks Fifth Avenue], you know, when that partner decided to retire, you know, he could do so.  When he came to me, he was pretty much retired and so this was just sort of a big cash cow opportunity and then that left me at square one again.  And so, there is that struggle and it's really a financial struggle in terms of finding the proper funding to really build your business and how do you keep employees?  How do you keep talent?  How, you know, do your vendors trust you?  Those are variables that challenge you as a designer and I certainly had my share of that.  I read in 'The Alchemist' [Paulo Coehlo], that you fall down seven times and you get up eight and I remember when I read this and it was, you know, just a few years ago, and I counted in my head how many times I actually had fallen and it was seven, so I was very excited to have read that.  I said, okay, universe, this is number eight and indeed that proved to be true.
Story_ID: 665696
Speaker 1: So without mentioning names, what are some of the thi- situations that you found yourself in?  Is it that someone said, okay, there can be this business opportunity here, you know, but, or I can help raise money but at the end of the day the monies not raised, I'm just--
Speaker 2: I would say that it really had to do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Give two or three examples.
Speaker 2: Okay, so one example that was a reoccurring example was the inability for wannabe partners really to raise the kind of funding that is needed and that, you know, there's this, you know, attraction to fashion because it's a glossy business or it's perceived to be glossy but it's really a business, and it's a business, you know, that requires payroll, requires paying your vendors, producing product, et cetera, et cetera.  So if it is not properly funded and properly managed, you know, that's really what is key to success.  So it's attracting that kind of both management and funding that is the biggest challenge, for certain, or you, you have someone who maybe has deep pockets but it's on their terms and that those terms are not necessarily the way the industry works.  So then you're mismatched in that sense.  So it's definitely a challenge and as people of color, you know, it's not an investment that we readily do.
Speaker 1: Right, well it's not a, it's not an industry that people know so the question is, with investments, what kind of investments would be productive investments during this period that we talked about that--or what kind of deals, like if you could have your ideal deal, what would that deal look like?
Speaker 2: At that time, that deal really would have been having someone who understood business and could run it and manage it as a business and someone who understood production and could handle that and then, obviously, the creative, would be the ideal kind of foundation.
Speaker 1: So you would be the creative, so you're talking about structure right now (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Structure, absolutely.
Speaker 1: So structure was the, the Achilles heel?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Always.
Speaker 1: Okay, right, right, that's what the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But what about financing?  What amount of financing?
Speaker 2: I mean there's, I think you're asking me what is that number--
Speaker 1: Uh-hm.
Speaker 2: --and you can't put a number on it.  If you have a million dollars, you know, you build a million dollar business.  If you have a hundred million dollars, you create a hundred million dollar business.  So I think that that's commensurate with whatever, however you're defining the business.  I mean you need a million dollars for advertising or you maybe only need a hundred thousand dollars for advertising depending on how you position the business.  So I think that that number, and for me, in my, you know, various cycles of business, that number has changed based on where I was at any given cycle.
Story_ID: 665697
Speaker 1: What were you wanting, though, to be?  I mean, just like Audrey Hepburn was your, you know, your perfect, you know, you think of her, you know, that was your sort of perfect vision, what was your perfect vision of where you wanted to be?  Where--who were you wanting to be that maybe you admired in the world of fashion or, you know, from a success standpoint?
Speaker 2: Well I think that the people who I admired, in general for instance, at that time, Eunice [Eunice Johnson] and John Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] were people that I saw as successful people of color who had done something different, you know, who were pioneers, if you will, in their world and so I admired them.  So I kind of aspired for, you know, to be successful in that sense of successful.  In terms of on the artist side, you know, I loved Coco Chanel because I, again, saw her as being rebellious and doing something different.  So, in my head on (gestures) this side, you know, I thought that's who I am, you know.  I see the world differently and I want to be able to, as an artist, manifest that.
Speaker 1: Okay, but what is a business person?  What did you want to manifest in?  Were you wanting to be Oscar de la Renta?  I'm just saying, you know, did you want to be--
Speaker 2: Well, I, I, as in terms of business, I, yes, respected and admired Oscar de la Renta but at that stage because I'm staying with you in that period, and in that period, I answered the question.
Speaker 1: Okay, I gotcha.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's fair enough.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's fair enough.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Because you were approaching it from an artistic (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Precisely, precisely.
Speaker 1: --all the time, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when do you start, when is the period when you start looking for something different?
Speaker 2: So, now I'm going to revisit your question because now my present partner and business--who is the CEO of our company [b michael AMERICA], but just in the early stages of our relationship, said exactly to me the question you just presented.  And he said, Mark-Anthony [Mark-Anthony Edwards] said, "Okay so you have created a dress, you've sold it and someone has worn it so you have now proven that you are a successful designer.  What else would you like?"  And that was the question that became, you know, my aha moment and I realized and said to him, 'That as a--an American designer and business and brand, I would like to leave a legacy."  And he said, "Then that's a very different business than the business that you're in today."  And so that was really the moment that was the catalyst for change in terms of how I saw myself as a business and the model that we talked about and that made the most sense for us, frankly, is Ralph Lauren.  And so, you know, we really look at his business as a vertical lifestyle business as the business model that we also emulate.
Story_ID: 665698
Speaker 1: So how had you met Mark-Anthony [Mark-Anthony Edwards]?  How did he come into your, your space, and--
Speaker 2: So Mark-Anthony and I met exiting a cocktail party that shared friends, we later found out, shared friends, were hosting and so that was really how we met.  That's a whole lovely story but we met exiting this party that was hosted by friends of ours.
Speaker 1: Do you want to tell the whole lovely story?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Well I will say this, we met in an elevator.  He will say I picked him up in the elevator.  I'm thinking I said hello but on any rate, we met in an elevator, crowded elevator, with people who, you know, everyone knew who like, oh, who's that, I know who that is, kind of crowd and I said to someone, "Oh, I think I want to stand next to him," and the him being Mark-Anthony.  And I have no idea what possessed me to do that but I am happy that I obeyed the instinct and we started chatting and spilled out of the elevator and continued to chat and I offered him a ride home, assured him, you know, I'm with a car service, this is like, just a nice ride home, and being the gracious person that he is, we exchanged information and he said, "I'll take you to dinner to thank you for the ride home."  And so subsequently we had dinner and that was really the beginning of our meeting.  So even when you step into an elevator, you just never know.
Speaker 1: That's right.  So what was his background?  And, and why was that the needed component?
Speaker 2: Well it's important, is that he had no clue of my background.  So he just was responding to me so that was refreshing.  And his background was finance and wealth management.  So we were not living in the same world, which is why we had not met.  So, therefore, but that's what was important and when the stars were lining up, it was understanding that that's what was needed.  And so that's the component that really was the catalyst in terms of my change.
Speaker 1: Okay, so tell me then what happened, you'll have to continue with the story (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I will.  So Mark-Anthony had this conversation with me and my answer being that's what I want to do and he's like, then you're at square one in the sense that, you know, you really need to put together then an infrastructure, you need proper funding and you need, you know, as part of infrastructure the right team.  I'm saying it in a nice way (laughter).  And so he took that project on with me in terms of, you know, looking at the business as a new business, and the only thing that was part of that business was, of course, who I am but really looking at it from a business perspective, as a brand new business.  He's like, "Really, you're at square one as a business," so, built the business plan.  We reached out to--we identified together the individuals that we thought would get it and shared with them the vision for the business [b michael AMERICA] and, you know, we were very fortunate in that it was the right timing and we attracted the right kind of, you know, support.  We were at the same time, looking at opportunities, business opportunities, and Macy's [Macy's, Inc.] was part of that process in terms of launching a ready to wear collection and they--they are the door that we knocked on first.  And so, it was really that kind of an evolution, if you will.
Speaker 1: So, really, Mark-Anthony then played a critical role because he saw that--'cause he could have told you that there was no business (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well he pretty much told me there was no business.  I mean--
Speaker 1: I mean he could have told you that, you know, there's sometimes business people look and, you know, no matter how happy you are at things, you know things--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and you love it and whatever, they're like, you'll--this will never be a business.
Speaker 2: Well he said, "Unless you approach this, you know, with this formula, this is not a business."  And so, you know, we had very hard conversation in terms of how to really restructure or to really build a new business, if you will, and to rebrand the business and to position it as an American business and what that meant to us and, and things that were important for us, like we manufacture in America and we both shared that desire for that to be part of who we are as a business.  And after, you know, two years of working with Macy's and having them launch the ready to wear collection, you know, that, that was definitely another part of the process but maintaining our position as wanting to be made in America was always during that process a priority for us.
Story_ID: 665699
Speaker 1: What does he say you have to do, though?  What is your business plan?
Speaker 2: So the business plan really, again, you know in terms of that conversation with Mark-Anthony [Mark-Anthony Edwards], has to do with funding, funding, funding, okay.  Have to be, you know, financially sound as a business and putting together the right infrastructure in terms of team and management and then also positioning the brand properly as well being very important as we relaunch b michael [b michael AMERICA].
Speaker 1: So what are the things that he--that you put in place to relaunch?  That's why I'm saying that's important.  I--
Speaker 2: So what we did was we, again, in terms of, for instance, my pattern draper who was with me through all of my struggles, is still with me, and so there was already a nucleus on the creative side, at least, of people who, you know, there are two people who really were with me through struggling, you know, who sometimes got paid or got paid when they got paid, and, but who hung in there with me because it was also feeding their spirit and feeding their soul artistically and they also believed at some point that this is going to make sense.  And so, you know, two of those people are still with me, and, you know, and participate in every collection with me.  So we had that nucleus.
Speaker 1: So the nucleus (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On the creative side was there.
Speaker 1: But who were the two, two roles or two names?
Speaker 2: So, my pattern draper and one of the sample makers, Andrea [Andrea Thurlow] and Josephine [ph.] are their names.  So, so you know, it now, you know, I just, they bring me so much joy and the fact that they're doing so well and that we are now a business that blesses them, is just a wonderful feeling.  But, so we had that, but then what we did not have on the other side was, you know, management.  Management meaning the financial end which, you know, Mark-Anthony put together, a team of people that we couldn't necessarily at that stage afford, but people that we had a relationship with and that we thought if we could speak to them and they understood the vision, would support us.  And, indeed, in most instances, that is what happened.  So we put together an advisory board and I will say of some very, you know, respected powerful people who are chiefs in their own industry, and presented: this is our challenge, we're repositioning b michael as a brand.  We are building a new business, needing to put together an infrastructure and needing to attract funding and for us to do that, we need help to tell that story.  We need help to attract the right kind of support and so that advisory board, with his leadership, really worked hard around the kitchen table, if you will, to really just kind of help us hammer out some of those details in terms of how we do that, what would be looked for in business and someone else's point of view in terms of how we market that or how we promote that and so forth.  And, you know, and in the meantime, we understood the importance of presenting a collection and staying visible.  We were fortunate to attract sponsors which really helped us, you know, in terms of being able to show during that time as participants in Fashion Week [New York Fashion Week] which was very important for us and--
Speaker 1: So you created a sponsor model for Fashion Week?
Speaker 2: We did, we did, at that time, yes.  That time meaning, when Mark-Anthony--
Speaker 1: Came?
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: And has that pattern continued?
Speaker 2: Well that pattern continued for probably four shows and then we had reached a point of needing then to go back to the bigger screen of fashion and we went back to under the Mercedes-Benz umbrella and we were then in a financial position to support our show but it also was important for us to do that because we were branding ourselves and launching the b michael AMERICA RED collection and so--but we were grateful for having had sponsors that helped get us to that point.
Story_ID: 665700
Speaker 1: I see, so that's--'cause you know, when I was looking at things, I saw Mercedes-Benz [Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, right.
Speaker 1: --you know at the beginning but, you know, you never know when you're on the Internet if that, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --if that was or wasn't part of the show.  Okay, so Mercedes-Benz became a major sponsor?
Speaker 2: Mercedes-Benz is not a sponsor at all but Mercedes--of us, but Mercedes-Benz is a partner with IMG [International Management Group; IMG] and they are the, what's the word I'm looking for?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Organizers of Fashion Week.
Speaker 2: Of fashion.
Speaker 1: Organizers of Fashion Week and so to show under their umbrella, which is, you know, probably the most recognized during New York Fashion Week, was a decision that we made once we were able to do so.  We could not do that with our sponsors because there's a conflict.
Speaker 2: Okay, so how did you get under their umbrella, though?  How is that done?
Speaker 1: By writing a check.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: So, so you--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And you know, it's, it's really interesting because during Fashion Week there's always this interest on, you know, being sometimes the only, or certainly one, of two maybe, designers of color who show under that umbrella and the question is often, "Why is that?"  And it's really a financial answer because it's a very expensive way to show and that's it.
Story_ID: 665701
Speaker 1: So when you went to Macy's [Macy's, Inc.], this time, you're, you're going to Macy's with Mark-Anthony's business plan--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and structure behind you?  You're also going with your experience of the first situation, you know with--
Speaker 2: Yes, with some understanding of what that process is and what their expectation is.  And I think having had that experience many years ago with Saks [Saks Fifth Avenue], I, you know, it was interesting to find that even, you know, however many years later, much of that process had not really changed.  I mean, certainly each of these giants has their own nuances but, but the process in general is, is very similar.  So I had that.  But what we recognized that we needed in dealing with Macy's was to keep me in the lane of creativity and we then enlarged our team [at b michael AMERICA] with Andrea [Andrea Thurlow] who manages the retail aspect of Macy's.  And so she is really the liaison who is, you know, confronts them and who works with them.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you, so, is that the only thing that was important in that arrangement or was the structure of the arrangement different?
Speaker 2: Similar.
Speaker 1: And also were the price, you know, what is the difference between the bridge collection--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know the, what was the--
Speaker 2: Bridge.
Speaker 1: --bridge collection.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And the RED collection [b michael AMERICA RED]?
Speaker 2: So the difference really, and part of why we had so much conversation with Macy's was identifying who we are in that world.  You know, where do we fit and what makes sense for us.  And, you know, Macy's is a very different world than, say for instance, the world that I had been in (background noise).  And--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --right, and so, but again, because we wanted to be something very specific, and we also did not want to dilute our brand, and we, one of the things that was important for us was to manufacture in America.  So now you already know we're at a different price point in the Macy's world.  So, in terms of that part of the deal, I would say that Mark-Anthony [Mark-Anthony Edwards], with me, we had a lot of negotiation in terms of how we position ourselves.  It was also important that we position ourselves as an American brand period and not as something more specific than that as an ethnic brand or as a, anything else, except that we're an American brand.  So those were all the things that, you know, we had to work through as we developed our relationship with Macy's.
Story_ID: 665702
Speaker 1: And as you're developing your relationship with Macy's [Macy's, Inc.], you're also developing more of a relationship too, right?  Okay, sorry, okay, never mind, okay.  There he goes, okay.
Speaker 2: More of a relationship?
Speaker 1: No, I mean you're developing a personal--you're developing a business and a personal relationship?  Okay, right?
Speaker 2: Mark-Anthony [Mark-Anthony Edwards] and I?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We--we've started with a personal relationship and we layered on the business relationship (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The business relationship.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And did he--
Speaker 2: And it's a very unique thing when you are life partners and business partners.  And the thing that we both agreed early on was to understand your lane and to stay in your lane.  And so, you know, I think that if I had to give someone advice, it would be to clearly define those lanes and stay in those lanes.  And, and although, you know, you go back and forth in terms of what do you think or what do you think, but it's clear, it's clear to me his lane of expertise and it's clear what my lane of expertise is--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --as it relates to our business [b michael AMERICA].
Speaker 1: But as with any partnership, you know, because there are partners that don't work together and there are partners that work (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --and live together.  And the thing is, is that there also has to be a trust and it has to--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, and there's also the transfer of information because--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, but if it can work, it works extremely well.
Speaker 2: It works extremely well and, and I will say that we are examples of it working extremely well.  And we even see it as a very unique statement in terms of who we are as individuals, and what it is that we are doing in the American fashion industry is actually a very unique statement.
Speaker 1: So it's exciting, see?  It's exciting.
Speaker 2: At least I'm getting you excited (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes, I am finally, and every time I turn, his head's down (laughter), he was looking to the side, okay.  Sorry, yes, it's better.  Okay.
Story_ID: 665703
Speaker 1: What your, the, the business plan was a five year business plan [at b michael AMERICA]?  Was it--what was the length of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So the business plan was a launch and then, you know, you look at three years and you look at five years and so that's really the way the business plan is structured.  You know, we, I will share this part of our team.  We were having dinner, a friend of ours came in from California and she called and invited us to have dinner and she was bringing her date, which is the gentleman that she was seeing at the time.  And the four of us went for dinner and, you know, she and I are having conversation at this side of the table and Mark-Anthony [Mark-Anthony Edwards] and her date are having conversation on the other side of the table, and somehow they got on the subject of business and he's asking, "Well what are you doing," and Mark-Anthony is, you know, articulating what our business plan is about and what the vision is and he was excited and intrigued and said, "Wow, I'd love to hear more about that."  And so this is a world class, high powered attorney and Mark-Anthony's like, "We can't even afford to breathe the air you're breathing in terms of that." And he said, "How do you know?"  And he became the first member of our team.  Isn't that wonderful?
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: Yes, and he remains, you know, so he helped us, you know, structure the plan legally.  He helped us, you know, tell the story from that perspective and gave--brought another layer of credibility, if you will, and, of course, now we are a paying client but it was wonderful that he saw our vision and helped us that way.
Speaker 1: So who are these other people on your team?  He and others since he's a, I mean, you need, just who became your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So these are people as I said, who--
Speaker 1: Names?
Speaker 2: --are chiefs--
Speaker 1: Names?
Speaker 2: --in their industries and, you know, we are not sharing their names because he's so good at what it is that he's done that we've signed--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know--
Speaker 1: I gotcha.
Speaker 2: --NDAs [non-disclosure agreements].
Speaker 1: Okay, no problem.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, gotcha, okay.
Story_ID: 665704
Speaker 1: Tell me what the collection, the b michael AMERICA--it's b michael AMERICA but then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) b michael AMERICA is the umbrella.
Speaker 1: The umbrella, but under the umbrella, tell us--'cause I've only heard about the RED collection [b michael AMERICA RED] under the umbrella but I also know there's the, there's Dimensions, well, I had a Dimensions--
Speaker 2: So let me tell you what, no, nope, there is, b michael AMERICA is our umbrella collection.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  But didn't you do--release a line of hats under b Michael, something Added Dimensions label, Charming--
Speaker 2: Added Dimensions [Added Dimensions Inc.] was a retailer that carried our hats.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.
Speaker 2: Right, so not a brand of ours.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, our customer (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So und- so under the b michael AMERICA collection is what?
Speaker 2: Under the b michael AMERICA collection today is the flagship couture collection [b michael AMERICA Couture] and the RED collection, which is the ready to wear collection of dresses.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, so our umbrella brand is b michael AMERICA and those are labels underneath the brand.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what, what have you, okay, so, this is two--let's see, you launch that in what year then?
Speaker 2: Two thousand--well we started rebuilding the business around 2009, 2010 and we launched the RED collection a year ago, a year and a half ago now, actually.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So is your, so in your plan, you are how far into your plan?
Speaker 2: So we are now about to--so in our plan, we took the first year according to our plan to build the infrastructure, which is exactly what we did and that meant we rolled out the ready to wear into Macy's [Macy's, Inc.], we, within that first year, hired brand ambassadors to work in each of those Macy's and they're now our employees and so they're in the stores where we are and they have the product knowledge and so forth and so, that's important for us.  And then we, in some of those stores, built what we call soft shops so they're branded b michael AMERICA RED shops within Macy's.  So all this happened in our first year.  We, we added to our design team, obviously, we needed sample makers, et cetera, et cetera to keep up with the pace.  Within our team, we promoted Carmen [ph.] to run the production and so she is now our production manager.  And then earlier on in that process, but within the first year, Andrea [Andrea Thurlow] was also brought in as a consultant to work as the liaison.  So that was really what happened in the first year.  And now we are in our second year, we also presented two collections during the first year, I should also mention, that we supported under the umbrella of Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week.  Now we are in our second year and we are in the process of getting ready to launch yet another label which is called the BLUE collection [ph.] and that collection is going to be more evening wear.  The RED collection is day, social dresses and the BLUE collection will be focused more on evening wear and all of it is done 100 percent in America, here in the garment center [Garment District, New York, New York] and, you know, we see ourselves in the three to five year period as building a vertical lifestyle brand.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which will include menswear and maybe you're going to have a b michael pillow on your sofa or you're sleeping on b michael sheets.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's wonderful.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 665705
Speaker 1: So you in this, the structure of having the ambassadors, the brand ambassadors, having the shops, you know, that are b michael [b michael AMERICA] shops, where did you get the funding for that?  Because those are all, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --those are, those show to the store that you mean business?
Speaker 2: That we mean business and that's exactly right.  And, and the stores respond to you when you are able to position yourself and that's what is so exciting about what it is that we are doing.  We're a privately owned company and so, you know, that's the part that's very exciting.  We're privately owned and we are American made.  So, and we're us.  So that is a very historical, unique opportunity that we are presenting.  We just started also as part of our second year, our first real advertising campaign.  So we had a beautiful ad in last Sunday's New York Times [The New York Times] and, you know, we are advertising in some of, now, the regional magazines.  We're also doing some national advertising come the fall.  So we're very excited about rolling the brand out as an American lifestyle brand but we are privately owned, 100 percent.
Speaker 1: But are you--do you, 'cause before you had always been seeking out private invest--you know, investors.  Are you--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean in the past we sought investors (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Investors.
Speaker 2: --they were not necessarily privately owned.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, investors.
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: So was this done with investor money or are you self generating?  Because, either people take, you know, leaps of faith--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I mean you're doing it with a plan?
Speaker 2: We're doing it with a plan, yes, yes.  It's, I mean, I think when you get up in the morning, it's a leap of faith that your feet will stand up when you hit the floor, but there is a plan because there is a floor.  So it's not that you are stepping into nothing.
Speaker 1: But you didn't go out and get investors for this stage?
Speaker 2: No, we did not do the whole venture round and that kind of thing, I think is your question?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Or even any other investors who had their return on investment that they wanted or their investment paid back.
Speaker 2: No, we are one hundred percent privately owned.
Story_ID: 665706
Speaker 1: So let's, now I, I had read that the launch party was thrown by Kathy Chenault [Kathryn Chenault]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know for your RED collection [b michael AMERICA RED].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So can you talk about that launch party?
Speaker 2: Sure.  That, so, Kathy and Ken [Kenneth Chenault] are people that we respect greatly and one of the things in, of many, that I respect about Kathy and Ken is that they are, again, very accomplished people who have made history really in our time in terms of what their accomplishments are and I mean that of both of them.  I mean, obviously we understand Ken's role in Corporate America but Kathy also has been, you know, very formidable as a presence in terms of what she has done in New York [New York] and in the country philanthropically, as an example, and, you know, their commitment to education and the arts.  And so, Kathy wears my couture [b michael AMERICA Couture] and has been doing so for some time and so we thought it was very gracious of them to invite us to host the launch of our RED collection because, I think, they were just excited for us and very proud and it was also a very meaningful moment for people to be invited to their home, given who they are, and who we are, and to say to the world, that this really is indeed the world we live in today and what we accomplish and that we do celebrate each other's excellence.  I think it's like, an example that, you know, is historical, frankly.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's wonderful.  So, one, I read that Brenda Blackmon [HistoryMaker Brenda Wood] was one of the, I don't know, I mean I can only go on what I have here.
Speaker 2: No, Brenda Blackmon is, again, a person worthy of honoring because Brenda called us to say, "I love what you're doing and I have a clothing budget at the network [WXIA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] and I would like to wear your clothing but I want to do it using my clothing budget because I want to support the business and I want to make that statement," and that is honorable and I think, again, that is when excellence is celebrating excellence.  And so, you know, we are inspired and we are encouraged by people like that because it is often said that we don't support each other but there are some really great examples of us supporting each other and when we do, it really does make a difference.
Speaker 1: It makes a difference.  That's true (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Story_ID: 665707
Speaker 1: In Fashion Week [New York Fashion Week], then it was you--so the other designer was [HistoryMaker] Tracy Reese?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that's, okay.
Speaker 2: And who I love, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is her story different from your story because this--the reason, I mean we're in 2012 with my question, but the reason I'm asking these is that there have been other people, other black designers, who preceded you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And they were the artists and it's been a very, it's been a road with a lot of casualties.
Speaker 2: Yes, and you know, I, I go back in my head to Patrick Kelly who is someone that I followed early on and then Willi Smith whom we talked about but there are so many others.  There's [HistoryMaker] Stephen Burrows who came along with Halston and, you know, in that era and who participated as an American designer in France during that--
Speaker 1: 'Versailles' ['Grand Divertissement a Versailles'].
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: The 'Versailles' show.
Speaker 2: So we have had a real presence in the industry.  So when Mark-Anthony [Mark-Anthony Edwards] asked the question and I said I want to leave a legacy, what occurs to me is that that is what we had not done.  We had not become a business in this industry.  We don't have equity in this industry and that's what needs to happen and, and we, you know, that's our journey and the part of that journey is to leave that door open so that, you know, that, the next generation can walk through more, you know, and be expected, you know, with a different expectation.
Story_ID: 665708
Speaker 1: So you're really trying to create a new--well see first of all, I want to challenge you though too because--
Speaker 2: Challenge me.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause when we were talking about CFDA [Council of Fashion Designers of America], I hope that's how it goes, you were saying that, you know, it's all about branding and, you know, "I'm trying to bring the artist--"
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but what you really should be saying is that you're trying to bring the artist back to the brand because the brand is what is going to be going to the future (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, that is very, that is exactly true but relative in the context of the CFDA, I see the CFDA not as a business in that sense, the CFDA should be where we can go and sort of get massaged and, you know, inspired and encouraged so that we can then springboard back.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: So I think my answer is in that context.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, there had been an alternate because, you know, there's been this battle, I mean, forever, you know, Bethann [HistoryMaker Bethann Hardison] has been on the--I mean lots of people, you know, the role of African Americans or other minorities in the face of fashion which has been very European and very white and, you know, Italians, sorry Italian, even Japanese.  So where do you--are you--what are your thoughts about that and where do you, obviously you're saying we're going to be part of this and we are finding a way that we will be part of it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --and that is what I want my legacy to be but what is the process?  What do you think needs to be put in place?
Speaker 2: Well you know it's interesting because when we are the ones who are saying it, I think that what I want us to realize is that there is some of that power that we can take back and some of those things that we can make happen and I personally feel that when we talk about, you know, there are no, there are not enough black designers on the runway, or, excuse me, black models on the runway, you know, it's like for me that's almost a distraction because if there were more successful black businesses in the fashion industry, there would be more black models on the runway but it's really interesting to me that if you don't empower by supporting the businesses or the designers of color, you know, you're really missing the bigger picture because that's where the equity is, that, that's--and that's where others have opportunities, then you can open the door.  I don't think I've done a show without a black designer and interestingly enough, when, when there's a showcase of these are the people showing black designers, I don't even know that I've ever been in that line up, of black models, excuse me.  I don't know that I've ever been in that line up, but I've never done a show without a black model but I'm able to do so--I've been fortunate enough to have, you know, the showcase to do that.  And if you empower black designers and support black brands and walk into Saks [Saks Fifth Avenue] or walk into Neiman Marcus or walk into Bergdorf Goodman or walk into Macy's [Macy's, Inc.] and look for black designers, you're automatically going to help that.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's true.
Speaker 2: Right, it's true and I think we have to take back that power and not expect everyone else to do it for us.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Harlem's fashion week--Row, what did you feel about that initiative?  I want to ask about that initiative which was a, you know, it was a supplement to, well, talk about Harlem's Fashion Row.
Speaker 2: So Harlem's Fashion Row, would that be what we recently participated in?  No, I'm not, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, so you're not, oh, I see, okay.  Do you know Brandice Henderson [Brandice Henderson-Daniel]?
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, gotcha, okay, gotcha.
Speaker 2: Why, do you have us participating in Harlem's Fashion Row (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, but there's a whole thing about it here and it has, oh, I see.  See, it'll, no you are not here, sorry.  It attracted Audrey Smaltz [HistoryMaker Audrey Lavinia Smaltz], [HistoryMaker] Teri Agins, [HistoryMaker] Harriette Cole, Bevy Smith [HistoryMaker Bev Smith], Michaelange- Mic- you know, Angela Davis [HistoryMaker Michaela Angela Davis] and [HistoryMaker] Stephen Burrows, okay, never mind.
Story_ID: 665709
Speaker 1: So let's talk about Whitney Houston and 'Sparkle.'
Speaker 2: Okay, that makes me happy and--on some way because years ago, if you said to me, name someone that you want to dress, my answer would be Whitney Houston.  So when [HistoryMaker] Debra Martin Chase called me to say, "B [HistoryMaker B Michael], I am, you know coproducing 'Sparkle' and are you interested in working with Ruth Carter [Ruth E. Carter]," who, you know, is a fabulous costume designer, "on some of the wardrobe, would you be interested?  And I told Ruth I would call you." And I said, "Of course."  And at that stage, Whitney was not the subject of the conversation.  And it was just before Fashion Week [New York Fashion Week] and I said, "But at the moment, you know, I'm focused on Fashion Week, if we could have this conversation immediately after, I would love to talk about it."  And Ruth actually flew to New York [New York] like the day after my show and we met and Ruth decided that I would really focus on Whitney's wardrobe versus at large, and that was really how that came about and, you know, she came in with the story boards and they sent me the script and before you know it I was, here I am, and that was it.  And it was just the most wonderful process I fit, got to fit Whitney on set in Detroit [Michigan] and what I loved about that one on one experience, was her willingness to trust me and to let me be artistic as it relates to building her character and I thought only a real pro has the ability to do that.  So I, it was a wonderful experience.  I loved her sense of humor and I loved working with Ruth Carter who, you know, is a visionary and I think just superb in her ability to take an era and depict it the way she does in terms of costume.  So it was a great experience.
Speaker 1: You know, De- Debra and I want to law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] together.  She's a good friend of mine.  I didn't know that.  Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's a good friend we share.
Story_ID: 665710
Speaker 1: So you had that whole, that experience with the movie ['Sparkle'] and then the movie's made and I, you know, I remember Debra [HistoryMaker Debra Martin Chase] being totally excited about--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the whole process because this was her chance.  She wanted--I mean first off, this movie she had wanted to make for a very long time.
Speaker 2: For a very long time, right.
Speaker 1: And it had come back and Whitney [Whitney Houston] had come back with it and I think she had been, I don't know if there were three or four cast, you know, or whatever, and then Whitney dies.
Speaker 2: Yes, which was, you know, when I heard that news, it was hard to really embrace it as a fact and I remember that I actually thought it was a rumor.  When I initially heard the news, I, you know, thought this is, this is really a rumor and this is not happening, that, you know, how lies get around the Internet or something.  So it was really very difficult to come to terms with that.  And, but I was grateful that she left that as her last work and I thought, you know, her recording of "His Eye Is On The Sparrow" for that may be to be the last recording after her lifetime of achievement and that's your swan song, is like she's almost writing the script.  So I thought that was pretty spectacular.
Speaker 1: So, this happens, and in a way, you know, it's an interesting thing because you started with 'Dynasty' but this time you get credit.
Speaker 2: And this time I get credit.  And so, you know, that's, that's a wonderful thing and I am, you know, humbled and grateful and excited all at the same time about that experience.
Story_ID: 665711
Speaker 1: Tell me, B, or [HistoryMaker] B Michael, tell me how you end up participating in the Chicago History Museum [Chicago, Illinois] exhibit because now, you don't, I was sitting here thinking, yes I did see, you know but how did you end up?  How did that come about?  What was the, the initiation because, well anyway, that's, talk about, and that has a full circle (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Full circle--
Speaker 1: --too.
Speaker 2: --because I would say that for me, Eunice Johnson is the gift that keeps on giving and so even before the Chicago museum, when--
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.
Speaker 2: --when she passed, when Mrs. Johnson passed away, we were at the time, I was part of the committee planning whatever was going to happen and that was at the Metropolitan Museum [Metropolitan Museum of Art] here in New York City [New York, New York].  And so Mrs. Johnson passed away and it was decided by Linda [HistoryMaker Linda Johnson Rice] that rather than a funeral, that luncheon would be the homage for Mrs. Johnson.  So it became something else, as you know.  Former President Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] came and spoke and, you know, but it was still an invitation only event and so it became enormously special and part of the installation for that afternoon were, I think, seven gowns from the archive and you understand how vast that archive is, and so, that I was one of the gowns selected was overwhelming for me.  Firstly, at least I can say I've had a gown installed at the Met.  So, can't unring that bell.  But, more importantly, it was in tribute to Mrs. Johnson and so that was the same gown that was part of the installation at the Chicago museum when a much larger installation in tribute from her archive was presented.  And it was very exciting to be a part of that and Mark-Anthony [Mark-Anthony Edwards] and I were invited to the opening and it's their version of, you know, the costume night opening and so it was really a wonderful moment and I, you know, you felt her spirit and, and her colorful presence there that evening.  It was really quite magical.
Speaker 1: That's, I mean, a lot about that is really wonderful because when we heard in Chicago [Illinois] about the Met, that was, it was putting her where she needed to be on a national stage--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --because--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that's, that's where she started--that's what she represented.
Speaker 2: Precisely, and that's what she accomplished.  You know, I mean, this is a woman who was attending the couture in Paris [France] as a consumer.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: So, for certain, that needed to be on that kind of a stage, absolutely.  I look forward to it being recognized by those kinds of institutions even more so because that's an American accomplishment.
Speaker 1: A big American accomplishment (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A big American accomplishment, absolutely.
Speaker 1: So with that, can you talk about since you were part of that, with the Met, what was the envisioning and the planning and everything that went on, you know, I mean, with that?
Speaker 2: Well it certainly changed lanes when Mrs. Johnson passed away and it was decided that it would be the service, if you will, so it then really became something else.  It meant then people from Chicago wanted to come in to attend and how do you manage the people who would be attending and now layering in, in a very dignified way, people who needed to be there because of their personal relationship with Mrs. Johnson.  And so I think that the team at the Met really managed that well.  I mean, we as committee members certainly had some input and, and were able to share some of that development.  But I would say overall, it was managed very well and, of course, Linda helped to orchestrate who would be invited from Chicago and so forth.  But it was definitely very special.  I mean the only other kind of thing I went to the Met like that for was the tribute for Eleanor Lambert, was also at the Met.
Story_ID: 665712
Speaker 1: But clearly (clears throat), there has been, I--what I'm saying is that what else has been done by the Met for the African--for someone of African American descent?  In--there is?
Speaker 2: No, I'm listening to you, and I would say that my feeling about that, there is within the Met [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York] a organization, you know, they have a diversity audience development organization [Multicultural Audience Development Initiative] under the umbrella of the Met and, you know, the person who heads it is an employee of the Met but that's really what that focus is, audience diversity development--development.  And, and for me, I don't get that when you are a New York [New York] institution why that is necessary and, frankly, I stand behind my feeling about that because I don't want to just be invited to the Met when it is about minority, whatever it is, audience development, diversity development, I want to be invited to Met as an American designer to the costume--
Speaker 1: Salle?
Speaker 2: Whatever.  Or, you know, so I think that there's a disconnect for me when I look at the Met as an institution that belongs to New York and to America and the need for there to be still in 2014 what we call audience development, whatever it is, and I say that with respect, but I just think that there's a disconnect.  We should question why is that still necessary?
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2: And I don't pick on the Met specifically.
Speaker 1: That's all over.
Speaker 2: But it's all over.  I always question, why is that still necessary?  You know, why am I a black designer?  Why am I not an American designer?  So, and I think that there is something to our heritage in terms of what we're sharing and how we archive that, but in terms of the world in which we live, that should not be the calling card.
Speaker 1: Right, well, I mean I would say that black Americans have been wanting to be Americans since the beginning of time, so--
Speaker 2: I mean I think we've contributed to American soil (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We've contributed, that's right, very much.
Speaker 2: So I think it's a fair expectation.
Story_ID: 665713
Speaker 1: Arthur McGee, do you know the name Arthur McGee?
Speaker 2: I don't and so sorry about that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Good, I'm--so, this audience development organization [Multicultural Audience Development Initiative] within the Met [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York] reached out to me to see if I would serve on a committee for a new event that they were planning, which actually is the same slot that the Eunice Johnson event fit into, but the inaugural event was to recognize a designer of color by the name of Arthur McGee and even though I thought I was, you know, sort of a historian of people of color in the American fashion industry, I did not know who Arthur McGee was.  So Arthur McGee really is the grandfather of fashion designers of color.  He was, you know, on 7th Avenue, worked for houses that were on 7th Avenue, dressed people like a Cicely Tyson and others from her era, all owned Arthur McGee, and he's still living.
Speaker 2: He's still living?
Speaker 1: He's still alive.  And so that very first initiative was to recognize Arthur McGee and this took place in January, I think, or something, but it was their initiative under that umbrella.  And so I had to really go do my homework and, and find who Arthur McGee is and it was such a privilege and an honor to meet him and, you know, so on the one hand it was great that they did that, but on the other hand, I felt like, but why does this have to be to a very small specific audience?  Why isn't this treated as someone who contributed to the American fashion industry?  And so I guess, you know, that is really the attached point.  Why do we have to go through a certain door?
Speaker 2: That's right.  No, it's, it's very important, I think, at this stage that we widen the lane.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You know that--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: You know that we expand it and that, there, that's the dichotomy.

Speaker 1: I want to go into, so where would you see yourself in the--in your career 'cause you've been at it now for how many years?
Speaker 2: For all the years we've talked about (laughter).  And I am happy, I am happy that I see myself and that I am becoming that, you know, because I think, you know, you're, you know, but I'm happy that I have this opportunity to really, even though I am this many years in the game from let's say if you want to count my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Thirty years.
Speaker 2: --millinery years, thirty years, okay, that I still feel that I am now given this opportunity to grea- to break ground, new ground, as you know, an American designer of color that's building a brand that will outlive me and I think that's what's important, but a brand that will educate, that will provide opportunities for others, that will inspire others and that Americans will embrace as a lifestyle brand.  And I see that as a huge opportunity and that I can be, you know, that person, that I am that brand, I think, is a huge opportunity for me and I take it very seriously, and through all the thirty years of struggles and failures and ups and downs, if this is where I win, then I wouldn't change it.  It's really very powerful and it's a wonderful huge, huge opportunity.

Speaker 1: You know, can I ask a couple--that was a beautiful--I want to almost end there but I have two more questions 'cause you, really, you know, yeah, you, you know we ask legacy, that's our last question and I may ask it again but if that's the answer, I guess that will be fine because you, you know stated it so well but we always ask people, you know, what they want their legacy to be, but, I wanted to ask you; how do you define diversity in the fashion industry?
Speaker 2: Diversity in the fashion industry, frankly, I refrain from defining because I think that I--it doesn't deserve that kind of credibility because fashion is subjective and so how do you define that, you know.  You have to look a certain way to like a certain thing is really not how that works.  You have to have a certain taste to like a certain thing as an individual.  So it's very subjective and I will not participate in this idea that all people who have this skin color want to wear that and people who have that hair color want to wear something else.  I mean, I think that's poppycock and it's, and it's really something that has been forced upon us and that we buy into but actually think about it, it's poppycock, and if you could only wear designers, you know, I mean, I just think who are, who the world dictates, this is the only person you can wear, I mean really think about how silly that would be, or I can only design for a certain group of people.  I mean, how can you restrain my, you know, my artistic vision?
Speaker 1: So, as you sit here and even look, you know, I mean at the fashion industry and even the example you gave with Arthur, you know, that, Arthur McGee, that you had not heard of him so even that knowledge, you know, 'cause there'd be spans of time, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: There's spans of time and people are not knowledgeable of the others because it's sort of disparate.
Story_ID: 665716
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American community in fashion?  I think we touched upon that but I--
Speaker 2: Well, I, so my hope would be that we, and I, you know, maybe I'm repeating myself, but my hope would be that we understand how empowered we are as a consumer and how that can effect change in the industry, and how we can empower each other which I guess would really be the change.  How we can, you know, use our dollars as whether or not we are black media, doing what you do, so thank you for that, so we might be black media, black broadcast or black corporation, and finding ways to, you know, promote those of us in the industry.  I mean, it's just like if you're a collector of art and you buy black, you know, paintings by black artists or so it's, it's finding ways to create equity in the business because that's really what we want to have.  We want to have equity, you know, in the auto industry.  We want equity in the music industry, in the film industry, in technology and in fashion.  I mean these are things that are a part of our lives and how can we not have equity.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Now is there anyone you've designed, haven't designed for that you would like to?  Can't bring, can't--
Speaker 2: Well I would say, you know who I think I would just love to dress and I don't mind saying this out loud and she might hear, is Queen Latifah.  I think that she has a great presence and, you know, I would just have fun dressing her.  So when you see her, you'll tell her for me.
Speaker 1: That's great, okay.
Story_ID: 665717
Speaker 1: And then, I think back, so I--I lied, I have two more questions.  Is there anything you want to say about Mark-Anthony [Mark-Anthony Edwards] and his role and then I will get to my legacy question but through another lane?
Speaker 2: Well I would, what I would say about Mark-Anthony and his role, we were having dinner with a friend last week and she used that as an opportunity to point out to us the uniqueness of who we are in terms of how the world might see us and how that impacts, you know, perhaps the way people will think about other people and that we should really understand that and embrace that and so I, I would say I'm grateful and it was great that she was bold enough to share that with us but I'm also very grateful that we have that opportunity and so in that sense it's a very good partnership.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what did you just say (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, what do I mean by that specifically?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what did she say?
Speaker 2: So, she's saying, you know, you are, you know, a couple in your personal lives and you're at the head of a growing fashion brand and business in America and in the world [b michael AMERICA], and you're two people of color at the same time and that there's really no one traveling in that lane that's in the circles that the two of you are also in, to be frank.

Speaker 1: I want to take you then back to the little boy that you told me, you know, who was looking at black and white movies, at Audrey Hepburn and, oh gosh, and Bette Davis and--
Speaker 2: Yes, Lana Turner, all of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Lana Turner, all of those.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And how you were essentially alone in your aloneness, in some respects.  You didn't say that, I said it.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and knowing that you were somewhat different.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But not, well, you knew you were different?
Speaker 2: Yes, I knew that I was different.
Speaker 1: Uh-hm, and maybe even your [paternal] grandmother and your mother knew that you were different?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, both have shared with me that they knew that about me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so, I ask this because, you know, we live in a different world and (pause) we live in a different world now, you know, where gay and lesbian have been able to come to the fore and it be recognized because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --it was all sort of hidden from view but--even recognize, but sort of hidden from view in some circles, some not, but I want to take, I want you to take yourself back and see where you are and I'd like you to talk about your journey but in terms of your legacy because there are, you were, as you said, I mean it was you and your sketch pad and your movies and the world that you start seeing around you that you wanted to be in and, you there--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So I just would like you to, I'm only trying to, I'm talking a lot not to feed you but I want you to take yourself back and bring yourself here.
Speaker 2: Well I think that what I now understand about that circle is the power of how we see ourselves and what we think about ourselves and how those thoughts manifest who we are and even though, in the case of my life, you know, where I made decisions that along the way, decisions in terms of my choices in my personal life, my choices in business, et cetera, et cetera, that sometimes hinder that, if you will, but if it's the powerful thought, if it is, you know, the thought in your mind, it gets you there.  And, and I really believe that.  I really believe who I saw myself as, you know, that young boy in my own little world with my sketch pad and my movies, is how I saw myself, really and truly, that was, you know, my continuing thought.  And so, in that way, I am supposed to be here because that was the abiding thought.  And so for all the things that I did in between, if you maintain that, you know, that thought is powerful enough, which is why I said my favorite statement is my will for me is God's will for me.
Speaker 1: That's beautiful, thank you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That was great.

Speaker 1: (MARK-ANTHONY EDWARDS):  You know, in terms of--
Speaker 2: Ho-
Speaker 1: (MARK-ANTHONY EDWARDS): --the young boy, sketch pad, you know, reinventing yourself, you know, and to also have a gown hanging in the Smithsonian [National Museum of American History, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (MARK-ANTHONY EDWARDS):  Did you know that (laughter)?
Speaker 2: As part of the--
Speaker 1: No, when did that happen?
Speaker 2: That happened a few years ago.  [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson called me on my cell, she said, "B [HistoryMaker B Michael], it's Nancy, and the Smithsonian wants to do an installation on me and I told them I wanted to use your gown, do you care?"  I said, "Nancy, of course I don't care."  "Okay, well it's going to be in April and I want you and Mark-Anthony [Mark-Anthony Edwards] to come.  I'm sending them the gown and they're going to be in touch with you guys so you get all the information about it."  That's exactly what the conversation was and Mark-Anthony and I went and I hadn't really thought about what that means and we get there and, and it's, you know, a big deal to have an installation in the Smithsonian and when I called my mom, now remember Nancy Wilson, I grew up listening to her music and now I have this, and when I called my mom, I don't know that she's forgiven me yet for not being present for that moment but I said, "You know, I really didn't understand what that meant."  But, yes, I do have a gown, thank you sir, in the Smithsonian, thanks to my dear friend, Nancy Wilson.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 665720
Speaker 1: When Patrick Kelly died and the service in New York [New York] was at, in the auditorium at FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology], and I attended and there was a woman there that I am still friends with, and I can say her name, it's Carol Craig, and Carol came up to me and she said, "Oh, you're [HistoryMaker] B Michael, the hat designer."  She said, you know, "I'm friends with Lena Horne and she's been trying to buy a specific color of a hat you have in Saks [Saks Fifth Avenue] and they told her they could not get it.  They had it in black and she wants it in brown and they said they couldn't get it in brown."  She said, "Can I take your number?  Would you mind if I bring Lena into you, would you make the hat for her in brown?"  I said, sure.  So Audrey [Audrey Potts] was with me, Audrey gave her the number and, you know, a week or two later, Carol calls and she says (background noise), "Oh, can I bring Ms. Horne in like at five o'clock today?"  And Audrey said, "Sure."  So Audrey came into my studio and she said--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Hold on, I'm sorry, you probably, if you're going to do this, you should probably get it without the siren.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  But if you can backtrack a couple of sentences and just start over again for all its worth.  Give it a minute.
Speaker 1: A New York sound.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah. It wouldn't be New York without.
Speaker 1: Right.  So you don't know about Lena Horne either?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: So, having met Carol Craig at Patrick Kelly's service, exchanging numbers and her asking would I do this hat for Lena Horne in brown and she'd love to bring her in if so.  So Audrey gave her our card, she called, you know, whatever the time period was that passed, and she says, "I can bring her in today at five o'clock."  So Audrey said, sure.  And somewhere in my head I still wasn't quite expecting that, you know.  And truthfully I'll tell you, I heard her voice, I was sitting in my design room and I heard her voice in the outer showroom and I was like, "Oh my god."  I mean, could you imagine?  And I went in and there sat, in my showroom, Lena Horne and she had brought this coat down, it was a brown coat with a brown Persian collar and she wanted my Persian hat in brown to go with this coat.  And she stayed and we visited and then she said to me, "So what are you doing tonight, honey?"  So, whatever I was doing I wasn't going to be doing it.  And I said, "Oh, what would you like?"  And she said, "Would you like to come home with me?"  And I went home with her, in her car, and she, you know, that became the start of our relationship and I would visit her and she would tell me stories (background noise) and, you know, we really had a wonderful relationship that way.
Speaker 2: Okay, can we stop for a second?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Carmen [ph.].
Speaker 2: Carmen.
Speaker 1: Carmen.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: Are you printing?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That is an am- can you just--
Speaker 1: That's an amazing story.  So, Lena said would you like to come home with me on that evening and I said, sure, and went to her apartment on the East Side [New York, New York] and visited with her.  It was, I mean I just couldn't even believe it.  And she was just telling me stories.  And so I would visit from time to time, she'd call and say, "Would you like to come by?"  And I'd go by and she would just--we'd sit and drink and she'd tell me stories.  I mean, just, could you imagine?  Just like you and I are sitting here, we would have that kind of visit, and we always sat in her bedroom, but she had given me a tour of the apartment.  I remember she bought two apartments and took the wall down so it was enormous but we always sat in the bedroom.  And she had a room where she had all her gowns and she would, you know, show me things and it was just a wonderful rapport.  So when she passed away and her family invited me to the service, you know, it was really special to be there.  Then fast--you know, later, when her estate was being auctioned and Cicely [Cicely Tyson] and I went to the auction party, before the auction, as part of the estate there was one of the hats that I made for her, with the hat box and my signature and a little handwritten note that I had written her, was part of the offering and made it into the book and part of the auction, and that for me was like, I mean I'm still feeling emotional about it.  It was really quite a tribute and just very precious.  So, that was great.
