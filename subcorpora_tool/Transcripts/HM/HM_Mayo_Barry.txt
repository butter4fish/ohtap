Speaker 1: I want to ask you what your first childhood memory is?
Speaker 2: Birthday party, maybe one or two.  I mean--my childhood memories have been jaded by the fact that my mother was a prolific picture taker.  And I've got a lot of pictures from--and I'm not sure whether I remember the pictures or what was really happening, you know--  Christmas.
Story_ID: 10536
Speaker 1: Your father was a police officer and your mother a personnel clerk. And you were the only son and a middle child.  Describe what life was like growing up in your household.
Speaker 2: I, I think I was kind of a lone, a loner type of kid.  I mean, you know I played with my sisters, but I really remember being in my room a lot, reading, drums.  I had been beating on stuff before I got to start playing the drums.  That was a little later on.
Speaker 1: And, let's talk about the music.  What, what.  You love of music came very early.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: So I know, when you were let's say, in your room alone.  What--What were your--I mean were you--?
Speaker 2: I think--I don't remember--My mother may have told you I don't remember what age I was but I, you know.  I guess the defining moment was when my father brought home a Victrola.  You know, which was an early record player that played just 45s.  You remember those 45 RPM records, the ones with the holes in them?
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Okay.  My love of music started early on. I guess a defining moment was when my father brought home a Victrola and a box of 45 RPM [revolutions per minute] records.  And this Victrola would stack four, five, six of 'em.  He just played them over and over again.  And it was all kinds of music.  It was blues, jazz, I think it was a country record in there or so.  That never worked.  I never picked up in the country thing you know.  But (laughs), and I just played records over and over again.  And I was fascinated by turntables and a record changer.  Cause, you don't see that much any more.  But we don't see records any more.  But, you know, these records, they played and then there was a stack of them.  Then the arm came over and one dropped and I would just sit there for hours whether it was mine or my father's and just stare at the records.  But music had am impact on me very heavily early on and it's been a constant thread through my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's, let's pursue that a little bit.  Music, why, why do you like music so much?  What, what does it mean to you?
Speaker 2: It's an emotional thing for me.  Music is as much a part of me as I guess a paintbrush and oils would be to [Pablo] Picasso.  It's, it was a companion for me early.  I remember--actually I remember a closer relationship with music than I do to say early on to my family.  It's hard to explain.  But it's been an integral part of my life.  Maybe it's because it was easy.  In terms of, you don't have to--you don't have to share back.  I was--I remember myself being kind of a loner.  And music helped.  It was a buddy, a companion.
Speaker 1: You know that's, that's interesting because you seem so gregarious.  You know, but I understand that, that--.
Speaker 2: Well, you have to understand I'm a Cancer. If you into the zodiac, there's two kinds.  There's the extrovert, apparently extroverted kind and then there's the apparently introverted kind.  But the fact of the matter is they're all the same.  For people like me who appear to extroverted a lot of time that's just a shield to protect that private place inside.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when we get to that point, music is a very close person that you can share with.  It's almost like a person. It's emotional.  I went to see Sting the other night and I was flabbergasted.  It was one of the top three musical experiences of my life.  And, there were times when I almost cried during that concert.  There were times--I laughed a lot because it was just so incredibly awesome, the music, and the juxtaposition of he music and the messages, it took me back to my childhood.  And, I thought about the future.  It's a very, very personal thing.
Story_ID: 10537
Speaker 1: What type of music is your favorite music that you like?
Speaker 2: For a music lover that's a hard question to ask.  But I guess the, the safest and most accurate answer would be jazz, all kinds.  I was raised in a jazz househol--jazz on the radio.  That was my father and his best friend's music, so--it's funny how--specific records, specific songs you remember at a certain point in your life that were played around you and you couldn't have possibly--in other words I couldn't have been a [Dave] Lambert, [Jon] Hendricks and [Annie] Ross fan at the age of six.  But, it was about that time that that big album that they had out played.  And my father played it over and over again.  And by the time I was a late teenager, if you put that on or if you put it on now, I can sing a lot of that stuff--I can't scat--but I can sing a lot of that stuff word for word.  So, I don't remember like sittin' down learning that stuff.  You know, when I was 14, 15, and 16, but it was like when I was around 6 or 5 or 7 when that was playing around the house.  And it printed, okay, it made an impact.  So jazz I grew up listening to.  I'd say jazz is my--and it continues to dominate my life.  I'm the chair of a group that's trying to build a jazz museum here in Chicago [Illinois].  I mean I'm kind of committed to the music.
Story_ID: 10538
Speaker 1: I met a woman by the name of Geraldine DeHaas who was the founder of a group called Jazz Unites here in Chicago [Illinois], who put on a jazz fest on the South Side of Chicago at the South Shore Cultural Club.  I think it's called cultural center [South Shore Cultural Center], every summer.  And I was at that jazz festival about two yeas ago taking pictures.  And a friend of mine introduced me to her and that's the first time I met her.  And then a few months later he invited me to a meeting.  They had a fledging group that was trying--she had this idea, this concept of building a jazz museum that would be both a tribute to the music, be focused on seeing the music live and more importantly, have an educational component for the young folks coming up who don't get exposed to it.  You know it's heard to hear traditional jazz on the radio.  And I basically bought into her program.  I was at a--it was at a time in my life when just being a consultant and working out of my home, I had a little bit of time.  And, I saw how committed she was.  And the educational component was am important part of it to me.  Here when I was growing up in school--in schools in New York City  [New York] they had music programs. Now most public schools around the country, a lot of them don't have music programs.  (Pause)  A lot of the public schools around the country don't have music--formal music program any more.  Unless you go to a private school or a public school in a very upper middle-class neighborhood.  A lot of times these young people don't get to be exposed to a lot of different kinds of music and certainly not jazz.  So, I--since it's been an important part of my life, I thought that it would be important to be a part of building an institution that help perpetuated music form.
Speaker 2: Why do you think that this an important project for Chicago?
Speaker 1: Well, while I'm not a jazz expert, I'm very aware of many famous jazz musicians who got off the train around the Roosevelt [Road] and [sic.] 12th Street area. Back in the day and came here.  Chicago got a very rich music history.  It should be here.
Story_ID: 10539
Speaker 1: Let's go back to jazz as a, as a music form and an art form.  Why do you think--a lot of people say that it's truly, you know, American music.
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: Why do you think that it's, it's so important and why do you think people have embraced it in the world wide?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, that's, that's an involved question.  First of all it is probably with the exception of hip-hop and rap music, the only original American music art form.  At the same time, it's black music which, the combination of both makes that--the combination of both makes that very appealing to me.  Jazz does not have the stature in the general market in America that the opera, the symphony has.  And I think it should. I would like to see get elevated in status and I think that's a fundamental reason why I'm involved in this project.
Speaker 1: Okay. But, let me ask you this.  What does it do to you as, you know, as a music form?  You were saying, you know, how it makes you--what is, what is that whole process of listening to jazz?  What does it do to you as you're listening?
Speaker 2: It's--again that's--it's a personal question.  It's like--I'm not even sure that I can answer the question of, "What does jazz do to me while I listen to it?"  I think that would almost be like akin to saying if you were walking down the halls of the Art Institute [of Chicago] and you saw a [Vincent] Van Gogh [painter] and say, 'What does that do to you?"  Music and jazz music in particular makes me happy.  It--I played the drums from the third grade to graduation from high school.  So I hear music in my head in particular rhythms all the time.  Polyrhythms, I'll just be sittin' down at any particular time and I'll, you know (taps on knees in a rhythm) come up with beats. And I hear music and see music in everyday life.  It's hard for me--it's a--when I say it's a part of me, I hear it in my head most of the time.  In conversation, I can--I see connections between music and conversation.  It's an improvisational thing.  And jazz is the original improvisational art form.  So, there is sometimes structure in jazz music.  And then there is sometimes a lack of structure and the combination of the two is appealing to me because that's kind of how I am.  I mean, as a person, my personality.  There is certain parts of me that have routine and structure for me to be comfortable.  But I could never be rigid.  And, jazz music as an art form speaks to that part of my personality.
Story_ID: 10540
Speaker 1: To describe my family life growing up I, I'd have to think about what phase of my family life.  Because there was the--we grew up--I grew up in the South Bronx [New York, New York] 'til I was about, ten years old.  Then we moved to Harlem [New York, New York]. From ten to about eighteen.  Then my parents moved off to the Northeast Bronx to a totally different place and about a year or so later I moved out of the house when I was about nineteen years old.  So, it would depend on what phase.  In the middle of my early teen years, I lost a sister who died maybe four days before she would have been nineteen. I was about thirteen or fourteen.  She died on the day that the first version--the first--the original debut of 'Star Trek' [television show that debuted in 1966] came on because I remember watching that on television when my parents came home from the hospital.  So, you know, my early, early life I grew up in the South Bronx. I was a rambunctious little kid.  I remember telling my mother to come get me.  There were two kindergarten classes in PS 23 [New York City Public School 23].  I was in K1 and that teacher said, "Maybe he'd do better with the teacher in K2."  And then my mother got a phone call and said, "I think you should come and get Barry, and he should be in the park for a few more months because I'm not sure he's ready to be in school."  (Laughs)  Now, I mean that's how it started.  That's kindergarten (laughs).  And depending on who you spoke to, now at age forty-seven I haven't changed much (laughs).  So, you know, I was--I think they give kids today like me drugs.  Like Ritalin and stuff like that because I don't know if I'm ADD [Attention Deficit Disorder] or whatever, but it's hard to sit still.  I have a lot of energy, both mental and physical.  And so as a kid I was active.
Story_ID: 10541
Speaker 1: I can't talk about my childhood without talking about the singular thing that impacted me in my life.  And that was at the age of eight when desegregation happened.  We're talking 1960 now.  Busing started.  I was bused from the South Bronx [New York, New York] to the Northeast Bronx and I integrated a school.  First school.  The first black kid in this all white school. I remember the next year, the fourth grade, the second black person came, Michelle Slader (ph.).  I mean I remember this vividly.  Whenever the word Negro came up in class you--I remember feeling you know twenty-five eyeballs.  You know, (speaking in a whisper) "That's him, they're talking about."  I remember my third grade teacher, being my rambunctious self, when I--we were lined up, you know, we used to line up in the hallway.  When it was time to go anywhere, glee club, gym, you know, "Class line up."  And, of course, the children's artwork--the kids artwork would be you know, Class 3-2's you know, picture.  And I was picking at the scotch tape of one of these pictures 'cause it was a very Barry Mayo thing to do.  And I remember Miss Costello saying to me, "Barry stop that.  Don't forget you're just a visitor here."  You know, it was two years later in the fifth grade that the implication of what she said hit me.  I knew I felt uncomfortable, but didn't even know why.  Until years later when I said, "Damn, just a visitor."  So growing up as a kid I lived--and for the most part of my life, with the exception of the middle of the fifth grade, till the end of the sixth grade, I lived a dual existence.  Living in what some folks called a ghetto and going to school with either exclusively or predominantly white kids.  And that experience has shaped my adult life. The next phase would start probably junior high school. I mean, we moved to Harlem [New York, New York] when I was in the fifth grade. And--that--I went from an all white school, a predominantly white school to the neighborhood school.  And, they put me not in the brightest class.  So, I was kind of ahead of most of the kids.  I had the answers.  And being that big mouth kid, you know, I, I took pride and pleasure every time she asked a question and I was the first guy to raise my hand (energetically raises his hand).  And, I always had the answer.  And, you know that pretty much didn't endear me to the rest of the kids.  This is Harlem now in the '60s [1960s].  And, my teacher made the unfortunate mistake of one day saying, "Why can't you guys be like Barry?" and not being smart enough to shut up, and you know, realize--she was setting me up, you know what I mean.  She did not realize that, and, of course, they would say ugly things to me and I'd you know give them the finger and whatnot.  And then, I learned the expression that probably had more of an impact on me in that fifth and sixth grade time period which was, "Meet me at 3:00." And I had a fight almost every day (laughs).  I mean, they took turns.  It was like, "Whose got Barry today?" (laughs).  "Now it's my turn."  "Naw, now you had him yesterday!  Now it's my turn!"  "Now you've got him!" And finally--until I finally got really upset  you learn how to fight.  And it wasn't until I beat up a bully once that I got comfortable living in Harlem because then you get accepted, you know.  Then we graduated from the sixth grade and I was ready to go to the neighborhood junior high school and my parents sent me to another--they called it open enrollment.  You know, that was the buzzword for desegregation.  And, I went back up to the Bronx to a junior high school that was on this list of better schools.  And--a predominantly white school.  But what she didn't tell me, my mother, was that, it was an--it was an all-boys school.  And I got there the first day and I'm sitting in homeroom and I'm going, "There's something different about this class."  And I was there for like at least forty minutes before it dawned on me.  "There are no girls here."  Now you understand the sixth grade is when you first start being I mean aware of girls.  You chase them home.  They chase you home.  You ask your first person to go with you.  I mean, that's what was happening with the sixth grade.  And here I am in junior high school and there are no babes.  And I really resented it.  I was not happy about that.  And the next two years were unhappy years, for me.  Taking the train up to the Bronx to go to this all-boys junior high school.  And I guess I became resigned because then I took the test for Brooklyn Tech [Technical] High School [Brooklyn, New York, New York] which was one of the three public schools that were better high schools.  But it was an all-boys school.  So from the sixth grade to college I went to all-boys schools, predominately white all-boys schools.  But when I came home to the 'hood and had my two sets of friends.  Had my Jewish friends, and I had the brothers and sisters in the neighborhood.  Probably the only black kid in Harlem that had a poster of John, Paul, George and Ringo [the Beatles music group] on his wall (laughs).  And listening--I, I, I--and, again there's a music thread through all of this because I listened to the WWRL New York City which was the equivalent of I guess a WVON in Chicago [Illinois].  It was the black AM radio station.  But I also listened to the--to the top forty stations and in high school by high school the rock stations.  So in buying records I had the R&B [rhythm and blues] soul collection and I had the rock and roll collection.  So that juxtaposition of black and white has run through my whole life from the third grade on and continues today.
Story_ID: 10542
Speaker 1: What about some of your friends and things like that?  What, what, what--what I mean--what I'm asking the question--I'm asking you what does--how is friendship or friends impacted your life? And--.
Speaker 2: I, you know, I, I have this running argument with my wife because I say to her, I, I don't--I wouldn't say that I had a lot of friends, and she disagrees. I guess, you know, my definition of friendship can only be defined through adversity.  I think that particularly when you come up in a business, show business, radio where you get to meet a lot of people. And if you become--even have some modicum of success everybody is your friend.  So I'm not being negative, but it's really until you go through some bad times that you find out who your friends really are, to me.  And I think that works both ways. So, I'll say that my best friend, Mario Brooks was my sixth grade classmate from [New York City Public School] 129.  And he still lives on 128th Street in Harlem [New York, New York]. He's a plumber and I'm proud to say he's my best friend, still.  You know, but I've been through a lot of stuff with Mario, you know.  Most of my friends today other than from the childhood friends are people who I've  grown to know and love through some business association, you know, radio.  I spent the last twenty-four years in radio.  There are a lot of sacrifices that I ended up making from a social standpoint, social life.  I think to get to the top of any business, you really got to pay your dues and put in the time.  So I spent most of my time in the last twenty-something years trying to get good at radio.  And--so I didn't do a lot of socializing.  And the socializing that I did do was centered around the business, you know.  More so even than my family. Maybe that's why I'm on my second, you know, family.
Story_ID: 10543
Speaker 1: Since you have come from what it seems like a, a strong family unit and you have a family yourself, I'd like you to just address the issue of what the whole concept of family means to you.  And you know if there is any sense of tradition or, you know, sometimes people want to pass on things that they learn from, you know, from their family environment and their parents.  And some people reject, you know--,
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to try to rebuild.
Speaker 2: See this is interesting. I didn't come from a big family.  Again, by the time I was fourteen it was just my sister and I, and I think a lot of my--I never met either of my grandfathers.  One of my grandmothers died when I was very small.  The second one died when I was maybe early twenties.  My parents didn't have a lot of brothers and sisters.  I mean they were older and they, they died when I was younger.  So, when I think about the black family tradition, I, I can't honestly say that I share in a lot of that.  I don't--we never had a family reunion. When I was real young, I may remember having Thanksgiving or Christmas dinners around my aunt, my aunt's house but I can't name you three cousins that I have,  which is an unusual thing for somebody forty-seven years old--black.  You know a black person, forty-seven years old.
Story_ID: 10544
Speaker 1: I don't have a great sense of black--the big family experience.  I had a small family. My father worked as a, a policeman and he worked the night shift a lot.  And he took care of us. But I don't remember a four or five person, like close family unit like that.  Again, you asked me what I remember from my early childhood, I remember reading, and arts--building science kit in my room doing a lot of stuff, you know, pretty much alone. Both of my parents worked.  When I got married, I married someone who was like one of thirteen.  And it was almost like a novelty.  I mean, they had like family reunions.  I'd go and I'd be like, "Wow!  This is like a new experience." I mean my--the mother of my children has more brothers and sisters than I can name total family members  in my whole family, you know.  So that's different for me.  In my current family situation, family is traditional black family and black family values, and is something else.  It, it's interesting.  I wonder if there's a connection, I never really much thought about it between the fact that I've been married twice.  And both people--both women have big strong family units, something that I don't remember as a child. If I can psychoanalyze myself, maybe that was an attraction to me, you know.  Maybe that filled a void in my life.  I had a loving mother and father,  but I don't have a lot of stories to tell about, "Well when we were young and we all did this," good or bad.  You know it's just--it's different.  I think more of myself again as a loner.  And you know, also when I think back now, trying to sort through that dual existence.  They really couldn't share with me my experiences of going to schools with white kids.  I mean there was nothing in their background that--I'm not sure I even came home and talked about it a lot.  I mean I internalize a lot of stuff that helped me become, pretty much, a loner. And there's still that side of me that exist today.
Story_ID: 10545
Speaker 1: You started out in New York, right? Were you at the City College [of New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously)  Yes.  At CCNY. When I--directly after I graduated from high school.  For whole freshman year and one half a semester of my sophomore year which is when I dropped out the first time.
Speaker 1: But, why did you leave then?  I mean, was it something that you always wanted to do?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously)  What?
Speaker 1: What was your major?  I mean I'm just--what, what was the whole process and why did you drop out?
Speaker 2: Well, I went--fax machine--I went to an engineering high school and I took the college prep program at Brooklyn Technical High School [Brooklyn, New York].  So it was a fait accompli that I was going to go to college.  I never really thought much about that.  But like most young people, I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do.  And because I've always been interested in things electrical and technical, I enrolled in City College of New York and declared my major--although you don't take major courses in the beginning--EE-- electrical engineering.  But you do take physics and you do take calculus.  And that lasted approximately six months (laughs).  Okay, so I said, "Well, we've got to change our major clearly, 'cause this is not happening."  I mean, the early part of calculus was fine in high school, you know, but when you get to derivatives and d(x), d(y) and all that stuff, you know, I, I--certainly I can do something else with my life other than this right here, okay.  So computer--computer science I changed to by the beginning of my sophomore year.
Story_ID: 10546
Speaker 1: My parents and I got invited to go to this thing called an opportunity meeting for a company that ended up being called Holiday Magic [Cosmetics].  Long story short, it was--the Attorney General of New York, considered it a pyramid scheme.  But that was probably the next defining moment in my life.  Because--by the way, the attorney general was upset because they seemed to put more focus on building an organization than actually selling product.  But I got exposed to some sales training there and I started reading different kinds of materials.  Psychocybernetics, success cybernetics.  It was the first time I was introduced to Napoleon Hill's 'Think and Grow Rich.'  The concept of that which the mind can conceive and believe it can achieve.  The whole 'I am' concept.  I bought into that lock, stock and barrel.  And frankly, I was never the same again. Because I came to understand that I could achieve--I could do anything I wanted to if I believed it and was willing to work for it.  And you know, they had a very exciting presentation in this meeting, and they showed how, you know, you could invest just this and end up making this much money (gestures).  And I said, "Mom, Dad, I want to do this."  And the little money they had saved up for me for college they invested in this company for me.  And that's when I dropped out of college the first time.  And I moved out of--when things got hot in New York [New York], when this company started showing up on the front page of 'The New York Times' [newspaper], they said, "Maybe we need to go find some virgin territory."  I hooked up with this Jewish guy named Mark Burger who's also--two young guys and we moved to Baltimore [Maryland]--to Towson, Maryland, which is a northern suburb of Baltimore, with one of their--one of their management people, and we started Holiday Magic in that area.  Virgin territory.  Long story short, it didn't work for me.  I was living in this apartment--I'm like twenty years old at this point.  I was living in this apartment, I wasn't being successful, and I couldn't hold up my end of the rent.  I ended up having to leave and I moved in the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] in Baltimore.  Which represented at this point, the, the low point of my life.  I mean it's no--I mean other than my sister dying, I mean, I was effectively almost homeless.  And to--I, I didn't have enough money to buy a room for a week.  So what I was doing was going door to door selling cosmetics, and I had to collect enough deposits to pay for my room that night.  But I had to collect a bunch of them, 'cause I had to pay for the room and also had to go by the product to go back and then hopefully collect, you know.  And this was like an every day experience.  I remember, it was $8.50 a night for the room.  And inevitably, you run into some hard luck, some bad weather for two or three days.  I didn't pay for two or three days.  And then one day I went and my key didn't work.  And all that I had which was my '70 [1970] Ford Mustang with a quarter tank of gas, about three bucks in my pocket, and the clothes on my back, and I couldn't get to my stereo equipment, which was, of course, in my room in the Y (laughs).  That's all I owned.  That, a little bit of clothes.  I couldn't even get to that stuff.  And that was the first time I was stuck.  And I had to make a decision at that point.  I called my mom's.  They said, "Look, you tried hard trying to make it work.  Come on back home to New York."  And I couldn't do it.  Because that would have been admitting failure.  So, they had a friend in the market in Baltimore. I went to her house.  She lent me twenty bucks.  I said, "Could I stay here for a few days," and I went and got a job as a messenger at Sealand Service, and a teletype operator sending messages over the teletype around the world for what--containers or shipping and all that stuff.  And I did that for a few months until I found another lady who took me in through Holiday Magic. And then I decided to go back to school.
Story_ID: 10547
Speaker 1: So now we're in around 1972, '73 [1973].  I went over to Washington D.C. to Howard [University], 'cause what I always really wanted to be was an audio engineer.  Have you ever seen the recording studios?  All those buttons and a board.  That's what I really, really wanted to do.  And I went in in the summer time that's seventy--'73 [1973]--'74 [1974] I think it was, and I said, "Do you have any audio engineering courses?" And they said, "No."  and I said, "Well, what do you have?"  They said, "The closest thing we have to that is radio."  And I says, "Well I've always been a radio fanatic.  I used to build them.  I'm a music freak."  And that's how I really first officially started getting involved in radio.  In the School of Communications at Howard University.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Was, was the Howard experience a continuation of Harlem [New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: No, the Howard experience was totally different for me.  And I did not even have the traditional, if you know any people who went to Howard, and you think about the traditionally black college experience--I had almost none of that.  I've never been to a homecoming.  I've never been to one football game.  I think I went to one basketball game, because at this point I was broke.  I was living with my aunt in Washington, D.C., and to pay for school I had to work.  So I went to Howard full-time.  I took classes from eight [a.m.] to three [p.m.] and then I worked at Union Station, the train station, from four [p.m.] to midnight, as a car cleaner.  And I cleaned trains.  Bathrooms, mop, broom, disinfect, steel toed boots, and I cleaned trains. And that's how I paid for Howard.  So I skipped the whole social part.  I skipped the whole social part of, of school.  I can't play bid whist [card game].  I don't know how to play cards (laughs).  I just--I worked.  But by that time I had already been--but I still had "That which the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve."  So I never even thought about the fact that it was difficult--that I shouldn't be able to go to school full time and work forty hours a week, you know.  It never dawned on me that, that was even a difficult thing to do.  It was just what I had to do.  And I did it.  And got like a 3.75 grade point average out of it.  But, of course, I was paying for it, you know.  Makes--it does make a difference when you're paying for it (laughs).
Speaker 2: Now how did you--so what you're describing is really not much of a social life.  Because you didn't have time for that.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) No.
Speaker 2: You didn't have the typical, you know, "black college experience."
Speaker 1: No.  I was behind in most social aspects until I got in the radio business.  And then I did some major catching up (laughs).

Speaker 1: You were the first general manager for WHBC [Howard University's radio station].
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: WHBC and--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) There were--there were a group of about seven students. This, this grew out of some unrest amongst us radio students. Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] is one of the few educational institutions in America that has a radio station that's got a commercial license, as opposed to just a, you know, a campus radio station for students.  And they have professionals on the air.  And with the exception of like one or two weekend slots, they had no students on the air.  And we were pretty pissed off about it.  And we boycotted classes at one time, and to alleviate that, they came up with a program for maybe four students to have a weekend slot. Or--you could try for that, which I thought my chances were very slim to do that--or, they had some equipment and they allowed the students to build  a, a what they called a carrier current station, which is--just goes through the dorms on the campus.  And something told me that it would be better to be a big fish in a small pond.  Since I wasn't socially hooked up at Howard, I thought I should do that.  And I did.  A group of us--a group of engineering students built it, and we staffed it.  And I, I don't know how.  I don't even remember how, but I got elected, chosen to be the general manager.  So I was the--we put that station on the air and I was the first general manager of WHBC--the voice of Howard's Black Communicators.
Story_ID: 10549
Speaker 1: Why that had--I mean, what role did managing that [Howard University's WHBC radio station] have--.
Speaker 2: Have in the rest of my career?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well, as the general manager--I took on that role.  It was interesting, 'cause every day, you could see a transformation around three o'clock [p.m.]. Because I would show up at the radio station dressed in a suit and a tie, 'cause in my mind, I was a general manager and I was going to try to recreate what I perceived as being the real live experience.  And at three o'clock, I went and changed my clothes and put on my jeans and workboots and went to work at the train station.  I bought into the fact that this was a real radio station.  I mean, we had a sales department.  I mean, we were selling the ads on the campus, but, you know, in my mind again "That which the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve."  At the end of my junior year, in May, I got a phone call from the dean of the school.  And I had the early morning show--I had signed on the radio station at six o'clock [a.m.] from six to eight [a.m.].  And he called me at the radio station and said, "Barry when you finish, could you come up to the office." And I did.  And he told me that he had gotten this job description.  There, there was a radio station and owner--and a radio station in Little Rock, Arkansas that was looking for a program director.  And he said, "You know, why don't you call this guy and look into it?"  He thought that I was a graduating senior.  I mean, I had been there for a couple of years, and he knew that I had been in college before.  I was older than most of the other students, 'cause you know, I had that gap.  And he figured he was helping one of his graduating seniors to get a job.  And I called down to Little Rock, Arkansas to the general manager of this new station.  Actually, the owner was getting ready to take over the station in a couple of months. And I essentially got the job over the telephone over a period of interviews over the course of six weeks.  I mean, I--he called me and talked.  I had to take this psychological profile test.  And I went down to the FCC [Federal Communications Commission].  'Cause as a radio student, we knew 1919 M Street [Washington, D.C.] was where the Federal Communications Commission is. And every radio station and television station's license is there for the public to know and peruse.  And I went and perused their, their public file and saw that there were some discrepancies between what this general manager had said to me about the station.  Something minor like, "It was 2500 watts."  And I saw that it was 5000 watts. So I called him up and said, "You told me the station was this."  And it blew this guy's mind that one a job tip, a job interview that somebody would go to the lengths of going to the FCC, pulling the public file, and delving into it that deep.  And, you know, he told me later on. He said, "You know, the fact that you built a radio station--albeit as a student--the fact that you went down to the government and pulled our file and told him some stuff he didn't know" was what had attracted him to me.  And by the time they sent for me to come down to Little Rock for the interview, I had already been hired.  So that's how I got in the business.  So, I'd say the WHBC--the Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] campus radio experience is 100 percent responsible for my entrance into the radio business.
Story_ID: 10550
Speaker 1: What did the other students think of you?
Speaker 2: (Laughs).
Speaker 1: I mean as general manager [of WHBC, Howard University's radio station, Washington, D.C.]? I mean, what did they think of you and--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) I got a piece of tape that I should show you at some point.  Back in the--in 1986.  By then I was--I'm getting off the subject, but it's on the subject--I was by then the general manager of a radio station in New York City.  And the Black Music Association had a roast for my tenth year anniversary in the business.  And they found this sister named Roxanne who ended up being a friend of my wife, but she was in the business in New York and she got up and roasted me and--and she also was one of the students who worked at the radio station.  And she did a monologue on me about what it was like to work for Barry.  She said--she just went on and on of how Barry didn't realize this was college--this wasn't real radio (laughs).  She said, "Barry had us signing in, punching time clock, signing in and signing out.  And we were like, 'Hey man, this is school.  This is not the real deal.'"  But you couldn't tell me that, you know.  Barry would get all dressed up with the college students in platform shows and bellbottom jeans.  And Barry is up there with a suit and tie on looking at his watch when you coming in going, "Shouldn't you have been here fifteen minutes ago?"  That was--what was it like?  What did they think?  They probably pretty much hated my guts (laughs).  And by the way, I'm that--still that same kid, you know, in the sixth grade.  You know, focused, has no problem telling you off--a big mouth kid, arrogant, short, Napoleonic (laughs).  Five [feet] six and a half [inches].  Does that tell you everything you need to know (laughs)?
Story_ID: 10551
Speaker 1: Was it the dean or the president who called you up?
Speaker 2: It was the dean.  Dean [Lionel] Barrow who--when I went to tell him that I had made a deal and had accepted the job [at a radio station in Little Rock, Arkansas] that I was leaving school.  Sometime during the interim I think he found out that I was just a junior, and it mortified him.  I mean think about it.  This was during the time when the School of Communications [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] was moving from--this was the school that [dean] Tony Brown [broadcast commentator] set up.  And the premise for the School of Communications was that their instructors were going to be people who worked in the business and bring real live experience as opposed to academicians.  You know, my broadcast management instructor didn't even have a college degree as I remember it.  But he had worked in the business and it was those disciplines they were hoping--Tony Brown, that was how he originally set it up, that--bring real live experienced people to teach these students.  This was during the time when the school was moving more towards an academic--and Dean Barrow was a Ph.D.  And when he found out that he had aided and abetted to a student dropping out, he went nuts and tried to talk me out of it.  My parents, when I called the up and said, "I'm leaving school." Everybody was like, "Are you sure you want to do this?"  And you have to understand I was twenty hours away from getting my degree.  So the senior year would have been a breeze.  I mean, ten hours each semester, no big deal.  I had finished my major courses. I had finished my minor courses. I just had twenty hours worth of electives.  And that man for about ten years hounded me.  Wherever I moved, Little Rock; Norfolk, Virginia; Nashville, Tennessee; Chicago [Illinois] the first time, New York [New York].  Wherever I was, he found me and he said, "Well, Barry you're in Nashville now.  You know, you've got Fisk University right there.  You can go there, take those last twenty hours so you can graduate from Howard University" (laughs).  And, I said, "Yes, Dean Barrow."  But you know, as I moved up in the business, I'm saying, "What do I need a college degree for?  I'm, I'm happening.  You know, I'm doing well."  You know what I mean?  So I didn't finish school at that time.  Dean Barrow was very, very upset that I dropped out of college on his watch.  And as I moved up in the business, it became even more important, I think, to him and to his successors who--some of whom I met and kept in contact with--to graduate from school and particularly from Howard.  Well, it's funny.  I was at the NABOB--National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters--dinner about four years ago.  And a young guy, whose name happens to be Mayo--it was Whitman Mayo, Grady on 'Sanford and Son'--Whitman Mayo's son, Ron, came up to me at the dinner and said, "Hi, I'm Ron Mayo, and I'm the general manager of WHBC [Howard University radio station]," you know.  "And you know, we're having some problems.  We have some technical problems.  There's not enough money.  We're not on in all the dorms.  I was wondering if you could help us."  And I put him through a few hoops over the next few months and said, "Well you go back and do a report and let me know exactly what the problem is and what's it going to take to get the station back up in all the dorms."  And he came back to me.  And I said, "Send me an itemized list of what the problems are."  And he did it working with the new dean.  And he sent me a list and it turned out to be about ten thousand dollars.  So I went down to the school and I made a donation for ten thousand dollars to get my baby radio station back on the air in all the dorms.  And the new dean, Jan [Dr. Jannette L.] Dates said to me--she did her homework and she said, "You know Barry you left here in 1976. Are you aware of the only fact that you only have twenty hours left to get a degree?"  And I said, "Yes."  She says, " Well, why don't you knock that out?  We'd love for you to finally graduate."  You understand, this is like twenty years later.  And my son--I had been divorced.  My son was living with me.  My oldest son was living with me at the time, and he was entering high school.  And I didn't really think he was serious enough about school.  And these two things were happening at the same time.  And I said, "You know what?  I'm gonna do it.  I'm gonna go back to school--A--to show my son that even though I've had some success in business, I still think it's important to finish."  I went to Columbia College here in Chicago, asked the head of the radio department if I could teach a course.  I said "Don't pay me any money.  Just give me five credits."  And it was an unusual request.  He had to go to the Board of Trustees to get that passed because no one had ever made that request before.  You know, "Don't give me any money. Just let me have college credit for teaching a course."  And I, I taught a radio sales course.  And that left fifteen credits, and I took five classes and discovered photography and that's another story.  But in May of 1970--1997, May 10th, I graduated.  I walked down the aisle. Parents, sister, family, close friends and I finally graduated from college, two years ago.  And I was I think the only forty-five year old person in the class (laughs).  It was good.
Speaker 1: That, that's what I want to know.  What, what did that represent?
Speaker 2: Well, it's funny.  I had convinced myself that I was doing this for my son.  About two or three months before graduation I found myself getting real emotional about it.  And I realized--(pause)--I realized that closure--finishing wasn't boring to me. It was good.  It was good. I didn't--I didn't realize how important finishing something that was left open was to me.  It certainly wasn't about getting a job.  It wasn't about making money.  I had made a considerable about of money.  Most people thought I was retired (laughs) at that time.  But it was important and it felt great.  It really did.  It felt great for my son to see that.  My parents hadn't seen me graduate from anything since junior high school.  I was in that group of students at Brooklyn Tech[nical] High School [Brooklyn, New York]. There was a handful of black students and we thought the graduation exercise was corny.  And we boycotted.  I mean we marched for the Vietnam War and we boycotted graduation.  So I never went to graduation.  So my parents never saw me graduate from high school.  I dropped out of college the first time.  So, I don't know how old you are when you graduate from junior high school, ninth grade. What, fourteen?  Something like that.  So from fourteen to forty-five is how long it took before my parents had a chance to see me graduate.  So I realized at the end of the day I did it for me.  But I thought I was doing it for my son.  It was great.
Story_ID: 10552
Speaker 1: What are you views about education?  An education and you know, black youth or education--.
Speaker 2: Right.  It is the only answer, in my opinion, for most of the challenges that black people have.  And I focus my time and energies outside of my hobbies on the education front.  I've for the last ten years I've been on the board of trustees at what is to me a model school here in Chicago [Illinois] called Providence-St. Mel on the West Side where a great man of principle, Paul Adams has found a system that takes 100 percent of the students who graduate go on to college.  And I found I'd rather spend my money and my time focused on a group of individuals whose lives that I can impact.  So I spend a lot of time thinking about education.  Even the educational component of the National Jazz Museum to help perpetuate the music.  It's like the same thing.  I don't think black people can rely or should rely on the government, or anybody else.  When I think about my own life, the fact of the matter is the thing that separates me, the only thing that separates me--I mean I was very fortunate to have my mother and my father there.  And they were extremely supportive of me.  I mean, whatever I wanted to do, they supported me.  But the thing that separates me from a lot of my friends who aren't even alive now in the same neighborhood was the difference in education background.
Story_ID: 10553
Speaker 1: I just wanted to pick up on the--when you talked about the idea of if you were a child these days, they'd give you drugs.  Because you may have had ADD [Attention Deficit Disorder] or whatever.  You were the kind of child that probably could have fallen through the cracks if somebody hadn't helped you and if there's a specific person like that, that you want to talk about?  Is there a teacher that--apparently you have--you said you were kind of all over the place.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Somebody must have said, "He's got potential" or whatever.  You understand what I'm saying in terms of--?
Speaker 2: I do exactly.  After my parents who--it, it's funny.  I don't remember a lot of the specific lessons.  I mean like you hear a lot of people say, "Well, you know, your mother always said this, this and that."  I don't remember a lot of those specific things other than things like, "First impressions are lasting impressions."  That was the big thing with my mom.  But there were a number of people throughout my career who I think wrapped their arms around me and me and said,  "I think this kid can do something."  There was a guy who I've been trying to find.  My first real job in high school was at the Port Authority in New York [New York].  I've always had a job, once delivering papers--Port Authority in New York.  And there was a guy named Jack Marshall there who I think saw something in me.  I was struggling at that time.  I was in high school. I was experimenting with drugs.  I was not being particularly reliable I think, fall asleep at work.  And I remember him inviting me out to his house out in New Jersey.  And the weekend specifically--I can't tell you what date it was in the late 60s [1960s] but it was the weekend that the man landed, landed on the moon [July 20, 1969.]  And he took a special interest in me when he could have fired me--well, turned his back on me.  And I remembered that.  There are a number of people--I mean later on in life. The gentleman who became my partner, Lee Simonson hired me from Chicago [Illinois] to come to New York.  Saw potential and we ended up being business partners.  There are a number of people who I think said, "You come over here for a second."  Or, "No, I see where you're going, but maybe not like this.  Like this."
Speaker 1: Why do you think that's important that people like that exist?
Speaker 2: Well I mean--,
Speaker 1: Mentors.
Speaker 2: --most of us--yeah, I was getting ready to use that word.  So few black people historically have had the benefit of having both their parents there.  Well, I shouldn't--so few.  A lot of people don't.  And then to be fortunate enough to have the parents have a supportive relationship because a lot of our parents had to deal with their own issues, you know, their own challenges.  Outside of that, if there is no--you put your parents in a home here. You put the education experience over here, which sometimes often is not good.  You need another individual.  A lot of times it's another family member, grandma, big mamma or a friend of the family, someone to mentor you.  Someone to say, "You know what--."  Someone to provide the, the thing that maybe your parents couldn't because---and then fill in the blanks.  Not because they weren't good parents, not because they weren't there.  Just because we look at other people different than we look at our parents.  We take our parents for granted some times.  Sometimes we'll listen to somebody else say something--give the same message that your parents are trying to give you, but it means more.  I don't know.  But I think it's critical to have a mentor.  Again I try and mentor a lot of high school students through Providence-St. Mel [Chicago, Illinois].  And it's been a critical part of my growth process. It helps me to grow. I get a lot out of that, selfishly, in addition to giving.
Story_ID: 10554
Speaker 1: I have one other question to ask before--I want to move on to your career in the music business.  But, the whole drug thing.  How do you think you were saved?  You know from that.  I mean you could have gone lots--you know--,
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --A lot of people in that era experimented with drugs--,
Speaker 2: Right,
Speaker 1: --that was more common (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Right.  Well you know.  That's not a difficult question for me because what was going on in my life--what I think saved me was Holiday Magic [Cosmetics], ironically enough.  While I didn't, while I didn't become a success and make a lot of money out of Holiday Magic per se, the two things it did for me, one I spoke about previously was introducing me to that "I am" concept--that Napoleon Hill [motivational author] and that whole success orientation.  And the other thing is it focused my mind on business away from--I mean I dropped out of college where those influences were.  I was hanging out in Crampton Auditorium the City College in New York [sic, Howard University, Washington, D.C.] getting buzzy brained half the time.  And--you know, one thing about my personality. It's the best and the worst of me is when I get focused on something I'm dogged about it.  And had I not gotten into Holiday Magic I might have become dogged about drugs.  You know, I want to have the best high.  That would be in my personality to do that.  And frankly, I think I was saved by Holiday Magic Cosmetics.
Story_ID: 10555
Speaker 1: So you started out in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Speaker 2: Yes, my first job in radio.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how was that whole experience compared to WHBC--, [Howard University radio station, Washington D.C.]
Speaker 2: Whooo!
Speaker 1: --since, you know, you had been (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely.  Its a--it was a sea change.  I mean you in essence had a college student getting a middle level management job. And everybody except maybe one guy at the radio station resented me.  Think about it.  The receptionist had more experience in radio than I did.  See I'm coming in as the program director.  See one thing if I like had been hired to be the overnight disc jockey and I worked my way up.  But I came in as all the news people, all the program directors, I was their boss.  And they knew that I had just left school.  And they didn't particularly appreciate that.  And you know, this was a new owner buying a station so the first thing we did is we came in, we got the keys at midnight and fired just about the whole staff except for one or two people. And of course, that word gets around.  So, let's review class.  We've got a guy from New York City come in, 'a Yankee' as they call us--a guy from New York City invading our town here in Little Rock, Arkansas who in essence is a junior in college telling us, professionals, what to do.  Okay.  So, I did not know what I was doing (laughs).  I was scared, and I had the point of view of a college student.  And I worked people like seven days a week until my boss said to me one day, "You know, you have to give these people days off.  They have to have at least one day off."  Because in my mind, we're here to get something done, we're working.  (Laughs)  It was again my personality.  This is what we have to do, this is what we have to do, let's put full effort into this.  And I didn't understand why people should have a day off. Anyway, there was one guy at the radio station who didn't seem to resent me.  He was the only white guy on a--this was an R&B [rhythm and blues] radio station.  A guy who called himself 'Dr. J,' Bob Harrison, who came and put his arm around me in a production room.  He was the afternoon drive jock when I got there and said, "You know, I think I understand what you're trying to do.  Have you considered doing it this way?"  And he helped me.  And probably if it were not for him, I may not have made it.  Because I truly, in terms of professional business, I didn't know what I was doing.  And I remember that guy two and a half years later when I got to Chicago [Illinois] and I hired him.  And he became the most popular white disc jockey in black radio, here in Chicago.  A guy named Bob Wall, is the guy who saved my life and got me started.  Of course, he ended up having problems of his own.  But, he's responsible for my early--in my mind you know, he helped me. I took him off of afternoons and put him on in the morning and told him to go off, be crazy.  And when he ultimately got here, when I got hired by WGCI [radio station] and we hired him, most of the things he did--the skits that he did here in Chicago, was stuff we did in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1976, '77--1976, 1977.
Speaker 1: So you went from Little Rock to--did you go to Nashville [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: I went--I, I had, you know--I was in Little Rock from '76 [1976], the middle of '76 'til early '77 [1977].  After about a year, the owner came in and changed the format of the station because he thought he could make more money with it doing the Top 40 format.  He ended up being wrong.  The station went from like number two down to the pits.  But I was out of my first job in radio. And I worked five nights a week in clubs and discos and helped start disco in Little Rock.  At that time the concept of going out to pay money to here records was an anathema to those folks.  Big bands were still, you know, like, "What band are we going out to hear?"  And was the thing at the time because disco hadn't been invented.  We invented it and I became "your main man Mayo."  And that's how I paid--that's how I lived for about six months until I moved and got my second job in radio in Norfolk, Virginia. This is now 1978.  And I went from--in January from Norfolk to Nashville and by November, I got my first big job here in Chicago at WGCI, which was number nineteen in the market.  At that time, AM was still up there. It was waning.  And it was the lowest rated of all the black radio stations here in town.  And, when I left, it was the number one music station right behind WGN, which at that time was (unclear) number one.  And that was my first big success in the business.
Speaker 1: Now, were you always program director?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I, I--it was funny.  So, Little Rock, program director, Norfolk, program director, Nashville, program director and I got hired at [W]GCI as program director.  So, it was weird.  Most people don't start in business in management.  But, I did.  And I--the first job I had where I wasn't program director was when I left Chicago to go to New York to work for my soon to be partner Lee Simonson as the assistant program director to help launch another WGCI-like radio station in New York called 98.7 Kiss [WRKS-FM].
Speaker 1: Now, one would say then that being--starting at--so it didn't hurt you not to work your way up, obviously.  Was it--did it give you more focus--I don't--what do you attribute your success take it that it's program director.  Since it seems--.
Speaker 2: Well, in that first job, I had a consultant.  An older guy who had a Top 40 in rock and roll background who taught me the mechanics of the business.  But the essence of what my thing was, over the years was--goes back to my love of music.  And I think that I learned instinctively how to put together a music platform that made people want to listen.  That's one.  Two, the radio industry and the record industry is one which has its vagaries.  And, you know, there have been a lot of scandals about payola and stuff like that.  Being the son of a cop I never, I never--I was afraid to have someone else influence me.  So I never, ever took a dime in my career to play a record.  And, I had a sense of independence.  No one could tell me what to do or what it was. So I just did what I thought was right, what I heard.  And as the years went on, with the advent of research in music, I juxtaposed research which was--I was one of the first to do that in black radio with my musical instincts.  And when I was at my best was when I had a healthy dose of my musical mind and research, which again is pervasive in the industry now.  But it was kind of new back in the late '70s [1970s] early '80s [1980s] when I was first taught that.

Speaker 1: --which was mainly eastern to southern.  And then you came to the Midwest.  I just what to know what are--I mean, those are three different types of, of markets.
Speaker 2: Yes.  What's your question?
Speaker 1: My question is but each place you have success.  And why is that?
Speaker 2: There is such a thing as a regionalism in the business.  I mean, I can think of specific artists and specific records that maybe happened or a style or a genre of music that's a little more popular here than in this place.  But at the end of the day, once you, you learn that playing hit music everywhere works.  Be there is a sense of style and showmanship that is important in presentation in radio and I guess I started to develop that.  And more importantly than anything, because--and this goes back to my initial job, I always believed in hiring--trying to attract people.  Remember as program director, it's my job to hire the disc jockeys and the news people.  So I was always kind of forced to hire people who were better than I was and who knew and had more experience than I was.  And I just became dogged about hiring the best and most talented people.  And when you can do that without constrictions, you can put together a very powerful career which is kind-of what happened to me.  I've worked with some of the best.  And I'm very proud of some of the people that I've worked with,  most of whom have gone on to be extremely successful.

Speaker 1: Well I mean I don't know how much relevance they [people Barry Mayo has worked with in his career] would have to a lot of, you know, your audience.  They're--most of them are disc jockeys who--you know, one guy in particular in my recent time, a guy named Tony Gray who was my program director in New York is America's foremost programming consultant.  You know, I'm proud of that. A guy named Steve Harris who was my music director at WGCI [Chicago, Illinois radio station] is now vice president of programming at ABC [American Broadcasting Company] Radio Networks.  Most of my jocks have gone on to become jocks in bigger markets, making more money.  I'm just like--the kick for me, by the time I was in the business ten years, the kick for me became helping to promote other people.  I mean I think you can't grow unless other people can grow who are associated with you.  And after you make a certain amount of money where you really get--well at least me, where I get great pleasure is saying--seeing somebody do it.  You know, do in an associated arena and go, "I work with that person,"  you know.  I love that.
Story_ID: 10558
Speaker 1: It was a serious paradigm shift for me to go from program director of a radio station which I was at [98.7] Kiss FM [WKRS-FM] in New York to become general manager.  I--that was not part of my career path.  It was not part of my goals.  It was not something I had planned on doing.  In fact, it was not something that I wanted to do.  I got talked into it by my former boss, Lee Simonson who got promoted to the sister station.  The WGN-like [Chicago, Illinois radio station] station in New York called WOR.  And he recommended to them that I become a successor.  Which is unusual in the radio business because generally people from the sales side, the general sales manager normally is the next person in line.  If it's someone at a radio station is going to be promoted, it would be them.  And he recommended against that principal and said, "Barry Mayo can do this.  He can learn sales pretty quickly I think.  But he's got the personality," whatever else.  You know, he thought I could do this.  And it was difficult for me, managing talent.  And I was never, I think great at it.  And the reason I wasn't great at it is because I never was one.  I was a disc jockey on the air in my--.
Speaker 2: (Phone ringing)
Speaker 1: (Off-camera comment)
Speaker 2: It was difficult for me to manage talent.  Primarily because I was never a good one.  I was never really a disc jockey.  I never--I was on the air, but I was always on the air as an on-the-air program director because the station only had a budget--didn't have a budget for off the air PD's [program directors].  These days the program directors rarely are on the air.  But back then, in the 70s [1970s] and the early 80s [1980s] you also had to do an air show.  And I never really honed my skills at it because I started at middle-level management.  So I sucked on the air.  I was horrible.  And it's interesting to have a horrible disc jockey on the air in a market as big as New York City.  But I did a Sunday morning show.  And I only got over because I could play what I wanted to play (laughs).  Because I was the boss, you know.  So, I don't think I ever understood the head, the psyche of a talent because I couldn't draw back on those experiences.  And I think if you spoke to most of the talent, although I recruited great talent, and they went on to do well and I'm proud of that, they probably told you I wasn't a wonderful boss. Intolerant.  I couldn't be very empathetic because I didn't know.  And I did not work my way up through radio through that, that path.
Story_ID: 10559
Speaker 1: Your experience here in--I mean Chicago [Illinois] the first time with WGCI [radio station]--,
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --what, what was that whole--how did--how was that whole experience?
Speaker 2: That was great.  That was great, to have another city.  I was here for two and a half years. So I was here long enough to have--it was probably the--it was the first job that I had that was that long.  So to have a city embrace me, in many ways was, was great and the beginning of some of the most long lasting relationships in the business that I've had.  I mentioned that I went out to see Sting the other night, with a guy who I met here in '78 [1978], you know, he is still one of my best buddies.  You know, that was great. I learned a great lesson.  I had, I had a interesting relationship with a guy who hired me.  He had been a former programmer too and we kind of clashed heads a little bit and it was his first job.  He's one of the earliest black programmers who became a general manager and we kind of did like this (hits fists together) a little bit.  But he was the guy who taught me in essence, "When in Rome do as the Romans do."  We, we--this was during the time of disco and New York [New York] had this fabulously successful disco radio station called WKTU.  And, everybody in the country was trying to do that thing.  You know, trying to replicate its success.  And--but Chicago was not to become a disco town.  And he didn't want it to be a black station, he wanted it to be a disco station.  And he'd come from WBMX which was a very popular--the first popular FM black music station.  And so we finally figured out--he figured out that, that wasn't gonna work.  And he sent me out to like the bars and the joints and the record stores and said, "You really need to get a feel for where black people are coming from in Chicago."  And it's when I came to understand how much the average black Chicagoan had, of a certain age had a base in blues and in jazz.  And we actually went from disco to black and it was great.  I, I really cut my--I think I became of age as a programmer here in Chicago.  Wonderful city for music. Deep music background.  People--black people here know more about music than most cities I've been into, certainly more musically sophisticated than New York. I'm sorry, but I mean (laughs), you know they, they know more about and are more open-minded about music. You know, just a bit of history.  Before the--I'm not sure what year it was.  It was a little before I got here but at a certain time, people grew up--black people grew up in Chicago--there were no--there were only black day timers.  I think [W]VON.  I'm not sure what year they went twenty-four hours.  But at sundown most of the black stations would go off the air.  So, if you are of a certain age and you grew up in this town, you had to listen to WLS or WCFL at night if you wanted to listen to music because there were no black radio stations.  So, I found a wonderful openness to pop music.  And I would go out and they would do the--hear the steppin' thing.  I would hear these white records, these rock records or these, you know, pop records.  I said, "Well how do they know that?"  You know, but I loved it because of you know, my music background, I loved all the music.  I found that wonderfully refreshing.  It's the only city I've ever worked in twenty-four years where, people just hear music.  If it's good--it can be oldies, it could be James Brown, it can be [Dave] Loggins and [Jim] Messina.  It doesn't matter.  It's great music.  And it really had a deep effect on me.  And help again shape my--the, the breadth of music that can be played if put together well.

Speaker 1: You leave Chicago [Illinois] and you go to New York [New York].  You have this--I mean you're working with Kiss [98.7 WKRS-FM, radio station].  Was there any lesson you took from Chicago to--you know and you're--,
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --back in New York your hometown for--.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And the big lesson was--is that I'm not in Chicago any more and I very rapidly got into the New York dance music scene.  I mean, I found myself hanging out in gay clubs because that's where disco in clubs was for the first four years of my existence in New York was the predominant influence on New York radio, dance music.  They played very few, historically, very few ballads, very few slow records.  And the music always came out first in the gay clubs.  So, I found myself in different atmospheres and hanging out in different places with another set of friends, so that I could be cutting edge.  I did not try to replicate anything about the Chicago experience in New York.  That's why Chicago was such a--and I'll thank Earnest James, you know, even though we did like this a lot (hits fists together), he really taught me that, in essence, when in Rome, do as the Romans do.  And I knew enough about New York having grown up there that none of that was going to work.  Although I did do different things that were not happening in New York.  And, that was very successful for me.  I took some risks.
Story_ID: 10561
Speaker 1: Our [New York radio station WRKS, 98.7 KISS-FM] primary competitor was WBLS. And my idol worked there, Frankie Crocker.  A guy who I grew up listening to as a kid.  And I was scared to death when I first got back to New York because I was going up against Frankie Crocker [disc jockey], my idol, you know.  And there was a disc jockey on the radio station I was going to--a guy by the name of Chuck Leonard, who had been on the old top 40 radio station WABC.  And you have to understand, when I was in the sixth grade and I remember making a radio.  I would sit--I'd be under the covers in my bedroom, 'cause I'm supposed to be asleep, listening to WABC in New York, listening to Chuck Leonard.  And now it's 1981, and I'm going to be the assistant program director--but over all the DJs [disc jockeys] and Chuck Leonard's on the air.  I said--well and I said--Anglo-Saxon expletive, "I'm Chuck Leonard's boss" (laughs).  And I was driving from Chicago [Illinois] in my little Datsun [now Nissan], down the [New] Jersey Turnpike scared to death.  I mean, "What can I say to Chuck Leonard?" (laughs).  But we introduced--although we had a dance music sensibility, I didn't understand why they weren't playing some big R&B [rhythm and blues] records.  'Cause Frankie Crocker played almost no ballads, and he wasn't playing all this great R&B music that was out.  Not just in Chicago, but everywhere else.  So one advantage I had--and I have to thank Frankie and--you know, we have a good relationship now, 'cause I've kidded him for years about I never would have been successful if he hadn't messed up, you know.  But when records like 'Silly' by Denise Williams and 'We're in This Love Together' by Al Jarreau came out, they were like just natural great songs to me and I put them on the radio.  And he would go like two weeks without playing it--three weeks, 'cause it's like, we don't play that kind of record.  It wasn't a club record, it wasn't a disco record.  And I knew these records would be hit records even for New Yorkers.  And that was one of the fundamental different things that we did, playing R&B music and some ballads.  And it helped us.  By the time his station and the other station--which was a pure disco station--started reacting, it was too late, and we had established ourselves as 98.7 KISS-FM--great variety music station.
Story_ID: 10562
Speaker 1: The experience between 1988 and 1995 (pause)--I think a mixed blessing (laughs).  Definitely mixed.  You have to understand that I had an early goal, back from college, of owning a radio station.  And I wanted to do that.  But it was never in my plans to become a general manager of a radio station.  I thought it was a corny job.  I thought it--there was no semblance of fun to me.  It took you away from the thing that I was most passionate about, which was the music.  And frankly, I couldn't understand why anybody would want to be one.  And when Lee Simonson, my soon to be partner, but my boss as the program director at KISS[-FM, WRKS, New York radio station] told me he was leaving,  I figured that I was going to leave shortly afterwards.  I had already reached my goal, which was to become number one in my hometown, New York City [New York].  I had done that a couple of times.  And Lee and I had gotten very close, and I figured leaving it up to RKO General [media company] to bring in some dope that I wouldn't want to get along with.  So I'm just thinking about going out on my own and becoming a programming consultant around the country.  And Lee said, "I got--." I remember he took me to lunch one day. He says, " I got some great news for you."  He said, I mean, he said, "I'm excited."  And I said, "Why?"  He says, "Well I'm leaving--."  I had heard rumors.  I said, "Well, that's kind of sad."  He says, "But the good news is that you're gonna replace me."  A long story short, I became a general manager.  He talked me into it.  And he was incredulous that I would say, "Well, I'm not sure I want to do this."  He says, "You're black!"  You know, he's a Jewish guy.  He says, "You're black! And you're the youngest--you'll be the youngest general manager in the biggest market!  What do you mean you got to think about it?"  And I said, "I don't know!  I don't want to do this!" You know.  But the long and the short of it is I did gain some serious business experience.  He said, "What are your goals?"  I said, "You know I want to own a radio station."  He says, "Let me tell you something.  If you run this radio station for a number of years and just don't mess it up--you've already got a reputation at the time of being the top black programmer in America.  You combine that with this--."  He says, "Any bank will loan you money and you will be able to buy a radio station."  And the long and the short of it was as usual, he was right.  Four years later we decided to go get some venture capital money, and we bought a small company.  And the plan was this--he would--I would oversee the programming, he would oversee the sales and, and you know, administration, and that's how we would run it together.  This is--the year is 1988. There were three of us, and our corporate structure could only handle, with only five radio stations, two of us being pure corporate.  So I volunteered to come back to Chicago [Illinois], 'cause I love  Chicago.  And it was the competitor to my old radio station.  So I knew a little bit about it.  So I was going to wear two hats.  I was going to run our new station in Chicago, which was WBMX.  We ultimately changed it to the station now known as V103 [WVAZ, Chicago, Illinois radio station], the first successful adult black--black adult contemporary radio station in America.  But I was only going to run it, set it up--run it for about a year, eighteen months, and then we'd buy more stations, and I would join them as pure corporate and just oversee the programming for the whole company.  Well, the recession started about sixty seconds after we bought the company, you know, right on the next quarter and it took us four years to buy another radio station.  So now for four years I'm--and it ended up being seven years.  The whole time we had the company, I ended up having to oversee that radio station.  And then we bought another radio station from Mr. Johnson, John [H.] Johnson [publisher] that became a hip-hop station, 106 Jams [WEJM].  So the last two and a half years I'm overseeing two stations and responsible for the programming, overseeing the programming for the rest of the company, which at the end was twelve stations.  And I was burnt out.  I never became a great general manager, 'cause I really didn't want to do it.  And at the end, I was feeling very frustrated because I wasn't being a great general manager to the people at the station, 'cause I was always on the phone, or gone traveling.  And I wasn't giving the support mechanism that I was supposed to to the other program directors in my job as head program person in the company.  And for someone who is as focused, for someone whose ego is as large as mine is, to be unsuccessful at everything is--it's hard to explain what that's like.  It really sucks.  So you know, we went public.  We did an initial public offering.  We went public in 1993. 'Cause we started in '88, in 1993 we went public. We went around the world and raised $35 million and became a public company.  But that was the exit strategy for our investors and they sold the company two years later.  Lee wasn't happy about that.  Bill Pearson, our other partner who was our chief financial officer wasn't happy about that.  I was thrilled.  I was so happy.  Because I was done.  You know what I mean?  I wasn't--I had almost completely got away from my love, which was the music.  And like I said, I wasn't being successful in either side.  And I made a few dollars and got my independence back.  So--but we had a wildly successful company, and my reputation which was good, I think grew.  Because now I was no longer Barry Mayo, programmer or Barry Mayo, general manager.  Now I was Barry Mayo, president of a public company.  And you know, I was still kind-of young.  And so, you know, you have a reputation amongst disc jockeys and a reputation on Wall Street [New York City financial district].  And that's not a bad thing.
Story_ID: 10563
Speaker 1: What were the lessons you learned during that whole period [owning his own radio station] about yourself and about, you know, what, what you valued in life? Or--?
Speaker 2: Balance.  I learned balance.  It cost me my first marriage.  I was fortunate that I got divorced when I did, because my kids were still young enough at nine, seven and two, at the time, for me to still establish a great relationship with them.  Which now they are seventeen, fifteen and ten.  And you know we're like this (gestures).  But I have to be frank and say I didn't really start becoming committed to being a good father--I mean I wasn't not there, but I wasn't engaged with them until I left my house.  So I learned--I had to learn to balance business and a family life.  I had to learn after I left--this all combined with the business thing--how to love, you know, as a man.  I mean there are a lot of little business lessons, but when I think about the macro picture,  it's not about any of the business things that I learned.  I learned and I grew up.  I mean, I think that experience helped teach me how to become a man.  And you know, it's a bitch to not do that until you're over forty (laughs).  But I did grow up.  It was great from that standpoint.
Speaker 1: That's an interesting thing to come out of a business experience.
Speaker 2: Well it's, you know--it's hard to separate the business and your personal life.  I mean, it's all kind of entwined.  But I clearly was focusing on the business, and being selfish, and thinking about me, me, me.  And you know , I--I just thank God that he grew me up.  Because there are a lot of people that never get that.  And that's sad.
Story_ID: 10564
Speaker 1: But the transition from [W]BMX to V103 [WVAZ, Chicago, Illinois radio station].  I remember being here--I mean as a listener. And I was thinking it was so fantastic.  And then you know and turning the dial.  And I still am a very avid you know, V103.  But they've a little bit.  You know--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, but how did you do that?
Speaker 2: We--I think I mentioned earlier that  one of the big things I learned in New York [New York] was I was--it was the first time I was really introduced to the research, radio research.  And, of course, I embraced it with reckless abandon.  And we--things became less instinctive and more programmed.  And that's kind of happened in radio too.  And--you can as a radio listener person, anybody watching this probably knows that radio's become more structured and more niche oriented, and more--and much to its detriment, and much to its detriment--editorial comment mine.  But we used a research company to find out where the hole was in black music listening here in Chicago.  And through some sophisticated music analysis, we saw that there was--you had one huge radio station here.  WGCI [Chicago radio station] my old station which was like number one with every age category from teenagers up to fifty-four and fifty-five years old.  And you know, research and common sense says you really can't serve both of those masters well.  They had done it primarily because WBMX, the station we were buying, had been largely unfocused and uncompetitive.  So we went and asked a bunch of questions, did surveys and found out that while people over the age of about twenty-eight or thirty listened to WGCI every day, and that was their favorite station, they couldn't honestly say that musically they were--it served all their musical needs.  So we created a music platform that spoke to the black adult.  And then we tried to juxtapose information and provide an atmosphere that made it comfortable for, and attractive to the black adult consumer.  And it was the genesis of a new format, which is one of the top two black formats in America now.
Speaker 1: So you're saying that that came about because of research?  You know 'cause--research, research and--.
Speaker 2: I mean, you know, look.  The best research without execution is worth nothing.  So I'm being frank.  I mean I've gotten credit in the radio industry for being the father of this format, for developing this format.  But--I'm not a particularly humble guy, but I'm a lot more humble now than I was years ago, and I'm not going to sit here and lie to you, and I'm telling you exactly how it happened.  Now I--between myself, a guy named Tony Kidd and again some great people, we put together a hell of a radio station.  We could have blown it.  Just 'cause the research said, that there's a hole to superserve black adult consumers doesn't mean we had to do it right.  So, I'm saying that research--all it can tell you is that this group of people are not as happy as they could be, okay.  What you do about that is something completely different.  So we went and--I mean, you know, the whole 'Expo for Today's Black Woman.'  I mean, that came a couple of years later.  The, the 'World's Largest Steppers [dance style] Contest'--it, it came as an outgrowth.  These were smart things, I think, that spoke to the black adult audience.  We didn't have to do that.  We could have blown it.  We could have just put all--all the records on the air, and would have probably done okay, but it wouldn't have created an experience that has people feel an affinity to the radio station, you know.  Have people affiliated with the radio station going, "That's my station.  Why? Because they do this, 'cause they do this.  'Cause I can get financial news from--Wardell and Reed in the morning."  You know.  And there are things on that station now--I was talking to Tony Kidd, who was the first program director who's working now as the station manager.  That's another one.  Again, this guy--here's, here's a guy who had worked for thirteen years in country radio, who happened to be a black guy, who I found through the research company--they recommended, you know, 'cause I was looking for, who is gonna be my first program director for this station in 1988?  And I found this guy Tony Kidd.  He had never worked in a black radio station one day in his life with the exception in Motown [music genre]--didn't even know the music.  I used to say to him, "Are you sure you're black?"  But it didn't matter to me that he didn't know the music--A, I did, and B, he was like a smart guy who knew how to win.  I mean if you can get a thirteen share [measurement or listernership] of listeners in Rochester, New York with a country format, there's something special about you (laughs).  So I want you to come with me.  I was talking to him the other day.  He's now a station manager in Miami [Florida] and is over all--oversees all the urban stations in Cox Radio [Inc.], you know.  Now, no one had heard of this guy in the black music genre in '88 [1988].  Another thing I'm proud of.  I'm off the subject.  But I was talking to him the other day, and he reminded me.  He said, "Barry you know we turned that station on eleven years ago."  It was eleven years ago, but there are still elements at V103 today that are on there, that have been there since almost day one.  So, those type of things you take for granted if you're a listener, but they're comfortable for you.  They're comfortable elements that are there.  Some of the faces--a lot of the faces have changed, but they're comfortable elements.  And that's really the magic of putting together a great radio station.  It's not just a place to go to hear music or listen to news, but you find yourself affiliating with it.  You don't even really necessarily know why.  It's not a conscious decision.
Story_ID: 10565
Speaker 1: There's a genius that you have.  You're--even though you are--you say that you are not a humble person.  I'm just saying how does--you know, is it like a general in battle?  I mean how does that--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) That's a nickname that somebody calls me.  He calls me 'General.'  It's a guy in San Diego [California].
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm just saying there has to be a whole strategy.  There has to be a method, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, the strategic planning--you used the key buzzword that is big with me.  And again, you know, there's research over here and I mentioned that to you, but then there's that instinctive thing.  There's, there's, there's research over here, and  I mentioned that before.  And then there's that instinctive thing.  I think that if I have a knack for something, it's knowing, being able to see--it's almost like radio chess and seeing like a couple of moves down the line, or having a sense of what people will like, or what they won't like.  And then, how to take a concept or an idea and make it real to the average person.  And, you know, you see a lot of things over the years, and you say, "Okay that works.  This doesn't work."  And somehow it's not difficult for me to synthesize all this stuff.  So I'll see a situation and instinctively know not--I'm not always right--but I know, like I say, more often than not, it needs like this.  It needs a little of this.  Which is why--what I've been doing for the last four years as a consultant--I think by best role now is as a consultant.  I can help people think through their challenges.  A lot of it is based on experience, and some of it's still based on instinct.
Story_ID: 10566
Speaker 1: You've been involved in the, in the record industry for over twenty years.
Speaker 2: Peripherally.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean radio.
Speaker 2: Okay
Speaker 1: I'm sorry radio.  Radio, radio industry.
Speaker 2: Okay, twenty-four years.
Speaker 1: Twenty-four years.  What are your views about that industry and its future?
Speaker 2: Well, (pause) it's almost not an industry any more.  It's a company or two (laughs).  The business changed when [U.S.] Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and effectively deregulated the radio industry.  I mean that really was about phone companies and cable, but radio is relatively a small business compared to like the whole telephone business and the whole cable industry, but to us it's a big business.  And  it--that, that act effectively started a process called consolidation and deregulated the industry.  And the short versions it said, "One owner can own up to eight radio stations in one marketplace."  Now what's happened in the last almost four years since that act has passed is that the big companies have eaten up the small companies, and our company getting bought was at the very beginning, you know, of what was to come a sea change in the business.  It's now December 1999 and a couple of months ago, the largest merger in the industry was announced between Clear Channel Communications and AMFM [Inc.].  AMFM is an outgrowth of the company we sold our stations to.  You have two monoliths, two behemoths, two giants who both own about 400 something radio stations and are now merging.  So you have essentially one company that dominates, and it's affecting--it's changed everything.  As usual, Barry Mayo's got a dichotomy, you know, whether it's  black/white,  the music guy, the business guy.  I have two points of view about it.  Frankly, as a businessman, putting my Wall Street hat on, it's the best thing that could have ever happened.  Wall Street [New York City financial district] back in the late '80s [1980s] discovered radio as an undervalued asset, and its values, the price of radio stations have been going up, up and up. And public companies are--radio companies are now public, and they're worth billions of dollars.  And by owning eight stations, AMFM in this town owns about six or seven stations--for instance they owned all the black stations.  They own WGCI-AM, WGCI-FM; WVAZ, my old station; WNUA; [WBBM-96.3] The Beat.  And so there are issues with pricing.  They--I mean, can help effect pricing.  The competition is them.  That's great for business.  The program director in Barry Mayo hates it.  Because--I mean the fundamentals of business in America are--is about competition.  You put out a good product.  Anybody has got the ability and the right to come and put out a better product, and that's natural competition.  And what competition historically has done in this country is make products better, okay.  I remember when there was a big deal a couple of years ago at AT&T or Sprint [telecommunications companies] says 25 cents a minute (chuckle).  You know what I mean.  And somebody came up and said, "Naw, naw, naw 15 cents a minute."  And then "10 cents a minute."  And I just signed up for seven cents a minute.  And now already I hear somebody has got five cents a minute.  Why?  Because of competition.  And in the end, the concept is that the consumers, us guys, should do better.  Because competition.  Well, competition has almost been close to eliminated, and in some sectors has been eliminated.  There's certainly no competition--true competition amongst urban or black radio stations in this market place.  Although the stations compete against each other, all the money goes to one place.  And I can't believe that long term you can have a diversity, of thought, and ideals and principles when that happens.  So yeah.  There are different music formats.  WGCI plays one kind of music and [W]VAZ plays another kind and The Beat plays another kind.  But this whole conglomerate concept, owning one station, particularly when it's public, is not conducive to new creative ideas.  There's no incentive.  As a matter of fact, there's a disincentive for one of those program directors to wake up one morning and say, "I got an idea for a hot new format."  They can't afford to do that, you know.  So the artist, the right side of my brain in me says, "This is not good."  The left-hand side of my brain, the logical businessperson goes, "Wow!  Margins fifty, sixty cents on a dollar.  This is great" (laughs).

Speaker 1: What about African Americans and the--and the radio industry.  What do you think the future holds for--in terms of management or you know, you know viewpoint, or in terms of--.
Speaker 2: The question of African Americans in the industry and moving forward is a very timely question.  The biggest issue--again we're speaking here in early December 1999--those two huge companies Clear Channel [Communications] and AMFM [Inc.] merging together.  There are overlaps in a number of those markets, and they've got to sell or spin off about 100 to 125 of those radio stations, a lot of them in very sexy markets--great markets.  You know, not just small markets, good markets.  And people in the industry kind of realize this is probably the last big auction, the last big opportunity for someone to get involved who's either not involved, or somebody who's already involved to get in it in a bigger way in these markets.  'Cause after that, the industry will essentially be controlled by two companies, certainly in the biggest markets.  One of the things this company is doing to try to help get this deal through the government, through the DOJ, the [U.S.] Department of Justice, is they're supposedly selling--they're selling a certain percentage of these stations to minority-owned broadcasters.  And we are, right now as we speak, in the midst of finding out when--who's going to get what, and how much.  The playing field will pretty much be outlined for black ownership after that.  We've got one public company, Radio 1, some friends of mine from--some folks I've known--who've known me since college.  As a matter of fact, the--the woman Cathy Hughes was an adviser at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] at the time.  So it's a good feeling to see them be the first public company.  But I think they'll be maybe one or two more public companies that come out of it.  Certainly the industry is pretty much closed to anybody African American, or female, or any so-called minority from jumping in in a big way.  But then again, that would apply to somebody white also.  I mean, the business has basically consolidated.  In the next five years, it's not the kind of business you want to say, "I think I want to own radio stations" and jump in there.  It's done.  And that does not necessarily portend well for African American ownership or the--or listeners.  And what we can hope is that the few black-owned broadcasters are able to pay their debt service, make money, and still find a way to be committed to the black community.

Speaker 1: My partners and I, like the O'Jays [music group], 'I Love Music,' I love all the music.  A couple of years before we sold our company in 1995, about a year and a half, we bought a station from John [H.] Johnson [publisher] and turned it into Chicago's [Illinois] first FM hip-hop radio station. And I was very involved in putting that station together.  So there was an article in the ['Chicago] Reader' [newspaper] with me--you know, I had on my blue navy, you know my jeans and my hat turned on backwards.  And that's a part of Barry Mayo too.  When rap music first started getting played on the radio back in the '80s [1980s] or early '80s [1980s], late '70s [1970s], Kurtis Blow and Grandmaster Flash, and all that, I was there.  I was a programmer and a jock [disc jockey] on the air.  So I have come up with the growth of hip-hop.  And between loving the music, most forty-seven-year-olds aren't into it any more.  I grew up in it and I've got a seventeen-year-old who's in it.  So I've never gotten divorced from it.  I love that music.
Story_ID: 10569
Speaker 1: What do you think of the evolution of rap music?  And why do you think it, you know, has had such staying power?
Speaker 2: It--well first of all because it's the only real--.
Speaker 1: Can you go by rap--start by rap music just in case.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Rap music is one of the few--I'm really not into some of the heavy metal and hard rock music.  Not 'cause I don't like it, 'cause I don't know it.  But I know for most mainstream music, of which hip-hop is,  it, it is the only real music that speaks to young America.  And it seems to cross racial lines because a lot of white kids in the suburbs, you know.  I mean it's changing, but they're sagging their pants and got their hats turned on backwards too.  It's 'teenage music' as Russell Simmons [record executive, Def Jam Records] once called it.  It's music that speaks to teenagers, young people, in a language that they understand.  And I guess that's good.
Story_ID: 10570
Speaker 1: I'm forty-seven years old and I love hip-hop music because I grew up in it.  I grew up in it professionally.  I grew up in it on the radio.  I've watched the evolution of it from, you know, records like Kurtis Blow [rap artist], 'These are the Breaks,' and Grandmaster Flash and [The] Furious Five [rap group] and hung out with some of those folks in New York City [New York] when rap first started getting played on the radio.  So I've watched the evolution of it.  I've watched it get harder.  I've watched the East Coast/West Coast thing [regional rap artist rivalry].  The--and I still love the music as passionately as I did then, personally.  As a parent of young kids--now, I've got a ten year old who idolizes his brother who's seventeen. And, you know, it's rough seeing your ten year old subjected to "M-F this," "M-F that," "M-F this," "M-F that," but that's just what it is, you know.  And it's real. That's real.  But I think--you know, my kids are raised with--raised as Jehovah's Witnesses and it's funny watching--you hope that your religious or spiritual training is solid enough to give them a strong moral compass and point of view to balance some of the other stuff because my kids never have and never will live the lives that some of these artists are singing about.  They love the music, but, you know, I wonder sometimes about, you know, what they're really hearing (laughs), you know, and are they really understanding it.  I live in a decent neighborhood now but I can remember an earlier time in my life--my kids never grew up in the Bronx [New York, New York] or in Harlem [New York, New York].  So, I can put rap music in context.  I wonder sometimes if some of the younger kids can.
Story_ID: 10571
Speaker 1: Do you think that as a music form it [hip-hop/rap music] will have staying power?  You had compared it earlier to jazz.  And I just, you know--.
Speaker 2: Well I think there's no question about the staying power of hip-hop.  I mean, people were calling it a fad since '79 [1979] and it's now '99 [1999].  So, I mean I guess there's a such thing as a twenty-year fad.  But that sounds like a conflict in terms to me.  That's as oxymoronish as it gets.  I can't say how long hip-hop music will last, but I think it is a legitimate genre of music.  I would suggest that while it may change, it's here forever probably.  My likening hip-hop music to jazz, basically the context that I mentioned that was in that both of them are some of the only American true music forms--original music forms.  And it's another conversation to talk about what jazz and hip-hop have in common, because it's a lot.
Speaker 1: Tell me.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, improvisation.  I mean some of the best rap artists don't write down--they don't write songs.  I mean they, they flow, you know.  What they call their freestyle, you know.  And they're just speaking from how they feel.  And how different in that--how different is that from a Miles Davis [jazz musician] solo?  I mean if you ever see any artist, true jazz artist do a solo I mean they never play the same solo twice. They're improvising, they're flowing.  They freestyle, you know.  It's great.
Story_ID: 10572
Speaker 1: What about rap artists as role models?  I mean they--you know, they're out here, they're making lots of money, they--I mean what--in a, in a community that is desperately in need of role models.
Speaker 2: I don't think most rap--I can't answer the question about rap artists as role models.  I have not been close to any artists in many years.  I would doubt that they would see themselves or would want to see themselves necessarily that way.  I think at the end of the day, fathers need to be the best role model for kids, and mothers. I think at the end of the day fathers and mothers need to be the best role models for kids.

Speaker 1: What impact it [the Internet] will have on the music industry completely and on radio.
Speaker 2: For a techie like me, the Internet is one of the most exciting things that's happening.  It's free.  And, and not just in terms of access to it, but it's free mentally, emotionally, politically.  And for someone who grew up in the '60s [1960s], I mean that's very appealing to me.  I like--the impact that it's having already on the record industry is that record companies are struggling on one hand on how to figure out--they, they realize that it's a delivery system that they're going to have to deal with and people are going to be getting their music there.  I think they're trying to figure out technically how to keep this royalty thing in line so artists don't get screwed.  But I look at it again as competition.  It's going to force--it's going to force record companies to become efficient.  I think it's going to have a deleterious effect on some people's jobs, because frankly you're not going to need as many people with technology in the record industry.  A lot of promotion people I think that's not--it's going to be unnecessary to have a lot of positions, but the same thing is happening in radio for that matter.  I mean, you've got one guy who can talk to ninety-five different radio stations and it works as in the case of Tom Joyner [disc jockey] nationally.  So the future of the record industry will always be vibrant.  What the Internet is, is just another delivery system to get the music to the people. Being involved in syndication, radio syndication right now--I think there will always be a place for local radio, you know, there will always be a place for local radio.  Radio stations' challenge is to find a way to economically use some things that are available on the Internet and syndication-wise and still make that station personal.  I think they're failing to some degree right now--radio stations are, because the, the ownership of radio trying to make as much money as possible has loaded up on commercials.  Radio is more commercialized than ever before.  And I think it's going to be very difficult for them in a year or two or three and this gets back to this whole issue of one company owning all the radio stations.  I think it's going to be able to--it's going to be difficult to keep the focus, the time spent listening amongst listeners with its proliferation of commercials.  The Internet provides a great, a great alternative to radio.  You can go on the Internet and hear any music genre or any radio station.  Not only can you hear all the radio stations in other cities, but you can go to a place like spinner.com and, and pick your music and then just listen to twenty-four hour commercial free music.  So, I can't predict what's going to happen, but as this whole issue of broadband, getting high speed access to the Internet--.  (Phone ringing) (Pause) You rolling?
Speaker 1: Um hmm.
Speaker 2: This issue of broadband which is getting high speed lines to access the Internet, and things from the Internet in the average person's home through cable companies or telephone companies, the combination of that and as it relates to African Americans, African Americans getting more computers and getting access to the Internet.  At a certain point down the line, I think the Internet's gonna become a real challenge for traditional radio.  And radio as a business is going to have to make a choice between the dollar and the listener's mind.

Speaker 1: What would you like--and you're still very young, but what would you want to be your legacy?  And what do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: That's the kind of question--the, the question about my legacy, what I want to be remembered for, is a question at forty-seven I don't really want to be thinking about because I think about dead people (laughs) you know?
Speaker 1: But you--.
Speaker 2: I'm way too young to be thinking about legacies.  Take it easy, twenty seconds (laughs).  Time out (makes sports time out signal with arms).
Speaker 1: (Laughs)  But I'm just saying, okay.
Speaker 2: No, I'll tell you.  In radio I, I'd like to think that I found a way to juxtapose business and art.  It's been a few years since I've been able to do that and I don't know that, that can happen again because of the proliferation of, of the change in radio ownership.  Ownership--radio essentially being an investor-driven business now as opposed to a broadcaster-driven business.  I mean, the business has changed.  It's run and owned by money people.  And, that's taken a lot of the art, for me fun, out of it.  But I was there for the highlight of my life. The heyday of finding a way to put together musically compelling radio stations and then still be very profitable and make a lot of money.  That will be my radio legacy.
Story_ID: 10575
Speaker 1: I mentioned earlier that two years ago in the process of--two and a half years ago, almost three years ago in the process of getting my college degree I'd by happenstance discovered photography.  And it, it is one of the most passionate and exciting things to me now because I've rediscovered my right brain.  It's like jazz.  Photography is a creative outlet for me in the darkroom where I can be just as creative as I was twenty years ago in radio.  A lot of people ask me, "What do you like to shoot?" and I like to shoot everything.  But I'm kind of committed and I think I'd like my legacy to be the study of race in America through the lens of a camera.  It is--the, the black/white dichotomy is the singular thread that has run through my life since integrating in that school at age eight in the third grade.  And while there have been times in my life where I've probably tried to ignore it, I'm way past that point.  And I'm extremely race conscious.  Not racist, but race conscious.  And living in America, although on the facade it seems that things have gotten better.  It's hard not to be conscious of that.  And I really would like to explore that through the lens of a camera.  And I've already started.  But I'm nowhere near as good as I hopefully will get.  And I frankly look forward to the day and hopefully by my fiftieth birthday I'll be there.  Where I'm just totally 100 percent focused on photography.
Speaker 2: That's your next career?
Speaker 1: I don't think of it as a career.
Speaker 2: Passion.
Speaker 1: Passion.  Yes, passion.  Because I never have done anything for money.  I mean it's my philosophy--well not since Holiday Magic [Cosmetics] but I was like twenty then.  It's my feeling that if you provide a good product, a good service or a good thing, money will follow you.  I don't think that money is something that can be chased. I mean you can do it.  I mean but ultimately money is the end result of a good service or good product that you provide.  So when I think of career, I think about making money and all that kind of stuff.  And I'm not going into photography for that.  Although I don't doubt that I make money from it.  But it won't be because I said, "Let's see how many photographs could I sell at how much price to make this amount of money this year?"  I think--and it may be ten or fifteen--hopefully it's before I'm dead, because a lot of photographers don't become famous 'til after they die.  I do not want to be in that group.  (laughs)  But, but, but I've been fortunate that I've made some money so I don't have to really be focused on you know, paying bills and stuff like that.  But I really would like to discover race--explore race through the lens of a camera.
Speaker 2: Do you have any thoughts about what that exploration part would lead?
Speaker 1: Only preliminary thoughts.  I only have preliminary thoughts about, about that.  I know that my exploration will include children.  It's very clear to me at this age having raised, or being in the process of raising three kids that in this country, kids are born without any preconceived notions about the issue of race, or a lot of things.  And it's interesting to me to watch how they develop in--along those lines.  I mean let's face it, it's not natural.  No white kid could have automatically learned to say "nigger."  I mean, where would you hear that?  Of course the same applies to any black kid too.  So, there's a time period and it varies depending on how you were raised and where you were raised.  But there's a time period between where you go from this innocent person to start to take on the values of, fill in the blanks, your surroundings, your aunts, your uncles, your mother, your father, sisters and brothers.  And watching that change is something that's very interesting to me.  And in an early photography class--because I've continued to go to school, even now take photography classes because again it's like the research and the instinct.  I'm trying to become a technically good photographer.  Once you learn a craft and you become good technically I think you have to do that first, before you can really maximize your instincts, your--you know.  I mean, if you're thinking about like what f-stop and what aperture you know if you're gonna think about that, you're gonna miss some stuff you know.  So-- but I want to be--I want the technical part of photography to become a second nature to me so I can truly explore some of these things.  But--so kids into that light bulb time coming on and then adults.  Then there are some adults and they're in interracial marriages who at least on the surface seem to have been able to overcome some of those differences that this country has, you know the mores and the folkways of this country, you know have put upon them.  And I think that's interesting to explore too and I'll probably be exploring interracial--I've already started that, interracial relationships.  And there's just a plethora of directions you can take.  And I 'de be lying if I told you I had it concrete in my mind but there's a path that I'm kind of going down.
Story_ID: 10576
Speaker 1: Is there someone who was a leader who influenced you and why are you--?
Speaker 2: Growing up at that time that I did, you know, even in radio if you're looking at demographics--for instance if you were putting on an oldies station they say the time period between when someone is in the like fourteen to sixteen years old is when the average person starts to grow into like their music desires and all that.  So if I was gonna--I don't know how old you are or how old any of you folks are.  But if I was gonna put a station on for you I'd go back--an oldies radio station, I'd go back and find out what years you were when you were fourteen, fifteen, sixteen age because that's when most of us go back and we can say, "Well I remember what I was doing then."  You know what I mean?  About that time period.  And it's a very sponge-like.  It's a very amorphous.  It's, it's a time period where we're really starting to grow into ourselves. Well, I grew up in that age and time and just before that in the Civil Rights Era. Vietnam [War]--and I lost my train of thought.  What's the question again?
Speaker 1: I was asking you what--what--is there someone who influenced you?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Okay.  So I grew up at a time when [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] made his impact, 1968 was a big year for me as a teenager.  [The assassinations of Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], [U.S. Senator Robert] Bobby Kennedy, that whole mindset. I grew up for the bulk of my life going in and out of being an integrationist because that was the message that Dr. King had at the time. So I'd say Martin Luther King had the greatest effect of any singular black leader on my life.  There have been others that I've met that have had some impact.  I mean having dinner with [Nation of Islam Minister] Louis Farrakhan was interesting.  Taking my kids to his home to have dinner with him was even more interesting.
Story_ID: 10577
Speaker 1: I think I want to ask--answer a question that I was asked earlier about advice for people.  But, I don't feel like I'm in a position to give anybody other than my children advise.  So, I'm going to rephrase a question I was asked and ask it of myself.  And that is what advice would I give to my children?  And the two things are to find God wherever he or she is, whatever his or her name is because my kids are raised Jehovah's Witnesses.  I'm Baptist.  But find some spiritual--something that can get your feet firmly planted in the ground so that you understand that you do not control this deal which was a major life's lesson for me.  You start having success after success after success and your head gets big and you actually start reading your own press notices and think it's you.  When in fact that's not true.  At least I don't believe that's true, today.  And the second thing is to the degree that you can, as early as you can try to figure out who you are.  I mean what it is that you want to do, which is a tough thing to ask somebody to try to do, but again it goes back to that--I love 'Think and Grow Rich.'  Not about making money, but about learning about persistence and how that fits in life.  Faith and where that fits in life. So to get focused find out what it is you want and then be dogged about trying to get it.  Hopefully it will be a legal endeavor.
Story_ID: 10578
Speaker 1: Your experience you said with [Nation of Islam Minister Louis] Farrakhan that was an interesting experience.  What was interesting about that, to be in his presence?
Speaker 2: He's the is--Minister Farrakhan is the single most powerful speaker I've personally come across.  I mean he's a rappin' somebody. And when I got up close and personal, one of the people who work for me--work with me and when we had the broadcasting partners experience we owned a radio station in Charlotte, North Carolina and my program director, it's a guy named Michael Saunders married [singer] Stephanie Mills.  And the minister married them in a small church in North Carolina and it was a small ceremony.  There were not a lot of people there and I was the only person Michael invited from the company.  And you know, Farrakhan blew my mind.  He had them kneeling on the ground.  It's hard not to get emotional about this because he had them facing each other and they spoke to him.  And he told him what his role as a man, as a father was, as a man in the, in the marriage.  And he spoke to Stephanie and he told her what her job was.  You know, what her role in the relationship was.  You know, I was sitting there in the back thinking about just having been divorced a year or two before that.  And I'm thinking, I, I didn't get this right (laughs), you know what I mean?  And it was a very emotional experience.  But the way he put it was so deep to me, it made like an impact.  And then, you know we had the reception.  And he had just met me and he took out a card and he wrote his name and two or three phone numbers.  I mean like all his phone numbers.  Like, "Any time you need me just, just to talk or anything, just call me."  And you know one of my laments is that I never did just to rap.  Although he clearly--he's such a powerful speaker that he's intimidating almost.  You know what I mean?  It's like, " I can't call him.  What am I going to talk about?" (Laughs)  Although I want to because he draws you in like that.  And we're not talking about--I'm not talking about his feelings and his opinions on specific things.  He is a powerful presence.  You know what I mean?  I don't even agree with him with everything where he's coming from.  But he's a powerful person.  So I'm not talking about ideology here.  I'm speaking about the man.  But there is a calmness about him that was very attractive to me too.  Something that I don't specialize in.  That's that calmness thing, you know. Then, I guess I saw him again after this East Coast/West Coast thing, the [regional rivalry between] rappers.  And he called a bunch of people from the radio industry to his home--radio and records to see how he could help get in the middle of this-- East Coast, you know Tupac [Shakur] and Biggie [Smalls , aka Notorious B.I.G., aka Christopher Wallace] are both dead now and can we do something about this.  And I don't know what ever came of that project.  But he's just a riveting speaker.  And he gets behind your eyeballs and scratches around there a little bit. At least that's the effect he has on me.  If I had any, if I had any point of view--there was a question that I was asked earlier, that I wasn't prepared to answer.  But I'll say this.  If his politics were a little different--I'm not going to get into the reality or the perception about him and his relationships with, you know, Jewish people.  But there's no question in my mind that he could be and would probably be the closest thing to a mass-accepted black leader in this, in this country.  Minister Farrakhan, I think so.
Story_ID: 10579
Speaker 1: I've achieved everything that I've wanted to achieve in the radio industry, for sure.  In life I'm just a pup.  I mean, I mentioned earlier that I didn't grow into manhood until I was over forty, and I'm only forty-seven now.  So I'm just a kid, you know?  Learning how to be a better father, is something that I still work on daily.  I may have mentioned that I've just been remarried seven months and you know trying to synthesize the mistakes of my early life and hoping that I don't repeat them.  And hopefully starting a new family and doing this all over again with my old behind is something I look forward to.  I can't think of radio--other than radio, I can't think of anything that I've actually said I've gotten to a point of saying, "Well, I've done that."  You know.  It's the fundamental thing that has me so excited about living to become old.  I mean really old.  I mean, think about it.  I'm passionate about photography right now.  How many people get a chance at age forty-five or forty-seven--I mean how many people get an opportunity to be truly passionate at the middle of their lives?  That's assuming--as you can see I plan on living until at least ninety (laughs).  How many people get a chance to be as passionate about something in the middle of their lives as they were about something else twenty years before?  And that's exciting to me.  But I haven't achieved anything in that, in that right.
