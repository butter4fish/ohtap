Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe, I'm interviewer for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My name is Alvin L. Spearman.  Alvin, A-L-V-I-N, L for Lewis and Spearman, S-P-E-A-R-M-A-N.
Speaker 1: And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: August 26, 1926.  I was born in Chicago, Illinois, at the [Cook] County Hospital.
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Right now I'm a courier, I'm a courier for IDEXX Laboratories, and they deal with animals.
Speaker 1: And you have been?
Speaker 2: Working for them.
Speaker 1: No, you have been in the past?
Speaker 2: And in the past I've done a number of things.  I was--once I got out the [U.S.] Army I went back to school, and once I got out of school, which was [Woodrow] Wilson Junior College [now Kennedy-King College], I started playing professional baseball.  I started with the--in the beginning with--professionally, with Chicago American Giants in 1949 and I went to spring training with them, but in 1948, I had been playing with a team in Washington Park, an industrial league that they gave a number of us tryouts with the Cubs in 1948, so they selected me as a person that was good enough to go in their farm system, that was in 1948.  Nineteen forty-nine [1949] they were slow calling me.  At the same time the Kansas City Monarchs and Chicago American Giants was trying to get me to go to spring training with them.
Speaker 1: I don't want to cut you off but I was just trying to establish that you played baseball, you're a baseball--
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: --You played baseball.  That was the main point.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: But we'll get into all the details--
Speaker 2: Okay, sure.
Speaker 1: --As we go along.  But what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: This is--this is January 15--
Speaker 1: Sixteenth, yeah.
Speaker 2: January 16, I'm sorry, January 16, 2003.  And I have been working for IDEXX Laboratories since, I guess it was about the summer of 2001 as a courier.
Speaker 1: How do you spell IDEXX?
Speaker 2: I-D-E-X-X.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's IDEXX Laboratories in Elmhurst, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Now, where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: I don't understand what you're saying, where at the present?
Speaker 1: Where are we right now at the present time?  This is for the benefit of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry.  Right now I'm with The HistoryMakers at 1900 South Michigan in Chicago, Illinois.
Story_ID: 76285
Speaker 1: Now before we get into depth, there are five People Magazine-ish type questions that we are compelled to ask you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They are simple questions and they just require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Five of them.  And the first one is, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food I would suppose I have a number of 'em, but if I took--if you talking about favorite, I would have to say probably chicken, if that's the type of answer you're looking for.  Because I would say a number of things, I'd say chicken, fish, you know, which are my favorite.  I used to like pork, but I don't go there anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I believe my favorite color, two, but basically I would say black and blue.  Those are--
Speaker 1: That makes sense.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: --Yes, summertime.  I like warm weather.  When I was young I did and now I'm older, I like warm weather.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Makes my blood circulate better.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I would say basically now would be Nassau.  Before probably was Mexico.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My favorite phrase would be "If I knew better, I'd do better."  That's the way I feel.
Speaker 1: Who can argue with that?
Story_ID: 76286
Speaker 1: Now I wanted to ask you about your--what you know about the origin of your family. How far can you trace your family back and do you know much about what they were doing in the nineteenth century or what they were doing during the period before the Civil War or after the Civil War?
Speaker 2: I would only be able to tell you what has been handed down to me.  My people from what I've been told came from a plantation in Arkansas.  And probably the name was Kiblah, Arkansas.  It's about--
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: K-I-B-L-A-H, Kiblah, Arkansas.  It's about four miles west of the Louisiana border and right there--runs right there close to Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas.  Texarkana [Texas] is about thirty miles from there, about thirty miles west.  That's Texarkana but that's the big city and it's a fascinating place.  I started going to Arkansas, I think, possibly about 1959, but this is where my people came from and I was--my mother and father came from there to Chicago [Illinois] and I was born and raised in Chicago.  And other than playing baseball or going in the [U.S.] Army, I spent practically most of my time in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your grandparents or your parents or did you hear from any other family members or any stories about your ancestors on the plantation in Arkansas or what they were doing or any stories about that period of time?
Speaker 2: I've heard some stories, but a lot of things, I think, is intensely been kept from me.  I think my opinion is a lot of things, and this is just my opinion, a lot of things that has happened to my people have been so negative that they didn't want to admit or pass that down. So a lot of things has intensely been kept from me.  I'm finding out now we don't have as some people, the Spearmans, don't have a, anymore, a family reunion that I know about.  There is one that my people go to called a Stuckey (ph.) reunion they have every year.  My mother's people were Stuckeys, but as far as the Spearmans, the Spearmans used to have a family reunion in Kiblah, but I think it's so many of the older people, and I say older people, that mean older than me, have died and not capable of traveling too much to go to family reunions.  I know I'm not into family reunions myself anymore because I think it's for the younger people.  It's more expensive.  The younger people I notice go to places--I'm going to a function in Kansas City [Missouri] next--on the seventh, a legacy thing in Kansas City for Negro League baseball players, and the place they, I think the hotel, the rooms were eighty-nine bucks a night.  And of course I'm gonna have to pay my own way and transportation, which I don't mind doing, I can do it.  But it's no way in the world I'm gonna pay eighty-nine bucks for a room there when I can--I'm gonna drive and I can find a motel much cheaper.  And I'm only saying that to say for those that can pay that kind of money, fine.  And a lot of younger people today are making more money than the older people.  And if they want to pay that kind of money, fine.  It was one time I could and did pay that kind of money but not anymore.
Speaker 1: You say you understand that the people in those days really didn't want to pass on negative things to their offspring?
Speaker 2: That's my opinion, yes, that's my opinion.  Because I feel that you know you teach your children and you teach people the truth.  And I believe that so much untruth was not told to me and a lot of people.  You know, I think you know a lie is something that you know not to be the truth.  You can tell something is not the truth, but you don't know it to be a lie.  But so many people, and I get so angry because I've been lied to so much it's unbelievable, you know.  And I'm saying this is where I think so many people that I've been involved with have just been lied to.  I've got a chance to know some outstanding people, some outstanding people, and I don't know whether these people realize how outstanding they were, but they were lied to.  I was lied to.  It's so many things that I was told, it's unbelievable.
Speaker 1: Do you think it would have been better to tell the truth about all these things in the first place?
Speaker 2: You know they got a saying that I like to say. "The truth will set you free, unless you tell it at the wrong time."  And I'm saying that to say it's a lot of obstacles that you could eliminate if you knew the truth.  And a lot of people intensely have misled me and I believe others.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This makes me very angry.
Story_ID: 76287
Speaker 1: Now let me ask you about your--did you know your grandparents at all?
Speaker 2: I got a chance to meet a grandmother that died, I went to her funeral.  And I got to chance to meet my whole--yes I got a chance to meet my grandfather.  And I got a chance to meet him in 1949.  I was with the Kansas City Monarchs Baseball Team, and they sent me from here [Chicago, Illinois] to Washington, D.C.  He was in Washington, D.C.  The team was gonna play the Baltimore Elite Giants in 1949 and the owner of Kansas City Monarchs, they needed an outfielder.  And I believe my name was passed along to them by, I'm pretty sure, the once great Hilton Smith, who was a pitcher with the stature of Satchel Paige, that us playing baseball in Minnesota with him.  And I'm pretty sure it must have been him, because time I left Minnesota coming to Chicago [Illinois], the phone rang and here was Tom Beard on the line asking me if I would go to Baltimore [Maryland] to play in Willie Brown's spot in outfield so I said sure I'd go, you know, but in the process, Baltimore didn't have an airport.  So they flew me to Washington, D.C. and I caught a train to Baltimore.  But in Washington, D.C., my mother [Connie Summage] told me that her father [Cornelius Smith] was there.  So I called him up and I got a chance to meet him, and I was so impressed.  I was unbelievably impressed.  This man was born in 1875, 1875 and I must have--when I called him on the phone, I must have described myself and I saw this tall man run up to me, thin you know, run up to me and hug me, you know what I mean.  I didn't know him, you know what I mean.  I didn't know what to look for.  But when I got to thinking about, I was so impressed cause this was 1949 and he had to be--been born in 1875, he had to be well, 25 and 50, be close to 75 years old, and ran up to me.  I was so impressed and this was in 1949.  In 1949 I was 23 years old.  And you know how young people think about old people, they think you know--and when I get to thinking about now it just blows my mind that this man was so agile in 1949, ran up and hugged me, you know, when I think about it now, it just blows my mind.  And so a lot of people today, they think when you get a little age, you're supposed to sit back and retire.  And I said no way, I expect to work the rest of my life, have no intention of retiring.  Sometimes I think about going back to school or going in a different direction, you know.
Story_ID: 76288
Speaker 1: But I'm just saying that--and my mother's going strong now.  My mother, next month will be--she's twenty years older than me, next month, she'll be ninety-seven.  And I have to take her and get her driver's license.  She drives every day.  Each year I have to take her to go qualify for her driver's license.
Speaker 2: Does she live in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Yes, uh-huh.  And so before--her birthday is the eighth, yeah the eighth.
Speaker 2: This is a good time to talk about her.  Can you give us her full name and her birthdate?
Speaker 1: Yes.  My mother's full name is Connie Summage, S-U-M-M-A-G-E.  She was born in Kiblah, Arkansas, February 8, 1906.
Speaker 2: Okay, is Summage her---
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  My stepfather's name is Summage.  My father's name is Spearman.  So my father died in the early '80s (1980s), and my mother married my stepfather.  His name is Summage.  So that's what her name is.
Speaker 2: Her maiden name though was what?
Speaker 1: Her maiden name was Smith.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was a Smith.  Because that's her--her father that I met in Washington, D.C., that was his name, Cornelius Smith.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, how do you spell her first name?
Speaker 1: Her name?
Speaker 2: Her first name?
Speaker 1: C-O-N-N-I-E.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And she was born in Arkansas?
Speaker 1: Kiblah, Arkansas, yes.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Kiblah, Arkansas.  Alright, well tell us about what kind of person was she, what did she like to do?
Speaker 1: Well, my mother, basically goes to church a couple of times a week.  She normally drives.  But for the last couple of Sundays I realized that it's convenient for her for me to drive her and bring her back from church, it's convenient.  But she normally drives herself.  She didn't go yesterday, which she normally goes on Wednesdays because it was basically pretty cold out, and I tried to convince her maybe someone else did that it didn't make sense to go, but she goes--she's very active.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she sounds like a self-reliant person.
Speaker 1: Yes, she's very active and she's kind of feisty too.  Sometimes she gets mad at me and you know and she runs up to me like she's gonna jump on me, you know what I mean.  And I laugh and I said you know you're unbelievable.  But my mother is--she's something else you know.
Speaker 2: Do you know much about her upbringing and how she (unclear) and where she went to school in Arkansas?
Speaker 1: Well, I can only tell you part of what she has told me.  And I don't believe that she's gonna tell me too much, you know.  But she's the baby of the family and it just, from looking at her, I kind of think that she was like babies that gets spoiled in a big family you know.  And she's very determined, I believe then and now you know.  But she's very active and basically she wants to be a good and caring person, that's what she wants to be.  A lot of times I believe she gets information that makes her kind of ornery at times.  But other than that she and I have it like the odd couple, you know.  But she reverts back to the fact that she brought me here and so she's right and I'm wrong.
Story_ID: 76289
Speaker 1: When did she [Connie Summage] come to Chicago [Illinois]?  I mean did she come while she was still young or did she--
Speaker 2: Well, she and my father [Benjamin Franklin Spearman] they married in Kiblah [Arkansas] and settled here in Chicago.
Speaker 1: --Now did they have a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: Well, they had to meet on the plantation.  Now, a lot of people probably won't think of it as a plantation.  But I think of it as a plantation because basically, when they freed the slaves in Kiblah, it was practically all black down there you know.  And so I guess from the stories I've heard about the 40 mules--the 40 acres and the mule, I think that applies to some extent down there.
Speaker 1: Did they have their own property?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  You got property down there.  And a lot of the, well both of my mother and my father were from there.  And so they had property down there and I do also.  But I maybe go there maybe twice a year or now that basically--mostly when I go down there was because of a death and go to a funeral.  And so I've been down there a number of times since my first being down there was 1959.  It was the first time I went to Kiblah, Arkansas.  And the reason I went there because I was playing baseball for Houston.  At the time we were at spring training in Daytona Beach, Florida.  So I, in going to Florida, I stopped through Texarkana [Texas], and with my aunt that's no longer living, now she drove me to Kiblah and I met a lot of family members in Kiblah.  And so it's a real nice place there, it's a real fun place to go because I met a lot of people.  But a lot of those people I met are no longer living now.  And so it's not the same as it used to be.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could imagine.
Speaker 2: And I used to--I used to have a lot of fun times because I basically worked two jobs all the time so I had a nice disposable income where I could get on a plane and go where I wanted to go.
Story_ID: 76290
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father, can you give us his name and spell his name for us and give us his date of birth?
Speaker 2: Well, right now, off the top of my head, I can't give you his date of birth.  I would have to bring in my birth certificate to be able to show you.
Speaker 1: You can approximate would be all right too?
Speaker 2: Well, apparently you see I didn't know that much about my father, but apparently he was a little older than my mother [Connie Summage].  And they both from--I know about his people better than I know about him, because my aunt--
Speaker 1: What was his name and can you spell it?
Speaker 2: --Yes.  His name is Franklin Spearman, F-R-A-N-K-L-I-N.  That was his middle name, his first name was Benjamin, B-E-N-J-A-M-I-N.  That's his name.  Now they have--I saw a book about the Spearman--history of the Spearmans.  And I looked and I saw a lot of Spearmans all over the--history of the Spearmans all over the country.  And someone wrote me some time ago with the updated version.  So it surprised me 'cause a number of these people in there in which I'm not in there myself and a number of people--I look--look at these addresses and some of them are true of today.
Speaker 1: What's the origin of the name Spearman?
Speaker 2: I really have not--
Speaker 1: Or what ethnic group is it associated with, is it German or Jewish?
Speaker 2: --I would not know.  A lot of things have not been handed down to me.  And I believe in my opinion, is because a lot of things some people didn't want to be told.  And a lot of things--I get angry because I think that we should tell our offsprings things that they should know because other people would tell you some things that they think they know.  And we're pretty good at saying what we think, not what we know.  But at the same time all the things that we think we know are things that have been told to us.  So I can only repeat to you what I've been told and whatever I've been told did not have to be the truth.  And so many things I've been told, I've been miseducated.  For example, like Santa Claus, you know.  They told me about Santa Claus, they told me about George Washington cut down the cherry tree and never told a lie.  I'm saying so many things that I've been told that you know when you look at it and people that tell you today, people would tell people about Santa Claus they have to know there's no Santa Claus, but what they're doing is they're handing down what they have been told.  And I've been told so many things, it makes me angry.  When I look at people and they say some things that they know is not the truth, they know it's not the truth.
Speaker 1: Sir, what do you know about your father?  I take it you weren't raised with your father?
Speaker 2: No.  I never knew my father.  My father died before I was--could see him to know him, you see.  So I know very little about my father.  My mother told me very little about my father.  And except when she gets angry with me.  When she gets angry with me she say you just like your father.  But other than that I know very little about my father.
Story_ID: 76291
Speaker 1: And I think that's intentional.  I think that's the scheme of things and it starts way back. It starts way back, in my opinion from slavery.  I think a lot of things have been handed down to me is intentional, a lot of things that are designed to make me just as I am.  For example, I went to school and I, you know, am not ashamed to say that I didn't have too much interest in being a good student.  I went to school because it was the thing to do.  My mother sent me out to go to school.  I look at a lot of--my thing was when I went to school, I had one thing in mind, is to get out of school and get a job.  I was even working while I was in grammar school, you know.  And I think I had no--if I went back to school today it wouldn't be with the interest of learning too much, it'd be with the interest of how I could apply it to making a buck, you know, what it would mean to me.  If I went back to school tomorrow, I think of how I could parlay that into making a buck.  That's my idea about education, what's it gonna do for me.  For example, I wouldn't be interested in going to school to learn to be a brain surgeon, because I don't expect to make any money being a brain surgeon, and so that's the way I think.  Now you've got people that read books all day long, you know and go to seminars.  And I look at that and say well what's that gonna do for me.  I realize that knowledge is power but how you gonna apply it.  You see, I've been working ever since I've been in high school.  And I think work means one thing, like my mother says to me you have to work the game.  So I believe in working, you know.  As far as I'm concerned, sure, I get a pension, I get social security.  But by working I get a paycheck every two weeks.
Story_ID: 76292
Speaker 1: [Low audio] Now you were born in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you really didn't know your father [Benjamin Franklin Spearman], you never got a chance to know him?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You have a brother?
Speaker 2: I had two brothers.  I had two brothers, my younger brother got hit and killed by a car and I was, at the time I was seven years old.  My older brother, Frank, died in 1942 when I was 16, he was 18.  And so that's--course that was during the war [World War II] and I was going to school, doing a number of things [end of low audio].  But I've been in Chicago living all of my life.  I've been some other places.
Speaker 1: Well, can you describe the neighborhood that you lived in in Chicago, tell us the name of it and, yeah, can you do that?
Speaker 2: Sure.  My family, I can first remember, we lived at 49, I think 4943, which was South Park.  I can remember going to Willard [Elementary] School and leaving out the alley and walking straight down 49th Street to Willard School.  I remember going to kindergarten at Willard School, which was 49th and Champlain.  And I graduated from Willard School and went into DuSable [High School].  But at that time we lived practically right around in that area, what you may call 47th and King Drive, that area.  I went through Willard School at 49, probably the address is probably like 4915 Saint Lawrence and then at DuSable, address was probably I think about 4934 Wabash, the address of DuSable.  I went there and I went in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: We don't want to get you too far, just wanted you to describe the neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Oh.  Well, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Just when we go back, just do this, just kind of reflect on--I want you to reflect on some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up, you know, in the Bronzeville area in Chicago and then DuSable?
Speaker 2: Well, at that time was a beautiful time for me because before the war, it was a fun time to be in Chicago for me because of the South Center Department Store, the Regal [Theater], the Metropolitan Theater, the Apollo Theater, the Willard Theater, these are places I went to as a kid, and it was a fun time.  I'd get out of school from grammar school, and we'd play or go into Washington Park.  Washington Park was a beautiful place.  We'd go out there.  Sometime my mother [Connie Summage] would take us and go in the park and play and run and play in the grass.
Story_ID: 76293
Speaker 1: Can you describe Washington Park for us in terms of the size.  'Cause I think that people, anybody who's not from Chicago [Illinois] would think of just a park, a public park.  But Washington Park was a lot of--
Speaker 2: Washington Park was huge and I--from my understanding, it was originally a race track, but this is much before I knew it.  I've heard this afterwards.  It's a huge park and basically, it's from 51st Street to about 60th Street south, and basically Cottage Grove to King Drive.  That's--Cottage Grove is about 800 East and King Drive is about 400 East.  And so it's a huge place that basically, I was in, as a kid growing up. I had went out there to play baseball or going out there to do a number of things I didn't care to--they had a swimming pool out there, I didn't care too much about swimming I never did.  But I became a amateur boxer about in 1939 and used to go out in Washington Park and run around.  They have a bridle path, a track that they used to run horses around and lot of the boxers and fighters would go out there and do what they called road work.  So I started going out in Washington Park about in 1939 a lot as far as becoming an athlete.  But before then I used to go out there more or less for maybe picnics or recreation, going out and watch (unclear).  It was a beautiful time.  In the neighborhood growing up during depression in the '30s (1930s), everybody knew everybody just about in that area.  When I say area, maybe I'm talking about maybe a two-block radius, everybody knew everybody.  And as long as you was in that radius, you felt comfortable.  I never felt too comfortable even though I--we basically lived south of 47th Street.  I never felt too comfortable going north of 47th Street, and I didn't feel too comfortable other than Washington Park going south.  So what I'm saying is we had enough friends and recreation when we played basketball in vacant lots and may play football in the streets.  And when we were playing baseball or softball, we'd go to Washington Park or maybe a vacant lot.  But it was a fun time in Chicago for me and I really enjoyed some of the friends I had weren't too promising, but then I got away from them and so the guys that I really felt comfortable with were athletes, people in baseball or boxing or basketball.  And it was a way of relieving tension because we were poor and really didn't know we were poor.  And so we ate.  My mother would--she'd get off and my mother worked, my mother always worked and--to support us.  And when she got off from work she would come home and cook sometimes you put a pot on the stove and we'd be out playing, I can remember burning up a pot of whatever, you know, cause instead of looking after it we figured you know we out playing and time just fly by you know.  But that was a fun time for me growing up in Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 76294
Speaker 1: What kind of a little kid were you, did you have a sense at that time that you were an athlete?
Speaker 2: Well no.  I--as I was a youngster and you're talking about I guess grammar school.  I only thought in terms--I see my mother [Connie Summage]and I knew she worked hard, I knew she worked hard and we didn't have that much and when I say we didn't have that much, I don't know, we lived in a situation where I'm not too sure locks on the door were necessary you know.  People go in and out of people's house to--apartment to borrow salt or whatever and wouldn't necessarily have to be home, you know, it was just like a big family.  And sometime we would sleep in the park, we'd sleep in--I remember when we was living on South Park there was a little grass place between the street and the--go out there and sleep right out there in the grass.  Take a blanket, it would be so hot.  It didn't have air conditions and a lot of times didn't have fans.  It'd be so hot you couldn't go to sleep in the summertime, it'd be so hot you couldn't go to sleep till early in the morning you know.  But it was a fun time and I really realize at that particular time that life was beautiful.  But I know you don't want to--but the main thing we did was on the weekend went to the movies you know, all day.  All during the week we played, I went to school and looked forward to going to the movies on the weekend.  But it was a fun time for me, I was basically ripping and running and going anyplace.  Didn't have any money except when I would get a job a little later on, and I would get a job working in the store or something like that.  Or working with--you had--I remember I must have been about eight, nine years old, maybe ten years old, you'd have men selling vegetables in the summertime and they would hire us young ones to run up and down the stairs.  A lot of times one of them would say, hey, bring me a pail of apples or whatever, so these men would hire kids like myself and they'd pay us like ten cents on the dollar and so we--and so I made a nice buck and I would take this money and I'd go to the Riverview.  The Riverview Park was a park on the north side, which was Western and I think it's Western and Belmont or either Western, no maybe it was--I forget what street was--Kedzie maybe, Kedzie and Belmont, I don't remember, but it was a beautiful big park.
Speaker 1: An amusement park, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, an amusement park.  And they had what they had a two-cent day.  And I never will forget they had rides like the bobs and you know it was a fun time in the '30s (1930s).  You'd get on the streetcar and ride all the way there.  I don't think at that particular time I was--if they had L I don't think I was catching the L.  They probably had the L but I don't--I think we just rode the streetcar all the way to Riverview Park.  And it was a fun time for me.  Plus the fact I'd go to--they had a store on 47th Street called Jack and Jill's and go up there and buy milkshakes and stuff like that with my money, but it was a fun time you know.  And so I got indoctrinated from an early age about the benefits of working, you know.  So I always made a--even when I was in high school, I made a decent buck.  I made money, I was able--pardon me--I made money, I was able to box, and I started boxing at about thirteen years of age, in fact, I actually fought in the Golden Gloves when I was in grammar school.  And they would give us like five bucks to fight in these clubs you know.  I had to put my age up because you couldn't get a AU license until you're sixteen, pardon me.  So I fought in the golden gloves and put my age up and I could--a little later I was--I could make some money playing baseball.  So I was--after that then I went to--when I got in high school, I started working in the stockyards.  Well the war [World War II] had started then.  Once the war started they had hired anybody--everybody that could work.

Speaker 1: Now, I don't want to take you to high school yet.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I want to take you back a little bit to Willard [Elementary School]--you went to Willard the whole time?
Speaker 2: Willard, yes.
Speaker 1: Now what was that like, I mean, you said earlier you really weren't that concerned about school?
Speaker 2: Well in grammar school when I went to Willard School, I remember it was a time of--that was before the war, before World War II.  And so basically what we did was we went to school and played after school and on the weekends we went to the movie.
Speaker 1: Now what were your favorite subjects in school, did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: My favorite subject was math.  I liked math because it was something that I could relate to because if you--if you--in school if you didn't do what you supposed to do one way of punishing you was to have you do tables, if you know what I'm talking about, tables you know, one to twelve.  And that was one way of punishing a student doing tables or having to write something a hundred times "I shall not" or whatever, but I was fascinated by the tables.  And I did so many tables that mathematics became pretty easy, you know.  I can even--I relate to numbers because I did the tables so many tables, you know, just numbers off the top my head and so that was my favorite subject in school was mathematics.  I was--in high school, I mean in grammar school, I remember that someone said that how difficult decimals were.  And before I went into decimals, I remember, I guess maybe about the sixth grade, someone was saying to me I remember how difficult it was, decimals because I was into fractions, yeah, I was into multiplication tables and went from fractions to decimals.  And it must have been around the sixth grade or something like this and I found out how easy it was--decimals.  So I always liked math you know, and I guess you like anything that you spend a lot of time in.  That's my answer to that, as far as my favorite subjects.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite teacher or any favorite teacher there?
Speaker 2: I didn't--I never had a favorite teacher because I was the type of kid that was sort of a introverted kid.  I sat in the back of the room, I you know, I didn't--I just, I just felt insecure.  I felt type of--I just had a complex, an inferiority complex as a kid.  And I may feel the same way now you know.  When I look at people and I admire people, people that have really achieved greatness in my opinion were people that I feel like didn't have a complex, they were open to learning.  Me, I had a complex, I wasn't opened to learning too much.  I more or less sat back and I watched people and I got an idea of what I thought about people.  A lot of times what I thought about people wasn't right and I didn't find out what was right until I actually met the people and talked to the people.  I had opinions about people that these are preconceived notions and I guess that's the same thing like prejudice you know.  I mean like prejudice you pre-judge people and I guess that's what I did.  I sat back and I pre-judged people, I thought--as a youngster.  I wasn't too open as far as meeting people.  I still don't meet people too well now, you know.  But the people I do associate with I'm very close with and I try to be very open with.  I get frustrated 'cause people don't think the way I think.
Speaker 1: That's understandable.
Story_ID: 76296
Speaker 1: Did you have any heroes in the neighborhood in those days?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Some people that I just thought they were giants you know.  When I was a kid the most visible person to me that I cared about was Joe Louis.  Joe Louis was just like the Empire State Building, you know.  All of us just thought about Joe Louis as--we used to--when he fought, of course there was no televisions and half the time we didn't have a radio.  We'd go down and bunch up and listen to the radio when he fought.  We were so--and then sometime we'd go to--I went to the Regal Theater and he'd be at the Regal Theater, just standing out there you know what I mean, and I just admire that man.  And another fellow was Jessie Owens was out--but he wasn't as visible as Joe Louis was.  Joe Louis was very visible.  Of course there were other people that I wasn't privileged to be around you know.  But Joe Louis was one that to me was just everything.  Also, the Harlem Globetrotters, the Harlem Globetrotters was a group that I just admired tremendously.  But other than that we had some local people that I've found out to be giants, tremendous people later.  But at early age Joe Louis was the thing.
Story_ID: 76297
Speaker 1: Now when you went to high school, you went to DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How old was DuSable when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, DuSable was a school, from what I understood, they had a fire at [Wendell] Phillips [Academy High School].  So they built DuSable, calling DuSable the new Phillips.  And the first graduation class, my understanding from DuSable was probably, pardon me, about 1936.  The senior class from Phillips, from my understanding was the first graduating class from DuSable.  My brother went there in 1938.  I didn't go there until 1941.  But DuSable was a new school, a school that many outstanding people had gone to, including Harold Washington, I guess he probably the most famous person that went to DuSable and come out because he became mayor.  But I know a number of people that came out of DuSable and went on to greatness such as the first [African American] police commissioner, a fellow named Fred Rice that was in school the same time I was and a number of other outstanding people that went to DuSable.  At that particular time, DuSable was the only school I could go to.  Some people went to Englewood [High School], some people went to Tilden [High School], some people went to Hyde Park [High School].  But I think they would have to change their addresses to go to the schools.  Course Tilden was a technical school and my schools DuSable and Willard were all black if no more than you may say 99 and nine tenths percent black, it may have been some others in there but I didn't see them.  So I've been mostly relegated to all black grammar school and the high school.
Speaker 1: Now when you were coming up how many schools in Chicago were all black, I mean high schools?
Speaker 2: Well, all of the schools to my knowledge in between State Street and Cottage Grove and between, well naturally I think Englewood from what I've been told may have been 85 percent white, Englewood was, maybe a few went to Lindblom [High School], maybe a few blacks went to Lindblom.
Speaker 1: Phillips and DuSable were the only all black schools?
Speaker 2: Yeah, those were the only two all-black schools.  There might have been a white in one of the schools.  I knew very little about Phillips.  Most I knew about Phillips was playing football against 'em, but I might have gone there once or twice to see a basketball game, but I didn't venture out the neighborhood too much as an individual.  When I went out the neighborhood it was generally with a team playing baseball or football or with a group in athletics.
Story_ID: 76298
Speaker 1: But I didn't venture out the neighborhood too much other than to go to work.  And I remember working at the post office, I started working the post office during the Christmastime, I think, probably about 1941 or at least 1942.  I can remember at Christmastime working at the post office, they needed some carriers, Christmas temporary carriers to work at the post office on 63rd Street, 63rd Street east of Halsted and I worked there as a carrier in 1942.  And that neighborhood to me was all-white.  So there could have been some black people over there but I didn't come in contact with 'em because--well probably I wasn't over there that much, but it was basically to me an all-white area.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 76299
Speaker 1: So what was DuSable [High School] like for you, you knew a lot of the people already, the students already from the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yes, I basically knew the athletes because I didn't--I wasn't the type of person that mixed too well.  I didn't go to dances, I didn't--wasn't around the girls, I was just around the boys and I didn't--I don't know I just felt--I just didn't feel comfortable around people that I didn't know, and I--that included girls, you know.  I was mostly around the fellows and we played sports and that's basically my--even in high school I didn't associate with the girls in high school.  It wasn't that I didn't like 'em, it was just that I had no need to be around them.  They didn't play sports and I didn't do dances so I just didn't--I wasn't around 'em you know.  So to me they were just like aliens.
Speaker 1: So what did you do, did you play all the sports in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, we were only allowed to play one major sport.  When I first got into high school, the coach wanted me on the track team because I was a pretty good runner.  But at the same time then a friend of mine finagled and got me on the football team.  And my first year in high school the coach wouldn't let me on the football team because I wasn't big enough, and I wasn't able to get on the football team my first year.  The second year I was just barely able to get on there with the--a friend of mine that was a football player he just insisted on me being on the football team.  I really, you know, it's unbelievable when I look back now I really didn't care that much about sports.  It was just something to do, you know.  And I participated in about four different sports, track, boxing, baseball and basketball and football.  But I just wasn't--for some reason sports just wasn't--and it seems odd because I played professional baseball for ten years and you know.  And--but it was something to do.  And the only reason I played professional baseball was the fact that I could make a buck out of it.  But I did whatever, you know, I worked as a salesman, I worked as a laborer, I did whatever to make a buck because I felt sorry for my mother [Connie Summage] to have to go out and work like she did.  And this is what I always--what I thought about, I used to walk, when I was a kid, and we lived on 50th Street, and I used to walk around the block and see the homes and I thought at an early I can, and I'm talking about like maybe seven years old, think about how I could buy my mother a building.  I used to walk around 50th Street and I look--and right now and I live in the area and the way that area has gone down is unbelievable.
Story_ID: 76300
Speaker 1: I heard that there was what they called today a Negro history program at DuSable [High School]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Was that going on when you were there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: That was pre-Margaret Burroughs [HM], right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  That was after--when I was there, she wasn't there.  She came after I was there.  I'm told I think her first year was 1947, I'm not too sure.  But I got to know her afterwards.  But before that we had Negro history class, and I don't remember too much about what I learned in Negro history at that particular time.  And I think the reason for it was because it was during the war [World War II] and I learned enough to pass.  I learned I wasn't a good student, I was a quiet student, you know.  And I think being quiet I learned enough to pass.  I wasn't the type of student that was a studious student, my mind was not really on learning.  It was learn--it was on getting through, it was on getting through school.
Story_ID: 76301
Speaker 1: The war [World War II] started in 1941, we were bombarded in what the Germans and Japanese were doing and quite frankly, I remember the date when Pearl Harbor happened.  I remember very vividly when they announced Pearl Harbor.
Speaker 2: What were you doing that day?
Speaker 1: I was standing on a porch, it was a Sunday, never will forget it.  A friend's house next door and the announcement came that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor.
Speaker 2: Did you hear it on the radio?
Speaker 1: Well, we weren't necessarily listening to the radio, but it came on the radio.  And then when someone says what's Pearl Harbor?  Pearl Harbor was to me at that time like you talking about someplace over in Vietnam, today.  But anyway naturally a war started and once the war started the economy jumped.  These companies start working people around the clock, people started making money, you know.  And so this was the thing that most important than anything else, it started with the defense plants.  My mother [Connie Summage] started working in the defense plants.  And so everybody was working, everybody had money and at the same time, a lot of people that weren't 4-F was being drafted.  In fact I was drafted, I was drafted in War World II.  So the only people that weren't drafted was the so-called 4-Fs or the people with the special consideration.  But it was--it was a fun time.  They start making money and I started making money, I had a little money previous doing things, selling vegetables or whatever, but once the war started then I started working in the stockyards.  And they didn't care how old you were.  All they cared about is you being a physical body that could do what you're told to do.
Story_ID: 76302
Speaker 1: Before we get into that, I want to go back to [DuSable] High School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And talk about your high school sports career, what you did in high school.  I know you played football?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: How did that go?  How did football go and if you did something else?
Speaker 2: Well, I--first of all my first encounter with sports--well see I had started boxing before I got into high school.
Speaker 1: On the last reel you got us to when you were playing football as a sophomore, you were a little bit bigger and they let you make the team?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You started playing football because one of your friends asked you?
Speaker 2: Yes, he insisted and bombarded the coach in letting me on the team.  So I got on the team and at the time I was probably about 180 pounds and right now I'm under 170.
Speaker 1: You were bigger then than you are now?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I was bigger then when I started playing football than I am now because I believe in losing weight.  But at that particular time when I was sixteen and I have a picture to show my size in 1942, I was pretty big--pretty big as a runner, not big as a football player, but as a runner I was kind of considerable, and I could run good.  I could run good because I had started boxing and that's what we did, we went out in Washington Park and we ran every morning and that's where you developed.  So when I got on the football team, I was a pretty good runner.  But the coach would not let me play.  He would not let me play because he had a couple of guys in front of me playing end--playing end, we had--on end.  So one fellow that play the one end, he played sixty minutes, played all the time.  So the only place they could put me was on the right end which had about three guys playing right end, but I was last to be going in the game.  So I got kind of disgusted and I said well, this isn't for me.  And so I was gonna quit the team.  And I think the coach realized this and he told--at the same time a fellow was in the back field, a fellow name Leon Cornelius (ph.) was playing in the position I inherited.  The coach decided to put me in his spot.  So the first game that--the first practice, which was Monday, we practiced and because I was a superior runner to most of the guys on the football team that the first Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, I ran a number of touchdowns in practice so that Friday the coach put me in to start the game, and I have a picture--and started the game against Kelly High School in which I ran a touchdown, and at the same time, I could catch pretty good which a lot of the players on the team could not catch a football.  And I could--because of being an athlete, I could catch pretty good, because you catch with your hands and a lot of football players they try to catch with their chest, and the ball would hit their chest and it would bounce five yards or so away.  But anyway because I was a good runner and could catch then I became what they called a first string player and I was happy about this you know, but other than that, I really did not care for football.  I played football at DuSable '42 (1942), '43 (1943) and '44 (1944), and I don't think all three years that I completed the season, all three years.  But I was a good football player.
Speaker 1: Did you get hurt?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, I got hurt those years, yeah, I got hurt, my ankle, my knee or something.
Speaker 1: I was wondering why you didn't complete the seasons.  So you were injured basically?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was injured.  But at the same time I was on the team, I just didn't--football just wasn't my thing.  And the only reason I was on the team was the fact that I think probably during the war, a lot of the good athletes probably left and got drafted, although you're not supposed to be drafted until you're eighteen, you know.  But I think probably a lot of guys probably quit and got jobs or whatever.  But I don't think we had a too good of a basis for good athletes at DuSable at that particular time.
Story_ID: 76303
Speaker 1: I think Phillips [High School] had a--we [DuSable High School] did have an outstanding basketball team.  We had a fellow they called Sweetwater Clifton was one of the first blacks in the NBA, played with the [Harlem] Globetrotters, a hell of an athlete.
Speaker 2: Can you spell his name for us?  I've heard of him and everything, but just for the record?
Speaker 1: Well, Nathaniel Clifton was his name.  They called him Sweetwater.
Speaker 2: Why did they call him Sweetwater?
Speaker 1: Well, I understand, from what I've been told that he used to drink, now whether this is true or not I don't know, but because we were poor and he couldn't have pop, he just to put sugar in water to drink and they called that sweet water.  So that's what I was told that's the way he got his nickname.  He was a little older than me and a hell of an athlete and he was in that statute that was awesome and outstanding because I have another friend, they played basketball with him on the team and on that team they won the championship at DuSable, a fellow name Rufus Randolph, and I talked with him quite often about Sweetwater and he tell me some things, but I learned that Nathaniel Clifton was a tremendous athlete.  I knew him to be, but he was big.  But there were so many outstanding athletes it's unbelievable.  I can name any number of people that I admire tremendously.
Story_ID: 76304
Speaker 1: What are some of the ones? Now you played against one tremendous football player?
Speaker 2: Yes, Buddy Young.  Willie Head (ph.), Buddy Young and Ranis Thomas, these were--Ranis is still active, I'm pretty sure as an umpire in Washington Park.  They reportedly won the state track championship just the two of 'em.  Of course we had two, was outstanding too, Harold Anderson (ph.) and--that was at DuSable [High School], Harold Anderson.  I talk with him kind of often now and also Herbie Williams (ph.), they did the same thing at DuSable, two tremendous people.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Ranis?
Speaker 2: Ranis?  R-A-N-I-S.
Speaker 1: R-A-N-I-S.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ranis.  And Ranis is still operating.  And I see him in Washington Park every now and then when I go out to eat.  He was umpiring softball games.  Ranis and Buddy Young are two tremendous people tha--I don't think Ranis was there in '43 (1943), that's when Phillips [High School] won the championship.  He may have been there, I'm not too sure.  I know Buddy Young was there, whether Ranis was there or not, I'm not too sure.  But I know Ranis was there in '42 (1942).
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think Buddy Young went on to play at the University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yes, he went--Buddy Young went to the University of Illinois in 1944 and then he went to the [U.S.] Navy to play and he came back and played, I think, probably New York or Baltimore in the National Football League.  But they were two tremendous runners.
Speaker 1: Buddy Young was small too, wasn't he?
Speaker 2: Well, Ranis also, but Buddy Young was muscular.  He was short and muscular like a fire plug.  Ranis was small and thin, a tremendous runner, tremendous runner.  I got a chance to meet him one particular time when he was working in a store around 45th and Saint Lawrence and I was in there with a friend that I was working on a milk truck with, that's my first meeting of Ranis.  But I see him every now and then when I go out in Washington Park, now they have softball games.  But he's no bigger now than he was then.  But he was a--he and Buddy Young, they were a tremendous duo.  But they did have some other people there at DuSable.  They had some outstanding athletes at DuSable, I mean at Phillips.  We had outstanding athletes in basketball.  And those two fellows Herbie Williams and Harold Anderson was outstanding in track, but other than that, course it was later after I left they had outstanding basketball players.  The first guys that went down state, Paxton Lumpkin and Shellie McMillan and [Charles] "Sweet Charlie" Brown [HM], that bunch, that was ten years after I left there they went down state.  But while I was at DuSable [Nathaniel] "Sweetwater" Clifton was--he was the man.  And also they had some outstanding basketball players at DuSable that did not have the name that Sweetwater Clifton had, that really outstanding players, you know, that were not nearly as tall as Sweetwater but also played with him that were tremendous basketball players you know.  And I talked to my friend, Rufus Randolph. Of course Rufus was in the '42 (1942) class and knew a lot of those guys and he start telling me about some of those guys that--it just blows my mind because I didn't--I just knew of these guys.  But it was so many outstanding guys that I got a chance to know of, it's unbelievable.
Story_ID: 76305
Speaker 1: Now football, back to football.  Now you didn't play basketball in high school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You played football.  I can tell from the pictures that we will show later, but you all didn't have much protection out there playing football, did you, no faceguards?
Speaker 2: Well no, we didn't have that.  The only guys had face masks were guys who wore glasses.  They had face masks.  But other than that, we didn't have 'em and I don't think we necessarily needed them, you know, at least I never needed 'em, you know what I mean.  But by the same token, I used to box and didn't have a mouth guard and so, and so--
Speaker 1: To keep your teeth?
Speaker 2: --So a lot of things that we poor people didn't have that others did, you see.  So I guess in our days practically everybody playing football has a faceguard.  But that time that was something you just didn't have.
Speaker 1: But did guys playing ball get their teeth knocked out a lot?
Speaker 2: Oh sure.  The same way in hockey, you know what I mean.  It's a lot of guards now that they didn't have then.  If you go back in baseball early enough they didn't have--the catchers didn't have faceguards if you go back early enough, you know.  So, I'm saying that it's a number of things that when you talk about me playing football, we had some things that--we had what we call kidney pads that goes around the kidneys.  And I realize that when I was playing that was in the way.  So I don't think now--I don't know--I don't think they have 'em now.  They may have 'em, but I don't think they have 'em.  But when we was playing they had 'em wrapped around like a corset and I realized it was in the way and so sometimes I didn't use 'em, and I don't see people use them now, you know.  But that's what they had when I was playing, you know.  So that's the difference, they were in the way.  And so it kept me from running like I could run with the bulkiness around there.  But that's just a big--but I--quite frankly, I've seen only one professional football game and that was the Cleveland Browns and the Chicago Cardinals.  And I went there for one reason because of Jim Brown.  So I care nothing about football, I don't particularly watch it, you know, and I'm just not a football person.  I don't think in terms of football.  I think as far as I'm concerned, it's a game that I really don't like.  I don't like football but I played it and I think I got on the football team basically because I thought girls liked football players.  But other than that I could care less about football, you know.
Story_ID: 76306
Speaker 1: Now what sport did you like, did you really like any of them?
Speaker 2: No.  You know, be honest with you, if I had to live my life over again, and I met a lot of outstanding people because of baseball and boxing, my good friend was Freddie Dawson, a tremendous fighter, a tremendous fighter.  Freddie was a person that--I got to be--I wish I had brought a picture of him when he and my good friend Alvin, you know.  But Freddie was a tremendous fighter, a guy that if you know anything about boxing, a guy that came up in the neighborhood with me you know and a tremendous person.  He fought Ike Williams to a draw and Ike Williams was awesome.  And when you fight a champion to a draw, you know it's something smelly going on.  But the big guy in Chicago [Illinois] at that particular time got to be Johnny Bratton.  Course I knew Johnny and went to school with his brother.  I knew Johnny personally because the gym that I was training in, which was a CYO [Catholic Youth Organization] gym, he later came in there, and I got a chance to know him.  Of course Johnny's a little younger than me.  But this fellow, Freddie Dawson, he and Nathaniel "Sweetwater" Clifton and maybe [Bob] Satterfield, the fighter, were just tremendous people in the neighborhood.  But we had so many people like Nate Bolin (ph.), guys who was awesome.  You know Nate Bolin (ph.) might have been in the class with Joe Louis, you know, that's just how awesome Nate Bolin was.  But we had--
Speaker 1: He didn't make it to the big time?
Speaker 2: --No.  He was what they called a club fighter.  He was--as a club fighter, the type of guy that in the right situation would throw a fight, you know, but he was just that good, you know.  But he was quite older, later.  I don't know whether he's still living now, probably not, but worked for the city much later, awesome, awesome.  It's so many awesome athletes in Chicago, it's unbelievable.  I knew very little about him, you know, but the high profile people like Joe Louis.  Another guy who was--I just think who was the greatest was a fellow name Ted Williams--Ted Strong.  Ted Strong played with the Harlem Globetrotters and the Kansas City Monarchs, just awesome.  A big guy that could run and throw, but drank hisself to death, you know.  That probably had a poor opinion of himself.  And I got to know his family very closely because his brother and I, we played baseball together in the Negro League and in Canada.  And--but this fellow, Ted Strong was just awesome, just awesome.  'Cause when I was a kid, if you were over six foot tall, basically you were clumsy, you know, and I often who as a kid wanted to be a six footer and a 200 pounder.  I thought that that was the ultimate of being a good man and athlete, being a six footer and a 200 pounder.  And most of the tall people were to me were clumsy.  When you saw a guy over six foot tall that could run and throw and jump and stuff, he was awesome, and I saw some people that at that time were awesome.  Ted Strong was one, you know.  A friend that went to DuSable [High School] name Tyree Wilson (ph.) was awesome.  Tyree died, drank hisself to death.  A number of people that at that particular time before the war [World War II] started used to drink wine and just--it was nothing else to do, there was no jobs for those people, you know, and they did not have the tools for going looking for jobs.  There were people that had the tools.  I was one of 'em, you know.  I was a type of person that would go looking for a job, do whatever.  I go on a job and the bosses say, hey, what can you do, I just hump my shoulders, do whatever I'm told to do.  I was a laborer you know.  And so I didn't think in terms of being an athlete.  I didn't think in terms of being anything other than a working person.  And maybe that's my same profile now.  I think in terms of working, I never expect to retire.  I'm gonna do something, that's the way I feel.  If I have to go back to school, I'm gonna do something.
Story_ID: 76307
Speaker 1: But I think so many people--I look at so many people and I see so many fat people, it's unbelievable today.  I see so many overweight people, and to me they seem to be getting bigger.  I go to the health club--
Speaker 2: This is, I think Chicago [Illinois] is like the second fattest city in the United States.
Speaker 1: --Well, that's what they say, but you know, they talk about Chicago, but all cities are the second fattest, are the first fattest.  Everyplace I go, it's ridiculous how people are eating, you know what I mean.  It just doesn't make sense.  I've conditioned myself today, and I think in terms of losing weight.  I may look altogether different than what I used to look you know 'cause maybe I'm old, you know, but I just--I just refuse to get fat, you know what I mean.  I've just conditioned myself a lot of times to eat most, not meat.  But I see people eating a lot of meat and just ballooning.  Sometime I go to Popeye's, you know cause my mother [Connie Summage] like Popeye's Chicken and I go and I see these people working at Popeye's, they this big, cause they probably eating all the time, you know.
Speaker 2: So you believe in being active and trying to keep your weight down?  Sports as such aren't that high on the agenda, but you were good at it?
Speaker 1: Well, I was good at sports for one reason, because I could run, and I could run because when I was young, when I say young, I'm talking about anywhere between eight and twelve, I used to see guys jumping on people in--around my neighborhood.  I see guys, and sometimes two and three guys would jump on a guy and the guy may not fight back or do the best he could but--and I thought, I said, first chance I got, when I learn to get with a group that was trying to become a boxer, I jumped on it.  I jumped on it just like--and I started boxing at thirteen years of age because I saw how some people mistreated other people like two or three guys jumping on one guy.  And this is why I started boxing.  And I never will forget my first year in high school, which at DuSable [High School], a couple of guys were gonna misuse me and got misused right in the lunchroom at DuSable because I had the skills being a boxer, I had the skills that the other person that don't have the skills don't have.  And my belief is people that don't have skills they do what I call bluffing.  And the bluffing is good as long as you're not dealing with somebody have skills.  But when you're bluffing and you with someone that have skills, hey, you're out of luck you know.  And so this is what I believe.  Life is all about learning and developing skills.  And when you're sitting around fat, you aren't developing too many skills as far as doing something you see.  And today it's more so than ever before because a lot of people are working on computers, a lot of people sitting down, you know, and they're not active.  And as far as I'm concerned, if I'm not active, my blood isn't circulating too good you know.  And so to me you have to be active.  And I'm gonna be as active as long as I can.

Speaker 1: We're rolling again.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about baseball.  You didn't play high school baseball but you did play when you were a teenager in other leagues--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Tell me about how that was set up?
Speaker 2: Okay.  We started--a friend, a good friend, he's a reverend now, his name is Morris Gordon.  He and I are the same age with him being about twenty-four days older than me.  And his family had a baseball team.  So his father ran a baseball team and they had equipment.  So my other friend, Othello Strong, which is the same age as me but few months older, his family had been in baseball.  Mr. Strong had been a baseball man in the Negro League and his son Ted Strong had developed into an outstanding baseball.  So both of these guys' families was in baseball.  Now since they were in baseball we would watch them and we started because they had gloves, we started playing catch and got into baseball.  Now when we went into Washington Park then another friend of ours was working for a fellow name Ernest Bush that had Lakeview Dairy.  They had a baseball team.  So here's three guys, friends of mine, that were connected some kind of way with baseball.  So we developed a team and started--once we started out in Washington Park playing then we got involved with a Sunday school league, and the team we got involved with was a church called Monumental--41st and King Drive now, which was South Park then.  So we developed this team and start playing in Washington Park and decided that we really liked it, which we were maybe the only young black team that I knew about or we knew about.  Now we are told that Phillips [High School] had a baseball team.  But we didn't--I didn't come in contact with them 'cause we didn't have a baseball team at DuSable [High School].  They had a baseball team at one time but they disbanded the team for one reason or another in the '30s [1930s] at DuSable.  But the time I went to DuSable they didn't have a baseball team there.  So I played baseball in the industrial league and the Sunday school league, which they called the Sunday school league.  In Industrial League they had teams like Wilson, Armour, Swift, and Lakeview and one other team that I can't remember the name of, called industrial league.  And they had some outstanding people in that league.  Guys that would play in the Negro leagues would come back and play in the industrial leagues.  And I liked playing with--I played with Armor, Wilson and Swift, played with all three teams because I could get a job.  They would give me a job at the stockyards.  And I could walk right in the stockyards and get a job like that because they wanted me on the team.  I was a pretty good athlete.  As a player I was like the jack-of-all-trades and the master of none.  But I was a pretty good athlete because I could run.  I could run and I was pretty strong.  So, I could always get a job and I could throw good when I played football.  I could throw good, I could throw accurate, and as I said I was a pretty good athlete.  I knew a lot of guys.  I got to meet a lot of guys and in my opinion were much better athletes than I was, but I was good enough to compete with these guys you know what I mean.  I'm talking about the guys like Buddy Young and some of those guys I could compete with them.  But they were in my opinion superior to me, in baseball and football, and boxing and everything else.  But this fellow like Freddie Dawson was a much superior boxer, but I could compete with him, and guys like Bob Satterfield.  And I knew so many people that I admired that was tremendous and I feel good because I could compete with these guys, you know guys like Willie Mays that I played against and Hank Aaron, guys that were tremendous people you know and I got a chance to know in baseball, guys like Satchel Paige and people that when I look back and think about the black people that I knew and those I did not know and I look at these people and how awesome these people were and how fortunate I was to be able to be in these people's company, like the guys in  the--that's going in the Hall of Fame.  And I'm saying we have so many people, I really enjoy being able to talk about how great black people have been.  We've had some people in my family that was outstanding black baseball players, people that I never knew, named Spearman that played in the Negro League that I never knew about even today.  People like [Ted] "Double Duty" Radcliffe [HM] that know these people, people that I know that talk about these people that were in my family tree that played.  But I'm saying that to say this, that from slavery on we've had so many outstanding black people that it's a crime that it has not been handed down, the ability that black people have.
Story_ID: 76406
Speaker 1: I got a chance to play with Satchel Paige and talked to him and Satchel--
Speaker 2: What what he like?
Speaker 1: --Satchel Paige was a person, and I played with him a whole year, and got to be, to some extent, friendly with him.  He was the type of person that no doubt was so awesome that he was like a person to himself, you know.  He's a person that when I asked him, I say Satchel, I said when you first played, and he told me I think the Birmingham Black Barons was the first team he played with in 1925, I said when you--when you, you know, now we're teammates, now this is 1953 and Satchel Paige in--
Speaker 2: He was playing over twenty-three years?
Speaker 1: Well, it's no telling how long he's been playing, but I know and the record says he was born in 1906.  But I know [Ted] "Double Duty" Radcliffe [HM] was born in 1902 and Satchel Paige was two years older than Double Duty Radcliffe.  But the record goes that Satchel Paige was 1906 in the record books.  But when I stop and think that I played with him a whole year in 1953 (unclear) from coast to coast and even in Canada, this was 1953.  If he was born in 1900, he was 53 years old and that man pitched in every game that we played except one.  And that one game he didn't pitch in he was angry, and that was in Springfield, Massachusetts.  He was angry because of a guy that he fired, Winfield West (ph.), the manager, sent him back, a fellow name Felix McLaurin.  And Satchel was so angry because he and Felix McLaurin got into it.  So when Felix McLaurin came back to the team, Satchel wouldn't play that day and left the team.  There's only one game that he didn't play the whole year.  This man was able to pitch in every game that we played.  This man was awesome, was awesome.
Speaker 2: He was about fifty-three back then?
Speaker 1: Fifty-three years old that this man--and not only that this man went, now this is 1953, this man went back into the major leagues, and if the record serves me right, pitched three innings in 1965 against the Boston Red Sox and gave up only one hit, in 1965.
Speaker 2: Charlie Finley brought him to the Oakland Raiders, right?
Speaker 1: Well, I don't remember too well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember, Charlie Finley of the Oakland Raiders brought him in.
Speaker 1: --Okay, so this man had to be awesome, had to be awesome.  And when I stop and think, now here's a man that I've been with, talked with, respect me as a fellow player, even though I was a shortstop compared to him you know, this man was tremendous.  But anyway I asked him about how that team was when he went with Birmingham [Black Barons] in 1925, and he told me he was like low man on the totem pole.  The guy he talked about was Smokey Joe Williams, was awesome.  To him Smokey Joe Williams was just like he is to me.
Story_ID: 76407
Speaker 1: Now, was Smokey Joe [Williams] a pitcher?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Smokey Joe Williams was a pitcher.  And I asked [Ted] "Double Duty" Radcliffe [HM], in fact, I'm a call him once I leave here, I asked "Double Duty" Radcliffe about Smokey Joe Williams, and so "Double Duty" Radcliffe said yeah, but he was much older you see.  And I got in my record book when I look I got a lot of stuff that I get because the Negro League Museum and I read about him.  But I mean it's so many awesome--and the way I was told during the time that I was starting playing baseball, the commissioner said if there was any Negros that had that ability they'd be in the Major League, you see.  And this gave the impression there was no Negros with that kind of ability because of what this person had said.  Now, this was said to deceive everybody because Negros did play in the Major Leagues before 1900, but they had a gentleman's agreement to not let anybody that had one or more Negros play against these white teams in the white leagues.  So it was a drought of Negros from 1900 to Jackie Robinson, 1945.  And so many--when I listen to people and talk to people and they will say well Jackie Robinson was good sure, but not the best in the Negro League.  Most people realize this, you see.  So how many people--and I got a chance to play one year with Buck Leonard in Mexico.  And the people I got a chance to know and talk to, how awesome these people were, one fellow named Hilton Smith.  They said Hilton Smith did in six innings, six or seven innings what Satchel Paige did in two or three you know.  But it was so many outstanding black people that--unbelievable and some I've met, you know.  I've met some people that just unbelievably--unbelievably good.  But we only know of a few.  When I say we, I mean most of us know about Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson you see, that's what most of us know.  But they had so many, it's unbelievable and that's in every field.  I don't care whether it's in medicine, I don't care whether it's in music it's in every field how I have been deceived about the greatness of black people.
Story_ID: 76408
Speaker 1: Now can you--kind of walk us through your career in baseball?  You were playing amateur ball in church leagues in high school and in the Industrial League you played--
Speaker 2: In the stockyard teams, yes.
Speaker 1: --In the stockyard teams.  What stockyard team did you play for?
Speaker 2: Wilson, Swift and Armour.
Speaker 1: You played for all three of them?
Speaker 2: I take that back.  I did not play with Armour.  I worked at Armour, but I did not play, I played with Wilson and Swift, and when I say, I worked at all three of 'em.  But I could get a job because I was a baseball player and they would say come on and give me a job.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how did you first start playing professional baseball?
Speaker 2: Okay, I was with a team, Wilson Stockyard Team in 1948, and we won what was the Industrial League championship in 1948.  We, about seven of us got a tryout at Wrigley Field with the [Chicago] Cubs, now this was in 1948.  Now they selected me as one of the group that was--that they wanted to sign to go in their minor league system.  Now in 1948 and before, the Chicago American Giants and the Kansas City Monarchs wanted me to go to spring training or to play with them.  So I decided I didn't know anybody with Kansas City, but I knew some people with the Chicago American Giants.  So I decided to go to spring training with the Chicago American Giants in 1949.  Now the Cubs had not said anything to me since that tryout in 1948, other than the fact that they wanted to sign me.  So when time came to go to spring training, I said the heck with it you know because the Cubs naturally weren't interested in hiring any black players.
Speaker 1: Now do you know when the Cubs did have their first black player, because this was 1948, Jackie Robinson is in the league and I think Larry Doby might be there too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well the first black player the Cubs signed apparently was Ernie Banks [HM] you see, that's the first black player.  However, when I was with Kansas City Monarchs in 1949, and I played with them until the end of the season, also on that team they had Elston Howard, Gene Baker and Curtis Roberts.  At that particular time they left the Kansas City Monarchs in 1949.  Now they had, naturally Jackie Robinson left in '45 [1945], and they had others between Gene Baker and Jackie Robinson, had others left between those two.  But Gene Baker was in the Cubs' organization, I'm pretty sure.  He was in the Cubs' organization.  And which probably was in 1950, but he didn't go to the Cubs until after Ernie Banks.  The Cubs signed Ernie Banks as a first black player in 1953.  Just after that Gene Baker joined Ernie Banks with the Cubs being roommates.  But Gene Baker had been in the Cub organization, I believe, in 1950 because he left--we worked with Kansas City Monarchs in 1949.
Speaker 1: Okay, but at that point they hadn't called you, so you went on--
Speaker 2: So I went to spring training with Chicago American Giants.  I end up the season with Kansas City Monarchs as an outfielder, but I went at the beginning of the season with Chicago American Giants.
Story_ID: 76409
Speaker 1: Well how did you end up in Kansas City [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: What happened was the [Chicago] Cubs called me.  I was in spring training with the [Chicago] American Giants.  The Cubs called me, I left the American Giants, came to Chicago, went to Wrigley Field, they sent me, the Cubs sent me with a team.  They were gonna put me with a team called Janesville, Wisconsin [Janesville Cubs].  The Cubs had the team in Janesville, Wisconsin.  They were gon' put me with this team as the first black integrating that situation, sent us to spring training in someplace, I can't--Carlyle, Illinois, someplace down in Illinois, middle of Illinois, someplace down there.  At the time when the weather in Chicago [Illinois] for spring training was very bad, never did get out on the field, never did get anyplace other than the quarters for the team in southern Illinois.  So I stayed there--we never did issue uniforms or anything, I was just with the team there, which I was the only black on the team.  And--
Speaker 1: What was that like, being the only black in downstate Illinois on this team?
Speaker 2: Well, that was before integration.  And downstate Illinois was something like south of the Mason-Dixon line.  Some related to Southern Illinois like Mississippi.  So it wasn't good.  In fact it was one--two fellows on the team that took a liking to me and went to--we went to the movie one time and when blacks couldn't sit--blacks had to sit in the balcony.  So this--one or two white fellows, they came up in the balcony to sit with me you know being teammates.  But at that particular time you could not--could not mix with whites in the South or southern Illinois.  But anyway I stayed there for about seven or eight days and came back, came back and--
Speaker 1: Just came back on your own?
Speaker 2: I don't remember but I came back, you know, I don't remember what the situation was.  It wasn't an unpleasant situation.  But I never did get on the field with this Janesville team, this Cub team that was the team in the Wisconsin state.  I never got on the field with them.  The weather was so bad it was just, you just couldn't do it.  You couldn't go out for practice or anything else.  But I was just there for maybe about eight days or nine days.  So I come back to Chicago--I come back to Chicago and a friend got me a situation to go up in Minnesota to play baseball.
Story_ID: 76410
Speaker 1: So I end up going in Minnesota playing Minnesota the entire year in a place called Pipestone, Minnesota as a pitcher and outfielder.  So when the season's over--and also they had two guys up there, Hilton Smith and a guy name Earl Ashley (ph.) was playing on one team, I think.  They were playing on a team I think called (unclear), I was playing on a team called Pipestone in Minnesota, southern Minnesota.  And at the end of the year I came back--caught a plane and came back to Chicago [Illinois] like on a Friday night.  That Saturday morning the owner of Kansas City [Monarchs] called me up and asked me if I would go and play with Kansas City as an outfielder.  So I said yeah that's fine.  He told me how much he'd pay me.  So he sent a plane ticket, I flew to Washington, D.C. and then caught a train to meet the team in--Kansas City Monarchs in Baltimore [Maryland].  And on that team they had Gene Baker, Howard--Elston Howard and Curtis [Roberts] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Howard became the catcher for the Yankees, right?
Speaker 1: --Yeah, Elston Howard became the catcher with the [New York] Yankees and Gene Baker became infielder for the [Chicago] Cubs.  And so we went from Baltimore to New York and then back to Kansas City [Missouri].  So we got to Kansas City, Buck O'Neil, the manager said, say son, I hear you're a pitcher?  And "you pitching tomorrow."  I said, not me Buck, I'm going home.  So that was my extent with Kansas City you know.  But getting back to you with Ernie Banks [HM] with the Cubs, Gene Baker had been signed and had played probably, I'm not sure, maybe Des Moines, but I know he played with Los Angeles Angels, which was the Cubs top team at that particular time.
Speaker 2: During the farm system?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  They were in the coast league.  So he played with Los Angeles.  They, I think they--I'm not too sure.  This is foggy, but I know Ernie Banks was the first one that actually played with the Cubs.
Speaker 2: True I got that.  Banks was in the farm system.
Speaker 1: Baker was in the farm system.
Speaker 2: Gene Baker?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But Ernie Banks played with Kansas City in 1950 and 1953.  See Ernie Banks came to Kansas City after I left and I left in '49 (1949).  So he came there, he played '50 (1950), 1950 and 1953 and he went from Kansas City in 1953 to the Cubs.
Story_ID: 76411
Speaker 1: Now why did you leave the Kansas City Monarchs?
Speaker 2: Well I left the Kansas City Monarchs because the season was over and I didn't go back to 'em the next year because I felt more comfortable with the Chicago American Giants 'cause this was home.  I didn't feel comfortable in Kansas City [Missouri] and so that's why I didn't go back to Kansas City.  And I got a letter from them saying that I should have gone back.  I could have brought the letter to show you. I could have gone back with 'em, but I just didn't because at that particular time--you may not believe it, but baseball really wasn't real interested, it wasn't a real interest to me, baseball, then and probably not now.  Sports was just something I did.  It was something that just like now, I'm working now and working now because I'm making a buck.  And this what baseball was all to me about, making a buck, because I didn't like--most of the teams I was with, I didn't stay with, I didn't like.  The last team I played for was Houston [Buffaloes] and the American Association.  They was talking about me going to the major leagues because at one particular time I was a pretty good pitcher with Houston, I was treated so shabbily down there that I quit the team and left.  And I got a letter from Marty Marion saying that I shouldn't have jumped the club but I'm saying that my first year in the South playing with a white team and we--we could not eat in the restaurants, and could not--in fact we in Love Field, we had our own private plane with Houston.  We're in the airport and we had Ray Noble, he was my roommate and another fellow that played with Cleveland a pitcher name Dave Hoskins and another fellow.  They wouldn't feed us in the airport at Love Field you know, and not only that you know we couldn't go in the restaurants, we couldn't go in the hotels, we stayed separate and I didn't--it didn't bother me really, and it didn't bother--the first game I pitched for Houston, we played and beat Minneapolis [Minnesota] and they had won the Little World Championship the year before.  The first year, Rube Walker was the manager--the first year I played Rube Walker put me out there to pitch against this team and we were lucky enough to win four to one and we--they got five hits off of me and I became almost a instant star down there because my first game pitch, I gave up five hits and we beat Minneapolis.  Then the next game I pitched was against St. Paul [Saints], and St. Paul was a Dodger team, and I was lucky enough to get out of that giving up six hits, and we won one to nothing.  Now the first two games I pitched eighteen innings, I give up one run and here these people in the box seats were treating me the same way they treated Jackie Robinson, all kind of insults and this and that, talking about me like they talked about Jackie Robinson a no dark leg doby (ph.) or you name it.  And so Rube Walker, the manager, came to me he said, hey Al, he said don't worry about what's being said to you, as long as you pitch for me you got a job.  But these people in the box seats, they treated me just like they treated Jackie Robinson in which I have always been--I didn't care that much about baseball, it's just the fact that I could--I was a pretty good athlete.  But I didn't like it, didn't really accept it, you know.  Me, I--it's just something that I--I've been the type of a introverted person that if you don't like me, I don't be around you.  I make it my business not to be around you.  If I can determine that you don't like me, I make it my business not to be around you, I'll walk around you.  But anyway it was an unpleasant situation in Houston for me.
Speaker 1: Referring to Houston, what was their name?
Speaker 2: They were called the Houston Buffs [Buffaloes].  They had been in the Texas League, but that particular year, in 1959, they joined the American Association, one of ten teams.  And see the Cardinals used to be--Houston used to be a Cardinal organization.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was in the Cardinal organization briefly.  And when they were going in the American Association, the [St. Louis] Cardinals had two teams, they had Omaha [Cardinals] and they had Houston in the same American Association.  See you couldn't have two teams in--so they sold, they got rid of the Cubs, I mean, they got rid of Houston and they got in a working agreement with the Cubs, Houston did.  But anyway I was like on loan from the Cardinals.
Story_ID: 76315
Speaker 1: So, we were talking about your baseball career and you said you came back and you were playing with the Chicago American Giants--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Back with the Giants.
Speaker 2: I came back with the American Giants in 1950, and [Ted] "Double Duty" [HM] Radcliffe was the manager.  So we went down south and we came back to Chicago [Illinois] and so Double Duty Radcliffe fired me.  And so I said it was no big deal, you know why he did it, I asked him later why he they fired me.  And, but it was no big deal because I was going back to this team in Minnesota that was paying me more money than Chicago American Giants was paying you see.  So  after and later when he, Double Duty, and I got to be you know pretty close and I asked him why he fired me, he said well my good buddy, Othello Strong, told him I was going to play ball in Minnesota.  So he said that's why he fired me you know.  But it didn't matter because actually I did go, you see because I was making more money and it was much easier playing in the Negro League, playing up there, see.  And but then the next year then I went back to the American Giants, another guy was managing the team, a guy name Winfield Welch.  And then I left and went up to Canada.  Another friend of mine had gotten me a better paying job up in Canada and so that's what it's all about, you know what I mean.  When you make more money, I mean, it wasn't like you having a contract and having to honor a contract.
Speaker 1: You didn't really have a contract?
Speaker 2: No, it was no contract.  It's just like--it's just like, if my job now, if someone offered me twice as much money chances are, if I thought, I would leave.
Story_ID: 76316
Speaker 1: Now, now, wait a minute.  This is raises an interesting situation now in some ways you know the Major League contracts in those days were really iron-clad.  If you signed with a team chances are if they didn't want to trade you, you couldn't get out of the contract, right, if you played for a major baseball team?  But the Negro leagues in contrast you were pretty much free?
Speaker 2: They had no contracts.
Speaker 1: So you're almost freer as a player though you didn't make as much money.
Speaker 2: Well, you were just like an independent. Baseball players were like independents.  You'd go over there--Satchel Paige played with whoever.  And not only Satchel Paige, all the other players, they played with whoever was gon' pay them more money.
Speaker 1: Now was that situation so into the situation today, say the Yankees have a huge salary, they buy all the players they really want and stock their team, but the Negro League teams, meaning the most successful teams, the teams that could pay the most money?
Speaker 2: What you're saying the difference between Negro League teams and Major League teams now.  See they have a contract that they back up with a gentleman's agreement, you see.  In other words your contract don't mean anything unless somebody is gonna honor it.  Let me explain it this way, what the Major Leagues have now is an organization in which everybody's honoring their contract, you see.  You can have a contract if nobody honors it, it doesn't mean anything.  And I'm trying to explain it in such a way that in baseball now, they have it in such a way, it's a global thing, they can, for example, they can stop you.  Once I quit Houston, I wanted to go to Mexico, someone's gon offer me some money playing Mexico, they could block it because of a gentleman's agreement.  So big business have gentleman's agreement even though contracts are in Major League baseball, you didn't have the contracts in Negro League baseball, you see.  But what they had in Major League baseball was a gentleman's agreement.  There was no contract to keep blacks out of Major League baseball, but there was a gentleman's agreement that none would come in.  So even though that you have a contract, if you have a contract, somebody has to be able to enforce it.
Story_ID: 76317
Speaker 1: Okay.  But my other question is this.  Were the teams in the Negro League that were the most successful in terms of winning games, were they the teams that had the most money to pay--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --players what they want?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You see because that's who the teams--that's who the players would go to is who could make the most money.  A lot of--during that particular time, during the war, just after the war, you had guys jumping the Major Leagues going to Mexico to play or going to Canada to play you see.  So a contract don't stop you from doing anything.  I had a contract with Houston and quit Houston, you see.  But they, with the gentleman's agreement, could stop me from playing anyplace else, (unclear) honor their contract.  I could--so a contract is only good if somebody's gonna honor it.  If nobody's honoring it what good is it, you know.  The best you can do with a contract is take somebody to court and then somebody's gotta honor it.  But when I quit Houston in 1959, I had a contract with them, but me quitting the team, which they could say, okay well we got a contract with him, don't let him play, you see.  But at a particular time--they had contracts when, oh, I can't think of these players, they quit the [St. Louis] Cardinals.  I think they quit the Cardinals.
Speaker 1: Curt Flood?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no, not--before them, before him.  He didn't quit, he just didn't honor the contract.  You see, he didn't honor their contract, but they stopped him from playing baseball, you see what I mean?  So a contract is only good with the people that's gon honor it.  So once he, Curt Flood, didn't honor their contract and said hey, well they said okay, you don't have to honor it, same way with me when I quit Houston, I didn't have to honor the contract, they just stopped me from playing anybody else you see.  But before that when the players would, I think it was with the Cardinals, Saint Louis Cardinals and the other team, New York Giants, I can't think of these guys names, maybe Max Lanier, something like that, they went to Mexico and played.  They said, pay me more money in Mexico, they said the hell with you and left the Major League and went to Mexico, and some guys went to Canada and played you see.  So at that particular time, you see, they couldn't stop them from going someplace else that--cause they didn't have that togetherness.  Now they got the type of togetherness, they could say hey don't hire him cause he got a contract with me, you see.  They at that particular time, they could break a contract but you couldn't.  The contract meant nothing.  Big business can break a contract when they wanted, when I was playing baseball.  They, once you signed, they had you for life and could pay you want they wanted to pay you.
Speaker 1: They could fire you but you couldn't--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they could fire you, but you could not quit.  So when I quit, I said well you know, you can take it and shove it, I'm gone.  And see so I got a letter that I keep right now from Marty Marion saying I had no reason jumping the club, but I was not going--and a lot of players, see I'm not gonna take this, I don't have to take it.  It's the same way now on my job.  If they don't treat me right on my job, you know what, I'm gone, you see.  Now if I go someplace and they find out they say hey don't hire him, they may honor and they may not.  But that's what life is all about you know.  You go when you're uncomfortable, you leave.  And baseball, or some people, I've talked to a number of people that's been mistreated in baseball or all sports.  Big business is ruthless you see.  And it's set up this way, it's set up this way with the laws and the lawyers and the people that judge, they do what they want to, the rich are getting richer and the poorer are getting poorer because the rich are together.  It's the same way over the unions, the unions are going out because big business has found a way of dividing the unions.  So the unions have very little strength now compared to what they used to have because people are more divided, see.  People are constantly losing jobs in this country because like Ross Perot said the jobs with Napster, the job is gone like the wind.
Speaker 1: -Yeah, they're going to people that can perform them cheaper.
Speaker 2: That's right see the rich are getting richer.
Story_ID: 76318
Speaker 1: But going back to my baseball experience you see that anytime that baseball then if--I once won, I don't know how many games I won, I won an awful lot of games one particular year and had to take a cut in salary because they said they didn't make any money.
Speaker 2: Now who were you pitching for then?
Speaker 1: Oh, I think I was pitching for a team [Stockton Ports] in Stockton, California, I think.  Yeah, I was playing with a team in Stockton, California.  Once I came back from Japan, I played in Japan in 1955, and a friend was--had a tryout in California named, a fellow, good friend of mine name Cleve Walker had a tryout, I think, Ernie Banks or somebody had got him a connection having a tryout with--so he was going to California to try out for this baseball team, the Oakland Oaks in the coast league, which Lefty O'Doul was the manager.  So I wasn't doing anything so I just rode out to California with Cleve you know.  I had played ball in Japan and I was just knocking around.  So I got in the car and rode with them.  So we got out there in California and I had known Lefty O'Doul briefly and he knew me briefly and so when we got to the stadium, you know, I'm figuring that I'd catch a plane and come back you know I had nothing to do, and wasn't really particular caring about playing baseball, I just rode with him.  And we got out there, so he in the process of his tryout, Lefty had looked at me and laughed, and so my friend, Cleve Walker, said well he's a ball player too, so Lefty just laughed, so they gave me a uniform and I proceeded to be with them and eventually sent me to a team in Stockton to play baseball.  I wasn't really particular, but I had nothing else to do so I went to Stockton to play baseball.  And the got in Stockton--didn't really care that much but I began to like Stockton and stayed out there for three years, which I won a number of games out there in Stockton.  I pitched in--in 58 games I completed 55 games in playing out there over a three-year time and didn't really care that much.  It was a young lady in Stockton I liked an awful lot but other than that I didn't care much for Stockton.  Stockton was not the place--in fact I don't know any city that I've played baseball in that I really liked.
Story_ID: 76319
Speaker 1: It's hard to understand, but to tell you the truth I felt better playing baseball in Mexico, Canada and Japan than I ever felt playing here.
Speaker 2: Why is that?
Speaker 1: Well, at that particular time, I've always been treated like a second class citizen.  And when you be around people that show you that they really like you, you feel better.  When you be around people--I was with Houston when they were calling me the ace of the pitching staff and they had mostly ex-major leaguers on the team.  Yet and still the general manager didn't want me to come up in the office to get my check, payday.  And so I'm saying when you're around people that really don't like you and they're not diplomatic enough for you not to pick it up, you don't feel too comfortable.  I don't--I was told there was a number of times that Jackie Robinson thought about quitting, that's what I was told, whether it's true or not--
Speaker 2: It's true.
Speaker 1: --Well I'm saying when people make you feel less than human you know, you don't feel too good.  And with me, I don't care whether you black or white, if you make me feel you know not adequate, I don't want to be around you.  I'm not going to be around anybody that don't seem to appreciate me.
Story_ID: 76320
Speaker 1: Now tell me about these two places that you were really intrigued, that would intrigue people, Japan--
Speaker 2: And Mexico.
Speaker 1: --Mexico, yeah.  Which one did you go to first?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to Mexico first and Japan.  I went to Japan in 1955.  And in Japan I was treated altogether different than the way I'm treated--
Speaker 1: Now how did that come about though?  Who was the hookup person? (unclear)
Speaker 2: --Well, I played (unclear) with Satchel Paige in 1954 and the manager, which this team was--the owner was Abe Saperstein.  So [Winfield] Welch was the manager, which Welch had been the manager with the American Giants in 1949 and 1951.  So Welch knew me even though that I didn't stay with either team when he was a manager, but in 1954, some friends--this team was practicing in Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois] with the intent of going down south to spring training, (unclear) the guys that I knew.  So I went down with them to Memphis Red Sox, just got on the bus and went down there and Welch when he saw me, Welch told me he said if you stay with me this year, I'll send you to Japan or spring training with the Cleveland Indians you know.  So this was the team that was headed by Satchel Paige in 1954.  And so I played the entire year with them and got a chance to meet Satchel Paige and played from coast to coast.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the team?
Speaker 2: Well the name of the team is the Harlem Globetrotters Baseball Team, that was the name of the team that Abe knew--owned.  So at the end of the year, of course I had a fairly decent year.  I won about 16 games and lost about 3 and so I got to be friendly with Satchel Paige and the others--we had a fun time just playing from coast to coast you know what I mean, I had a really fun time.  And so the following year, in 1955, I get a letter from Cleveland Indians to go to spring training with the Cleveland Indians.  So I go down to Daytona Beach, Florida with this farm team, that's where they--the farm team was in Daytona Beach, I go down there.  And I had been in the South in the [U.S.] Army, I was in World War II in the South so I knew something about the South and the treatment of how black people were treated in the South, which wasn't--which wasn't something that I enjoyed you know.  And didn't really like, you see.  So anyway I was there in Daytona Beach, Florida and so I left and came back to Chicago [Illinois] and then went to Japan you see.  But Abe Saperstein and Winfield Welch set this up for me to go to Japan because Japan had started--the first two blacks had went to Japan was 1955, which was Johnny Britton and a pitcher by the name of Jimmy Newberry.
Story_ID: 76321
Speaker 1: So you went to play with a Japanese team?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I was one of the imported players.  In fact in 1955 I was one of four imported Americans there.  But on my team they had a fellow that was imported was from Cuba.  So he and I were the only two imported players on this team called the Hankyu Braves.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: H-A-N-K-Y-U, Braves, B-R-A-V-E-S.  Did I say that right, B-R-A-Y-V-S.  Wait a minute, oh well.  Hankyu, H-A-N-K-Y-U, Hankyu Braves, yeah.  All right they had played in the--it was two leagues there, the Pacific Coast, I mean the Pacific League and the oh the other league, I can't think of the name of it, but there were two major leagues and this was in the Pacific League which was--that's 1955, I'm thinking with my mind on something else, but anyway, so I went over there.  And those people treated me, oh, they treated me unbelievably good.  And same way when I played in Mexico, those people treated me unbelievably good, the same way when I played in Canada, I was treated unbelievably good.  I was treated like a celebrity, but even in this country I've never been treated like a celebrity.  Now I know you got people that are and have been, you know what I mean, but I'm talking about me.  Now no doubt they treated, in New York, they treated Willie Mays like a celebrity you know, no doubt they treated Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods like a celebrity, but I'm talking about me and how I've been treated you know.  And my experience with Houston [Buffaloes] is where it's not only Houston there's other places in the South when I couldn't go into restaurants where other people went in--when I couldn't, it makes you feel like you know, hey you know, okay, you don't want me in here, I don't want to be in here.  So I don't want to be anyplace nobody wants me there, I don't care whether it's--wherever it is, you know.  I mean if it's my relative's house.  If I was at, you know, if somebody don't want me, I don't--that's my particular makeup you know.  But that's just the way I felt when I left Houston.  And I got so that--I've been there once or twice, Houston [Texas], once or twice.  Of course it's a different city than it was then, but by the same token as far as I'm concerned, I got people on my job now that I don't think care too much for me, but I don't have to deal with them.
Story_ID: 76322
Speaker 1: Now, Mr. Spearman, how long did you play baseball?
Speaker 2: Between 1949 and 1959.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Houston was the last team that you played for?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And when you look back on it, what would you see as a highlight of your baseball career?
Speaker 2: Well, the highlight as far as I'm concerned was when I was winning, you know, that was my happy time.
Speaker 1: What was the best team you played for?
Speaker 2: When you say the best team--
Speaker 1: Well I mean what was the best--
Speaker 2: --What do you mean the best--
Speaker 1: --Two things, what was your best personal record, I guess on a team and then like what team were you on that was successful as such?
Speaker 2: --Well, two teams that I can remember that I had the best record with, I was with Stockton when I had 18 wins and 3 losses and then when I was with Satchel Paige, I had 16 wins and 3 losses.  Now the other teams I played with, the losses and the wins were mixed, you know.  I don't really remember, I just remember those two because they were--I like to remember the good times.  I was with Houston and the first two games I pitched, I won, the second--the next game I--the next game I remember, I remember losing a game and that we were winning two to one in the ninth inning and a guy hit a home run off of me, which we lost three to two.  So there certain things I remember and certain things I don't remember.  So these were three incidents that I remember.  There are other incidents that I've just--they're not important to me, you know.  I remember the last game I pitched with Houston [Buffs], we were in--we were in I think in Fort Worth [Texas], it was either Fort Worth or Dallas [Texas], one or two.  And what happened is I had a sore arm and the manager told me, said, Spearman, go pitch.  We were losing I forget what game we were losing, we were losing, maybe eight to three or whatever.  And I told him, I said my arm is sore, he said, I don't care, gotta go.  So then he sent the umpire to tell me to come to the mound to pitch.  So I went out there to the mound to pitch and it just so happened that I pitched the three guys and got the three guys out with maybe, and I'm just guessing, maybe about eight or nine pitches.  And got 'em out relatively easy and just so happened the next inning, I was the second batter up.  So they put a pinch hitter in for me you see.  So now here's the game is over, we lost about eight to three, last game I pitched.
Story_ID: 76323
Speaker 1: We lost about eight to three, so here's the manager, he's patting it, and this wasn't Rube Walker, Rube Walker was a hell of a nice guy, it was another guy, a manager.  This manager was patting everybody on the back about the game that we had lost.  He said oh, if this ball had a been hit here, and then when he got to me, he said and Spearman, you're gonna either pitch or take your (bleep) behind home, that's what he said to me.  So all these veteran ballplayers looked, you know cause here I was a veteran you know what I mean and he should have took me in the room and say whatever he had to say to me, you know, but  all the ball players--I looked at him, say you gon take your so and so home. I didn't say anything to him.  But our plane was parked between, it was Love Field and Love Field airport between Fort Worth and Dallas.  We go up there to eat because our next trip was in Indianapolis [Indiana].  We played Indianapolis the next day.  Our next trip, we go into the airport to eat, we, black ball players, they wouldn't feed us, fed everybody else and didn't feed us.  So when time come for us to get on the plane and go, we had our own private plane a DC-3.  We get on the plane somebody must have told him, so he kind of apologetic and goes back and get a sandwich for me and the other guys.  Now I'm burnt by what he had said to me in the locker room, so when we got to Indianapolis, I had my bags, I just went right on to the train station.  I never went to the hotel and my roommate was Ray Noble, had played in--so when they got to looking for me, naturally, I wasn't there you know, I was in Chicago [Illinois], you know.  So that was when I left Houston, you know.  But it wasn't just that incident alone it was a number of things.  Like the general manager didn't want me to come up in the office to get my paycheck, didn't want me to get in the clubhouse you know, didn't want me up in the you know, but this is the racist attitude they had toward me.  Now I wasn't one that could accept this you know at that particular time.  And it could have been because maybe you know I didn't have to.
Story_ID: 91498
Speaker 1: Now tell me now, when you stopped playing baseball, what did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, when I stopped playing baseball, I took a job with 7Up Bottling Company as a driver salesman.  And I worked there until I got disgusted with 7Up Bottling Company because of the attitude of the boss, and I quit and I was gonna go back into baseball but I didn't and then I got a job as a truck driver, I got a job as a truck driver and worked a few months until I got a job as a salesman, had a job as a liquor salesman.  And I did that for twenty-three years until the company went out of business and then I started going to truck driving school to become a truck driver.  And I didn't like that too much, then I took a test for the park district and started working for the park district as a truck driver.  That didn't pan out because they had big layoffs.  And so then I became an independent contractor as a truck driver you know.  So now I work as a courier you know, and which I really like.  So this job that I got the people like me and I like them and so--and we got a pretty good situation going.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You stay active, right, you like what seventy--
Speaker 2: Seventy-six, I'll be seventy-seven in August, but I'm gonna do something as long as I can, you know, as long as I can work, I'm gonna work.  I believe if I became incapacitated as far as walking I think I would work if I had to work in a wheelchair because I'm gonna do something as long as I think the way I think.
Story_ID: 91499
Speaker 1: Now this is a flashback over to the baseball career just for a second, I never did ask you, what was your--as a pitcher, what was your best pitch?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't have a best pitch, I had--my best pitch was between my ears.  I more or less think in terms of what my opponent's weakness is.  Whatever his weakness is that's the way--I attack weaknesses.  If you--for example as a pitcher I learned that if you're a highball hitter, why throw you highballs, if you're a curveball hitter, why throw you curve, if you're a fastball hitter why throw you fastballs, plus the fact in pitching the main thing is timing.  You can throw different pitches at different speeds and these are basically the most successful pitchers the one that keep you off balance you see.  So I've learned that even throwing batting practice, you can't hit every pitch out of the ballpark and you know what's coming.  So all the pitcher has to do is think.  See I had--I was pretty successful because I never let the catchers control what I did.  You see a catcher he'll sit back there and he'll call pitches based on what he thinks, but what he thinks isn't what you are capable of doing.  I was pitching one game when I was with Colorado Springs and the manager and I had a difference of agreement, difference of opinions, that is.  I was pitching and I had two strikes on the guy from fast balls.  So the manager was sitting in the dugout calling pitches and so the catcher, after I had threw him two fast balls, the catcher called for another one.  I shook him off and begin to shake, shake him off enough for him to come out and say hey I was calling the pitches.  I say I'm doing the pitching, you know.  In other words, the first two games I pitched for Colorado Springs I pitched completed games and won 'em both.  So apparently the manager figured you know what I mean that he wanted me to pitch a little different.  You see because pitching is all about keeping the hitter off balance, that's what pitch is all about. I once--when I was in spring training with, that year, with the Cleveland Indians, minor league team, I never will forget Red Ruffing was the pitching coach for Cleveland in 1955, and he was saying that one time he pitched to a guy his fastball and the guy hit a home run, and he was saying, he didn't believe the guy could do it again, so he threw him another fastball and the other guy hit a home run again.  So although Red Ruffing was a Hall of Fame pitcher, I thought he was stupid you see.  So this is the way some people think.  Some people say well you hit my best pitch, I'm mo see if you can do it again, that's foolish  Because if a guy hits your best pitch and you throw it again, that mean he has seen it.  So the best pitchers are the ones that use the fewest pitches.  The more you see of anything the more you get acclimated to seeing it you see.  It's no way in the world for me being a veteran pitcher to throw you the same pitch too many times because you get accustomed to the timing and that's what hitting is all about, timing you see.  A lot of guys that--I've heard some guys say that he saw the pitch good, but you don't see the pitch.  When that pitcher leaves his hand you get an idea of where it is and you swing at it.  When you swing at that pitch you don't see it, it's impossible you see that pitch once you hit it.  You see it coming and you get an idea of where it's going to end up and that's where you swing.  I've seen some guys, I've seen particular guys like Willie Mays and Yogi Berra swing at a pitch and it's in the ground, start swinging at it and when it comes, it's in the ground.  It could be a fastball, it could be a knuckleball, it could be a change of pace.  So you have to start your swing early enough otherwise the ball gets past you.  But that's what I learned from pitching you see.  So a lot of pitchers--I've looked at--some of the games I've looked at like the Cubs games and some of the pitchers is throwing the ball seemingly out of sight and get home runs hit off of 'em.  If they time you right they gonna hit it, and it's all about timing, Bobby Barnes or whoever, if they connect right, and it's going and they gotta be just right because some balls are hit so hard they won't rise.  I get a ball so hard they just flatten out, you know, since you got to have the right spin, have the right lift, they go out the ball park, and this is all about timing, you see.  But that's my opinion.
Story_ID: 91500
Speaker 1: Now tell me, what are your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, my hopes and concerns for the black community is all about jobs.  It's about jobs and as far as I'm concerned, I grew up in a neighborhood where the people worked and spent their money in the neighborhood, so the neighborhood was comfortable.  What's happening now is a lot of people working are not spending their money in the neighborhood you see.  So money isn't staying in the neighborhood.  My hope is--my mother [Connie Summage] always told me it's not how much money you make, it's what you do with it, you see.  And so in my opinion what you have to do, what I have to do, or anybody has to do, they have to make money and put it in a family because that's where the growth is.  The growth is in the family, you see.  In other words for example, if we are family and we help each other, once one of us get done, the other two can help the one you see.  So it's all about togetherness you see.  I think if we're divided, the three of us, if we're divided, we can't help each other if we in need, we got to go to strangers.  You see so everything in my opinion is a family core, you have to help the family.  In this situation the family is being destroyed, their being divided, the families are hating each other.  And it goes to me back like the Willie Lynch letter, you know, divide and conquer.
Speaker 1: Now, what's the Willie Lynch letter, can you explain that to us?
Speaker 2: Well, the Willie Lynch letter is a letter that supposedly a guy came from Europe and talked to slave owners into not killing their slaves.  At that particular time the slave owners used to think the way of control is killing the slaves and this fellow said hey you foolish to kill the people that can make you rich.  All you have to do is train 'em.  And the way of training them, which the Willie Lynch letter promoted was divide and conquer.  So they divided the slaves according to size, weight, color, every way of division, that's what they did.  So as a result a bunch of people started hating each other because this is what they were taught, this is what they were conditioned.  So this was division.  Most people that want to conquer, have to divide, you have to divide because togetherness, is pretty hard to conquer a group that is together.  The best way to conquer a group is to divide them.  And so this is what has been done with a whole lot of black people.  A lot of us black folks have been divided and I've seen divisions like when after Harold Washington died how the divisions were divided and couldn't get together you see.  And so this is a--this is a prop of the people in control you see.  So you got a lot of people--I've talked to a lot of people everyday and it's unbelievable how a lot of people have been divided, see.  And we need to get together if we can.  And this is why I'm happy to talk about my experiences.  My experience is actually something that I have lived and I feel you see.  So I would be foolish to burn any bridges because when you burn bridges that mean you can't cross, you can't come back across 'em, but so many of us burn bridges and we alienate ourselves with people that can help us.
Story_ID: 91501
Speaker 1: Now, in terms of that what advice would you have for young people that are becoming involved in sports and sports is a big thing in the black community especially when kids see, you know, a lot of kids see sports as a way to get out of poverty, change their lives, what advice do you have?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell you I don't know whether I've impressed upon you, but sports isn't it.  Sports is a division, the same type of division that people like to go to see the lines in the Christmas fight, it's just a division.  You see once you involved in the sport, you forget about other important things, such as like the Super Bowl game, the World Series, it's just a ball game, that's all it is.  If you get so confused about the good time you gonna have watching the Super Bowl or the World Series you know and you can get caught up these things.  I can get caught up in the maybe Joe Louis fighting somebody maybe somebody fighting, I can get caught up in these things.  But after it's over, it's over.  And the people go away rich and you come away poor.  You're watching entertainment.  And entertainment is one of the biggest business, entertainment and killing people, it's a big business.  You see I see all these people going on the riverboat in Las Vegas, entertainment.  So we are so programmed that entertainment is so important we will spend millions on entertainment, but that's all it is, entertainment.  I played sports because it was a way of entertainment for me, and I did it well enough to get paid for it, but that's all it was, entertainment.
Speaker 1: You say there are more serious matters to--
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely.  What happens when you can't play sports, what happens?  I can't play sports now to get paid for it, so that's all it is, entertainment you see.  So the friends that I knew that are outstanding athletes, it had became a time when they couldn't no longer make that money.  So when you can't make that money then you just go into depression, alcohol, drugs or whatever, you see.  But it's all about entertainment.
Story_ID: 91502
Speaker 1: Well let me ask you this, did your mother [Connie Summage] get a chance to see you play ball, how did she feel about it?
Speaker 2: My mother was so busy working you see that sports was not in her mind, making a living was in her mind.  And I'm so busy working, sports isn't in my mind.  Only thing sports mean to me is somebody willing to pay for it.  And if you can do it well enough, for example, the people going to see Michael Jordan playing, you know.  I have  no problem with that, but as far as I'm concerned only time I go to a Cub game, or White Sox game is somebody got to sponsor me, because as far as I'm concerned they're doing something they're professionals at.  And professional mean that you make your living doing it, that's what it means to me.  Now you can make your living at doing something you don't really like, but you're making a living.  I suppose dope dealers make a living at doing something they don't like but they making a living.  So that's what it's all about, making a living.  And when people learn that that's the most important thing, when you make a living, you can do for your live ones and you feel good.  When you do something for your kids, your family, it makes you feel good.  I feel good, I feel real good because I'm making money to do for people I care for, and that's my grandkids, so I feel good and I'm going to work as long as I can you see.  And when we, the people that developed this, they feel good about themselves and you may take a job that you don't like, but you taking that job for that paycheck.

Speaker 1: Tell me something, sir, now you have grandchildren now, what would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't--you have to define this for me to understand what you're looking for, my legacy.  Unless you define what you looking for the only thing I can think about is what I like to do is tell the truth.  Tell people what my experiences are and how I feel, I honestly feel.  And I hope somebody could say well Al was not a lying person.  My mother [Connie Summage] taught my brother [Frank Spearman] and myself, my older brother and myself to say the blessing every time we had something to eat, and one was I shall not lie, I shall not steal.  So I'm not gonna say to you that I haven't lied and I haven't stolen, but my idea is not to lie and not to steal.  If I don't have to lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna say that I'm mo tell you the truth, but I'm not gonna lie to you, because if I lie to you and you come back and say hey, Al, you lied, makes me feel bad.  I'm not gonna steal from you because you come back and say I stole from you that's gon make me feel bad.  And I'm not gon say that if I had to lie, I'm not gon say I'm not gon lie, if I gotta steal, I'm not gon say I'm not gon steal.  I'm saying I don't want to and I'm not gon do it unless I think it's absolutely necessary.  And I think this what should be taught.  Because people look at you and over a long period of time they decide where you are in life.  They decide whether you're a liar, you a thief and they judge you based on over a long period of time.  You may tell the truth sometime and tall a lie another time, you may steal one time and may not steal another time, but you're known by from what you do you see.  I would like to leave a history of being a working person, a sensitive person and a person that--I'll go out of my way not to do you any damage.

Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, that's the way I like to be remembered.  I'd like to be remembered as basically a truthful person, I may not be right in what I say but just based on what I believe.  And all of us have opinions you know.  And all of us have opinions, opinions like nose, we all have nose, all of us have opinions.  And you know and I like to say you're entitled to your opinion.  I go to a barbershop, I used to get into arguments with people and in the barbershop that I go to and I say well listen this is just my opinion, right?  One guy said you don't have an opinion, I said, wait a minute, do you have an opinion, he said yes, I said, well why do I not have an opinion.  But I'm saying how ridiculous some people are.  Some people want you to respect their opinion, but they don't respect yours.  And it's all an opinion.  Because my opinion might change tomorrow, but right now this is my opinion.  And I would like for us black people to become more truthful and we are constantly being more divided the females and the males are coming wider and wider apart because of that Willie Lynch syndrome you see.  And I believe, like--I like to quote Tina Turner, she says "What's Love Got to do With It", you see.  It's a lot of people talk about love, but what's love got to do with it?  I put a whole lot more weight on respect than I do on love.  Because my mother [Connie Summage], sometimes she tells me, she says love a light on the toilet and so her thoughts about love you know, respect.  And if I deal with you truthfully you will respect me.  You don't have to like me but at least you'll respect me.  A lot of people that you don't like, but you have to respect them based on what they do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right well thank you, sir, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Okay, my pleasure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
