Speaker 1: Now before we get into depth, there are five People magazine-ish type questions and lightweight questions that I am compelled to ask you.  And the first one is, Ma'am, what is your favorite food?

Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 178344
Speaker 1: Let me ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask you about your mother's side of the family, and then your father's side of the family, and start with your mother's side.  How--what's your mother's full name?  Can you give us her--
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is--was Jamye Harris.  She didn't have a middle name.  And I was named for her, Jamye Harris Coleman, then I just dropped the Harris when I got married and used Coleman for my middle name.
Speaker 1: Okay, and when was she born and where?
Speaker 2: She was born in Mayfield, Kentucky, on September the 20th, 1893.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what do you know about her side of the family?  How far back can you trace that--
Speaker 2: I can't go back very far with her.  Her father's name was James Harris.  He originally lived here in Atlanta, Georgia, as a matter of fact; was a brick mason and somehow migrated to Mayfield, Kentucky, where he met my mother's mother, my grandmother, whose name was Tennie Beatles [ph.].  And that's about it.  I don't know anything at all about her father or his father, so I'm stumped right there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there are any stories that, that are passed down through the family about what the family was doing in the nineteenth century?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandmother died early.  She had about six or seven children.  My grandfather then went to Topeka, Kansas, and the children all went to Louisville, Kentucky.  And I suppose that's where my mother lived until she met my father [Frederick Douglass Coleman], and that's where they were married.
Speaker 1: Oh, in, in Louisville?
Speaker 2: In Louisville.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 178345
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Frederick Douglass Coleman and Jamye Harris Coleman] met?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they met in church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother was very creative and wrote poetry and wrote plays, and she had written a play called 'Ruth the Gleaner,' which was based on the biblical story of Ruth in the Old Testament.  And my father, evidently, had a role in the play, so that was the way they met and subsequently got married there.  And he went overseas in service and was over there when I was born.  He didn't see me until I was about six months old.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's 1918.  He was a--
Speaker 2: Nineteen-eighteen [1918].
Speaker 1: --War World I [WWI]--
Speaker 2: The war, the war--armistice was signed November the 11th, 197--18 [1918], and I was born in December.  And he went through--he was chosen to go to a, a college called AEF [American Expeditionary Forces] university for military people.  And that's why he happened to stay longer, and he didn't get home until the following summer.
Story_ID: 178346
Speaker 1: Okay, let me ask you some more about your mother [Jamye Harris Coleman] then.  Did your mother have a chance--well, I suppose she went to school.  She had a chance to go to school and everything if she was writing--
Speaker 2: She, she was--she went to elementary school in Mayfield [Kentucky], left there at age fourteen, then went to Louisville [Kentucky] and immediately started working, and went to night school and finished Central High School in Louisville in night school.  My mother was very talented, and I often say that she--if she had had the opportunities that my family provided for me, she really would have been something else.  She wrote plays, which were published, two books of poetry, and when she was age seventy she started writing music, the words and the melodies.  And clearly she could not write the music, so she would sing the music into a tape recorder and then have somebody to record it.  And I have copies of them over there on the piano, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So she was, she lived to be ninety-three, was a devoted church woman.
Speaker 1: Okay, she a member of the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] Church?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, my father [Frederick Douglass Coleman] was an A.M.E. preacher.
Story_ID: 178347
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your father.  Now what was his full name, and can you spell his name for us?
Speaker 2: His name was Frederick Douglass Coleman.  He's named for the great Frederick Douglass.  And you can always tell when an African American was named for Frederick Douglass, if his name is Douglass, they spells it with two "s"'s.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: My grandson's name is Douglass with two "s"'s, so the Frederick, F-R-E-D-E-R-I-C-K, the Douglass, D-O-U-G-L-A-S-S, Coleman.  And he was born in the oldest town in Kentucky, Harrisburg, Kentucky, which is not--maybe about thirty miles from Lexington.
Speaker 1: Okay, and now when was he born?
Speaker 2: Eighteen ninety-two [1892], October 30th.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell us about your, your father.  What was he like, and what, what did he do?
Speaker 2: My father lived in this little community, Harrisburg.  And there was a white family of Colemans, and the slave master had a black family in that same community.  And my father was the son of one of the, one of those slave children.  And his father's name was Henry Coleman.  Heard you say something about Ripley, and some of the Colemans migrated to Ripley, Ohio, at one point.  He was always interested in education.  I had a cousin of his who came to our home, and I did a tape of vid--of, of audiotape talking about my father.  And he said even when my father was very young, he had a post office box, 'cause he sold all the people in--the white men in Harrisburg with post office boxes.  And he would have some kind of little mail coming to him.  He sold things and ended up going to Kentucky State [University, Frankfort, Kentucky], which was at that time a Normal institution [State Normal School for Colored Persons].  I suppose he was, early on, a jack of all trades.  He was a printer; he worked in a cleaning and pressing company; and he ultimately became a minister in A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] Church and was that for about forty years, until his death.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was a minister, but he also had these other jobs?
Speaker 2: He didn't have any other job after he became a minister.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: He had these jobs leading up to that, you know.  For example, when I got married he printed my wedding invitations.  He had bought a printing press at the church in which he pastored in, in Nashville [Tennessee].  So he printed all the programs and all the tickets and everything.  And when I got married he printed my wedding invitations.  So, he pastored in Nashville, Covington [Kentucky], Lexington [Kentucky], back to Nashville, Memphis [Tennessee], Jackson, Tennessee, Paris, Tennessee, Union City, Tennessee.  And all of this was over a period of forty years.  He died in 1959, at age sixty-seven.
Story_ID: 178348
Speaker 1: Okay, now did he [Williams' father, Frederick Douglass Coleman] have any stories about what his ancestors did, when, you know, or, or any, any stories about his grandparents or, or great-grandparents?
Speaker 2: Well, he had these unhappy recollections of, you know, being a part of a, a family there in Harrisburg [Kentucky].  And he said that, interestingly, this was not a secret.  I mean the people in, in the community just openly knew that both of these Coleman families were of the same root.  And he'd, he often would tell about one of the white uncles died, and their father had them to put on their little, nice little clothes and to go up to pay their respects.  And when they, when the, the white aunt came to the door, she open up.  She said, "Oh, you came to see your Uncle Jimmy.  Come right in."  So he was--and when, when my uncle died and we had to go to Harrisburg to settle his affairs, the white lawyer was--he said oh, yeah, you know, your cousin this and your cousin that, and these were all people of the other group.  That was his side of the family.
Speaker 1: So they, they, they didn't distinguish them, or they, they didn't make any--there was no discrimination on their part in terms--
Speaker 2: Oh, well, everybody was on his side of town, but they had--one--my father had an aunt whose name was Eliza.  And one of the white brothers used to come regularly to see her.  And she would lecture him on how horrible slave, slavery was and told him the Lord was gonna punish you all for treating us like this.  So, yeah, that's, that's the South.  That's what I wanted to get away from.
Story_ID: 178349
Speaker 1: What was your earliest memory, you know, as a, as a child?
Speaker 2: Well my earliest memories were, of course, living in Louisville [Kentucky], and they are very faint.  And I guess my most vivid memories were, would be in Nashville [Tennessee].  My father [Frederick Douglass Coleman] was assigned to a church in Nashville called St. James [A.M.E. Church], a small church.  And he also wrote a column, the 'National Banner,' which is no longer in existence.  I think it's been out of print maybe for about eight or ten years.  But it was the afternoon paper, and it had a column called 'Happenings Among Colored People,' and my father edited that for the 'National Banner' while he was--is that rain?
Speaker 1: It's rain, yeah.
Speaker 2: --while he was pastoring St. James.  We stayed there for three years and then we moved to a small town in Kentucky called Midway, which was seven miles from Georgetown, Kentucky, seven miles from Versailles [Kentucky], fourteen miles from Lexington [Kentucky], and fourteen miles from Frankfort [Kentucky], that's why it was called Midway.  And he stayed there for two years, and then we moved to Covington, Kentucky, and I suppose all my great memories are of living in Covington because by that time--
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, now Covington--yeah.
Speaker 2: --I was about nine years old and made a lot of friends and was right across the river from Cincinnati [Ohio].  And even that was great, a lot of discrimination in Cincinnati.  To Cincinnati, that meant, you know, somehow or another that was a little, little freer.  And I remember some of my classmates went to school in Cincinnati because the schools were decidedly better.  And they would register with their relatives in Cincinnati and go to school there.  We stayed there for five years, and then my father moved to St. Paul, Lexington, Kentucky.  That church has an attic in it, which used to hide underground slaves when they were trying to escape, and we stayed there for three years.  Then he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to pasture St. John A.M.E. Church, which is a mother church of African Methodism in the state of Tennessee.  And he pastured that church for eleven years.  During that period, my brother [Frederick D. Coleman] went to medical school at Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] and became a doctor.  I was at Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] when he moved there, so when I came home--
Speaker 1: Okay, I--
Speaker 2: --that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay, I didn't want you to go too far.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We wanna maybe go back to childhood in a minute and just talk about school and--well, not school, but, but growing up--
Story_ID: 178350
Speaker 1: Can you, give us some ideas of some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: I can remember when I was a little girl we lived in Louisville [Kentucky].  We lived across the street from, it must have been a factory of some kind, but there were some ducks over there, and my mother [Jamye Harris Coleman] would take me over to watch the ducks.  I'm still fascinated by ducks.  A couple of weeks ago some ducks ran--walked across my lawn.  That's a, that's a vivid memory.  My memories of Nashville [Tennessee] in those early years, I went to a school, and I had to go through the woods.  And I can remember walking through the woods--remember one day, every day my mother took me to school, and for some reason I came back and she, when I came back, she, she let me go back alone.  And I remember her saying how frightened she was, thinking I was going through the woods.  But, you know, no one was frightened about anything in those days.  Covington [Kentucky], I think about Eden Park in Cincinnati [Ohio], the [Cincinnati] Art Museum, the Cincinnati Zoo, and I still talk about this.  Every time we go through Cincinnati I'll tell my husband [McDonald Williams], "I wanna go to the Cincinnati Zoo just one more time," and he says that's just a fancy I have, that I really don't wanna go.  But that's, that's a vivid memory.  All our high school, one day out of the year, close to the closing of school, we would all go to Cincinnati to the zoo.  And everybody would take a lunch, and that was out day out.  I guess those--my summer vacations, many of them were spent in Louisville, Kentucky, with an aunt, my mother's older sister, had no children, so all of her nieces and nephews sort of became her grandchildren, and I would go to Louisville.  In fact, if anybody got sick in our family, favorite saying was, you know, we'll take you down to Aunt Rue [ph.], and we'd have to go to her doctor.  So that was one, that's a good childhood memory.
Story_ID: 178351
Speaker 1: Now, now what were you like as a little girl?  What, what did you like to do, and--
Speaker 2: Read.  I've often told Donna [Williams, Williams' daughter] that I had a chance to learn how to play tennis.  When we lived in Lexington [Kentucky] we had a little group of friends, about six or seven girls.  And every afternoon they would come past my house on their way to the park, and I would join them.  We'd go to Douglas Park, which as about four blocks up the street from where I lived, and they would play tennis, and I would read.  So I never developed any kind of athletic ability at all, always been interested in books.
Speaker 1: What were your favorite books?
Speaker 2: When I was young I read novels, and I don't ever read them now.  But everything--I, I remember when we lived in Covington, Kentucky, one of the members of our church, who came sort of an older sister to me, who worked for a white family in Cincinnati [Ohio], and I would frequently go across the river, as we said, and spend the night with her.  And I, I would tell her about some of the books I had read, and I think she got the impression that I was reading books that were not appropriate for somebody my age.  So she, you know, mentioned it to my parents [Frederick Douglass Coleman and Jamye Harris Coleman], and my mother [Jamye Harris Coleman] and father [Frederick Douglass Coleman] were upset.  So they went around to the public library and to check on what I'd been reading, and the librarian said, "Oh, she's reading all the, the right things."  So I grew up--and then there were books in our house.  My father was an avid reader, as was my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we still have their books packed in the garage, however.
Speaker 1: Are there any titles that stand out that you remember that you, that, that you liked especially?
Speaker 2: There was a woman who evidently wrote religious books called Grace Livingston Hill, and I think I read every novel she ever wrote.
Story_ID: 178352
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell us about grade school.  What was the name of your grade school?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to grade school in Midway, Kentucky, and I don't know what the name of that school was.  I can remember, if the boys were bad, they were threatened with the principal was gonna take them to Room C, which was a room in the basement.  And the girls said, "Well, we'll never have to go there 'cause he only whips the boys."  In Covington [Kentucky], when I first moved to Covington, we were in a school, an old building right downtown.  And you know the movies were segregated in Kentucky, so they provided an opportunity for us to see a movie every Friday afternoon.  So when school was out you'd have about a half hour break, and then they would show--and of course the film was silent back in those days.  But it was--there was enough time so we could run around the corner to the ten cent store and buy some peanuts and candy and come back to watch a western movie.  That school also had a fire escape down the side of it.  And I've never forgotten that because on some occasions, you know, we'd see the janitor come, and he would have these great big pieces of cloth.  And he would go and go down because it would get dirty in there, and he would clean them out, and we knew that we were gonna have a fire drill.  And it wasn't particularly a pleasant thing because it was dark, and it was just like a tunnel.  I don't know, have you ever seen one of them?  Looks like a tunnel on the outside of a building.  We were on the third floor so they had--we had to have fire drills.  I can remember.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, yeah, the, the black metal fire escape on the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --side.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's like, almost like a little tunnel in there, dark in there, and of course, you know, we didn't like that.  While I was there they built a new school, which was closer to where I lived, called--and, and the school, they, they tried to make it as modern as possible.  They even put in an apartment, where the young women would learn how to cook and keep an apartment straight.
Story_ID: 178353
Speaker 1: I remember being in a lot of plays during that period.  My mother [Jamye Harris Coleman], wherever my father [Frederick Douglass Coleman] went, would organize a dramatics club, so there were always a lot of young people in and out of our house.  And she would have plays and make all the costumes, and my father would say--and move all the furniture out of the house into the church in order to make it work.
Speaker 2: She thought she was really devoted to theater, you know.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, she really was.  And she herself had great histrionic ability.  Yeah, she--there, there was one play called 'The Call to Service' that she wrote that they traveled all over Kentucky with it, and she had the leading role in it.  So--
Speaker 2: What was the theme of the play?
Speaker 1: It was a missionary play about a young woman who chose to become a missionary, married a doctor, and they went to Africa.  This was my mother's dream.  She wanted to go as a missionary to Africa.  All of her life that's all she talked about, to the extent that my brother [Frederick D. Coleman], when he took medicine, decided he wanted to be a medical missionary.  And we always said that this wasn't his idea at all, that this was something my mother had talked about so much that it just got implanted in his mind.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, okay, so all of her plays were done in the church?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they were all religious plays.
Story_ID: 178354
Speaker 1: Now you were in school.  You went, you went, went to school the longest in Covington [Kentucky], right, from grade--
Speaker 2: That's right, five years.
Speaker 1: --grade school, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's the only place I was there for that--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --five years there, three years in Lexington [Kentucky], where I finished high school [at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any teachers that you remember from--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --grade school that you--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I had a teacher.  Her name was Blanche Irene Glenn [ph.].  And you know, teachers would sort of have favorite students.  She lived in Cincinnati [Ohio], and she, on occasion, would have bridge parties.  And she would--her little fa--little favorite girl she would have to come over, and she would teach us how to take the wraps of the guests.  And ta--I can never forget she was serving olives on one occasion.  She said now you have to cultivate a taste for olives, but this is what people do.  So I can remember her vividly.  And she gave--I remember my first watch I ever had she gave me at Christmastime.  In high school, my favorite teacher was also my music teacher, the one who taught me piano.  Her name was Maime [ph.] Summers.  She was the person who told me I should change the spelling of my name.  My name was originally spelled J-A-M-I-E.  And when I was in Lexington about to finish high school, Ms. Summers said to me, you know, people are going to think you are male because Jamie is a diminutive of James, and it's usually used by boys.  You need to put--feminize your name by spelling--putting the "y" in it.  So that's when I changed my spelling of my name to J-A-M-Y-E, and subsequently, my mother did the same thing.  But when we got ready to get passports to go to Europe, and I got a birth certificate, it came out J-A-M-I-E.  So my, my passport says J-A-M-I-E, even though I had changed it.  Everything else legal has J-A-M-Y-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 178355
Speaker 1: Now in, in high school, now where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: Lexington, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: [Paul Laurence] Dunbar High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a very good school; teachers were interested in their students.  I had two teachers who were graduates of Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] who just insisted they wanted me to go to Fisk.  And my response to that is I didn't wanna live in the south.  Somehow or another I didn't consider Lexington in the south.  And many, many years later, when I lived in Nashville [Tennessee], one of our friends, Jane Eskind, who is--who ran for the senate of the United States, one of the newspaper reporters complained about her, saying that she'd been born in the north.  She'd been born in Louisville, Kentucky.  So this always amused my husband [McDonald Williams], who's from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], who certain didn't consider Kentucky north.
Speaker 1: Okay, but when, when you were at Dunbar High School were you involved in a lot of activities or--
Speaker 2: In plays.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would--yeah.
Speaker 2: And I was a cheerleader, interestingly.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Of all things.
Speaker 1: So you had to do some athletic stuff--
Speaker 2: That, that--yeah, but they weren't like they do now.  You know, it was just a little rah, rah, rah, and throw your hands up.  I mean, what they do now, we, we never even dreamed of.  But I--my father [Frederick Douglass Coleman], my father was always ready to do something with me and my friends.  And he would take us to the surrounding towns to the football games so we could cheer our team on.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And here, again, in Lexington my mother [Jamye Harris Coleman] did, was doing plays again, so all the young people in the community were gathered at St. Paul A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] Church to do plays with us.
Speaker 1: So you had a pretty active social life, I guess, when you were in, in high school.
Speaker 2: Social until it came to going to the dances.  I didn't dance, and I didn't play cards.  I was a preacher's daughter.  That's not true anymore.
Speaker 1: So you officially--
Speaker 2: That's not true anymore.
Speaker 1: So officially you could not--they actually told you you could not dance and play cards?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was so devoutly religious that she just did not believe in dancing and playing cards.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I went to college and didn't go to dances.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She pounded it in, in me enough I guess, and I still don't go to the movies on Sunday.
Speaker 1: Now, were, were there any teachers there that took an interest in you or in, or in--that you admired?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ms. Summers, Ms. Iva Green, who is incidentally from Dayton [Ohio] originally.  She was an, she was another person who taught English, Mr. James Jonathan, who was my biology teacher.  But you know, you know, the teachers took great interest in their students anyway and encouraged them.  I remember when it was time for us to graduate there was another young woman in my class who was a daughter of a minister.  And our averages were so close as to which one of us would be the valedictorian, because whichever one was gonna be the valedictorian, they had decided that that father could preach the baccalaureate sermon.  And I think I edged her out for a few points.  So the baccalaureate sermon was preached by my father and at my father's church, St. Paul A.M.E.
Story_ID: 178356
Speaker 1: Now when you were a senior in high school [at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, Kentucky], did you have any idea what you wanted to do for college or where, where you wanted to go or?
Speaker 2: I always wanted to go to Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  You know, in--
Speaker 1: Why--
Speaker 2: --in early years, Wilberforce commencement was a big affair.  Preachers came from all over the country to Wilberforce commencement.  People came with their picnic baskets, and after commencement, spread among the lawn.  And every year when we would go, my mother [Jamye Harris Coleman] would say in X number of years you'll be going to Wilberforce.  And this went on from, I guess from the time I was about ten years old.  So when I got ready--when I finished high school, I was all primed to go to Wilberforce.  It just so happened, it was in the midst of the [Great] Depression.  And my father [Frederick Douglass Coleman], said I don't know whether you're gonna be able to go to Wilberforce or not.
Speaker 1: Even as an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] minister, he did, did--
Speaker 2: Yeah, because I'm not sure we're gonna have enough money to send you.  You may have to go to Kentucky State [University, Frankfort, Kentucky].  Now all of my classmates were going to Kentucky State.  You could go to Kentucky State for sixteen dollars for the quarter of the semester, and you could certainly get, get hold to that.  Well, I announced that if I couldn't go to Wilberforce, I was not going to college.  Now I don't know how far I would have gotten with a statement like that, but coincidentally, Bishop Reverdy Cassius Ransom came through Lexington [Kentucky].  In those days, no one could--you know, people didn't stay in hotels.  So everybody who came through a, a city who was an A.M.E. would stay at our house, 'cause my father was usually pastor of the largest church there.  So Bishop Ransom came through, and at breakfast he said, "Oh, you finished high school.  Where are you going to college?"  And I said, "I wanted to go to Wilberforce, but my daddy says I can't go."
Story_ID: 179562
Speaker 1: Yeah, tell us about Bishop Reverdy [Cassius] Ransom.
Speaker 2: Well, Bishop Ransom, well, let me just tell you what his response to me was.  He said he could get me, get me, get me a scholarship to go to Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  And then he asked me how old I was, and I said, "Fifteen."  He said, "Oh, that's too young."  I said, "No, I'm not too young."  So I got the scholarship, and that's how I got to Wilberforce, through Bishop Ransom.  Bishop Ransom figured in my life in a lot of ways.  That was just one instance.  That was--he, he, you know, was a great orator.  And I can remember when my father [Frederick Douglass Coleman] pastored in Covington, Kentucky.  Now I had to be maybe twelve years old, but I can still remember the title of the speech he made at the public auditorium there called 'What Time is the Clock Striking Now?'  And he was on racism, as he was so much of his life.  When I got to Wilberforce, he lived at Tawawa Chimney Corner.  You know where that house is?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: It's right down at the end of the campus.  It's in disrepair now and really makes you very sad, but it used to be the hotel, the old Tawawa Hotel.  And I think Bishop [Benjamin W.] Arnett might have owned it at one time, and then Bishop Ransom came in possession of it.  His wife, his first wife, Mrs. Emma Ransom, knew my mother so, you know, people would take an interest in you.  So we would, we would frequently go down to their house.  As a matter of fact, when she had guests, she would have some of the preachers' daughters, daughters of preachers that they knew to come down and take the coats of the dignitaries.  So we were, you know, when the bishops would come, we were down there resting their coats and listening to what was going on.
Speaker 1: Okay, what kind of things did, did you hear (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, let me tell you, I was down at the house the night before the split.  Now this was many years later and I, I--see, I knew Bishop Ransom during the years when I was in college, and then when I came back to teach at Wilberforce, he was a chancellor and still there.  And when his first wife died some years after that, he married my dean of women, Myrtle, Georgia Myrtle Teal, who had been my mentor through college, and who became just almost like a surrogate mother to me.  So when they married, every night Mack [Williams' husband, McDonald Williams] and I would say, "We going to the house?"  That's what we called it.  And we'd go down and sit on the porch and talk to the Ransoms.  He was just a fascinating man, very well read and so articulate.  You need to read a new biography by him, which is called 'The Sage of Tawawa [: Reverdy Cassius Ransom, 1961-1959' by Annetta Louise Gomez-Jefferson].  And that's the way we refer to him at A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] Church.  When I quote him in my speeches, I called Reverdy Cassius Ransom, the sage of Tawawa.
Story_ID: 179563
Speaker 1: This ['The Sage of Tawawa: Reverdy Cassius Ransom, 1861-1959' by Annetta Louise Gomez-Jefferson] is a biography, and it was written by the daughter of one of our A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] bishops.  Her name is Annetta [Louise] Gomez--what's Annetta's last name?
Speaker 2: MCDONALD WILLIAMS:  Jefferson.
Speaker 1: Jefferson.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And it's put--it, it's just been published maybe about two or three months ago by the Kent University Press [sic, Kent State University Press].  She's a retired professor Wooster College, the College of Wooster [Wooster, Ohio], wonderful writer.  You need to read the book.  If you're interested in [Bishop Reverdy Cassius] Ransom, you really need to read the book.  He was--I told Mack [Williams' husband, McDonald Williams], I said you know, "I thought I knew him, but all of the things I read in that book, he was just so far ahead of his times."  I knew he started Institutional Church in Chicago [Illinois] because he was interested in providing not only a spiritual refuge for people, but he thought that you needed to minister to the whole person.  You may know that he was a good friend of Jane Addams of Hull-House in Chicago, the great sociology--social worker, and I think he got the idea from that.  And so everywhere he pastored he tried to do more than just preach; he tried to minister to whatever needs there were.  He got people interested in voting.  When he moved to New York [New York] and started a church there he ultimately ran for Congress, and he was interested in politics and just, just all kinds of things.  William E. Du Bois made the statement, after he heard him deliver a speech at Harpers Ferry [West Virginia], that that was really the speech that sparked the organization of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].
Speaker 2: His famous speech on John--
Speaker 1: Famous--
Speaker 2: --on John Brown.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Spoke at Faneuil Hall in Boston [Massachusetts] several times, yeah.  But he was a man has walked the grounds at Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], and students were able to hear him in chapel.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I remember after the split, he came to chapel one morning and he said, "Children of the morning, what can I say to you?"  And he was really dramatic anyway.  And he went on to say, in essence, that this just will always be a Wilberforce.  And when I was in a trustee meeting just recently, and we were talking about our financial problems, I said, "Hey, this will always be a Wilberforce."
Story_ID: 179564
Speaker 1: Now, this is a good time to talk about--give us some history of Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  Wilberforce has been called the oldest black college in the United States.
Speaker 2: It's the oldest black private co-educational college in the United States, owned and controlled by black people.  Now Lincoln University [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] was founded in 1854, but it was not founded by black people, and it was--it ultimately became a state institution.  It started out as a school for men.  I think it's co-educational now, Cheyney [University of Pennsylvania], in [Cheyney] Pennsylvania, I think the date the use is 1834, but here again, this was state.  But this was, we, we claim to be the oldest private school, co-educational.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, and it was named Tawawa has to do with the Tawawa Springs.
Speaker 2: Tawawa Springs, right.  That, that was the original name of the community was called Tawawa Springs, when Wilberforce University was organized.  And you know it's named for William Wilberforce, the, the great abolitionist, English abolitionist.  Incidentally, a group of trustees went to Hull, England in 1992 to give a posthumously grieve to William Wilberforce, and my husband [McDonald Williams] I went with them.  And that was really an experience.  William Wilberforce's family gave the family Bible to Wilberforce, so it is used every year for commencement.  When we have the commencement procession, somebody comes in and brings the Wilberforce Bible so that the scripture can be read from it.
Speaker 1: Now Wilberforce is considered the leading abolitionist from Britain I guess who--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --was able to end the slave trade in--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --in Britain--
Speaker 2: In 18--if my--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --husband were in here, he would tell you the date, and the time, and the place, and everything else.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Eighteen thirty-three [1833], Mack [McDonald Williams]?
Speaker 1: That's it.
Speaker 2: MCDONALD WILLIAMS:  For what, dear?
Speaker 1: That's it (laughter).
Speaker 2: Abolition of the slave trade.
Speaker 1: MCDONALD WILLIAMS:  Eighteen thirty [1830].
Speaker 2: Eighteen thirty [1830].
Speaker 1: Okay, we're off by three years.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he knows it all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he does not--if you ask him anything, he will not tell you anything modern.  His frame of reference is something that happened four to four or five hundred years ago.  He's really the one you ought to be interviewing.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, well, Wilberforce was, you know, purchased by the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church.
Speaker 2: The A.M.E. church.
Speaker 1: And the A.M.E.--
Speaker 2: It has been--
Speaker 1: --church's tradition, too, as you, as you re--kind of alluded to when you talked about the speeches of Reverdy--and the activities of [Bishop] Reverdy [Cassius] Ransom.  Tradition is social activism growing out of--
Speaker 2: Well, growing out of our founding really.  You know the story of the founding of the A.M.E. church.  Richard Allen walked out of St. George's Methodist Church in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] because he and Absalom Jones were asked to get up off of their knees at the communion table.  And he said--Absalom Jones was the one actually who said, "Wait until the prayer is over, and we will trouble you no more."  So they went out and he--Absalom Jones subsequently went to the Episcopal church, but Richard Allen formed, organized the A.M.E. church.  And our home church is Mother Bethel [A.M.E. Church] in Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Richard Allen is buried in the basement of that church.
Speaker 1: And then that was--
Speaker 2: It's only historical places of--places to visit in Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Right, you know, the early black conventions were always held in A.M.E. church in those days, you know.
Story_ID: 179565
Speaker 1: So when you got to Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], Wilberforce was doing fairly well, I guess, but it was, it experienced some trouble later on.  But I guess, guess we'll, we'll get to that when we get back to--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --to, to, to the '40s [1940s].  We'll talk about that, but that's a big part of the story I guess.  But, okay, so when you were in, in school at Wilberforce, what activities were you engaged in, in school.  I know you, you, you were involved I plays, I know, right?
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, and I was president of the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association].  I was edit--associate editor of our yearbook.  I was editor of our school newspaper.  I was the big chum.  I was president of my dormitory.
Speaker 1: What's the big chum?
Speaker 2: These were, there's a group of girls that the dean of women would choose to mentor the freshmen when they came in, and that was the big thing, "Who was gon' be a big chum next year?"  So I was president of the spectator's club, which was a literary club we had on campus, under the auspices of the head of the English department.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you talked about Woodson's--Grace Woodson, who was a daughter of George F. Woodson, who for, I guess, thirty years was the dean of Payne Theological Seminary [Wilberforce, Ohio].  Grace Woodson was a moving spirit on that campus.  With a (unclear) work.  And she was, she was one of my favorite people on campus.
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned off camera before we started that you knew Hallie Q. Brown.
Speaker 2: Hallie Q. Brown was, she was a lecturer by the time I got to Wilberforce because, you know she was quite elderly.  And she lectured on allocution periodically and did lectures for the English department, lyceum features.  Well, she was quite a fixture on our campus, lived across the street in a little cottage called Homewood Cottage.
Speaker 1: Right, and that, that's from--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that cottage she wrote--
Speaker 2: Wrote 'Homespun Heroines.'
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Pinned pictures of the pioneers--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --of Wilberforce and 'Tales My Father Told.'
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we, we, you know, everybody revered her.  We looked at Emery Hall.  You know, the story was that Hallie Q. Brown went to England and performed before Queen Victoria and impressed so many people over there that a woman whose name was Kezia Emery gave her enough money so that she could--Emery Hall could be built, which was a boy's dormitory on our campus, right there next to the library.  And you know, we didn't have many buildings on the church side.  There was Emery Hall, the library--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Carnegie Library.
Speaker 2: --Carnegie Library, and Shorter Hall.
Speaker 1: Now Shorter Hall is, has a history in--
Speaker 2: Shorter Hall was the heart of the university, president's office, the dean's office, the dean of women, the dean of men, classrooms and dormitories, dining room, bookstore.
Speaker 1: It's a huge stucco building.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, white--
Speaker 2: I lived in--
Speaker 1: --painted white.
Speaker 2: I lived in one, the same room for three years, 323 on the back.  And nobody wanted to live on the back, but you got the view of all of the trees and hills in the back.  And my roommate, I had the same roommate for four years.  And the, the, the matron just had to force us to move down.  She said you can't stay up here.  This is a floor for freshmen and sophomores.  We'd been up on that floor for three--didn't not want to move.  But my senior year we moved down to the second floor.
Speaker 1: And that row in the back they call the backbone, devil's backbone.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, which led to Antioch [Ohio].
Speaker 1: Right, right, Yellow Springs [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Yellow Springs.  Now you know, when you go around that road now, it's just really--nobody thought anything about it in those days 'cause there were not many cars.  But it's just a real tricky road.  We actually had a student who got killed on that road while I was a faculty member there.  It's--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's very dangerous, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, very dangerous.
Story_ID: 179566
Speaker 1: At Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] you majored in?
Speaker 2: I majored in English.
Speaker 1: English, okay, all right, and so you go on to take, you know, speech.  I mean you, you, you, you receive your Ph.D. later on in--
Speaker 2: In speech--
Speaker 1: --in speech, yeah.
Speaker 2: --rhetoric and public address.
Speaker 1: Were, were you influenced at all by, by Hallie Q. Brown and your mother [Jamye Harris Coleman] and other people that, that you knew that were involved in--
Speaker 2: Well, I, you know, I--
Speaker 1: --rhetoric.
Speaker 2: My mother starting me to speak when she had to stand me up on a table and teach little speeches that I would say.  I learned the, all the books in the Bible when I was eight or nine years old.  And you know, they'd, they'd call on me, "She's gonna recite the books in the Bible."  And I would recite 'em according to categories, and then do all the New Testament, all the--this was my mother's influence.  And so I guess maybe the fact that I, you know, have done a lot of speaking in my life really stemmed from the fact that she started me out very early.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It didn't hurt, I guess, to run into people like Hallie Q. Brown and others.
Speaker 2: I don't think she had any particular influence on me.  It was really my mother's influence.  Yeah, it was really my mother's influence--
Story_ID: 179567
Speaker 1: There any incidents in college [at Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio] that really stand out as, as, as important that you, that, that you wanna tell us about, any, any good stories?
Speaker 2: There was a peace movement during my years in college.  And I can remember Dr. Gilbert Jones, who was a former president of Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], taking a group of us, and I can't even remember what white college it was, so that we could work with these students in the peace movement.  We had International Day at Wilberforce every February 12th.  And students from all over other colleges in the state would come--
Speaker 1: This--
Speaker 2: --University of Cincinnati [Cincinnati, Ohio], International Day--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and there would be speakers and no school that day.  That was an important day.  Founder's Day was always an important day at Wilberforce, and here again, the preachers all came back.  And of course there were the usual activities.  All of the sororities and fraternities gave plays, and where you had an opportunity to act also.
Speaker 1: Now did you join a sorority?
Speaker 2: I joined Delta [Sigma Theta Sorority].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And as the member of the Pyramid Club, we put on a play called 'The Mystery of the Masked Girl,' which I produced.  Many a times later, when I taught at Edward Waters [College, Jacksonville, Florida], when I taught at Shorter [College, Little Rock, Arkansas], I still remember that play, and I used to use it, 'The Mystery of the Masked Girl.'
Speaker 1: 'The Mystery of the Masked Girl?'
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was that about?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) A play with nothing but girls in it.  And somebody has committed a murder in it and trying to find out who it was, ended up being the maid that nobody would've suspected at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, well, tell us about graduation from Wilberforce.
Speaker 2: You know, Wilberforce graduations are just really events.  First of all, we march from Galloway Hall all the way down the outside walk to Shorter [Hall] and then down the walk to Shorter and Ed [Edward Smith Hall]; we separate at the fountain; and then come back together and go into Jones Auditorium.  So it's really a spectacular sight to, to behold.  Your parents are there.  My father [Frederick Douglass Coleman] and mother [Jayme Harris Coleman] and brother [Frederick D. Coleman] all came for graduation.  And, and then of course, the--it was always a sad time, because you knew that you would never see some of these people ever again.  And re--remembered that the last song we sang after the alma mater was 'God Be With You Until We Meet Again,' and then we were crying.  I'll never forget my roommate's aunt said, "Now you all have to stop crying or you're gonna start me to crying too."  But those years were really, I call 'em golden years, wonderful years.  And I still say there's no sky is blue as a Wilberforce sky, love that place, hated to leave it.  When I went back to work for fourteen years, and my husband [McDonald Williams] dragged me to Atlanta [Georgia], I nearly died.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Wanted to be buried at Tarbox, and you know where that is.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they, they now call it Massie Creek Cemetery [Cedarville, Ohio], right.
Speaker 2: Massie Creek, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right down on [U.S. Route] 42, so--
Story_ID: 179568
Speaker 1: So what, what did you do after graduation?  Now, you got an English degree and--
Speaker 2: When I graduated from Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] couldn't find a job, had planned to become a high school English teacher, could not find a job, so I went to Fisk [University, Nashville Tennessee] and got a master's degree and that was in 1939.  And then I got my first job--
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about Fisk maybe, too, 'cause this says a lot.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's just Fisk is historic too in a lot of ways.  You, you, you got--when did you receive your master's in at Fisk?
Speaker 2: English.
Speaker 1: English?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In, in--for the first time, I was able--there was--we didn't have any speech and drama courses at Wilberforce.  And I was able to get speech and drama courses at Fisk.  I had a teacher over at the little theater whose name was M. Franklin Peters.  And I had a job.  You, you know, back in those years they had a program called NYA, National Youth Administration.
Speaker 1: Right, this is during the Roosevelt--
Speaker 2: During the [President Franklin Delano] Roosevelt years, and--
Speaker 1: --New Deal.
Speaker 2: --that, that's the way we got money to go to graduate school, and I was able to get one of those scholarships.  And I could never forget, there was always four dollars and thirty-one cents left at the end of the month after the bills were paid.  We thought we were rich with four dollars and thirty-one cents.  But I went to Fisk and, and did a minor in speech and drama.  So when I eventually went back to Wilberforce, I initiated courses in speech and drama there.  But I stayed there for that year, and when I graduated I got a job at Edward Waters College in Jacksonville, Florida, which is an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] school, a junior college.  And I was all of twenty.  My students, some of 'em were about the same age I was, when I thought I was a real grownup authority.  And I can remember some of the football boys in the class talking in the back of the room. And I did not weigh a hundred pounds in those years.  And I informed them that, you know--"You know, if you could continue to talk, and I ask you leave and you do not leave, I will bodily take you out of this room."  So they always had that for a joke--"Now how she gon' bodily take us out of this room?"  But I put my--got my little bluff in.  So I stayed there for a year, then I went to Shorter College in Little Rock, Arkansas, and taught for two years, which is also an A.M.E. junior college.
Speaker 1: Named for the same Shorter that that Shorter Hall is--
Speaker 2: That's right--
Speaker 1: --name for.
Speaker 2: --James A. Shorter, one of our bishops.  I had made an application to teach at Wilberforce, I think, when I got my master's degree.  And Dr. Walker, who was a president at the time, said well, you know, the North Central [Association of Colleges and Schools] frowns on hiring too many of your own graduates--  And I think they still feel that way--so I couldn't get a job there.  So I just, you know, dismissed it from my mind, went back--I always, however went back to Wilberforce for commencement because my father [Frederick Douglass Coleman] was on the trustee board by this time.  So in 1942, I went, made my usual trip back to Wilberforce for commencement, with no thought in the world that anything spectacular was about to happen in my life.  And I was out on the campus with some friends, and I saw my father come down the steps of Shorter Hall, started down the walk.  And he was tipping his hat as he walked down, and people were stopping and shaking his hand all the way down the walk.  And I wondered what was going on, and when he got to me he said, "May I be the first person to congratulate you on being elected a teacher at Wilberforce University?"  So that was the year I went to Wilberforce, and that really made all the difference in my life, 'cause actually that's where I met Mack [Williams' husband, McDonald Williams].  And he--I think he told you earlier that Charles Wesley hired him.
Story_ID: 179569
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And this is Charles Wesley, Dr. Charles Wesley, who was the collaborator with Carter G. Woodson on--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --many books, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, Charles Wesley was an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] minister, had been a presiding elder in Washington [D.C.] at the same time he was dean of the graduate school at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], had been elected to the presidency of Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] ten years earlier, in 1932.  He was a candidate for the Bishopric at the 1932 General Conference, which met in Cleveland, Ohio, and lost by just a few votes.  And he was told that, you know, take Wilberforce and you know, we will bring you in the next time.  So he consented to take the job at Wilberforce.  Mrs. Wesley, so the story goes, came to Wilberforce.  Now you can imagine what, what a culture shock that had to be, leaving Washington and Howard to come to the boonies, as they call it.  I think she took one look and said, "Charles, I don't think so," so he resigned after about a month and went back to Washington.  Then ten years later they invited him and he came in 1942, which was the same year--now I had--I was hired at the same time Charles Wesley was hired.  So he really didn't have anything to do with my being hired.  Trustee boards don't operate today the way they operated then.
Story_ID: 179570
Speaker 1: Shall I tell this interesting story about how I got hired [at Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio], Mack [McDonald Williams]?
Speaker 2: MCDONALD WILLIAMS:  Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Yes, I, I say yes (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: If it's interesting, that's what we--
Speaker 2: My father [Frederick Douglass Coleman] was a trustee and a man who later became a bishop in the church, Frank Madison Reid, who was one of his friends and a co--a pastor down in Kentucky, they were seated together.  And the report was made that there was a vacancy on the faculty.  Now, nobody thought about what the vacancy was in, just there was a vacancy on the faculty.  And Frank Reid said to my father, "Well, this would be a good time for us to get little,"--they all called me Little Jamye. "This is a good time for us to get Little Jamye at Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio]."  So he made the motion that I would be hired, somebody second it, and it happened.  So that's the way I got hired.  When Dr. [Charles] Wesley got to Wilberforce and discovered that I had been hired in place of somebody who had left the school--the person who had left was in science, and I was in English, and in his judgment, he did not have any need for another English, because he had hired McDonald Williams, who I later married, so this is a real joke in our family.  Mack says I came to Wilberforce in the back door and that he was hired legitimately.  So Dr. Wesley wrote--now mind you, after we got--my father was great on public relations.  So the Pittsburgh Courier and the national paper, everybody had carried the news that I was gonna be a new teacher at Wilberforce.  Then I get this letter from Dr. Wesley saying that he's very sorry, but that, you know, he could not honor that because the person I was to replace was not in English but was in science.  And they didn't have any need for an English teacher.  Well, my father was just outraged so he called Frank Reid, and they talked backwards and forwards.  And finally--here again, Bishop Ransom interacts in my life.  They, they called Bishop [Reverdy Cassius] Ransom, and so Bishop Ransom talked to Dr. Wesley.  And he said, "We don't have anything in the budget for another English teacher," 'cause he had already hired somebody.  So Bishop Ransom simply told him, "I will raise her salary."  You know, we can't embarrass our A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] preacher's daughter.  So that's the way I went to Wilberforce.  Mack says the back door.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they should be very glad because I worked very hard after the split (laughter) to help keep the, the ship afloat.
Speaker 1: Now be, before we get into this split, was there any other, are there any other stories that, that you can tell us about, days at Wilberforce?
Speaker 2: Forty-two [1942] to '47 [1947], the school was booming, large enrollment.  In fact, the enrollment got so large that we had--they had to house students in the balcony of Shorter Hall.  They had to create areas as so the girls could live there we had so many students.  It was really on its way to being, you know a, a great institution.
Speaker 1: So what happened in, in that, that period of time?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, there'd always been a rocky relationship between the church and the state.  The state came into Wilberforce University in 1887.  The statement was that we have come to help a struggling institution.  They came to help, so they put in what they call the Industrial Arts Department.  And they paid the teachers at Wilberforce University to do the liberal arts work.  So they had--this is the only time, I think, you had a case where a state institution had a contract with a private church school and was paying the fac--they, they call it clock hours.  So for whatever number of hours that they, they taught these courses in English, all the liberal arts courses, they were, the university was paid.  It was an uneasy relationship a number of times because frequently politicians would get involved in it and say, you know, that, you know, the state ought to take it over.  And so you, you had that kind of situation periodically, but it really did not come to a head until about 1946, when the rumor got out that there was gonna be a bill introduced in the legislature which would give the State of Ohio, the board, the authority to elect the president of Wilberforce University.
Story_ID: 178366
Speaker 1: Okay, so the, the state [of Ohio] was subsidizing part of the program at Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: And now they're trying to overreach their bounds and--
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: --get involved in the governance of Wilberforce.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, Dr. [Charles] Wesley, people were not sure how much a part of this was he was.  The key figures in that were Ray Hughes, who was a politician, and Wilber Paige was a Baptist minister in Cincinnati [Ohio].
Speaker 1: Ray Hughes was a black politician in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, at--
Speaker 1: --in Ohio?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Was he from Dayton [Ohio] or, or--
Speaker 2: I wanna say Columbus [Ohio].  I don't--
Speaker 1: Columbus, okay.
Speaker 2: --I don't, can't recall.  Ray Hughes and Wilber Paige were the two key people, Wilber Paige, pastor of Baptist church in Cincinnati.  It was just, it was just a lot--I, you know, I guess a lot of personal animosities that had built up against the, you know, the bishops of the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church and Wilberforce, and, and so these, they, they were introducing this bill.  They, they had a state board.  You know, all, all along the state had really accommodated the university because they had allowed the bishop of the district to appoint two or three members on a nine member state board.  So in reality, they were just cooperating.  At this point, they had changed gears and, and this--they had a joint Wilberforce, I mean church state board, and that board was going to really elect the president of Wilberforce.  Well, this was the rumor leading up to commencement of 1947.  And by this time, the Frank Reid I mentioned had become a bishop in our church.  He was also a good friend of Charles Wesley.  Both of them were from Louisville, Kentucky.  And so when he got to the campus and was told what was in the works, he said well, I'll go over and talk to Dr. Wesley.  He went over to the president's home, which is old Scarborough House, great big white house in the middle of the campus.  And Mrs. Wesley escorted him in and told him to be seated, that Dr. Wesley would be in with him in a moment.  And he waited for forty-five minutes and Dr. Wesley never came, so he got up and left.  Well, you don't do that to one of our bishops.  So that confirmed in his mind that Wesley did wanna just talk about it.  That's the reason he didn't come and have this conversation.  So when the board met on a Tuesday morning, they fired Dr. Wesley and gave him twenty-four hours to get his things out of the office.  And this is two days before commencement.  Now if they had asked for some advice from somebody in communication, I would have suggested to them that they have a board meeting in July, as they frequently had called me.  And I think if you have the authority to do something that's fine, but there's a way to do it, and that was not the way to do it, as events have proved, because he was a popular president.  We had just built the student union building, the Stubb.  It was gonna be dedicated on commencement day, and twos--two days before commencement the president is fired.  The students [at Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio] were in an uproar.  The faculty was in an uproar.  Half of the people in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church were divided because he [Charles Wesley] was a--he was popular with A.M.E., mind you, he was an A.M.E. preacher an A.M.E. presiding elder--almost a bishop in our church.  So there was a great deal of sympathy for him and what had happened.
Story_ID: 178367
Speaker 1: So on commencement day, Lester Granger, who was then head of the [National] Urban League, was the commencement speaker.  It was, it was an awful commencement.  Half the students wouldn't put their caps and gowns on.  And finally we got everybody--they, they burned Bishop [Reverdy Cassius] Ransom, an effigy, the night before on his lawn too.  So when we got to commencement it was just a very unhappy event.  The choir sang 'My God and I,' and Dr. [Charles] Wesley got up and asked them to sing it again.  And then he recounted what had happened, and he said however--and all of this is documented in the history of the A.M.E. church by Howard Gregg, the whole commencement essay, his, his speech to the group, to the people that day indicating that the A.M.E. church has made a mistake, and he hoped that they would see--soon understand that, and that they would--that he would be back in Shorter Hall on that stage.  In the meanwhile, he was moving to Bundy Hall where the state would support him in starting a school, that summer school would start, and all the faculty members who wanted to come with them that they were welcome to come.  He took with him all of the files of the faculty out of the president's office except one, and that was mine.  I'm dyed in the wool of A.M.E., and anybody who knows me knows that I'm not going anywhere that, where the A.M.E. is involved.  They took Mack's [McDonald Williams] file over there, everybody's file left, except mine.  It was amusing though.  When the new president came in, that was the only, it was the only faculty file he had, was mine.  So then Wesley went across the campus and started summer school.  Mind you, all of the applications that had come into the school during that spring had come into Wilberforce University [Wilberforce, Ohio].  They took all of those records.  They intercepted the students when they came to school in the fall.  They did everything.  Now I, you know, I can understand Dr. Wesley's bitterness, but I do not understand his desire to kill Wilberforce.  I mean that went, went too far, and then to intercept students who were going to Wilberforce.  They, they met them at the bus station and took them over to what was then--see, they didn't have a name.  He tried to call it Wilberforce State.  They had just built a natatorium, a--
Speaker 2: A pool.
Speaker 1: --pool, and had put up on there, 'Wilberforce State Natatorium.'  If they had been able to keep that name, Wilberforce University would have gone out of existence.  We could not have fought the state, if they had had the name.  So we had to go to court.  And I think Mack told you that one of our friends did the research and dis--because Wesley's contention was that the, Wilberforce took its name from the community; and therefore, his school had as much right to use Wilberforce State as we had to use Wilberforce University.  And when the, when the proof came in, it was that the community, the village, had taken its name from Wilberforce University.  So we went to federal court in Columbus [Ohio].  I have a picture of Dr. Charles Leander Hill, who was the president, Dr. James Robinson, the dean, Mack and me, standing on the steps of the capitol right after the decision was rendered saying that they could not use our name.  So eventually they came up with the name Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  So that's a, that's that story.
Story_ID: 178368
Speaker 1: Did your husband [McDonald Williams]--now, now you all got, met and got married during that--between--
Speaker 2: We met in 1942 and got married in '43 [1943].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now this split occurs, and, and he's been drafted to, to service Central [State University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  And (laughter) did--
Speaker 2: Well, he, he--
Speaker 1: --did he, he--
Speaker 2: --he, he--they took all of--
Speaker 1: They move--
Speaker 2: --from, from--but the pe--all the people didn't go.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, they didn't go.  They didn't go.  We still had many loyal people who stayed with the university [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  Milton S. J. Wright, the economist; Geraldine Jackson, Isabel Askew, all the people who'd been teaching liberal arts courses stayed, you know.  But we had--the, the people over on the state side were in the College of Education and Industrial Arts.  The music department was there.  Leontyne Price came to Wilberforce and was there for--she was one of my students as a freshman.  You know who I'm talking, don't you?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the great opera singer--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that's right.
Speaker 2: And she went--she graduated from Central State because the music department was on the state side.  But she did her first three years at Wilberforce University.
Story_ID: 178369
Speaker 1: Leontyne Price, what, what was she like in, in college [at Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Could sing.  Every time you looked up, she was on the stage of Jones Auditorium, and they featured her in 'Porgy and Bess.'  And when Mack Green, who was head of the Physical Education Department over on the State side [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio], was a good friend of Paul Robeson, and he, he was interested in Leontyne's career and had Paul Robeson to let her appear on--at the auditorium in Dayton [Ohio] when Paul came there for a concert.  So that helped her along.  And then she went there, from there to Juilliard [School, New York, New York], and of course the rest is history, yeah.
Speaker 1: When did she perform the concert in Dayton with Paul Robeson?
Speaker 2: Probably about 1948.
Story_ID: 178370
Speaker 1: How did Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] do?  I mean I, I know it was a struggle, right, from--
Speaker 2: It was, it was a real struggle.  I aged ten years the first year.  But I really, I really--Wilberforce is a magnificent obsession with me.  Every time we talk about money, my first thing is if I ever get any money, first thing, first person who's gonna get some is Wilberforce.  I went to Chicago [Illinois] one year to the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] convention.  And they were giving prizes at the Life Membership Luncheon and I won two or three things.  And so when I went to Donna [Williams]'s house, she said, "Mama, you been so lucky, maybe you ought to buy a lottery ticket and win some money for Wilberforce."  Well, as you can imagine, I won fifty-four dollars.  But Donna had heard me talk so much about Wilberforce that for a Christmas present one year she gave me two Lotto tickets a year, a week for a year, saying if you can win, you can have some money to put this building up at Wilberforce, so.   We do have, have established a fund, a scholarship fund, for Wilberforce and Payne [Theological Seminary, Wilberforce, Ohio] that is located in The Community Foundation of Middle, Tennessee, in Nashville, where I'm a member of the board of trustees.  So it really is a special place for me, always has been.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, now you, you stayed at Wilberforce until--
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-six [1956].
Speaker 1: 1956, okay.
Speaker 2: Would have stayed forever, didn't wanna leave.  My husband--we were managing on a shoestring because many times the school didn't have enough money to give you your full check.  You might get a half of check, and then you'd get the half check later.  Women make due, but my husband believes a man ought to provide for his family.  We didn't have a home, so he decided--he got an offer to go to Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia] as head of the English department.  And I'm telling you, that was the worst thing that I thought could have ever happened.  First place, I didn't wanna go south, number one.  Number two, I didn't wanna leave Wilberforce, but I did in 1956.  I remember Bishop R. R. Wright called me up on night at midnight after I had moved to Atlanta [Georgia].  He said, "I just had to call and ask you how in the world did you ever leave Wilberforce?"  And I said, "Well, Mack said he was leaving Wilberforce and you know, I could come with him or I could stay, so I didn't have any--much choice."  So we went to Morris Brown for two years, and it turned out to be two great years.  And then he got an offer to come--to go to Tennessee State.  And we moved to Nashville in 1958 and stayed there for--he taught--he was head of the, the honors program there for twenty-two years, taught for thirty year.  I taught there for twenty-nine years.  I was head of the communication department for fourteen, so that was our career.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Forty-eight years.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Story_ID: 178371
Speaker 1: And when you got to Nashville [Tennessee], it was right on the cusp of the Civil Rights--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --Movement, making national news.  And it wasn't too long after you got there that the, the sit-in movement--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --really jumped off in--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --Nashville, right?
Speaker 2: Well, before we left Atlanta [Georgia], I was advisor for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Youth Council here in Atlanta.  And so there was stirrings about that because Ruby Hurley, who was a southeast regional director for the NAACP, was in Birmingham, Alabama.  And they were trying to get hold of her records.  So she left Birmingham and came to Atlanta.  Even here, there was a judge whose name was Judge [Durwood T.] Pye.  And when you interview Donald Hollowell, who was a civil rights attorney, who was [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]'s attorney, I can never forget the day that he went before Judge Pye in a court, in the court here, relative to whether or not the secretary of the NAACP would, was gonna give up her records.  Her NAACP rolls, they're closely guarded.  They were in those days.  Because people took out--there were repercussions, especially for people that work in public schools.  And a lot of people wouldn't join the NAACP for that reason.  We went to Judge Pye's court, and it was so crowded that he said, "All of you can't find seats you'll have to go out."  And it was just almost like a miracle.  People started moving over, and everybody who was standing, you know, we just crowded in, and everybody got seats, and we were able to watch Donald Hollowell.  And I really hope he's able to talk to you because he has a great story to tell about his days with Martin Luther King, his helping to get Hamilton Holmes and [HM] Charlayne Hunter-Gault in the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia], life was in danger many times.  He's written a book [sic] called 'The Sacred Call,' ['The Sacred Call: A Tribute to Donald L. Hollowell-Civil Rights Champion,' by Louise Hollowell and Martin C. Lehfeldt.'] which you also ought to read, 'The Sacred Call,' by Donald Hollowell.
Story_ID: 178372
Speaker 1: Okay, now, at, at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], though, during those early '60s [1960s], James Lawson was on campus, right?  Do, do you remember him and some of the messages?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I just got through introducing James Lawson at an anniversary celebration in Nashville [Tennessee] just before I left, in fact it was in October of last year.  He was brought back along, and, and there was a man there who worked with him, [William] Bill Barnes, who was a white minister pres--pastor of the United Methodist church there.  And they had the two of them on a panel to talk about the Civil Rights Movement.  And they asked me to set the stage for it to, you know, tell me my experiences leading up to that.  So, but [James] Jim Lawson was the person who taught the nonviolent method to the students.  And he did that at two churches, at First Baptist Church Capitol Hill [Nashville, Tennessee], where Kelly Miller Smith--you've heard of him?  He was--
Speaker 1: Kelly Miller Smith--
Speaker 2: Kelly--
Speaker 1: --I've heard of Kelly Miller, but--
Speaker 2: Well, Kelly Miller Smith--
Speaker 1: --Kelly Miller Smith--
Speaker 2: Kelly Miller Smith was pastor of First Baptist Church Nashville, was a leading spirit in the Civil Rights Movement there, president of Nashville Christian Leadership Council, which was a subsidiary of SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Council], was the former president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  His daughter was one of the first persons to attempt to integrate the schools in Nashville.  Jim Lawson was at his church and was at Clark Memorial [United Methodist Church, Nashville, Tennessee], where they taught the students a nonviolent method.  They, these students actually tried this out prior to the Greensboro [North Carolina] students in February of that year.  Before Christmas they decided they were going down to the ten cents store and, and try the sit-ins.  It didn't work very well, but I think maybe they, if history is accurate, they were really the first persons.  But after the Greensboro incident, they were really ready, and the sit-in movement started in, really in full in Nashville.
Speaker 1: Okay, some of the other students there, Diane Nash and--
Speaker 2: Diane Nash, [HM] James Bevel--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, Bevel.
Speaker 2: Bernard Lafayette, who later became president of American Baptist Coll--He was here just recently.  There was a showing of 'This Far by Faith,' the series that is being done on--
Speaker 1: DONNA WILLIAMS:  PBS [Public Broadcasting Service]
Speaker 2: --on PBS, 'Forgotten Heroes and Heroines of the Civil Rights Movement.'   And Bernard was there--
Speaker 1: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 2: --so was [HM] C. T. Vivian--
Speaker 1: That's right, right.
Speaker 2: --that night, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, there was just a galaxy of people there that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --were involved.  Even [HM] Nikki Giovanni was there at one point at, at Fisk.
Speaker 2: She came to Fisk a little after the movement.  She wasn't involved in the movement.  Fisk student, Diane, was the leader.
Speaker 1: Oh, Diane Nash, yeah, by all means.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was really, she was really the one that put the courage into the students, had no fear at all on the outside.  But she said she was terrified every time she went out, but she, but she was able to keep going.  And some of the things she did it's just a wonder that her, you know, her life was in danger many a time; it's a wonder she survived.  They had them all, 'The Children'--you read the book 'The Children?'
Speaker 1: David Halberstam.
Speaker 2: Right, David and the children came back to Fisk about three years ago and did a forum, recounting their--the Civil Rights Movement for them.
Story_ID: 178373
Speaker 1: Yeah, the, the Freedom Rides were really the--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --scariest part of it [the Civil Rights Movement], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, definitely.  I was advised for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Youth Council during those years.  Now, that, the Youth Council is comprised of high school students.  And they wanted--my daughter [Donna Williams] was the treasurer.  Another young woman, Ceresa [ph.] Whitaker, who was at that time a student at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], was the president.  And they wanted to get involved, do some protesting.  So Avon Williams, who was the Thurgood Marshall of Nashville, civil rights attorney, fearless, just took on everybody and anybody about anything, head of a group called the Tennessee Voter's Council, which was a nonpartisan group that endorsed candidates, statewide candidates.  And we had people, whenever there was a senatorial race or gubernatorial race, the candidates came before Tennessee Voter's Council to get our endorsement.  And Avon, they came hat in hand, and Avon treated them like they had hat in hand, questioned them closely on what their position was going to be relative to black people, and really tough--great spirit in that movement.  I called him and I told him and I told him, I said you know, "The Youth Council students want to stage a protest in front of Hill's Grocery Store," which was a grocery store in my neighborhood that did not hire black people.  He said, "Well, I don't think they ought to do that, unless you can get some of the college students to go with them," said, "I wouldn't like for them to be out there alone."  So [HM] James Bevel, and Bernard Lee, and [HM] John Lewis, who's now a congressman, came to our house.  And, and they took our high school students and they marched up and down in front of Hill's and protested all of one Saturday, 'cause they wanted to be a part of it.
Speaker 1: I got two questions.  The NAACP Youth groups--
Speaker 2: Council.
Speaker 1: --Council--always pops up as a catalyst for the sit-in movement and, and other actions that are taken against discrimination in various cities.  And, and they sometimes are, are not--they kind of shake up the national NAACP in those days, because they really didn't necessarily want them to do some of the things they did.  We, we interviewed [HM] Ron Walters, who was in Wichita [Kansas], who was a head--president of the NAACP Youth Council, who stayed the first sit-in in Wichita, which he says is the first sit-in ever (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh really?
Speaker 1: Yeah, here it is, those are--there are about three or four people say they had the first sit-in.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: Well, there are people all over the country who had--I mean the, the movement was, was in the minds of a lot of people.
Speaker 1: But it seems clear that it's all being generated from the NAACP Youth Coun--Youth Councils and (unclear).  So do you have a, a sense of, of--
Speaker 2: Well, I think, I think the reason why the--why you have that dichotomy is that, you know, as we grow older, we're more cautious.  And you know, I've frequently talked to people about Aristotle's concept of youth, middle age, and old age.  And there's just a difference among us.  When we're young, we're enthusiastic; we are idealistic; we don't have any fears.  The older you get, the more cautious you get, except those of us who remain young at heart.  And that would mean that the older generation would be less likely to make these great moves than the young people.  The young people, you know, let's go full speed ahead.  And that happened, that happened even in national (unclear).  It happened with SNCC and the older people, even with Martin Luther King.  I mean they've tried to slow the kids down.  But see, young people don't have any fears and you know, if they get an idea in their heads they're ready to go full speed ahead.  So I think it's just in the nature of the age differential that accounts for that.
Story_ID: 178374
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I wanted to ask you another question about another personality from, from Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  Did you meet Charles S. Johnson by any chance?
Speaker 2: Charles S. Johnson became president of Fisk after I was there.  I got an interesting story about him, though.  He was on the board of the Rosenwald Foundation.  And this was one of the foundations back in those years that gave help to graduate students.  When I was a young woman, you know, you didn't just necessarily talk to people you didn't know.  I rode from Louisville, Kentucky to Nashville [Tennessee] on the train in the seat beside Charles Johnson, with never a word.  And this man, mind you, could have--I had already made an application to Rosenwald Foundation, you know, never--I guess maybe we said, "Hello, how are you," and that was it.  When we got to Nashville--and my father [Frederick Douglass Coleman] was always standing there at the steps when I got off the train to meet me--and when I got off and, and Charles S. Johnson off behind, he and my father greeted each other warmly because they knew each other, and I said I blew that one.  But Charles S. Johnson was the first black president of Fisk and is really revered there.  There's a building named for him, and his descendants frequently come back for our commencement exercises, yeah.
Speaker 1: He's one of the pioneer black sociologists I guess too.
Speaker 2: What did you say, Mack?
Speaker 1: MCDONALD WILLIAMS:  Pat Gilpin is doing a biography (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, there is a new biography that's gonna come out on Charles S. Johnson in the fall, written by one of our good friends, a young white man whose name is Patrick Gilpin.  Patrick Gilpin came to Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee] as a Woodrow Wilson intern.  There were three young people who came.  And President [Walter S.] Davis, at that time was thinking of organizing an honors program and put them in charge of it.  After the first year, two of the youngsters went back to finish that graduate work.  Pat Gilpin stay on and asked Mack to be his co-director.  Then he decided to go to Vanderbilt [University, Nashville, Tennessee] to get a, a history degree.  We had a hard time with Pat.  Pat really did not understand that he was not black.  And Vanderbilt was, still is, quite discriminatory in his treatment of people, not only blacks, but the Jewish people have problems there too.  So Pat went over to Vanderbilt, and there's, there was a coach over there who was really a sacred cow.  And there was a newspaper called the 'Hustler' and something came up relative to a black player, and Pat was going to take on the establishment.  So we had to call him and tell him, "Now look, we know you're interested in helping black people.  This problem's gon' be here after you get your degree, and then if you wanna fight the civil rights battle, that will be fine."  So we (laugher), we had to tell him, "You, you can't do this.  If you wanna get a degree from Vanderbilt, you can't go over and fight the sacred cows."  But he finished Vanderbilt with a history major, later became a lawyer, worked at Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas], and is an attorney in Houston now, and has written this biography of Charles S. Johnson.  His dissertation at Vanderbilt was on Charles S. Johnson, and he's turning it into a full-length biography, which you might want to get hold of come the first of the year, I think is when it's coming out.
Speaker 1: Yes, Ma'am, now all, all these figures are so important.  I mean that's why I guess--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean all those students and Charles S. Johnson and--now, there--
Speaker 2: It's interesting how they--how Charles S. Johnson, you know, would influence people so many years later.  I mean Pat Gilpin just thinks there's no one in the world like Charles S. Johnson and what he was able to accomplish in the field.
Story_ID: 178470
Speaker 1: Tell the story of Attorney [Z. Alexander] Looby's house being bombed.
Speaker 2: Okay, Attorney Looby was--you know, during, during the movement, these students were getting, were put in jail regularly.  And the, the lawyers who argued for them would be the Z. Alexander Looby and Avon Williams.  People in the community put up their homes as, as bond to get them out.  You know, they would go to jail, and then somebody has to go and put up the bond and get them out.  And the lawyers had to go down.  So Looby was the, you know, a target by the racist element in the community.  So on the morning of April 19th they bombed his house.  His house was across the street from Meharry Medical College [Nashville, Tennessee] and blew out some of the windows there.  We lived, I guess, maybe two or three mile from there, and we could even hear the sound.  Fortunately, he and his wife were sleeping in a back room, and they were not injured, but they could have been killed.  And the whole community was just up in arms.  So the students started at Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  They galvanized the students there; they marched from Tennessee State down to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  Then they decided they were going to Pearl High School and get the high school students, something that they had never done.  They went to Pearl High School, went in and told the kids to come on out.  Mr. James--John Hull was the principal, and while he was sympathetic with the movement, he did not want to have any responsibility for his students leaving school, maybe getting hurt, maybe there parents didn't want them involved.  So he was stopping the students, you know, when they would try to leave the building to say, 'What do you think your parents would say?"  When he stopped Donna [Williams], she told him, "My parents would be most upset if I'm not in this march."  So we didn't know she was in the march.  We left Tennessee State in our car, went up to the courthouse--
Speaker 1: Talking about your daughter, Donna.
Speaker 2: My daughter.  And our first person we see is our daughter, Donna.  In fact, there is a picture on one of the covers of Time with these students snaking all the way up to the capitol, you know, and she's one among them.  So she was a part of that historic event.  And that was the day on which Diane Nash confronted Ben West, who was then the mayor, and asked him if he thought it was right for the department stores to allow people to shop there and then not allow them to eat.  And he hesitated a minute, and then he said, "No."  That just shook Nashville because that meant that, you know, here, the mayor of a city is really taking the position for these students who are demonstrating.  Following that, we had a selected--we had--well, they had really called it a boycott, and that was really what broke the back of the, the movement.  And that's what really changed everything.  And we always said it had nothing to do with people changing their hearts.  It was a matter of their pocketbooks.  Because it was prior to the Easter season, and you know back in those years everybody dressed up his child for Easter Sunday.  And the department stores were saying that that was their margin of profit.  The black people didn't go to town, and the white people were afraid to go to town 'cause they didn't know whether any violence would break out.  And the students told the black people, "If you go to town, we will take your bags away from you."  Some few people ventured up there, and they took their bags away from them.  So, it was really that, we're convinced, that really broke the back of 'em, of the demonstrations, and that the white people finally conceded that they would allow the people to go in the restaurants and other public places.  My husband [McDonald Williams] and I, and another couple, and another woman and her two sons were the first people to integrate Morrison's Restaurant in Nashville.  And a few weeks before that, the students had sat down in the street all the way across--Western Avenue is a rather wide street.  And there's a picture in the newspaper of all these students sitting down in the street.  Traffic cannot go anywhere in front of Morrison's.  And then several weeks later, when they declared that they were gonna integrate, we went there on a Sunday afternoon to be served, to test it.  We were all ND--NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] people.  And we didn't even know what time the restaurant opened, you know. We went after church.  That restaurant didn't open until 4:30, so they--we had to go back to the restaurant.  And the only thing they said to us, you can't bring a photographer in.  So we went in and nobody--it's really amazing.  You would have thought after all these years of segregation, and all the carrying on that had been going on in Nashville, and all the objections to integration that somebody would have registered something or the other when we went in.  Nobody paid us any mind.  The white people went on eating.  Nobody paid us any mind except the black waiters who were so delighted to see us.  They had these [hand pushing up]; oh, they were so happy--the, the only, only reaction we got.  And we had taken one of our, the photographer from Tennessee State.  He couldn't make pictures, and he happened to be a white guy, and nothing happened.  There wasn't, there wasn't anything to, to make a picture of; nobody paid us any mind.  By the same token, we also, the NAACP went to Centennial Park, decided we were gonna have a picnic out there, and nobody paid us any mind either, which was a public park we had been denied the access to.

Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, well, those are some exciting days at Fisk [University, Nashville Tennessee] I guess.  Any, any other stories from--
Speaker 2: In Nashville [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: --from--
Speaker 2: In Nashville.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: Yeah, really.
Speaker 1: Yeah--from Nashville?
Speaker 2: We had mass meetings every Monday night and speakers.  That's when we would hear [HM] C. T. Vivian, [HM Joseph] Joe Lowery, Kelly Miller Smith; [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] came once and spoke in Fisk gym.  And, and these were, these were people who were motivating us to, you know, keep this movement going, keep this movement going.  And the adults turned out in large numbers, not that they were involved in the demonstrations, but we were the backup.  We delivered the kids to First Baptist Church [of Nashville, Nashville, Tennessee]; you know, we, we drove them wherever they needed to go; and took up money; and people who had homes mortgaged their homes when necessary.  So the adults were the backup people in the community.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you remember any outstanding students that you had at, at--in your English classes that, that you--
Speaker 2: Wilma Rudolph.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oprah Winfrey.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee], David Evans, who is now in the Office of Admissions at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Right, he's a--
Speaker 2: Allen--
Speaker 1: --Counter.
Speaker 2: [HM S.] Allen Counter--
Speaker 1: They're, they're--
Speaker 2: --who--
Speaker 1: --explorers, right?
Speaker 2: That's right, Allen Counter, who was, who is now president of the Harvard Foundation.  These were all our students, yeah.  I went to, I went to a convention of the Speech Communication of America one year to do a presentation.  And Allen Counter and a couple of the other guys from TSU [Tennessee State University] were in the audience.  And when I got through, they came up and they just literally lifted me up to hug me.  And I got a letter later from someone at Syracuse University [Syracuse, New York] saying, "You must have been a great teacher, you know, for your students to react like that.  Would you be interested in coming here to teach?"  I said, "I don't think so."
Speaker 1: DONNA WILLIAMS:  [William] Julius Wilson.
Speaker 2: Julius Wilson, who is at--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --Harvard now.
Speaker 1: Harvard.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was at Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  He was at Wilberforce.  He went to--he got a--his mentor--
Speaker 1: In University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] too.
Speaker 2: --at Wilberforce was a man by the name of Dr. Maxwell Brooks.  And he will tell you the person who inspired him to, to do his work in sociology was Maxwell Brooks who taught at Wilberforce University.
Speaker 1: Yeah, William Julius Wilson.
Speaker 2: Will--yeah, right.

Speaker 1: Now, Oprah [Winfrey] left--was in my department at Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and left without getting her degree.  She debated about whether or not she should--this was when she took her job in Baltimore [Maryland], and she debated about whether to take the job.  And finally we said you know, this is an opportunity.  You can come back and finish college.  Her father really wasn't in favor of that, but she went on to Baltimore and then subsequently went to Chicago [Illinois].  Well, all this time, she never got--came back to finish.  And every time I would run into her father, his remark to me was, "When are you gonna make our girl come back and get her degree?"  So finally, one day I said, "Mr. Winfrey, you know people go to college to get jobs so they can make a living."  I said, "Oprah's doing fine."  "She's never gonna amount to anything till she gets that degree," he kept saying that.  So periodically I would give her a phone call and you know, say, "Oprah, you really ought to do this."  So the last time I called her, I told her, I said, "You ought to do this.  If you don't wanna do it for yourself, you do it for your father; and you also do it because magazines are printing that you are a graduate of Tennessee State, and you are not, and you don't want that."  I said, "And all you have is a three-hour course, and you need to finish it."  So I said, "You need to send me a check to register you for this course, and you need to send me a video of a documentary you have done for your senior project."  And that's when she did it, and she was invited back to be the commencement speaker in 1987, which was the year that I--'cause I kept saying, you know, "I'm getting ready to retire.  You'd better come on and do this."  She considered to be the commencement speaker, but in the meanwhile, she was interviewed by some magazine.  I think it was 'Redbook.'  And she made comment that she hated college.  Well, the TSU [Tennessee State University] students were up in arms 'cause that meant she hated TSU, so they didn't want her to deliver the commencement address.  And we had to--I--the president of the student council, and the president of Mack [McDonald Williams]'s honor's program, and a member of my department--what was Greg's last name?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Carr.
Speaker 1: Greg Carr.
Speaker 2: Greg Kimathi Carr; I know him.
Speaker 1: You know Greg Carr?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's at, he teaches at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] now, yeah.
Speaker 1: He's, he's at Howard now.
Speaker 2: Dr. Greg Carr.
Speaker 1: I called Greg and I said, "Greg,"--he was one of the main ones, carrying on about we need to uninvited her.  I said, "You don't have the authority to uninvited her 'cause you didn't invite her, Commencement Committee invited her."  So I said, "Greg, let me tell you, you, you better keep the students in line because I'm gonna tell you, none of you people in the speech department, communication department, will get a recommendation from anybody in this department if anything happens on commencement day."  Now you know good and well I could not have carried that out, but I told him that, you know.  And so when commencement day came, Oprah shows up on the campus.  Mind, mind you, I'm in a tizzy because she has not shown up the day before.  Her advance people came, and one of the young women whose name was Beverly Coleman, and she said, "Don't worry, she'll be here."  She was in California shooting some movie, and so she had chartered a private plane to fly to Nashville and got there at 7:00 in the morning of commencement day.  Everybody said, "Don't worry, she'll be here."  So she came on the stage.  She knew that the students had had this feeling about what she'd said about not liking college.  So she got up and she said you know, "I know a lot of you all came here today, you know, and some of you probably said you didn't wanna come, and some of you decided to come and you said I'm just"--and she mimicked, "I'm going out there and find out there and find out what she really looks like and what she's got to say."  But before she got through with her introduction, you know, she had the audience just really mellowed out and really delivered a speech which was more like a sermon, very inspirational.  And when the president gave her her degree, she held up her diploma and said, "See, daddy, I amount to something."  Because he had been saying, "You're not gonna amount to anything till you get that degree."  So that's my Oprah story.
Speaker 2: Was Greg Carr impressed?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Everybody was impressed.  She was really good.  She was really good.  And I, and I really don't think what--she called at--shortly after the article came out in the paper.  Her favorite teacher at TSU was a man in the drama department, Mr. Dury Cox, and he was almost like a surrogate father to her.  And Mr. Cox, you know, would just talk to the kids, and they all hung out with him in, over in the, in the auditorium.  So she called one day, and I picked up the phone in my office.  "May I speak to Mr. Cox?"  I didn't recognize her voice, and I simply said, "Well, he's in class.  If you'll leave your number, I'll have him call you."  And she said, "Dr. Williams is that you?  This is Oprah."  And she said, "I know you all upset with me."  And she said, "Mr. Cox is gonna kill me," you know.  And so she went on to say that she knew people were upset about that article.  So I said I'll have Mr. Cox call you.  But she, she, she mellowed her audience out.
Story_ID: 178473
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so you're in, in Nashville [Tennessee] up until retirement?
Speaker 2: We retired in--
Speaker 1: --in Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: --nineteen--I was in--I retired in 1987, and my husband [McDonald Williams] retired in 1988.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we just stayed in--I guess we assume we're gonna live in Nashville the rest of our lives and just made a decision last--year before last that we were gonna move to Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: And you both have been showered with honors, from what I understand--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and are usually interviewed in tandem, in which we're not doing today, yeah.  But--
Speaker 2: We've, we've, we've already felt that, you know, you ought to be a part of the community, and you ought to contribute to the community.  And I guess my basic philosophy is everybody can make a difference, and everybody ought to try.  So, and we do everything together.  As a matter of fact, when the mothers were alive, they went to all of the events with us.  So we were known in the national community as Jamye, Mack, and the mothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They have their pictures over there.  And if we went someplace and they weren't with us, the people went, where are the mothers?  Dr. Humphreys, who was president of Tennessee State for about ten years, was very fond of them. And every time we had a banquet or anything, took them here, the mothers--want the other to stand up and be presented.  So he was very fond of them, 'cause they were a real part of our lives and real influences in our lives.
Speaker 1: Now one mother lived to be over a hundred, right?
Speaker 2: Mack's mother lived to be 102.  When she was 100, I have a picture, and I think it's in, in the papers I'm gonna give you when the mayor came out to our house, our house to in--to, to talk to her and declared Margaret Bigely [ph.] Williams, yeah.
Speaker 1: And your mother [Jamye Harris Coleman] lived to be--
Speaker 2: Ninety-three.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they died four years apart.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's an interesting cycle.  My, my father [Frederick Douglass Coleman] died in 1959, and he was just sixty-six.  He would have been sixty-seven.  And back then, you know, we thought that was--that was almost seventy.  And I remember saying he lived a long, full life.  And you know, I don't even remember when I was sixty-seven, it's been so long ago.  Four years later, my husband's brother died of lung cancer in 1963; four years later, my brother [Frederick D. Coleman], who was a medical doctor and a preacher, died of lung cancer in 1967.  You know, we would--when 1971 came we were scared to death something was gonna happen to one of the mothers.  The mothers went on like the brook.  But they did die four years apart, one in '82 [1982] and one in '86 [1986].
Story_ID: 178474
Speaker 1: Now you made a name for yourself as the first woman at--
Speaker 2: I was the first woman to have a major general officership at A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: And in our hierarchy we have the bishops who preside over Episcopal districts.  And we have a group of--at the time I was, thirteen general officers who are responsible for the programs of our church: one, our mission program, our education program, the Sunday School Union, which is our publishing house, Evangelism, historiographer, the A.M.E. Christian Recorder, and the A.M.E. Review, the Pension Department.  And all of these jobs had been held by males.  There had never been a woman in one of those major offices.  I ran for that office in 1984, and what was very helpful was the fact that I had--Mack [McDonald Williams] and I had taught for fourteen years at Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  So we had taught half of the bishops, people that been elected, so I had that network.  Then I had taught at these other three A.M.E. colleges, where the preachers had gone out and they were now delegates to the general conference.  So I had my students everywhere.  And so when I decided to run, you know, I got a lot of help.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I see you kind of surrounded the problem with (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I did not get, I did not get a lot--I got a lot of opposition when I tried to help a woman get elected to bishopric, had a real serious problem there.  But when I ran, my sex did not become an issue.  And I think it was because of, you know, the friendships I had with all these people and the people who had been our students.  And our students, you know, we have outlived so many of our close friends that our close friends now are people that we have taught.  They're our students who come to see us, visit with us.
Story_ID: 178475
Speaker 1: Now you were editor of the A.M.E. [Church] Review too for a long period of time now.
Speaker 2: For eight years.  That was a job to which I was elected in 1984, and I held it for eight years, until my retirement came up in 1992.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you were also instrumental in the selection of [HM] Vashti McKenzie as the first--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] woman bishop too, right?
Speaker 2: I guess maybe one of my friends put it this way, that the resolution that I introduced to the general conference was a catalyst for electing a woman.  I had, I had been the chairperson for the candidacy of William P. DeVeaux, who became a bishop in our church.  And this was the first time that a candidate for the bishopric had had a woman for a campaign manager.  And he was--he came within about thirteen votes the first time, and we do believe that he was elected, that they just took it.  And then the second time I was his co-chair he was elected.  So con--as a result, I think a lot of the people thought that, you know, I would be of some help in getting them elected.  So Vashti, on the night that [William] Bill DeVeaux was elected, when we were walking around supporting him, and I said I'm glad this is the last time I have to do this, she said oh, no, you gotta do this one more time.  You have to help me, so I said okay.  Because I had promised the women--we have an organization called Women in Ministry, and they had asked me to come to Atlanta [Georgia] to speak at a forum they had.  They, what they said to me was, "We have the woman power, but we have not been in the political structure.  So we don't know the politics and we need help, and so we want you to help us."  So I told them that I would help some women to get elected to the bishopric, and Vashti was the first person who asked me.  For the first couple of year, I mean I was talking about helping Vashti to become a bishop.  And I went to a, a convocation in Columbia, South Carolina, and she was not there.  Another young woman who was a candidate for the bishopric was there, Carolyn Tyler Guidry.  And it just, you know, the A.M.E. church gets on my mind, and I may be awake at three o'clock in the morning figuring out something we need to do in the church.  And it just came to me in the middle of the night, and my expression is the spirit led me that what I needed to do was to do a special resolution to set aside a slot for a woman.  Now my model for that was when we elected our first African bishop back in 1956 and our second African bishop in 1984, they were both elected because we set aside a slot to do that.  When we elected our first person from the Caribbean in 1972 that same thing was done.  I just took that as a kind of model and decided I would do a resolution, and take it to the general conference, put it on the floor, and have the general conference to instruct the Episcopal committee, which is the body which decides how many bishops we will elect, to instruct them that one of the persons to be elected would be a woman.  Well, I started talking about this two years before, and I--you know, you can imagine, the males discouraged me, and all my friends on the bench were discouraging--the bishops were discouraging me.  And I went to the Connectional Lay Organization, which is a big body, and we have equal representation in the general conference.  And I was able to get (unclear)--I didn't--I had one of my friends to take it to the executive committee and get it approved there.  This was a year leading up to the general conference.  And then I said well, we need it approved by the whole biennial.  So the president of the Lay Organization--I had to leave--I said, "I want this resolution approved by the whole thing."  He said, "No problem.  Just bring it to me.  I'll have it read."  And so they passed it.  Well, that really sent shockwaves to the, the bench of bishops, because here, you got a whole organization--
Story_ID: 178476
Speaker 1: I was able to get the endorsement of the Connectional Lay Organization, and the Women in Ministry were behind it.  And so, I mean I kept talking about it.  And every time I had an opportunity to make a speech--I made a speech called 'It's Time,' which was printed in the A.M.E. Review, and the whole thing set out the fact that every other major denomination had elected a woman to the bishopric except these three black Methodist groups.  And then I accused them of all kinds of things, in other words, it's time, it's time.  Two thousand year was the, I thought was the time, and that was magic for me.  When I got to the general conference in Cincinnati [Ohio] in July of 2000, one of the bishops who had been one of my students came to me and said, "You don't need to introduce the resolu--special resolution because the bishops have decided that we will not elect a woman until 2004, when we have seven or eight bishops retiring and they'll be a lot of slots."  So I just said very calmly, "That's not acceptable."  Because as a layperson they could not tell me what to do, so sending him to tell me that didn't mean anything.  I had prior to that called the person in charge of the PR [Public Relations] for the general conference and said to--his name is Mike McKinney.  I said, "Mike I wanted to have a press conference to--and have--present the women candidates and talk about my resolution when we get to the general conference."  He said, "No problem."  We got to the general conference and he came to me the second day and said, "Dr. Williams," said, "I have to tell you that some of the bishops say that if you're gonna have a press conference, they have to know what you're going to say."  So I said, "Mike, I told my husband [McDonald Williams] before I left home that I was not gonna lose my temper at this general conference," and then I lost it.  I said, "But let me tell you..." and then I went into a tirade.  "You go back and tell whatever bishops told you that, that I don't need you to call this press conference me.  I'm perfectly capable of calling it myself, but I'm gonna tell you when I have the press conference I'm gonna talk about them."  So he came back to me and said, "I made a mistake.  They thought you were gonna talk about the sexual harassment case that we have in the church."  I said, "Okay."  So he called a press conference, and one of the bishops came and sat with me.  And the candidates were there, the press was there; the New York Times picked this up, and I got a call from somebody, you know, to interview me and the wa--it was just, the only news at the general conference in the Cincinnati papers and on the television was whether or not we were gonna elect a woman to bishop.  Everything else got lost.  And the bishops were working very hard behind the scenes to see to it that we didn't do that.  So I had to say a day ahead of time--I had to make an announcement to the general conference that I had a special resolution which I would present in twenty-four hours.  I did that.  The person who gonna preside--the bishop was gonna preside--told me at midnight that when you present your resolution tomorrow, we're going to send it to the committee, committee--Episcopal committee.  We're not gonna vote on it.  Well, I--my husband tells me that I did not tell him no, that's not acceptable.  Because when the bishop got angry with me and told me I crossed him and all of that, Mack said well, you have to fair because you didn't tell him you were gonna oppose him.  I said well, I don't remember.  It was midnight and I was tired, but I do know I went upstairs and got all my data together.  When I got the floor the next day, he recognized me.  You know, if you don't have a bishop in the chair who will recognize you, you can never do anything in our A.M.E. General Conference.  Because you can stand on the floor all day long, and if, if they know you're gonna say something or bring something before them they don't wanna hear, they don't have to recognize you.  But he had said he would recognize me.  So I went down to my delegations, and he said, "I recognize Dr. Jamye Coleman Williams for her resolution."  And then I said, "I yield the floor to [HM] Reverend [Dr.] Floyd Flake, who will read my resolution."  Well, that threw shockwaves in the place, because they thought I was gonna read it--
Story_ID: 178477
Speaker 1: But when I get [HM Reverend Dr.] Floyd Flake--you know who Floyd Flake is?  He's a--
Speaker 2: Yes, Ma'am.
Speaker 1: --pastor of [Greater] Allen [A.M.E. Cathedral of New York] in Jamaica [New York, New York], one of our biggest churches, and also former congressman.  I had been saying all along to Mack [McDonald Williams], I said you know, "I don't wanna read the resolution.  I want a man to read it who has stature in the A.M.E. church, who is not a candidate, and who people will listen to."  And the bishops thought that I found him on the grounds and got him to do that.  But the truth of the matter is the prior October Floyd Flake had invited me to New York to deliver a speech for the dedication of the steeple of his cathedral.  And while we were there, he took us to one of the homes of his members for dinner, and that's, that's all I talked about.  Whenever I was, I was talking about the resolution.  I was talking about electing a woman.  That's what's all that was on my mind.  So I was talking about the resolution, and I said you know, "I really don't wanna read it.  I want a man to read it who has stature in the church and who is not a candidate."  And Floyd looked across the table and said to me, "Jamye, I'll read your resolution."  Well, he got accused of all kind of dire things, that he had connived with me on it to see that the general conference, you know, so to help give some stature to the resolution.
Story_ID: 178383
Speaker 1: Now we're at the point where [HM Reverend Dr.] Floyd Flake reads the resolution and--
Speaker 2: He read the resolution, and the bishop said that he was referring it to the Episcopal committee.  And I objected, and I gave the data on which I was objecting.  And finally, I said something which would suggest that I was really challenging his authority, like I called for a division of the house, or I made some kind of statement.  And then all the preachers started conversing--you--we don't wanna do--you don't wanna do that.  Just let it go, let it go; let it go to the committee.  Well, we let it go to the committee, so we thought, but it never--they never sent it.  And I later learned that when--can I tell this, Mack?
Speaker 1: MCDONALD WILLIAMS:  I guess so.
Speaker 2: Well, later learned that it never really--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Yes, it, it never really got to the Episcopal committee until some young man told me that it hadn't gotten there.  And I had to get it there myself.  And when the committee brought it back to the floor, they said, which was the only logical thing that they could say, that they had no jurisdiction over it, over the resolution, because the resolution said, be it resolved that the general conference instruct the Episcopal committee.  So, they, then they, the general conference had to vote on it.  And the regis--regi--resolution failed by forty-nine votes.  How many delegates did we have, maybe seventeen or eighteen hundred.
Speaker 1: So it, it came close to passing--
Speaker 2: It came close to passing.
Speaker 1: --right, pretty close.
Speaker 2: But it's really good that it didn't pass.  See, you, you know, you don't know everything.  And sometimes what you think is the best route to go is not really--it was good to do the reso--but if a resolution, if, if we hadn't had all of that publicity surrounding it--that was all that everybody was talking about, and all that the--the politics was all about the resolution.  Because if they, if they could defeat that, they thought they could defeat[HM Bishop] Vashti [McKenzie] or whoever else was running.  And they were convinced that I was doing the resolution just for Vashti, when in reality, I had told Vashti, I said, "When I do the--when I put this resolution out, it means I'm gon' have to be neutral."  So I, I didn't wear anybody's button there.  I just worked hard to try to get that resolution passed, and I knew the general conference had the ability to decide--there were two women who were running, major candidates.  They had the ability to decide which one.  And Vashti certainly had mounted a very significant campaign.  Fortunately, we had electronic voting at the general conference for the first time.  So there was no way anybody could do anything other than just, you know, you had to vote your conscience.  And after the first ballot, when the vote came in, she was second.  And all these people who had been so opposed to it were, you know, they were really in shock at this point.  So then they put together a ticket that had her on it, and she was subsequently elected.  When they got ready to vote on the resolution, do I tell this?
Speaker 1: DONNA WILLIAMS:  What they (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: DONNA WILLIAMS:  Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: When the general conference got ready to vote on the resolution, and they recognized me to say something, the people who were opposed to electing a woman began, and yelling, "We, when we don't want some (unclear) we yell no," you know, "No, no, no, and they'd boo" and you know, so you, you can't be heard.  So that's what they did.  Now, mind you, I'm standing up here, and Douglass, my grandson, was standing beside me, as I recall.  And I really wasn't aware that--I was just hoping they would stop all the noise so I could make one more appeal to get this--a woman elected.  And one of the bishops, the same one who had come to me to say we're not gonna elect a--[Bishop] Garnett Henning, got the microphone and told the people to be quiet.  "You've got to listen to this woman.  She's a matriarch."  And he just went--you know, taught all of us, did this, that, and the other.  And so everybody got quiet, and then, and I, I did make my statement.  I don't recall what I said, except I had been told since then that I made a statement that really upset them was that if they did not elect a woman, they were gon' be just like the Southern Baptist, who will not recognize a woman.  And that made folks sort of upset.  I don't remember.  I--they said I said that.  But when I went back to sit down, my grandson's wife, who has not been an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] very long, was in tears.  And I said, "Why are you crying?"  She said, "They booed you."  And I said, "They did?"  That goes with the territory.  So I got another woman coming up at the next general conference.  I guess I'll get booed again.
Speaker 1: Well, you, you're in a fight.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: You're clearly in a fight.
Speaker 2: Oh, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 178384
Speaker 1: What do you plan to do in the future?
Speaker 2: You know, I really had all these great intentions of doing some writing.  And I thought when I moved from Nashville [Tennessee] to Atlanta [Georgia]--because in Nashville my husband [McDonald Williams] and I were in a lot of things.  You know, he was on the Board of Professional Responsibility.  We were co-chairs of the Life Membership Committee for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], the Community Foundation of Middle, Tennessee, you know, just active.  So I said when I get to Atlanta, we can do some writing.  I haven't done anything since I've been in Atlanta.  So Mack [McDonald Williams] said to me today, "You know, I think we ought to give some thought to what we're gonna do."  So I hope at some point I'll be able to do some writing.
Story_ID: 178385
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, Ma'am, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: You know, I hope, first of all, that some way we can get drugs out of our community, because it is my conviction that that is what has ruined a whole generation of our young people, black and white.  And I think that the hopelessness that we see, and to an extent, a lot of the poverty has to do with the fact that there are drugs out there.  Now I was talking to some people on one of my boards in Nashville [Tennessee], and these people were of the other group.  And I said you know, "This is not gonna affect just one group of people in this country.  Because if we don't stop all of this crime, it's gon'--all of us are gonna, our lives are gonna be in danger."  So I would hope at some point we can stop that drug traffic.  I hope that the justice system will be changed so that we will not be discriminatory the way in which we sentence our black men to prison.  You know, for just a little bit of crack cocaine, you go for X number of years, but for smoking the real thing, you may not go at all.  I mean it's so much injustice and so many inequities in our country that I would hope at some point that those people of goodwill will continue to work very hard to eliminate that.  And I think as long as I'm still around, whatever I can do, where I can, I just wanna be a part of all of that.

Speaker 1: Ma'am at this point in your life, and you're still active and--
Speaker 2: Which is still growing quickly to a close (laughter).
Speaker 1: What would you see as your legacy at this point?
Speaker 2: I guess my legacy would be probably, if you wanna think of it, some things will be documented would be primarily with the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] Church, and the fact that I've been active in the A.M.E. Church for, since 1940, and that I have, in connection, I have tried to do whatever I could to improve whatever problems we had in the church.  And I think the fact that I was able to break the barrier and become the first woman general officer made it easier for us to have the first woman bishop.  And I think whatever efforts I made in that direction were, they were of some help.  So I would think that would probably be my legacy.  I guess the other part of it would be the students that, whose lives we have touched over the years, and who--we tell them who have enriched our lives so much.  So it's really a two-way street.  I mean we've had all these marvelous students, people like Greg Carr, and, and Oprah [Winfrey], and Leontyne [Price], and Wilma Rudolph, and teachers in the public school.  And I have a student, a former student now, who, who's been elected president of the Pointer Institute of Journalism down in Tampa [Florida], which is the first time a woman or a black has been--you know, so, so I, I think I take great pride in the students that I have taught, and not that I have influenced them so much, is the fact that I've been a part of their live, and they have also enriched my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's--
Speaker 2: I guess maybe I hope I have some kind of legacy with my family.  My grandson and my daughter [Donna Williams] I hope will carry on in the way I have.  My daughter has become such a great person of integrity that, you know, I just feel like it--my future is in safe hands with her.  And her son, my grandson, is an attorney here who has a great sense of values.  So I really think that I would like to think that whatever I have been able to do, and whatever I've been able to say, whatever values I've had, Mack [McDonald Williams] and I boast that because when you, when, when you--when I say, talk about myself, I really am talking about the two of us, because in every effort that I've had, you know, he's been a part of it.  We co-edited a book called 'The Negro Speaks' in 1970.  And if I write a speech, he reads it.  If he does an article, I read it.  So it's been our lives together that I think that's perhaps made the difference.
Story_ID: 178387
Speaker 1: And one last question.  It's slightly different from legacy, but we always ask it, is how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As somebody who was on the right side of the issues, who was not afraid to take positions no matter whether they were popular or not, who felt that it is very important to stand up for right no matter what.  I mean that's just what I feel.  Take on the fights.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you very much.
Story_ID: 178388
Speaker 1: Okay, on the left-hand side, that is I.  And my mother is next to me.  And that's Mack's [McDonald Williams] mother
Speaker 2: Give their names, if you--
Speaker 1: My mother's name is Jamye Harris Coleman, and Mack's mother's name is Margaret Bailey Williams, and that's Mack.  And that's Jamye, Mack, and the mothers.
Speaker 2: That's McDonald--
Speaker 1: McDonald.  Now, you know, interestingly, that picture was made about 1967, when I'd had a bout with cancer, and I thought I might not live.  And I said, "We'd better have this picture made together so that they'll have a picture of me with them."
Speaker 2: And that's Mack's mother.  And that was when she was maybe about ninety.  She was a member of the Episcopal Church, and until she died she was able to go to church and walk very straight up to the communion table.  She didn't want anybody to help her.  And she, she would--if you could see on that, how black her hair is, when she died she wasn't quite like I am at 102.
Speaker 1: And that's my mother, the poet and the playwright.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That's my mother, Jamye Harris Coleman, who lived to be ninety-three.  She was a poet and a playwright.
Speaker 2: And that's my father, Reverend F. Douglass Coleman, Sr.  The year I left Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] he was given an honorary degree from the school, and doctor of divinity degree.  And he died, he left us early, 1959.
Speaker 1: That's my wedding picture, and it was taken in St. John African Methodist Episcopal Church in Nashville, Tennessee on December 28th, 1943.  My father performed the ceremony, there between Mack and me.  And everybody on the picture is gone with the exception of that little flower girl; all of my friends are gone.
Speaker 2: And that's a picture of my daughter, Donna [Williams], who is standing on the left-hand side, and her father next to her, and I'm next to him, and then my mother is seated right in front of me, and his mother is seated right in front of him, and that is our grandson when he was a little boy.
Speaker 1: My grandson, whose name is Douglass Peyton Selby, and that is a picture of him when he got his MBA from Harvard [University,, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  He also received in addi--there's a big box in, in the dean's hand.  And it contained a, a silver tray engraved to Douglass Selby for his contributions to Harvard Business School during that year.  He's always been an activist too.  And he was concerned about the fact that there were not enough black teachers at Harvard.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: We're called the Episcopal committee of the general conference the power for the Episcopal committee because that's a committee that assigns the bishops to their districts and passes on their character.  And I was a member of that committee for about twelve years, and I'm seated over here on the far right, right over there.  And I, I was young then, so I always got to sit on the front row, and I always got to march in first with the, all those men.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of my brother and me.  I was about five, and he was about three.  His name was Frederick Douglass Coleman, Jr.  And he became a doctor and a minister.
Speaker 1: This about 1923?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And that's Donna, and Mack, and me.  Is this at the wedding?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Unclear--
Speaker 1: This is when our grandson, Douglass, got married in 1995 in Minneapolis, the mother of the bride and the grandmother of the bride.  And my husband was my grandson's best man, and he is wearing a tuxedo he got married in.  And come December, we will be married sixty years, so he can still wear it.  My wedding dress I can only get my finger in.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of one of our ministers, Reverend Donald Tucker; that's Bishop Vashti McKenzie, the first woman elected a bishop in the A.M.E. Church; and that's me, and that's Mack.
Speaker 1: And that picture is taken in front of Shorter Hall at Wilberforce University in 1970, when I went back after, right after Mack and I had edited 'The Negro Speaks.'  And the alumni association was gonna push it for us.  And with us is Dr. Sherman Green, who was former secretary of education of the A.M.E. Church.  He's still alive.  He's ninety-seven.  Shorter Hall in the background.
Speaker 2: And that, now that's a picture of Mack and me when we went to Europe in 1968.  And that is in front of the Milan Cathedral.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  I was gonna say Venice, but--
Speaker 2: No, we did go to Venice.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  I'm looking at the sidewalks.
Speaker 2: About what year is this?

Speaker 1: That's a picture of me and Attorney Donald Hollowell on the occasion of their, one of their wedding--which wedding anniversary?  Fifty--

Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That's a picture of me with one of the bishops from India in Tampa, Florida, last year at the National Council of Churches meeting.  I'm a member of that general assembly.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE):  There are two people on there.
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, the other person is--you know, I can't think of his name, one of the delegates.
Speaker 2: And that picture was made shortly after the Connection Lay Organization introduced a special resolution to launch my candidacy for the A.M.E. Church Review.
Speaker 1: And that is the day I was installed as a general officer in July of nine--that's the, July 1984.
Speaker 2: And that's a picture of Mack and me with our first great-granddaughter, Jamye.
Speaker 1: And this was me and Jamye.
Speaker 2: And that's a picture of me in 1946 at Wilberforce when I was young.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: And that's a picture of me in 1956 when I was coordinator for centennial activities at Wilberforce University, the year I left.
Speaker 1: That's a copy of 'The Negro Speaks: The Rhetoric of Contemporary Black Leaders,' book that Mack and I edited in 1970.  It's a book of speeches by (unclear) and black leaders.
Speaker 2: Oh, the fountain, Wilberforce.  When I was editor of the A.M.E. Church Review, I did one issue during our bicentennial celebration.  And we had what we called the four horsemen, the founder of the church, Richard Allen; William Paul Quinn have extended the church into the West; Henry McNeal Turner, the person who was in the legislature here in Georgia; and Daniel Alexander Payne, who founded Wilberforce University, or who was the founder of our part of Wilberforce University.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That's the fountain at Wilberforce.  The fountain was located in the middle--oh.
Speaker 1: And that's the fountain located at Wilberforce.  And when the decision was made, you'll be interested in this--when the decision was made to move the Wilberforce to the new campus across on Highway 42, the president of the alumni association was a member of my class, Hondenbud [ph.] Hargrove.  The alumni, they were opposed to doing that, so he said well, let's move the fountain.  That will be a part of our history.  So he wrote and asked me to do a poem.  My poem is etched on that fountain on the new campus.
Speaker 2: That's my grandson, Douglass, his wife, Pam, and our first great-granddaughter, Jamye.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That's my grandson, Douglass, his wife, Pam, the baby, who is Peyton, Jamye, the first grandchild, and Donna.
