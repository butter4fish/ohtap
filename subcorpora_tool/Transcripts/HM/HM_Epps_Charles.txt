Story_ID: 6847
Speaker 1: --your mother and what you know about her background and her growing up.
Speaker 2: My mother, Marjorie Sue Jackson, was born, I believe, in Cumberland, Virginia. Her parents were Robert and Lucy Jackson. And at an early age she moved to Baltimore [Maryland] where she completed high school. She married my father and they had six children. She did not have a profession. She was a home wife--a homemaker. Until my father died, that's what she did. After my father died she did domestic work.
Speaker 1: Did she talk any about her growing up in Cumberland?
Speaker 2: Well not very much. You know, I left home when I was seventeen and never had time to talk to her very much about her childhood. I gather it was a happy childhood. And--But she never shared any little vignettes about one thing or the other. I do know she--There was an extended family and she was the only child and she had some cousins with whom she felt very close.
Speaker 1: What was she like as a person?
Speaker 2: She was a warm, caring, nurturing person. I mean she was the one I'd turn to when I had a scraped knee or anything like that. She was affectionate and--but a good disciplinarian. She had little favorite sayings. Well actually she and my father sort of worked together on that. They were sort of a team. And they would say things, for example, I can remember hearing both of them saying that "Manners will get you things that money won't. You should always be polite." They always--they told us to always respect adults, be honest, tell the truth. And they both stressed--earnestly stressed the importance of education. And they always would say that a good education gives you something that no one can take from you. And the other thing I remember is that, of course, by being born in the 1930s, and living in Baltimore, there was total segregation. With the one exception that we didn't have to ride in the back of the bus or the streetcar. But they always said that you have to work twice as hard as the white man to get the same--to get to the same place. And that sort of resonated throughout my, my childhood--those, those expressions.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about your father and--.  Okay (chuckle).
Speaker 2: My father [Charles H. Epps, Sr.], whose name I share, was a proud man. He was born in Washington D.C. and was raised in Baltimore, where he met my mother. He was a graduate of Coppin Teachers College [Baltimore, formerly Fannie Jackson Coppin Normal School, later Coppin State College, then Coppin State University]  and then he took courses at Morgan State [University, Baltimore]. And he was a secondary school teacher. That was his work. The things I remember most about him were also some admonitions that he gave me. He shared the ones with my mother that I've already told you about. But he also told me--And I can remember distinctly as a young boy of five or six when he would leave home to go to work. He always said men shook hands, you see. And so he would extend his hand and I would extend my little hand and he would shake it warmly. And he said, "There are two things you must do whenever you shake a man's hand. You look him straight in the eye and you squeeze his hand to let him know that you're--intend to shake it." And I always remember those things. But he also said to me, "Son, I'm leaving you here to protect your mother and sisters. And you're in charge and I expect you to be responsible for them." Now, even though I was 5 or 6, you know, that impressed me and I felt very responsible for my mother and my sister. Particularly after he died. But even as a youngster I was sort of watching over them. And they--I was their protector in the community. Although they were able to take care of themselves, but I sort of considered myself their protector. And even now, I feel a sense of responsibility for them, because I was the oldest son. My father also stressed the importance of education. And I guess that would be a natural, since he was a teacher. And as I said, there were things that the two of them shared together. Now I suspect also, because I was a minority of one in the home when my father was away. Because my brother wasn't born until I was twelve. I felt overwhelmed by all these females. And my father when he would be shaving or doing things like that, would take me into the bathroom with him. And I would sit there and watch him shave. And he would tell me stories. Now I can't remember a single story that he told me. But he was a very engaging storyteller. And I suspect that some of these were stories that came out of his experiences as a teacher or his work as a teacher. But I always enjoyed listening to him tell me stories.
Speaker 1: Do you know anything--Did he ever tell you anything about his growing up? Or even him going, you know, to become a teacher?
Speaker 2: Not--(sigh) Well you see, I can't remember very well. Because I was fifteen when he died. And I never thought that I would--should try to remember these things for posterity. Because you always think your parents are gonna be alive forever, at that age. And he died when I was fifteen. And at that age, you know, you're not on the very best terms with your father if you're a boy. And so (chuckle) I don't remember his telling me things other than he always gave advice about preparing for life and things like that. But--.
Speaker 1: Now do you know how your parents met?
Speaker 2: No they never shared that with me. Now if I knew as a young child, I've forgotten. Because a lot of these things you remember because they're reinforced over and over again. But because he died when I was fifteen and she died when I was twenty-one, I just don't have any particular memory of that.
Speaker 1: Now your parents, how old were they when they died--it--respectively?
Speaker 2: My father was forty-two and my mother was six years older. She was five years older. She was forty-seven. Yeah, they were the same age.
Story_ID: 6848
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of, you know, of growing up?
Speaker 2: I was born in Baltimore [Maryland] in the ten hundred block of Mount Street. Which was a block down from where my father's [Charles H. Epps, Sr.] parents [Henry Epps and Martha Epps] lived. And there were two--There was a brother of my father who lived in that block, as well as an aunt and uncle. But I just have no memory of actually living in that house on Mount Street. But at about age three, my family moved to Pimlico. Which is an area in the northwest section of Baltimore.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: "P-I-M-L-I-C-O". That's where the Pimlico racetrack is. And I remember a moving van in front of the house and my father piling all of us in the car. And we followed the van out to our home in Pimlico. And I remember there unpacking the furniture. And I was so excited, because we had a large yard. You know in the section of Baltimore where I was born, there was a row house. And we had the white model steps and the side walk. But there was no front yard. And, of course, there was a small back yard in those areas. But I don't have any particular memory of that. But the new house had a large yard and there were two pear trees and a peach tree and grapevines. There was a garage in the backyard and an old barn that stood for many years. And the house had a back porch, a side porch, a front porch and actually a porch on the second floor. So this was just a--It seemed to me, this was a enormous house. However, when I went back to the neighborhood about thirty years later (chuckle) and I looked at the house, it was--It seems so small.  You know, but in my memory as a child, this was a very large place. And I remember the trees were large enough for me to climb and swing from the branches. And I really enjoyed that place.
Story_ID: 6849
Speaker 1: Now what were you like as a child?
Speaker 2: Well I think I was somewhat pampered because I was the only son for so many years. And I think my father [Charles H. Epps, Sr.] , I'm sure, spoiled me. Although my mother [Marjorie Sue Jackson Epps] I thought--Although he was a disciplinarian. And when I really misbehaved my mother would say, "Your father will have to deal with this when he comes home." And he did. But my childhood was happy. I loved my sisters. And then, of course, when I had a baby brother, that was a big event. I was just as excited, if not more so, when my younger sister was born. And I think she's about six years younger than I. So I had two older sisters, two younger sisters and a very young brother. But ours was a very warm, close affectionate family and my childhood was very happy. Because I didn't have an older brother or a brother even close to my age, I played with the neighborhood boys. And we played literally from sun up to sundown in the summer. And we played baseball and we rode our bicycles and we would explore actually out into the suburbs of Baltimore [Maryland]. And in the fall we played baseball. Our neighborhood didn't have a basketball court as it were. There was a lot and we nailed that proverbial peach basket to the pole and play basketball. (chuckle) I remember how excited I was when I went to junior high school. I came home and told my mother that I had seen a gymnasium. And they actually had lines painted on the floor for the foul shots and the boundaries. And the school I went to in Pimlico didn't have a gymnasium.
Speaker 1: Now give me your siblings names and their--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: you know, birth order.
Speaker 2: The oldest was Charlotte [Epps Shorter], next was Marjorie [Harriette Epps], I was next and then younger was June [Epps Green] and next was [Suse] Rae [Epps Crosby] and Robert [Bismark Epps] was the youngest.
Speaker 1: Now did you find that you had sort of special status as the boy in the family? Or were you, you know, your sisters required to do things and you were sort of exempt from, you know.  Or you had your own--.
Speaker 2: Well I enjoyed a special status, as I said, because my father was so proud to have a son. And I was the only son for twelve years. And, for example, I would have--When I have those finicky moments about eating--I remember once at the dinner table I didn't want anything but celery. And my mother was insisting that I eat some peas and potatoes and whatever else there was. And then finally my father said, "If he wants celery, let him eat celery." Well (chuckle) I never forgot that. But I made a meal of celery on that occasion. But he indulged me, like that. Now having said that though, my mother made sure that I knew how to do certain things, I was spared any responsibilities as far as cooking was concerned. Because with four sisters I never had to lift a hand to prepare a meal. They did all the cooking. I think she was interested in teaching them how to cook. But she did teach me how to clean. And she taught me how to wash clothes and even to iron my shirts. So that when I went off to college I did my own laundry and I could wash and iron a shirt as good as anyone. And the cleaning came in handy because I actually had a job. I worked for E. [Edward] Franklin Frazier my last two years in college. And I basically did housework for him. But I also learned to paint. And in Baltimore--in high school I used to whitewash basements. I had--and I could also tar a roof. You know, you buy this tar and you get a brush. And you can dip and smooth the tar out. And I did that for some of my teachers in high school and they would sort of pass me around. I'd finish one job and then I'd do another one. So I learned how to do those kinds of things. And I don't regret that. Because I can help now, with just my wife and myself here I can help her with the housework. I'm not so male that I find that demeaning, I think it's only fair.
Story_ID: 6850
Speaker 1: If you take yourself back to the second house. You know, where you lived, were you--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you live in that house until you went to--?
Speaker 2: College.
Speaker 1: College.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you tell me what sights, smells or sounds remind you of growing up there?
Speaker 2: Well this [the Pimlico neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland] was a, I guess, in a sense suburban type community. Although the houses were--many of the houses were side by side in a row fashion. But there were fruit trees in the yard and flowers. I remember that. But in the neighborhood, if you ventured close to the racetrack you could smell the horses. You knew that there were horses there. And--so that became a familiar aroma. Other than that I can't think of anything that was particular about Pimlico. And the sounds, there were--When the races--When the horses were actually running in the races you could hear the crowd. I lived so close that you could hear the crowd. And you could tell when the race was--You could tell when the race started, because there would be a roar. And then it would sort of rumble along at a low intensity. But then when it came down to homestretch, the crowd noise would pick up until the race was over. And I never thought about that. But now that you asked, that was a familiar sound during that--during that time.
Speaker 1: Now the street where you lived on, can you sort of describe that community that lived on the same street as you did?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes. blacks or 'Negroes' as we were called in those days, lived on two streets, Paton Street [Avenue] and Denmore Avenue. There were two blocks on Paton and three on Denmore. And they were all--some row houses and some detached homes and semi-detached homes. And it was a very small self-contained community. As a matter of fact, they didn't have a school there when we first moved in there. And I don't know where the older children went. But as I said, I was 3 or 4 at the time. And when the time for school came around, there was a lady across the street, who had finished Coppin Teachers' College [Baltimore, formerly Fannie Jackson Coppin Normal School, later Coppin State College, then Coppin State University]  They were sisters, as a matter of fact, two of them. And they took students in their home. And my oldest sister Marjorie and I attended the Di Corsi (ph.) School, we called it. I think my parents paid them a very modest amount. And I learned to read at the age of 4. And, of course, I fell in love with my teacher who was Miss, Miss Virgie as she was--(chuckle). I just adored that woman, because she taught me to read. And at noon--well at recess time, or sometime during the morning she would serve us milk and graham crackers. I love graham crackers to this day. But Miss Virgie--And I think her sister taught my sister. And after that first summer, the City of Baltimore bought her home. And I sat on my front porch and watched their carpenters come. And they put all the lumber from her house in a pile. And they brought new lumber and they built a two room school house. And it was interesting.  Because there was a center hall and two classrooms on either side. And then they had restrooms for boys and girls and faculty and a closet and that sort of thing. But in each room there were six rows, One A, One B, Two A, Two B etc. and then across the hall, where the principal was, there was Four A, Four B, Five A, Five B, Six B, Six A and then you went to another school. And it never occurred to me that I had to go to that school, because that was the only school we had. And I never really figured out where the kids went before that school was built. I guess they had to go downtown or to another colored community, as it were.
Story_ID: 6851
Speaker 1: One day I was riding my bicycle and I rode some distance from home and I came to a block square campus with a three story red brick building. And it had a baseball diamond and a soccer field and a football goalpost. And I returned home as fast as I could. And I said, "Mother I've just found this wonderful school." And I described all these things it had and I said, "I wanna go to that school." And she [Marjorie Sue Jackson Epps] said, "Son, I'm sorry. You can't go to that school." and I said, "Well why on earth can't--I can walk there. It's just four blocks away."  Now at my age, that was a long distance, you see. She said, "You can't go to that school because we're colored." And so she sat me down and explained to me the basic elements of racial discrimination. And I was appalled about that. I had learned to recite the Pledge to Allegiance [Pledge of Allegiance] in school. And whenever I heard the National Anthem I would--Even at home, I would stand up and cross my heart or salute. And after she told me that, nothing was ever the same. I felt terrible about this. And then I realized that we all lived in Pimlico in these five blocks, because we had no choice. And, as I said, we didn't have to ride in the back of the bus or the street car and taxi cabs would pick us up. But every other aspect of life was segregated. You could go to the store and buy groceries. But you couldn't  go to the barber shop and get your hair cut or your--And you could--The movie houses were not desegregated. And although there were two large theaters in Pimlico, we had to go all the way downtown to go to the movies. And so it awakened me to this terrible plague that, you know,  hovered over every aspect of life in America. And I really never--in a sense, never got over it. But that was my awakening in that community.
Speaker 2: And how old were you again?
Speaker 1: I was about six.
Speaker 2: Six years old--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 2: when you realized it.
Speaker 1: when I realized it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then--And it was by accident that I discovered this school and then she explained it. Now I just had accepted that we lived there. But I didn't know we lived there, because we didn't have any choice. And I accepted that we went to this school, because it was right across the street from my house. And--But I didn't realize that that's where I had to go.
Story_ID: 6852
Speaker 1: Oh by the way I should tell you that I fell in love with my second grade teacher. Which was the first year in the public school. And her name was Louise Kerr "K-E-R-R" [later Louise Kerr-Hines]. And this was her first class out of Coppin Teachers College [Baltimore, Maryland] . And because I could read, she allowed me to read to the first grade while she did other things. You know, I think those teachers were marvelous. Because here's one teacher with six different levels in one room. You see there was One B, One A, Two B, Two A, Three B, Three A. All in one room and she's teaching all these kids all at the same time. And I was so proud of the fact that she would ask me to read to the first grade while she did other things with the other kids. Now when I got to the fifth grade and passed to the sixth grade there were three of us in the class. A boy named Johnnie and a girl named Elaine. And Johnnie quit. He just stopped going to school. And the girl failed. So I was left to be the only one in the Six B. So the principal said," We can't have one person in a whole grade like that. So we're gonna have to send you to Falls Road." And Falls Road was another community by about four or so miles away in another direction. Not downtown, but sort of across from Pimlico where there's a larger group of black people. And they had a much larger school. And I went to the sixth grade there. And I met a friend who remains my closest friend in Baltimore to this day. His name was Paul Johnson. And he had a wonderful mother who would--invited me over to lunch. And I would take my lunch in a bag to school. And at lunchtime I would go with Paul home. And his mother would serve Ovaltine or whatever she had for him. I would have as my beverage for lunch. And if she had pies for dessert, I'd have that too. But Paul and I became very close friends. And then we-When we went on to junior high school and high school; we were always in the same class. He went to Morgan [State University, Baltimore], I came to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]. But we remained friends to this day.  But Pimlico was, as I said, an interesting neighborhood. We played baseball. We played football. We boxed. We played cops and robbers when we were, you know, quite young. And, as a matter of fact, there was a small group that I really ran around with--about four of us, all around the same age. And I really lost touch with them. But--we had a, a great deal of fun, you know, during those, those early years. And my sisters had their friends who lived out there. There were two boys a little older in the next block whose names were Washington, Earnest and George--excellent athletes. And they went off to college to Morgan. And they both finished Morgan. And they were sort of like a model for me to follow. Earnest became a pharmacist. He went to Howard. And George became a dentist. He went to Howard also. But interestingly enough, because they were-Their education was interrupted by war. World War Two. I came to college and actually finished medical school before they did. But they're both dead now. But we were sort of in touch with each other, you know, over the years.
Speaker 2: Throughout really high school. Right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, through high school.
Speaker 2: (unclear).
Speaker 1: And then afterwards we sort of lost touch.
Speaker 2: Pimlico--I just--Was that the racetrack. Was it a white racetrack or a black--?
Speaker 1: Oh they didn't discriminate in the racetrack. You could go in the racetrack. There was a matter of betting your money. You could--They took your money and you could go up and sit down in the grandstand (chuckle). They didn't care about that then.
Story_ID: 6853
Speaker 1: The racetrack [Pimlico Race Course, Baltimore, Maryland] was integrated in the sense that they admitted anyone and you could--if you purchased a ticket, you could sit in the grandstand.  In terms of participation and actual racing industry, it was very discriminating.  There were almost no black jockeys, if any. But they had a lot of black exercise boys.  These were--they rode the horses and trained the horses but they didn't ride in the races. As I recall, there were very, very few. And there were no black owners, to my knowledge, in those days.  And they, the men who cleaned the stalls and exercised the horses and walked them--groomsmen, I guess they were called, they--many of them were black. But I am not aware of any owners or people like that.  They, they had a protective force, the Pinkertons [detective agency]. They were all white.  As it--In that time blacks were relegated to the more menial jobs.  The racetrack's still there. It doesn't have the same prom-preeminence that it had. And I think if it were not for the fact that the Preakness [Stakes] is held there, I don't think that it would probably have survived, even to this time.  There's talk now about putting slot machines there.  But it was a grand old racetrack--The Maryland Jockey Club and it was a major activity in Baltimore.
Story_ID: 6854
Speaker 1: Did you immediately like school?
Speaker 2: Immediately. As I said, I fell in love with. Miss Virgie who was my first teacher.  And I fell in love with Louise Kerr who was my first real public school teacher.  And I always wanted to please them.  As I said, my parents [Marjorie Sue Jackson Epps and Charles H. Epps, Sr.] stressed education. And I saw the pride and satisfaction in their faces when I brought the good report card home.  And then I saw how pleased they were when they went to PTA meetings and they were told that I was doing well. And I enjoyed studying.  And I wanted to please my parents. And I wanted to please my teachers. And so I was a hard working student from really the very beginning.  But I enjoyed reading. I enjoyed learning. So school was always a pleasure for me.
Speaker 1: What were you like as a child?  Were you quiet, introspective, outgoing, mischievous? I mean--.
Speaker 2: Well I think that in school I was quiet and studious.  Because I had four sisters I was, I guess, sometimes obnoxious at home. And I remember that we used to have some very interesting (chuckle) discussions and situations about who could do this and who couldn't do that. But as I said, while I might disagree and rough them up, nobody else could do that.  I do have one--my mother had a cousin who used to say that I was a terror when I was a little fellow.  And that was kind of embarrassing. But I really don't have any recollection of that.  But in general, I was a very studious person.  I worked hard in school. And I also worked hard after school. Because I always had jobs after school. And particularly during the racing season. Because we parked cars. And I shined shoes. And I did all these little things to earn extra money.  When I got older, I mowed lawns in the summer. I shoveled snow in the winter. I delivered groceries from the A&P and I delivered cloths from the cleaners.  I had many, many jobs.  One job I particularly enjoyed was a job in the bakery. Rice's bakery.  As a youngster, maybe before age 6 my mother would take me with her to the bakery and she would buy donuts.  In those days you could buy 3 honey-dipped--large honey-dipped donuts for 5 cents. And she'd buy a bag of donuts and would give me one and I could eat it on the way home.  And I can remember holding her hand with one of my hands and this honey-dipped donut in the other. And the heat would-My fingers would melt the honey. And I just enjoyed them. Now I should tell you that I love honey-dipped donuts (chuckle) to this day.  But when I was a teenager, I got a job in that bakery washing the pots and pans after school. And they would--If they had donuts left over or cake or whatever, they would give me that to take home.  I enjoyed working in that bakery.  But I had almost any job you can imagine.  I also worked in the Chinese laundry there in Pimlico. I ironed the collars and cuffs for this Chinese laundry after school for a period.
Speaker 1: Now was the Chinese laundry actually owned by Chinese?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay. And with that exposure to it, you know--. Had you been around many Chinese people (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, I think probably this was the first one. And there used to be this joke about "No ticky, no shirty, no ticky, no laundry."  And he actually would say that to people. If they came in and they wanted their laundry and no ticket, he says, "Sorry no ticky, no laundry," (chuckle).  And I think they had some kind of negotiations. But he would actually say that. But he had a machine that would press the collars and the cuffs with very thick starch. And that was my job.  I'd ironed these collars and cuffs and then someone else ironed the back, the front and the sleeves. But the collars and cuffs had to be board stiff.  And he had a special starch that he used on then.  But I had so many jobs. And once when my kids were young, I was telling them about the old days.  I actually counted up the kinds of jobs that I had, had. And there were thirty-two a actual count different jobs I had done in high school and when I was in college.
Story_ID: 6855
Speaker 1: How did you end up finishing school at sixteen, I guess is what--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Because I started when I was four.  You see my sister, who was older, was six. And they were gonna send her off to school, to Miss Virgie's ["DaCorsi (ph.) School", a small school held in a private home in the Pimlico neighborhood, Baltimore, Maryland].  And so I said, "I want to go too." So, she let me go and I went along.  Now there were opportunities to advance or skip but my parents said, "No. You're far enough ahead already."  So they would never let me advance a year. But when I went to junior high school they offered me an opportunity to skip a grade. And my parents said, "No, you're too young. And you just go along with your class."  And so I did.
Speaker 1: Did you play sports at all?
Speaker 2: Well the first sport I took up was boxing.  In junior high school I got on the boxing team. And I was interested there to learn the art of self-defense to put it plainly.  My neighborhood was kind of ruff and I was always very small. I didn't weigh but 135, 140 pounds when I got married at age 25.  So I was a little skinny kid and small. And so I joined the boxing team to learn how to box.  And I did all right. I never won any titles or anything. But I did alright.  But I did learn how to box. And from that day to this, I've only had to defend myself with my fists once. And I was a freshman in college [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.]. And there was a bully in the dormitory who liked to pick on people. And one day he picked on--challenged me. And I used my boxing skills to punch him, and he never bothered me (laughing)---He never bothered me again.  But that was the one time I had to defend myself.  But also after I got on the boxing team, I had more respect in the neighborhood. So I didn't have much trouble there either.  I also played basketball, junior varsity basketball.  And in high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland] I was on the junior varsity basketball team. And we had intramural. I played really more intramural sports.  Basketball and football on intramural teams. Even though athletes were not very large in those days, I was still small by even then--The current standards even then. So I--You know, you can't play much football if you only weigh 125, 130 pounds. And I wasn't tall. And--But I enjoyed watching. And I enjoyed playing on that intramural level.  In college I never bothered with sports. I didn't--I did run on the track team though in junior high school and for a while in high school.
Speaker 1: Did you--Were you involved in any other extracurricular activities in, you know, high school? Or did you have any other interests? Or were there other people in the community that you looked up to?
Speaker 2: Well in junior high school, as I said, I did sing on the choir--chorus. They had a chorus in junior high school and I sang on that chorus.  I think I played intramural basketball.  In high school I--my voice had changed and I could no longer sing. So I didn't pursue singing in high school. But I became active in student government. And I was interested in writing. So I worked on the school newspaper. And in my senior year I was editor of the school paper, which was called 'The Douglass Courier.'  And I was active in student government.  And I was president of my graduating class in high school.

Speaker 1: Did you always have an interest in being a doctor? Or in math and science at that point or--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well I learned that I had an aptitude for science in junior high school. And I had a teacher whose name was Brown. And he used to give us--We'd finish the regular work and then he'd give us extra problems to solve. And I would solve those. And he told me that he thought I would do very well in science.  He knew my father [Charles Harry Epps, Sr.] and I think he sort of (unclear) a way to encourage me.  In senior high school --Oh and I finished second in my class in junior high school. And let me just digress for a moment to tell you that--And another thing that really drove this matter of segregation home was the time I went to junior high school. It was in 1941--Yes. There was no black junior high school between my home in Pimlico and downtown Baltimore [Maryland]. So I had to ride the streetcar all the way there. But on the way, I'd pass white junior high schools that were literally half empty.  There were so many of us, that they couldn't accommodate all of us in one shift. So we had two shifts in junior high school.  The first shift would start around 7:30 or 8:00 and we'd get out at noon.  And then the second group would go in at noon and get out at 5:30. Which meant that if you were in the first shift you left home at--and it was dark in the winter and you got home around noon. But in the second shift, you went to school at noon and you--when you--It was dark when you got out at 5:30. Which was I thought really imposition on our families and us as students to have to have a double shift like that.  In high school we just had one shift.  But I think the [Frederick] Douglass High School where I attended was built for blacks. Because my father [Charles H. Epps, Sr.] had gone to that school. It had been built, you know, the generation before.  Junior high school, I'm certain, was a white school that was handed over to us.  They had two separate systems. A superintendent for the black system and a superintendent for the white system.  And I was always annoyed greatly by the fact as I--when I was in high school that there was (unclear) discrimination.  For example, when we got what was called "new books", you could open the cover and you'd see names of students who were obviously not black.  Most of us were Smith, Johnson, Brown. And these were Caucasian names. And which meant that they had used those books through several years. And then suddenly they probably got new books and these books were boxed up and sent to us as new books.  Well I resented that.  In addition to that, there were two high schools in Baltimore. One called City College and the other called Poly. And those schools had advanced curricular. And boys who finished those schools could enter college at the second year level. And that was only possible because they had advanced placement courses.  And, of course, now blacks can go to those schools and take advantage of that. But I always felt badly about that.
Speaker 1: Now did you--In this whole process of, you know, questioning, were there adults you talked to, other kids or, you know, where you said, "This is not right.  Why is--?"
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Well I talked to my parents [Marjorie Sue Jackson Epps and Charles H. Epps, Sr.]  about it.  And they agree that it wasn't fair. And that's why they said, "You--This is the way life is in this country. And you're gonna have to work twice as hard as the white man to get to the same point."  We talked about it in school. Our teachers recognized it.  Now in a sense, there was possibly a little benefit from it with respect to teachers. Because most of my teachers in high school had a master's degree. And the reason why they couldn't get a job teaching college. So they were over prepared to teach us in high school. And they were good teachers.  I later learned that in many of the white schools their teachers didn't have--It was unusual for them to have a master's degree. And occasionally there would be someone in high school who had a Ph. D.  So we had a highly qualified core of teachers--many of whom were overtrained. And as I listened to them and look back on it, there was a great deal of frustration on their part that they were not able to utilize their education to its best advantages.  But that didn't affect the way they taught us. They did their best by us.  I know also that our equipment was inferior particularly in our science labs and things like that.  Now you asked about my deciding to become a doctor. I had to--I must answer this way.  I wanted to be a doctor.  Back in those days if you aspired to be a professional there was medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and divinity.  We didn't have opportunities in banking and business and those kind of things.  And so I said, "Well gee, I really would like to be a doctor." Because I had--The doctor was very conspicuous. You always admired him.  He'd carry his little black bag and people revered him.  And he was always doing good for people. So I said, "Well it would be nice to be a doctor."
Story_ID: 6857
Speaker 1: And then my father [Charles H. Epps, Sr.] died. And it became clear to me that if I got to college I was gonna have to support myself. And as a matter of fact when--I remember when my mother [Marjorie Sue Jackson Epps] had a discussion with my father. When I was a senior--when I was a junior in [Frederick Douglass] High School [Baltimore, Maryland] I entered a project in a science fair that Howard University [Washington, D.C.]  had. And I won first prize. And my project was on atomic fishing. And as a--to get the--to receive the prize, my chemistry teacher whose name was Williams, Maceo Williams, brought me over on the train. And I came up to the Howard campus. I had never been on a campus before. And I said, "Oh, this is beautiful."  I fell in love with Howard's campus.  And there was a graduate student; her name was Gwendolyn Hackney (ph.) who sort of shepherded us along.  There were a number of students who, you know, won prizes. And my prize was a book, 'A Science For The Citizens'. I have it in my library now. And I was so proud to receive this prize. But this graduate student showed us the laboratories in the chemistry building. And I could see how poorly equipped our chemistry lab was, you know, back in Baltimore.  But, I fell in love with the university and decided that this is where I want to go to school.  My father was still alive then. This was May of 19--no I'm sorry. He had died--he died in January of '46--this was May of '46.  Anyway I went home and I told my mother that I just gotta go to Howard University. But I'd always talked about going to college. And my mother and father had, had a discussion. And she said to him, "What are you going to do about this boy? He wants to go to college." and my father--I remember my father said, "Don't worry. He'll be all right. He'll get there. He'll get there." (chuckle) But after he died, I was put in a position of being the older son with the two younger sisters [June Epps and Suze Rae Epps]. My older sister [Charlotte Epps-Shorter] had gotten married. And my younger brother [Robert Bismark Epps] and my mother and I were really, you know, supporting the family.  And that's one reason I had so many jobs. Because I worked every day after school.  But when the time came to go to college, I had a discussion with my mother. And she said--well we made a bargain. That I could go to college and she wouldn't have to send me any money. And I would work and send her all that I could spare. And so that was our bargain.  And I left home. I had just turned 17. And I remember waving goodbye to them as I walked to the streetcar line to catch the streetcar to go to the train station. And I never really lived at home but one summer after that. Because my mother died shortly.  But she never sent me--never had to send me five cents during that whole time. Now because I had wanted to be a doctor and when my father died, I said--I realized looking at the catalogs that this is eight years. And knowing that I had to--no family support, that I would have to work to support myself. I decided that eight years might be a little much. And I had liked chemistry and mixing and compounding. And I said, "Well I should become a pharmacist.  This is something that I can do. And I think I will enjoy doing that. And it only takes four years."  And so I--by going through that process I delayed too long in making applications to Howard and I was away working that summer in New Hampshire. You know I said I had a job every summer. I worked in a camp called Camp Cody which was a camp for wealthy Jewish boys in west (pho.) Ossapy New Hampshire. And I remember my mother forwarded my letter from Howard which said they were sorry but the class was filled. And oh I was deflated.  What am I gonna do? I had put all my eggs in this basket to go to pharmacy school. But now the class was filled.  So I wrote to Howard Hueklies (ph.) who had been my biology teacher in high school.  Now after my father died Mr. Hueklies (ph.)  who had been a friend of my father became a surrogate father for me. And he wrote back right away and said, "Don't despair.  The first year of pharmacy is very much like the first year of a professional chemist curriculum. So go ahead and declare yourself a chemistry major. And they'll put you in the general chemistry course. And that's the same course that pharmacy students take. And that way you won't lose so much time. That'll make you a stronger first year pharmacy student the next year."  And so I came on to Howard. And I enrolled as a chemistry major. And I worked and surprisingly I was able to support myself and my grades were good. So I said to myself "Well I've made one year and that wasn't so bad. I think I can make eight."  So I continued as a chemistry major only rather than taking courses to become a professional chemist I did the pre-med chemistry major. And I went on to get my bachelors in chemistry. And I was able to earn Magna Cum Laude. And I went on to medical school. But I sort of backed into medicine. Because I had been persuaded not to pursue it because of the eight year challenge. And I was gonna do pharmacy.  Now looking back at it, that was probably a fortuitous development. Because of the fact that the thing that I enjoyed most or I thought I would enjoy most about pharmacy turned out to be something the pharmacists don't do very much.  They do very little compounding there. And they count from the big bottle--They count out twenty pills and put them in a smaller bottle and put a label on it and dispense it.  Now I don't think I would have enjoyed doing that for the rest of my life. Because I had imagined myself having to compound these prescriptions. And that's what I had looked forward to.  But then after I found that I was able to support myself and help my mother a little, I was able to go ahead and work eight years.  It was easier, the medical school part of it. Because after living--I lived in Cook Hall in the dorm on the campus and I watched around and saw how people were working. And I noticed that a lot of young men drove taxicabs. So I enquired and found out how you got into the cab business. And that's what I did.  I got a taxicab after I finished college. And I supported myself, driving a cab during medical school.
Story_ID: 6858
Speaker 1: Now, I wanna go back to just two things. One, the death of your father and how it effected you and your family? You know, because its right before you--what, a--how long before you graduate?
Speaker 2: It was about a year and a half.
Speaker 1: Okay. So if you could just sort of talk about that. And then I want to--and then I'll ask the second question.
Speaker 2: Well that was a period of time I can't forget.  My father [Charles H. Epps, Sr.] had came home I guess right at Christmas and was ill. He said he didn't feel well, he took to bed. And they called the doctor. And they couldn't get the doctor to come.  Well he thought he just had a bad cold. And he'd sort of lay around from Christmas to New Year's. And then he was--but he did complain of chest pain. And then finally on New Years Day he said, "This is very bad. I've gotta get some help."  And, of course, my mother [Marjorie Sue Jackson Epps] kept calling and she couldn't get a doctor. She couldn't get his doctor, couldn't get anybody else to come. And finally on the second of January she did get a hold of his doctor who came right away. And took one look at him and said, "We have to go to the hospital." And phoned for an ambulance. And I rode with my mother in the ambulance to Johns Hopkins [Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland]. And they had admitted him. And we went to the emergency room and we sat there. And when they took him upstairs. And after a while they said, "You can go on up now. He's on Osseler (ph.) Two."  Which was the name of the ward. And when we got there, the doctor ushered us into a side room and said, "We're sorry. But your husband has just passed."  And so it was a devastating thing. And, you know, it was very hard on my mother.  Six young children and she was not working. So it disrupted the family quite a bit. So we all pitched in to help.  I was--I already had little jobs. But I began working in real earnest after school at that time. And my mother who had not worked previously went to work as a domestic for a family--The Hutzler family which owned the, the large department store downtown--my cousin had helped her get that job.  She worked for the family already--another part of the family. And so we made it somehow.  And what I said it was a very difficult decision to leave home under those circumstances. But my father had been the sole support of the family. And as a public school teacher he didn't earn a lot of money (chuckle), as you may know.  So with the dramatic effect of this after he died I lived at home until I went off to college. And then the first year I was away my mother died. And my sisters went to other relatives.  I had one sister who was hospitalized at that time. But we were all sort of spread around. But we all somehow survived that. And managed to finish school.  We had health problems which took time to resolve. At least my sisters and my mother.  And my mother died after what was a minor surgical procedure. She had a complication and died while hospitalized.  And then, of course, that--Her illness completely disintegrated the family as it were.  So--For myself after the age of seventeen I really had no home.  I lived in school. I worked with--and I always found a job in the summer where I had room and board. And I'd go back to school. And I continued to do that. And then once I finished college I didn't live the dormitory. I lived with a very nice family in Washington [D.C.] here throughout my medical school and then got married after that. And, of course, things went on from, from that point.
Story_ID: 6859
Speaker 1: Now the other thing that I'd like to touch upon is the State Boys Senate.
Speaker 2: Oh the State Boys Senate. [Boys' State Senate] Well that was a aspect of the YMCA.  They had these YMCA Clubs--Hi-Fi clubs. And there was a--there was a model senate, it met in Annapolis [Maryland] and each one of these clubs in high school would elect representatives who ran for office after they got there.  I was elected, I think, Secretary of the Senate.  And, of course, one of the things that really bore on my mind was this discrimination and segregation. And as I said, in Maryland transportation was not basically enforced.  You could--you didn't have to ride in the back of the bus. But it was offensive to me that there was a law on the books. And I think the segregationist politicians left it there--even though it wasn't enforced.  And so, I was determined that this law should be stricken from the books. And it, and it was.  This was 1945, '46. I introduced a bill and that law was--we passed it--the youngsters passed it. Though it--that had no effect upon, you know, the regular legislature. But the [Baltimore] Afro [-American newspaper] made a little fuss about it. The fact that the boy legislature had--"boy model legislature" they called it had passed the bill to vacate this discrim--transportation discrimination.  And that was a happy moment to see that pass.
Speaker 1: You were sixteen then?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.
Story_ID: 6860
Speaker 1: She [sister June Epps Green] was about sixteen, seventeen.  (unclear) a junior in college. And--But she was admitted to the hospital at Freedman.  She stayed in got well, went back to Baltimore [Maryland] and stayed with my older sister [Charlotte Epps-Shorter] who was living there with relatives. And went on to finish Morgan [State College, later Morgan State University].  And after she got a bachelors at Morgan she came back to Howard [University] and got a masters in social work.  Meanwhile, my older sister [Marjorie Harriette Epps] continued to teach. She was teaching.
Speaker 2: So you're talking about of the three oldest kids were fine?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And then the--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) The two younger ones and my brother [Robert Bismark Epps] were--No my brother was okay.
Speaker 2: Your brother was okay.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: So the two youngest girls, your mother [Marjorie Sue Jackson Epps] and father [Charles Harry Epps, Sr.] had tuberculosis.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And the others no sign of it?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: And you think it was hereditary?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Well not hereditary--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Environmental?
Speaker 1: Well obviously it's environmental in a sense that you--you know, you  catch it from someone. But I think you can have a inherent weakness for a disease. Because I came down with tuberculosis myself.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) You did?
Speaker 1: In 1958, ten years after I'd left home--11 years.  See I never lived at home when my family members were ill. I was in school. So I was never exposed to them. And I had negative skin tests all those years.  But I did--I was exposed to patients who had active tuberculosis. So my illness was considered worker's compensation.  And I stayed in the hospital three months and then went back to work and finished.  So that was a very traumatic and stressful phase in my life in college and medical school in terms of, you know, the family.  I don't talk much about it--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: But that's (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)  I mean that's pretty--Do you think that with--so if it's treated--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh I got--yeah.
Speaker 2: If its treated soon enough you can take care of it--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh yes.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) --but people went away. 'Cause weren't they--'Cause my grandmother had tuberculosis--
Speaker 1: Well before 1951 --.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) They sent people to the sanitariums.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. Well they went to the sanitarium. But you see before 1951 they didn't have anything really effective. It was sunshine, rest and fresh air.  If you remember--You're too young to remember that. But they used to put them out on the porch and they had fresh air. And they believed that the fresh air would be helpful.  But after Streptomycin and PAS [p-aminosalicylic acid] and Isoniazid came along they had--these were called anti-tuberculous drugs.  Those drugs were specifically, would specifically kill the tuberculous organisms. And that's why my second sister got well and eventually the others got well. And my mother died of a compli--developed a parotid abscess which was unrelated. And she had a stroke after that. So while she had tuberculosis, it wasn't tuberculosis that killed her.
Speaker 2: That's pretty amazing. Okay. So when you went to--Okay so you decide that you're going to Howard. But you know you have to go on your own.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Mm-hm.
Speaker 2: And there's no sense--at that time when you are going to Howard are your sisters--any of--No one has contracted TB. Right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh they--Your mother is still alive.
Speaker 1: My mother became ill after my second year.  My younger sister had become ill during my first year.
Speaker 2: Of college?
Speaker 1: Yes.  And then my mother and my next sister both became ill the same summer.
Speaker 2: So there was no sense that you have to stay here to help support the family?
Speaker 1: Well after my mother became ill, there was no family there to take care of.  My older sister went to live with a cousin.  One sisters was in the hospital at Freedmen's [Hospital]. The other sisters was in Henryton [Sanitarium] which is a state hospital in Maryland. And my brother was with another part of the family.  And--So there was no home. You see. We were all in different places.  Then as my sister here recovered, she went to live with my sister who was staying with relatives in Baltimore. And that left my brother and my younger sister who were still by themselves.  But we were--We maintained contact with each other. But there wasn't a lot we could do. You know, to help each other.  My sister who was in Coppin [Teachers' College, Baltimore, later Coppin State College, then Coppin State University] finished Coppin the same year I finished Howard. And she, of course, got immediate employment.
Story_ID: 6861
Speaker 1: You graduate salutatorian--valedictorian.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) In high school.
Speaker 1: In high school
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you've done very well in high school.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so--But this is a time where there weren't necessarily scholarships or anything.
Speaker 2: Well I had a scholarship. It was for $150.00, given by some organization in Baltimore [Maryland]. So I had that. I had cash. They gave me a check which I brought over to--and deposited it in the treasure's office. And I had a couple other little--So I probably had $200.00 or so $250.00 in cash from that graduation.  But, you know, there was no one sending me an allowance every two weeks or once a month.
Speaker 1: So how much was the tuition at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] at that time [1948-1951]?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: It was--There were three quarters. It was--It would be over $200.00.  Somewhere around $300.00 a year with fees. Then you had another $300.00 or so for room rent. And then, of course, you had to eat. And you could eat whatever you had money to pay for (chuckle). Literally. And then there was food or whatever.  You know?
Speaker 1: And so you found this family for--to stay with right?
Speaker 2: No that was in medical school.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) medical school.  So you stayed on campus?
Speaker 2: In college, I lived--I stayed on campus.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: I lived (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: But I waited tables in the dining hall. I worked for a caterer in the city.  I used to go home, when I would go to Baltimore to visit. I had a friend who worked at a nightclub. And I would go to work with him. And he was a fella I'd known in high school. And we passed out towels in the men's room. And, you know, you got tips for that. And sometimes I'd go home to Baltimore. There'd be a big catering job. I'd do that.  But basically I just--But I saved literally every penny I made during the summer.  I always had a summer job.  The last summer I lived at home I worked at the Curtis Bay [Coast Guard] Shipyard. My mother [Marjorie Sue Jackson Epps] was still alive then. And I joined the union. And I made good money that summer.  And I remember one thing I did I was quite proud of--I was working on a team that was scrapping one of the World War Two baby battle ships. And the name escapes me now. The [U.S.S.] Hornet I guess it was called. The Hornet.  And my job was to remove the four by four oak beams that formed the deck--the landing deck.  And when I arrived there the man handed me a twenty pound sledgehammer and a couple of steel wedges and showed me how to cut the steel bolts that held this oak beam down to the steel deck. And I did that all summer.  I had good muscle tone when I left that summer.  But I earned good money that summer.  One summer I worked on the B&O Railroad as a waiter, while I was in college. And I saved my money fastidiously. And I put it in the bank. And when I came back to school I deposited it here. And I would dole it out to myself. And by working as I went along.  I waited tables in the dining halls when they had banquets on campus. And there was a caterer in the city I worked for also.  And I was able to manage well enough then.  Ran a little short at graduation time in my last year. And my grandmother--I wrote to a couple of members of the family. And I said, "I need $150.00 to pay all of my graduation fees." And my grandmother, I'm sure, went to her cookie jar, you know, and sent me the money to pay all my graduation fees.  But once I got through college, a friend who lived in the city said I could stay with him until I got a job.  And I found a job that summer at the Naval Annex as a file clerk, GS2. That's the (chuckle) lowest Government grade.  But I had it in mind that I was gonna drive a cab. Now I didn't become twenty-four--twenty-one, rather, until July [1951].  So from the time school closed until July, I saved my money. And I was able to get my hacker's license.  And, but then I had my sister [Marjorie Harriette Epps] borrow $150.00 for me. She went to Household Finance [Corporation] for me.  You probably don't remember what--HFC.  She went to HFC. And on the strength of her having a contract to teach school, she borrowed $150.00 which I'd put down on this cab. And as soon as I could, I paid her back and she paid that back.  But after that I was, you know, my financial future was secure. Because I could--The advantage of having a cab is that I could adjust my hours to meet my convenience. And they were very considerate when I had exams in medical school. They would allow me to not pay a car note the week I was taking exams. And then I would double up, you know, the week after. They were considerate.
Speaker 1: So you learned a lot about discipline and how to really make ends meet during that time period.
Speaker 2: I had no choice.
Story_ID: 6862
Speaker 1: Who were the teachers that really, sort of influenced you during that time?
Speaker 2: Well let me go back because there was one at each--at least one at each stage.  As I told you, I adored my first two teachers--Virgie di Corsi (ph.) and Louise Kerr  She became Louise Kerr-Hines.  In junior high school there was a science teacher named Brown that I was very fond of.
Speaker 1: Who?
Speaker 2: Brown.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Brown. Okay.
Speaker 2: I think his first name was Ben Brown.  But he taught me science in junior high school, at Booker T. Washington Junior High School [Baltimore, Maryland].  In high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland] my friend and mentor was Howard Hucles who had been--who had taught me biology.
Speaker 1: Can you spell--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry "H-U-C-L-E-S".  He taught biology and his wife taught English. And she was also the faculty advisor for the school paper.  And so they were very good friends. And even when I was in medical school and even after I was married, whenever I would go home to Baltimore to see the family I would always stop by to see Mr. Hucles.  And he--we  would write letters periodically. But he became a surrogate father for me until he died.
Story_ID: 6863
Speaker 1: When I came to college [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] , in the first year I had a teacher I adored. I had a little crush on her.  Her name was Peggy Strauss (ph.).  We  laugh about it now.  I think every freshman male in that class was in love with her (chuckle).  She was very attractive, and--but so nice and sweet.  We  all loved her.
Speaker 2: What did she teach?
Speaker 1: Humanities.  I mean, you know, it was not part of my field at all.  But I was also was very fond of Gwendolyn Hackney (ph.), who later became Gwendolyn Hackney-Austin (ph.). And she was a graduate student who had ushered the group of us who had won prizes in 1946. And when we  came to the campus, and she later became--I had her as a lab instructor when I came to, to college.  Now out of all the professors I had in undergraduate school, Lloyd Ferguson, "F-E-R-G-U-S-O-N", is the one that I remember most. He taught Organic Chemistry.  And Organic Chemistry they always said is a course that separated the men from the boys. And if you don't get Organic Chemistry, you cannot get into medical school.  Well he and I hit it off just fine.  I got three A's in his course. And I just had the highest respect for this man.  And I think he regarded me as one of his best students.  And we  had a little--he would write messages on my exam papers. And if I got less than a perfect score he would write on my paper "I got you this time".  And then when I got everything right on the next paper he would write at the top of the page "Ah, you got me this time".  So we  had this little thing going.  And I remembered maybe twenty years, twenty-five years later he became--eventually became department chair at Howard. And after he retired he went back to California where his home was. And he taught at University of California, Los Angeles.  And when he retired from that system--he--They gave him a retirement banquet. And he asked me to come--Out of all the students he had he said  he was gonna invite one undergraduate student and one Ph.D. student." And he invited me to come to represent his undergraduate chemistry students.  Of course, I felt quite honored.  And the man that he had invited who had been a Ph.D. student was a chief chemist at Proctor and Gamble.  And it was a wonderful occasion, had a big banquet. And we gave talks. Each of us gave a talk. And my talk was--I-- based on how organic chemistry had played a life--played a role in my life as a physician.  And so I--you know, I was doing surgery.  So I went to my, my regular routines and I pulled out the organic chemistry in each of the little things that we  do--for example, the organic chemistry involved in the antiseptics that we use to prepare the skin. The organic compounds in this--in the nylon suture that we use. The organic chemistry in the plastic portions of the artificial joints that we inserted. And all these things. I tried to make it interesting. But at the same time to show that organic chemistry was still important to me even though my life was that of a surgeon and not a chemist.  And of course the man who'd  gone to Proctor and Gamble had just lots of products to talk about that involved organic compounds.  So Ferguson  was quite pleased and it was a happy occasion. And we were both glad to have been a part of.  But I felt honored that he would ask me to do that after all the hundreds of students that he had taught at Howard and at California.

Speaker 1: Now in medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], it was a whole different situation. And there were a number of professors that I admired there.  One was W. [William] Montague Cobb, "C-O-B-B".  He was professor of anatomy.  Dr. Cobb had two daughters, never had a son. So he became another surrogate father for me. And he adopted me sort of as his son and we became very close.  For example, he had a home down near Annapolis, in Columbia, Maryland. And he had a little boat there that he used to get out every fall called the "Tuscarora" (ph.) .  And he would ask me to come down make this boat transition from storage out into the water.  He was a interesting man. Had a great deal of knowledge about poetry and literature. And he could quote Shakespeare etc. But he was one that I turned to for advice and counsel, while I was in medical school and even afterwards. See all during that time my father [Charles Harry Epps, Sr.] had passed. And Mr. [Howard] Hucles, of course, was a surrogate father on the other end [during high school].  But Dr. Cobb was right here in Washington.  I was no great anatomy student. However, but our friendship was on a personal basis and not so much--The man who was chief of orthopedics gave me the opportunity to study orthopedics. His name was J. Robert Gladden.  But in so many fields there were men who were really outstanding people.  And I don't know whether my wife [Roselyn Payne Epps] had mentioned it or not, but we entered medical school at a time when this special faculty that they had put together was there. You see prior to 1926, almost all of the Howard medical faculty were white. And Mordecai Johnson and the first black dean, Numa P. G. [Pompilius Garfield] Adams, put together the first full-time African-American medical faculty.  So that in each area there was somebody who was outstanding.  In internal medicine there was J. B. Johnson and Walter Lester Henry. In surgery there was Burke Syphax who incidentally was the chairman when I was hired as a faculty member.  In neurosurgery there was Clarence Greene.  Thoracic surgery--[J.] Richard Laurey; psychiatry--E. Y. Williams, obstetrics--Julian Waldo Ross and John [F.J.] Clark.  In every field he had a bargain. "I will send you away to get special training or a Ph.D. in the field. Then you come back to teach."  And he did that. And that's how he filled his first full-time [black] faculty.  So there were many men there that impressed me. But I guess Dr. Cobb did. Dr. Burke Syphax was another.  And I went on, of course, into orthopedics. And as I mentioned J. Robert Gladden gave me the opportunity by selecting me for the program at Howard.  And then, because they had more material at D.C. General [Hospital], I went to D.C. General where I was the second black to go out there in orthopedics. And--but the first to become chief resident.  You see. They had three men at each level. And in the third year only one gets to be chief resident.  And although a black had preceded me, he was not appointed chief resident.  And I remember the tension and concern during my year. Because the other fellows were there. They were aggressive. They wanted it. But they--But I got the post.  And--So I was the first black chief resident there in orthopedics. I came--I must say, I came through my training at a time when segregation was just breaking down. And that's why in my CV you'll see that in so many instances I had the opportunity to become the first. And the only reason I became the first is because I was prepared and the opportunities were there.  Now the man from GW whose name was John P. Adams was over the program at DC General at that time. Along with a man from Georgetown. But it was Adams who mentored me and sponsored me and helped me. Not only during my training, but afterwards as a--he helped enhance my professional career in orthopedics.  He and particularly and his associate Henry Feffer were the, were the main people who helped me.
Speaker 2: Henry--?
Speaker 1: Feffer "F-E-F-F-E-R"
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 6865
Speaker 1: You had mentioned that one of the people you had worked for in the last two years was E. [Edward] Franklin Frazier.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And I would like you to talk--I mean 'cause he's such--You know, I view him as such a giant of a man.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And I was wondering, you know--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: --he's a well known--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: if you could describe him.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.  Well I met him in 1949, while I was working at the Lee Haven Beach Club in Greenwich, Connecticut. And I was a waiter there. And he was there with his wife for summer vacation. And he said, "Charles I want you to be my waiter."  And so I waited on him and his wife during that time they were there to vacation.  That's what those families usually did. And then at the end they'd give you a tip and they'd go on their way.  Well he said--I told him I was at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and he said, "Oh that's fine."  Well it turned out that he lived just about three blocks from the campus. And he said, "Would you like to come and work for us?"  And I said,  "What would I do?"  He said, "Well you could do things around the house."  I said, "Yeah, I'd be pleased to."  Because as I told you, my mother [Marjorie Sue Jackson Epps] had taught me how to do anything in the house. And I said, "I'd be pleased to."  And so what I would do a couple of times a week, I'd go down there and I would do house cleaning. I would dust and mop and vacuum.  I'd give the bathrooms a good scrubbing. If there were dishes left over, I'd do those.  I'd mow his little lawn. He had a small front yard, small back yard.  I washed the Venetian blinds.  I painted his basement. You know, anything that needed to be done in that house I did it. And he paid me.  And I did that for the last two years I was in undergraduate school.  And that was just one of the jobs I had. But--Now I got to know him well. And he and his wife were the first people I had ever seen actually sit in their living room and listen to the Texaco Opera Hour, every Saturday.  They were--Texaco had a program where they played an opera from beginning to end. And they would sit down listen to this opera.  But he was a very interesting man. And I never forget one day I went to see him and he was grumbling. He was very unhappy. Because that year he had been elected president of a national sociological organization. And they were meeting here in Washington. And the meeting was going to be at the Statler Hotel. And they had raised some question about whether or not he could attend the meeting.  Because the city wasn't desegregated at that point. And he was livid.  He says, "Charles, what do you think they expect me to do?  Swing from the chandelier like a monkey or something?"  I mean, you know, it was preposterous. That here's a man who has a Ph.D. and one of the leading sociological figures in this country, who has been recognized by his peers and is elected president of the organization.  And they have questions as to whether or not he could be allowed to come, to attend the meeting of that organization.  Now I'm sure he's probably the only one--black one in the organization. But certainly he was the first president that they had, had at that time. And this is the way they were treating him.  Well they had the meeting. He was allowed in. And I never heard anymore about it.  But someone actually had called him and raised that question.  But beyond that, I mean, he would talk about things on campus. Current events as I would be around there working. And I got to know him.  He would appear on the surface, I guess if you didn't know him, to be a gruff person. But he was really a very warm, considerate person. And someone I guess you might describe as a teddy bear in his personal setting.  I mean he treated me with a--although I was just a undergraduate student--but he treated me fine.
Story_ID: 6866
Speaker 1: You also met your wife [Roselyn Payne Epps] as an undergrad.  Was it a--was it around--I know that you were--she wasn't doing as well in organic chemistry as--
Speaker 2: Well we hadn't taken organic chemistry.
Speaker 1: Right.  At that--oh--point.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) At that point.  When we met we were in a philosophy class [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.]. We were in philosophy class. And I'm one of these people who always sat on the front row. And it happened that she was sitting on the second row. And there was a little girl, who was sort of like a campus--little sister on campus, Alberta Jeffrey (ph.). And I always teased her.  Whenever I saw her, I had to tease Alberta Jeffrey.  And so I was turning around in my usual fashion to tease Alberta Jeffrey. So she was sitting next to her. And I noticed her. And after we had class--this was the last class of the day. We would all walk over to Cook Hall, where I lived.  And see in those days you could eat in any cafeteria on campus. And so we would all go in there as a group to eat dinner. And we would sit at the same table. And we'd eaten.  So I got to know her. And I'll never forget--I don't know whether she mentioned it or not. But I'll never forget they were going around the table one day and they were saying what everybody wanted to be. And we got to her. She said, "Oh I wanna be a doctor."  And I said, "I will never marry a woman doctor (chuckle)."  And, of course, I've lived to regret those terms--those words--many times.  But that was a very common male attitude at those times. I mean in the dormitory you'd talk about the women. And you'd say, "Well you don't marry a woman doctor. You don't wanna marry a woman doctor."  I think most fellows wanted what today we call "trophy wives". You know. Most people who were gonna study medicine were looking for a trophy wife.  But I don't think that was my objection, you know.  My objection was that my mother [Marjorie Sue Jackson Epps] had never worked. She was always at home. And you'd you always imagine that a women doctor--woman doctor's out there working. And she's not home with the kids.  But I must say it was never a problem in our family.  My wife gave our kids quality time. And she worked throughout--I mean she always took off when the babies were born.  But she always--her work was also always made it possible for her to be wherever she had to be for that--what was significant.  If they had coffee hour for the kindergarten, she was able to get there. And we both made PTA meetings in the evenings.  She didn't have to take night call in her jobs. And she was home on weekends and holidays. And she was home when the kids had breakfast. And she got home shortly after they did. And she had dinner.  She was there to prepare their dinner.  She saw them to bed every night.  As a surgeon and in orthopedics I had emergencies. I was coming and going.  But I must say, we had a rule that I would come home for dinner every day. And if an emergency kept me away so that--and I would know before 6:30, I would always call to tell them that I can or cannot come home for dinner. I won't make it by 6:30. So you all go ahead and eat. And then they would go ahead and eat. And then my wife and I would eat after I got back.  But that was the one time when the whole family always got together.  And so I would have breakfast with my kids in the morning. Except on mornings when I had a 7:00 o'clock operation or I had to be somewhere at 7:00 o'clock.  But I tried to schedule my surgeries so that didn't happen.  And so I drove a carpool the whole time they were in school. Until the oldest one got to be sixteen and could drive (chuckle) themselves.  In fact we both drove carpools. Sometimes we had three different carpools.
Speaker 1: When did you decide that you wanted to get married?  That this was the person?
Speaker 2: Within months after I met my wife.  We--I was just nineteen then. And I knew that this is the girl I wanted to marry.  In fact, I wrote my mother who was still alive then.  I said, "Mother I met this beautiful girl who's brilliant. And she's so sweet." I said, "This is the woman I wanna marry and I want to be the mother of my children."  And, of course, my mother was--wrote right back and said, "Son are you giving me a message (laugh)?"  I said, "No Mom. I'm not sending you a message. But I just want you to know that I met this wonderful girl." And fortunately she was able to meet my mother before she passed. But there was no doubt in my mind from the time I was nineteen after I met her that this is the girl I wanna marry.
Story_ID: 6867
Speaker 1: Can you talk just briefly--?
Speaker 2: Mm--hm.
Speaker 1: About the history of orthopedic--this, you know, the orthopedic study--practice--.
Speaker 2: Mm--hm.
Speaker 1: --within Howard.
Speaker 2: Oh, within Howard?
Speaker 1: Medical school, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well actually the orthopedics began at Howard [University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] shortly after the school was opened, and the first professor was Robert Rayburn.  He was a white man who had, I believe, come from Georgetown.  He, incidentally, was dean on two occasions.  He was dean for about three or four years. And then after a break, came back and was dean for a longer period.  So all together, he was dean for about thirty years in the--This was in the early phases of medical school.  Then the formal--the more recent and important history about orthopedics began around 1941.  When Julius Neviaser, who was a George Washington graduate, who had gone to a New York hospital for the ruptured and crippled to get his training, returned to  Washington.  He was a professor at George Washington. And Charles Drew then--who was the chairman of surgery at Freedmen's [Hospital]--invited him over to start a program at Freedmen's. Neviaser came. So that meant he was simultaneously professor at George Washington and at Howard's. And he organized a residency program. And his first resident was J. Robert Gladden, who had finished Meharry [Medical College] in 1939.  Dr. Gladden finished the program and took the boards and passed and became the first African American certified by the American Board of Orthopedic Surgery in 1949.  And then two years later, he became a member of the Academy in 1951.  When--After Gladden passed his boards, they made him chief of the division in 1950. And he remained chief until 1964, when I became chief.  Then I remained chief from 1964 'til 1988.  During that time, we were able to vastly enlarge the program.  We went from one resident a year to four residents a year. And in addition to rotations at Freedmen's Hospital, we had a service at D.C. General [Hospital] Southeast Community Hospital, Providence Hospital, Veterans Administration Hospital, and Children's Hospital.  At various times, we would send a resident up to Hopkins to their children's program. And--But we were self-contained with sixteen residents--four each year.  I remained as chief until 1988, as I said. and then in September of that year, I was appointed dean of the medical school. and Richard Grant, a Howard graduate from the 1970s, became chief.  He continued the program, enriched it, improved the academic performance, and remained as chief for thirteen years.  And more recently, in July of 2000, Terry Thompson--2001--Terry Thompson, who was a student of mine and a resident--who, incidentally was in the last group of residents that I trained before I became dean--became chief. And he is the incumbent at this time.  So it's a fully approved program. They take four men a year, and it's a thriving--one of the--and I, I say this with pride, but it's one of the best programs in the, in the university.
Story_ID: 6868
Speaker 1: Now so when you were a resident [at Howard University Hospital Division of Orthopedic Surgery, Washington, D.C.] , there was only one residency?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Now--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] One per year.
Speaker 1: One per year.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. Mm--hm.
Speaker 1: That's what I meant.  One per year.  Now so you enter medical school. Now were you--Did you have an idea of what you wanted to practice--?
Speaker 2: No.  I guess I was like most medical students.  Every time I went to a new discipline, that one was absolutely the greatest and I wanted to do that.  I mean at various times I thought I'd might like to be a pathologist. I thought I would like to be a cardiologist. I thought I might like to be an obstetrician.  However, during my senior year I rotated to D.C. General Hospital. And on Friday mornings we attended a clinic in what was called the handicapped and crippled children's unit. And that clinic was run by a man from George Washington [University] named John P. Adams.  And they were treating largely children with residuals of polio. But they also had arthrogryposis, myelomeningocele, cerebral palsy. They had complications of fractures and all these various things which were absolutely fascinating to me.  I'd always enjoyed things in mechanical--and the approach that you have to use in reconstructing deformed or damaged limbs sometimes, you know, borrows from, you know, engineering, so to speak.  But in any case, I found it absolutely fascinating and I decided that I would like to be an orthopedic surgeon.  And Freedmen's Hospital at that time was the only historically black institution that had an approved program in orthopedic surgery.  And I applied for the program and I was accepted.
Story_ID: 6869
Speaker 1: Accepted to the program [residency in orthopedic surgery at Freedmen's Hospital] and in my first six months, I was--since I was the only resident--the chief resident had graduated.  There was nobody in between.  I was, in my first six months, equivalent to the chief resident.  And so I did literally everything that came in the door. And it was a wonderful experience.  At the end of that time, they thought I should go to [Washington] D.C. General Hospital, where they had more patients, and a greater variety, and a larger faculty.  And so I transferred to D.C. General Hospital. And there I came under the direct supervision of John [P.] Adams, who had really impressed me when I was a medical student, you know, the year before.  And I continued to rotate through that program. Which included a turn at the Veteran's Administration hospital.  And the other time was spent not only at the crippled children's, but at the adult service of D.C. General Hospital.
Speaker 2: So when you were at D.C. General, that was where you spent a lot of time with Paul Adams. Right?
Speaker 1: John Adams.
Speaker 2: John Adams.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  John P. Adams.
Speaker 2: John P. Adams.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And where--What kind of facility--Who--D.C. General was the main hospital for Washington D.C., was that it?  Or--?
Speaker 1: D.C. General Hospital was the public hospital for the city.  And it had a thousand beds. It had--They had about six residents on the orthopedic service there.  But there was more activity there than at any place else.  It functioned as a city hospital.  All the patients who could not be treated elsewhere were, you know.  We accused the city of dumping on us. But the fact is they always had lots of patients,  lots of work.  We worked very hard.  Every third night or every other night we were on call.  I remember the first night I was on duty there, I admitted seven patients. Which was, you know, a lot of work in one nights--in one night.  But I got a wonderful experience there.  So much so, that I enjoyed the, the children's aspect and when I finished my training in 1961, I was--I applied and receive a job as a consultant for the handicapped crippled children's service.  Now as it turned out, Georgetown and George Washington gradually dropped their involvement there. Which meant that it was totally a Howard [University College of Medicine] service. Not only in the children's, but on the adult side particularly. And we needed it for our training program and for our student education because during that time we still had the old Freedmen's Hospital and patient volumes were decreasing.
Speaker 2: Did you--What are the--some of the things that you really learned during that era--you know, that period of time?
Speaker 1: Medically?
Speaker 2: Yeah, medically and--.
Speaker 1: Well as I said the great bulk of the patients in that area were--polio patients.  And I remember the--I guess the last case of acute polio I saw was around 1960--in the 1960s.  The acute polio stopped right after the Salk vaccine.  We didn't see any more acute polio. But we had the chronic residuals for years. And for the next ten years we were working on these children who had deformities from the polio.  So we were straightening spines, lengthening heel cords, correcting contractures in joints and straightening out bones. We're doing all these things for the patients who'd had polio five and ten years before.
Speaker 2: And you were doing that, basically, through use of braces and things that helped--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Through surgery and bracing and physical therapy.  All of those.
Speaker 2: And--Excuse me.  Weren't there a good amount of fractures and just--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh yes.
Speaker 2: injury--things like that?  But those were more rudimentary.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Well that was more specialized.  The fractures we just took care of as a matter of routine. Because the city hospital had a large pediatric service--acute pediatric service.  And we had a thirty--bed ward where we admitted our patients who needed the--our care.  See children who had a routine fractures could be treated on the acute pediatric side.  They were in, reduced, a cast put on, and they were out.  On the chronic side, those who had fractures that became complicated and those who had infections in joints and that sort of thing, we took care of.  But fractures that didn't heal properly, that had to be reconstructed, we took care of on the chronic side.
Story_ID: 6870
Speaker 1: Burke Syphax "S--Y--P--H--A--X" was chairman of surgery [at Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.]. And when I finished my training, he was the one who hired me as an instructor in orthopedics in the medical school in 1961.  So he gave me the--He made it possible for me to join the faculty.  And as my department chair, he supported me during those as a member of the faculty the first four years, and appointed me chief of the division in 1964 at the age of thirty--three. Which--He had a lot of confidence in me. And we became friends.  You know, it's interesting. Just as the case with Dr. [W. Montague] Cobb.  When I was a student, I--they treated me like a student--I was a medical student and I sat there in awe of them.  Once I was through my training, they regarded me as a peer, and we became good friends.  Dr. Cobb was a person who was very difficult to feel close to in class. And in my own situation, driving a cab at night made me sleepy during the day. And we sat in class alphabetically. And I somehow wound up right in front of his lectern (chuckling) on most days. And we would have lunch and then we'd go to his lecture and I would doze.  And I'm sure it annoyed him, because I use to get annoyed when students would go to sleep while I was trying to lecture, too.  And he would awaken me--tell someone next, "Wake that gentleman up there."  And he would say, "Young man, how tall is the Washington Monument?"  Well I mean I didn't know in the first place. But I could never know by (chuckling) waking up from a dead, you know, a deep sleep.  And those kind of things would happen.  But when I finished, as I said, we became very good friends.  And as a matter of fact, for ten years I was associate editor--assistant editor--his assistant editor for the Journal of the National Medical Association.  He was the Editor in Chief and I was just his assistant editor for ten years.  And during the year that he was president of the organization, they wouldn't allow him to be president and Editor-in-Chief at the same time. I was Acting Editor-in-Chief.  We had a little arrangement that I would turn it back to him after his term as president was over.  But he became a very close friend, over the years, up to the time that he died.  He was also my patient at one point.  He fell and broke his kneecap. And I took care of him.  And it was always a great source of pride to him. He would say, "I can get any kind of condition, and I can get one of my students to--to take care (chuckling) of me."  But he was a wonderful man and very kind to me.  He was also one that I could always turn to for advice.  Now he had a man-- was a man of great interest.  He was president of his own anatomical association.  He was president of the NAACP, and a real fighter for civil rights.  He was responsible for our getting interns and resident positions at D.C. General Hospital.  He was responsible for helping to break down the barriers so African American doctors could get privileges in the private hospitals in the city.
Story_ID: 6871
Speaker 1: Now let's just touch upon that a little bit. Because you had previously mentioned how [Howard University] President Mordecai Johnson had worked strategically to change the faculty [to get African American faculty at Howard's College of Medicine]  .
Speaker 2: Mm--hm.
Speaker 1: And that--I don't know how long a period that really sort of, you know, changed over.  But how long a period was it?
Speaker 2: Well the immediate effect was that he had enough blacks to make it a regular daytime school.  Prior to that time, it had been largely an evening school. And the white professors would teach at Georgetown or work in the Smithsonian or various chemistry or scientific laboratories around the city.  And then around three o'clock they'd come to Howard and teach the Howard medical students until, you know, seven or eight at night.  Now this was all right for the students, because they could hold down full-time jobs downtown and then come to school in the evening.  And it worked well.  But that's not what you need academically. And for accreditation and a lot of other reasons, Mordecai and the dean wanted a full--time faculty.  So by this mechanism, they were able to bring African Americans with the requisite education and qualifications to the school. And they became full--time faculty. So that Howard, in effect, had the first full--time African American medical faculty anywhere in the world.
Speaker 1: And then--Okay.  That's even before--Let's see--.
Speaker 2: That was before--long before my time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well as I said, when I came to medical school, that faculty was in place.
Speaker 1: Was already in place.
Speaker 2: That was in place.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 2: And I didn't realize how they got there.  You know I didn't know then.  It wasn't until I read Rayford Logan's book ['Howard University: One Hundred Years'] years later that it became clear.  Now then--The issue was that, you know at this point in time, even when you come through medical school, about--I think I had read  85% of the doctors were being trained--black doctors were being trained--.
Speaker 1: Mm--hm.
Speaker 2: Either at Meharry or Howard.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Howard.  That's correct.
Speaker 2: But then the issue that you were just speaking to--you know, that was the--opening up opportunities, you know, as the (unclear) for black doctors.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: So they would not be just constricted to, you know or, Freedmen's Hospital or , you know, other places wherever they would go back to their home.  Home towns and things like that.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yes.  Washington [D.C.]  is a classic example.  When the [Howard] medical school opened, they had six white faculty members, two black medical faculty members.  And the blacks could not join the Medical Society of the District of Columbia.  Neither could they join the AMA. Because the AMA said, "In order to join the national AMA, you had to be a member of a local constituent society."  So since they weren't allowed to join the D.C. Medical Society, they couldn't join the AMA.  And, of course, Dr. [W. Montague] Cobb fought against that, and in 1958 they were able to do that.  Now the hospital situation wasn't much better.  Freedmen's Hospital was the only hospital that allowed black doctors to have full privileges up to the 1960s. And they gradually won that battle.  When I started practicing in 1961, I had privileges at one hospital.  I was able to get privileges at Providence Greater Southeast Community. And eventually, before I stopped practicing, I had privileges at Sibley, at Capitol Hill, at the Washington Hospital Center, at the Children's Hospital.  And that was true, eventually, for all qualified black physicians.  The--I must tell you that the early years were not always easy, because our patients were discriminated once they were admitted.  They would be put in certain rooms. And it wasn't until protest were made--In other words,  you could call to get a patient in, and they'd say, "We don't have a bed."  And there were empty beds. But they didn't have a bed vacant in that one or two rooms that they had relegated for blacks.  And then eventually they were--They had to place blacks in the rooms with whites in order to accommodate them.  And once they breached that, then there wasn't a problem of getting them admitted.  But I must tell you that I always felt that there was someone looking over my shoulder while I'd go in the operating room.  There were people who, I'm sure, looked at my patients' records to see what I was doing, and saying, how I was conducting my practice--I always felt that I was being watched.  And it took time for the city, which had a long history of segregation, to accept black doctors.
Speaker 2: That must have put more pressure on you. Because it's hard enough being, you know, a young doctor, isn't it?  I mean in--?
Speaker 1: Well there was pressure.  But you see, all of my life I've had to fight about and think about discrimination and segregation.  I felt a great deal of pressure when I was in residency.  I was one black resident in that program. And when I became chief resident, there was only one other black chief resident in all of D.C. General. And he happened to have been a classmate.  I'm sorry, there were two--one in general surgery, my classmate in urology, and I was in orthopedics.
Speaker 2: And who were they?
Speaker 1: Francis Baytips (ph.) in urology and Edward Cornwell (ph.) who was on the George Washington surgical service.  But we felt that it was a mission.  We had a mission.  We had to succeed and we could not fail.  And when I went with my colleagues from the program to take the boards, I, I had to--my attitude was that if these guys can pass, I've gotta pass, too.  And I'm prepared to do whatever is necessary to see that I pass.  I don't wanna let myself down, but I don't wanna let Howard University down and the people who have sent me here.  So there was always great pressure.
Story_ID: 6872
Speaker 1: I had an unusual Army career.  You see, I was in what was called a 'Berry Plan.'  They defer you to complete your training. And the--It's with the stipulation that when you complete your training, you would come into the Army for two years.  Now in this neighborhood I went to in Pimlico [neighborhood in Baltimore, Maryland], I think I gave my draft board fits. Because I kept getting educational deferments.  And I was the only African American male in that neighborhood who was of draft age that they didn't pull into the service.  And by the time I--you see, once I got through college, I got a deferment for medical school. And when I finished medical school, I got a deferment because I was doing a residency.  And so by getting into the Berry Plan, they couldn't touch me.  And so I think they were really quite annoyed about all that. But in any case, I enrolled in the Berry Plan. And I was guaranteed deferment until I completed my residency--which I did in December of 1960.  And once I did that, they still couldn't draft me. Because now the government--I'm subject to the call of the Army, not the draft board.  And I went to the Pentagon, had a physical. And they said, "Here's a list of places where you can be assigned.  Pick out where you'd like to go," for my two year commitment on that.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Now what year is this?
Speaker 1: This is 1961, 1961.  I finished my training December 31, 1960.  And I had put down these places where I wanted to go. And I started with Hawaii. And I said California, England, Germany, Italy, and then New Jersey (chuckling).  You see, it didn't make any difference. Because they wrote back and they said, "We're sorry.  We can't use you now.  We have 170 orthopedic surgeons and we don't need any more.  But you may come into the Army as an MOS--3100."  Now that happens to be a GP.  And I said, "This doesn't make sense.  I spent five years becoming an orthopedic surgeon. And why should I come into the Army as a GP and do histories and physicals?  I'll lose all my skills by the end of two years if this is all you'll have me do."
Speaker 2: GP is the general practitioner.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) General practitioner, yes.  General duty medical officer.  So they said, "All right, then you must join a reserve unit."  An active reserve unit. Which meant--and I did. Which meant I drilled every Thursday night and one weekend out of every month.  And I did that from the first of January up until around September or August when they--President [John F.] Kennedy became exercised about the Berlin Wall, and he called up these reserve units.  And one of the units he called was my reserve hospital unit.  Now I had been told by the members of that unit that you don't have to worry. Because this is a thousand--bed general hospital, and you should know and seek comfort in the fact that during the Korean War they never called a thousand--bed general hospital.  So you'll be safe with us.  You'll never get called.  And they called us.  And, of course, I went to Fort Meade.  Now professionally it was good. Because I was the only one of two orthopedic surgeons in that hospital. And we had lots of work to do, which was good professionally.  It was not good in terms of finances. Because, after I finished my training, I increased my life insurance. I bought a house, and bought a new car.  And quite frankly I couldn't make those payments comfortably on a captain's salary.  But I only stayed in about a year.  They finally decided that this war wasn't so bad, and they let all of us out.  And because we now had almost a year of active duty--combined with the other years of inactive reserve, they said, "You don't have to continue to drill."  So I didn't have to drill anymore--Thursday nights or weekends. And I had to remain in that inactive capa--status until I reached my thirty-fifth birthday, when I resigned my  commission.  So I'm ex--captain now (chuckling). And have been so since 1965.
Speaker 2: When you talk about drilling, you said "drill--?"
Speaker 1: Well you go out to--this was an Army hospital.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh I see.  Okay.  all right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It's not--this is a thousand--bed Army hospital. And we'd go out to the armory and they would--we would--one of us would give a lecture to the doctors and they would have the--they had enlisted men who were corpsmen.  The medical corpsmen would do things; the nurses would do things.  But this was sort of a, you know--"make busy" I use to call it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So in 1961 you're sort of doing your, you know, your medical corps duties.
Speaker 1: Mm--hmm.
Speaker 2: You also are at D.C.--?
Speaker 1: Part of--no, no.  Part of '62.  See when I went to the Army--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh I see.
Speaker 1: See I went in mid--'61, and got out in mid--'62.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 1: So everything stopped.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 1: My work at D.C. General, my private practice--everything came to a screeching halt.  I went into the Army.  I stayed about eleven months, I came out. Then I resumed again.
Story_ID: 6873
Speaker 1: So you resumed again.  You were thirty--two when you resumed again?  No--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, thirty--two.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Thirty--two.  I always wondered that.  And then a year later you become chief of orthopedic surgery [at Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C., and at Freedmen's Hospital]
Speaker 2: A year and a half or so later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: '64 [1964].  I had to pass the boards.  I took the boards in '64.  I was delayed because you have to practice in one location for two years. And the Army interrupted that.  So I put together the time had before, the time when I had came out afterwards, then I had the practice requirements. And I applied for the boards.  I passed the boards and--I think they--you take them in June. And then in July Dr. [Burke] Syphax made me chief.
Speaker 1: Well this was a big deal, you being made chief.
Speaker 2: Oh it was wonderful.  It was a professional dream come true.  I'd always wanted to teach.  And I always-- something in medicine. And orthopedics was my specialty. I wanted to teach orthopedics.  So I was now made chief of orthopedics--orthopedic surgeon and chief of the hospital.  So I had responsibility for all the orthopedic education in the hospital.
Speaker 1: And this is at D.C.?
Speaker 2: No, this is at Freedmen's Hospital.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Freedmen's Hospital.
Speaker 2: But as it turned out, because we had a major service at D.C. General, I became chief there, too.
Speaker 1: Okay, because all the other hospitals start even pulling out, you said, in time.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.  They eventually pulled out.
Speaker 1: In time.
Speaker 2: Same thing happened at the VA [Veteran's Administration].  I had to fight to get a--one resident's job over there in the VA hospital.  And then we got a resident in. And then first G--George Washington left. And then next Georgetown left.  And so the hospital that I had to fight to get in eventually became totally Howard [University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C..]  So now Howard has all of the VA hospital. We have a service at Provident, which is the only one.  We have a service at Children's Hospital, and there's only one other school over there.  So in the inner--city, we are the major university.
Speaker 1: What is meant by "full privileges?"  Like if you didn't have full privileges, what did that mean?
Speaker 2: Well let's say you are--You're just out of training and you're inexperienced.  You may get provisional privileges. Which means that you will be allowed to do surgeries. But you may have to clear them with the chief of the service or a senior person.  You may not do all kinds of surgery, because you may not have had the training to permit you to do that.  But full unrestrictive privileges means that you can do, according to your practice delineation, all of these procedures.  But people who have restrictive privileges usually have--Let's say there's a man who has very bad experience in doing foot surgery.  Well they may give him privileges which restrict foot surgery.  Now by choice some people decide they don't wanna do spine surgery. They don't wanna do hand surgery. And that may--they may have a self--imposed restriction on them.
Story_ID: 6874
Speaker 1: I was asking about you having to balance, you know, being chief [of orthopedic surgery at Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C. and at Freedmen's Hospital] and then your, you know, your practice and--was it assumed back then that everyone would open up, you know, that you would have a private practice?
Speaker 2: Yes.  If you are going to be a surgeon and in charge of a surgical program, you've got to be an operating surgeon.  No one respects a surgeon who doesn't operate.  And if you're going to be training people, you have got to be in there doing and showing.  And that's one of the reasons I became dean [of Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], because I had reached a point after twenty--four years that I no longer wanted to do that, and I was looking for a career change.  So I had actually planned to retire in 1985--I'm sorry--I was planning--in 1989, which would have been twenty-five years.  In my mind, twenty-five years as chief of anything like that is long enough.  But I became--I was appointed dean in September of '88 [1988].  That's nine months before.  But during the time that I was doing all those--juggling all those things I was--I was chief in the medical school, chief in the hospital, and program director [of Howard University Orthopedic Residency Training Program at Freedmen's Hospital].  So this meant I was responsible for the education of the sixteen residents.  I was responsible for the orthopedic education of 450 medical students.  Then I was administratively responsible for the programs that we maintained at the other hospitals.  So we had three residents at Southeast Community [Hospital], we had three residents at Providence [Hospital, Washington, D.C.], we had three at the VA [Veterans' Administration], we had one at Children's [Hospital], and we had the bulk of them at D.C. General Hospital.  So I'm responsible for each of these programs, although there is someone who reports to me who is on site.  Now while that's going on, I had a busy, four--man professional corporation, had about nineteen employees who were working in there.  We had two sites, at least--always had at least two offices--a suburban site and one in the city.  And so that really kept things going.  And as you may know, the senior partner is the one who the problems sort of percolate up to.  And so I was the senior partner in that practice as well.
Story_ID: 6875
Speaker 1: Now during all this time, because I was prepared,  and because I had an interest in academia and organized medicine, I became involved in other organizations.  For example, the Washington Orthopedic Society, which is a local group of orthopedic surgeons.  I joined that organization in 1961. In 1968, I became the first African American president of that.  The local medical society, I joined in 1961 also. In 1979, I was the first African American to become president of the medical society.  My wife, interestingly enough, became the first woman president--African American woman--in 1992.  I joined national organizations.  In the National Medical Association, which is the counterpart of the AMA [American Medical Association] for black physicians, I helped start the orthopedic section and became its chairman.
Speaker 2: What year was that, that you started the orthopedic section?
Speaker 1: In the early '60s [1960s].  You see, it was around--probably around '63, '62, '63, somewhere in there. After--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Now why is it that they didn't have a orthopedic section?  Was it because everything was included? Or was because there weren't that many for--?
Speaker 1: There weren't that many.  There were so few orthopedists that at the AMA they sort of included us in the general surgery section where there were lots of people.  But beginning in the early '60s, more and more people finished training.  For example, the year I completed my boards, two other men did as well.  Well once we got to the point where we had at least a half a dozen of us, then we wanted to have our own section.  And that's what we did.  And now we have a large section.  Sometimes our meetings have as many as ninety people.
Speaker 2: Do you remember who was part of that original group?
Speaker 1: Oh yes.  There was Marvin Shelton, Raymond Pierce--those two names stand out. And it went on from there.  Then in the majority orthopedic organizations I joined the Academy--Orthopedic Academy.  That's called the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons.
Story_ID: 6876
Speaker 1: Can you talk about the process that, you know, that first you had to be board certified.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This was the way the process evolves.  In order to become board certified, to get your--that's the threshold--you have to get your boards.  You have to be a graduate of an accredited medical school--such as Howard University.  You have to be a graduate of an approved residency program.  That was a program at Howard--Freedmen's Hospital and D.C. General Hospital.  And then you have to practice--and at the end of that period, you take the first part of the examination--a written and an oral.  And then you have to practice for two years.  And so when you apply for Part Two, you have to submit records of patients that you treated and the hospitals where you have practiced or queried, to see if you've been a legitimate, honest, ethical practitioner.  Now if you've satisfy all of the peer review, then you sit for the examination. And you pass that, you're given a certificate. And then you become a diplomate of the American Board of Orthopedic Surgeons.  That was established in 1934.  Now once you have become boarded, then you can apply to the Academy. The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons.  That's an all--encompassing group and today there--we have meetings, and there're about 27,000 orthopedists there, you see.  So that is the largest umbrella organization of orthopedic surgeons.  Now there're subgroups within that. And one is the American Orthopedic Association, which was basically the professors at the various institutions.  Now I applied fo--I was sponsored for that by John Adams and another man, Tom Akin, from Grand Rapids. And I was elected a member of that organization. It's by invitation only--in 1975.  Five years later--I mean ten years later, in 1985, I became the first African American president of that organization.  The membership has now increased to about 400 or so. But in those days there were probably only 200 members.  It was considered an honor to be, you know, elected to that.  In the Academy, I was appointed Chairman of the Task Force on ethics. And we worked on a code of ethics for two years. And presented it to the Academy, it was approved.  And then I was appointed Chairman of the first committee on ethics for the Academy. And I stayed as Chairman for six years.
Story_ID: 6877
Speaker 1: What were the issues that you were talking about in terms of ethics that were--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) For the Academy [American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons]?
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: The usual ones.  Fees, ethics, the improper ethics from scientific investigations, informed consent, patient rights. Those things that were generally being considered by the AMA [American Medical Association] as well.  Now in the AMA, I was appointed to the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs. And I served two terms--five years for one and four in the other.  And, of course, that body looks at the entire spectrum of ethical issues:  surrogate motherhood, abortion--all those issues.  And the strength that fills in the, the diversity of the membership--I mean, I was an orthopedist. There might have been an internist there, a general surgeon, an allergist, you see.  And we had ethical consultation.  We had ethicists who, you know, consulted with us.  The orthopedic group was primarily concerned with issues that affect orthopedic surgeons.  I was a member of the American College of Surgeons.  That's the umbrella organization for all of--for surgeons.  And I served as a governor of the American College of Surgeons.  That's a group that--sort of like the governing body--makes decisions.  Oh incidentally, I was appointed in 1970, an oral examiner for the American Board of Orthopedic Surgery.  And as an oral examiner, once a year, you go to Chicago, and you actually give oral examinations to candidates.  And I did that for twenty years.  I stopped--I think twenty-two years.  I stopped around 1992.  But during that time, I was elected to the board. And that board has only twelve members on it.  And I served a term of six years as a member of the board.  Now that board actually constructs the examination.  They make up the questions. They administer the examination, and certify who has passed and who hasn't.  I was chairman of the recertification committee. And that committee first of all--After the board approved that there would be recertification, this committee developed the recertification examination and mechanism.  I was a member of the Board of Directors of the 'Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery', which is the premier orthopedic journal in the country--if not in the world.  The office is in Boston, called JBJS briefly for the initials of the letters.  I served as a member of that board for six years. And was Vice--Chair my last year.  I was also a member of the Association of Child Prosthetic and Orthotic Clinics.  Now that's an organization of the clinic chiefs that service these clinics where children were treated for limb deficiencies.  Remember one of the things I did at D.C. General [Hospital] was develop a special clinic for limb-deficient children. And we functioned as a regional clinic.  And I had--patients would come from not just D.C., but Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, West Virginia. And we even had some from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.  And these were children who were born with portions of limbs missing. And others who would have trauma and have their limbs amputated by a bus accident or a car accident or fire.  And then some had diseases such as tumors, and they had to have their limbs amputated for that reason.  And there were about seventy--five clinics here and in Canada that would meet annually. And discuss problems and innovations and so forth.  And I became president of that group.  I think that was around 1981.  As I said, because I was prepared, and there were opportunities--I had an opportunity to become the first in many of these organizations. Whereas today it wouldn't be considered, you know, anything remarkable.  I think in those days it was, because no one else had been there, you know, before.
Story_ID: 6878
Speaker 1: Dr. Epps, let me ask you.  When you were like the first at the Academy or, you know--or you may want to structure it, depending on what the organization is. But I'm talking about the majority organizations.  What did you find in terms of those physicians' approach to the world, the networks that may have been opened up.  I'm just wondering did you find a new world there? At all?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well you know, they say that America is the--the most segregated time in America is 11:00 on Sunday mornings. When we go to our churches and they go to their churches.  But I can tell you that there's a great divide in medicine as well.  And where things may be very well integrated up to 5:00, we go home and they go home.  And I found that there were some people who treated me as another orthopedic surgeon, and there were others who kept me at arm's breadth. And, in fact, there were some who literally ignored me.  They never looked at me; they looked through me.  And you could tell by their body English,  and by their manner, that they really didn't care that I was there. They'd rather that I were not there.  Now having grown up in a segregated southern town and experienced all these indignities that we have to have, I learned early to perceive people who felt that way about me.  And I have come to refer to them--to people who treat me with respect and with--and show humanity to me, and look beyond the color of my skin--I refer to them as having "soul".  And it's a term I use talking to my colleagues who are black, who seem to understand.  And we can be talking about somebody, and we'll say, "Well, you  know, that man has soul.  That brother has soul."  We're talking about someone who's white, but if  I say, "He has soul," he knows what I mean.  Now interestingly enough, I have had a number of friends who are Canadians. And uniformly I've found that Canadian orthopedists always treated me with the utmost respect.  And, in fact, one of my dearest friends to this day is a man that I met in 1961, when I first finished training and started traveling.  I went to a meeting of these crippled--of these amputee clinic chiefs.  And we were standing against the wall. And he was standing there, I was standing there. I didn't know at the time, that was his first meeting, it was my first meeting,  I didn't know him, he didn't know me.  But we sort of turned to each other, extended our hands, said, "How do you do?  My name is--"  I said, "Charlie Epps." He said, "I'm John Hall."  And he and I immediately became friends.  It turned out that I had four children, he had seven.  Their ages sort of matched.  And in those years--that's forty--one  years, we have been and still are close friends.  In fact, when we go to Florida next week, they're gonna come over to see us. And we were just in Boston visiting them.  But each summer we would send two kids up to spend a week or two with him, and the next summer he would send two kids down to spend two weeks with us.  It was that sort of a relationship.  But professionally he was--he greeted me as a person, he-- as an orthopedist. And it never mattered to him.  And there were at least two or three other Canadians who treated me the same way.  Now on the other hand, I have encountered orthopedic surgeons from the deep South. And I could just see them tense and freeze when I entered the group.  They may not have been aware of the fact. But it became clear to me by their body Anglish--English--to some extent their facial expressions, and in the inflections of their voice--that they really weren't happy to have me there.  But that made me even more determined to stay there and to represent myself well.
Speaker 1: Now patients--did you have any patients who, like, immediately when they saw--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh sure.
Speaker 1: You were black they were--?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: You know, they did not want you to treat them.
Speaker 2: And I must say that I had--initially I had a all white--I mean all black practice. I was at Freedmen's Hospital is where I saw my patients, where I operated. And the first experience I had dealing with a white patients was while I was a resident.  I was sent to the VA Hospital.  I was the first black resident in orthopedics at the VA [Veterans' Administration] Hospital here in Washington. And the first white patient I operated on was a man from the deep South--who had--while I was operating, they had some difficulty with his blood pressure--his blood pressure dropped and I had to rush the operation to get finished.  And I was deathly afraid that my speed may have compromised the result.  But in any case, in the VA they have a system whereby you can send someone home for six weeks to convalesce and then bring them back.  And in the course of events I sent him home. And then he came back.  I removed his cast. And the operation had healed perfectly, much to my great relief.  Well he turned out to be a, quite a nice gentleman, even though he was from Mississippi and up to that point, the only people I knew from Mississippi were [Senator] Bilbo, who was always vilified in the newspaper. This terrible senator from Mississippi.  But this man showed me that he was just another man. And I'd learned as I treated white patients and operated on them, that they have the same fallacies and problems and virtues that the black people have.  Their station in life may be better, because they have more money. They have more opportunities, but they're still basically people.  And once you cut through that epidermis, you go through the skin, we all look alike inside.  But I did find that there were people who would object to my treating them.  And I'll tell you about an experience I had at Southeast Community Hospital [Washington, D.C.].  And this is how--And this was sort of replicated in almost every white or majority group in which I ventured.  A patient comes into the emergency room. And they tell them, "I don't have an orthopedic surgeon."  So they said, "Fine.  We'll call our orthopedic surgeon."  Now I come in and when they see me, their face drains. And I could see that oh boy! They weren't expecting this. And nobody had prepared them.  So I introduced myself and I say, "I'm going to the X--ray department to see your x--rays and I'll be back."  Now while I'm gone they make a protest, "I don't want that doctor treating me, and blah, blah, blah, blah."  And when I come back, the medical director of the hospital comes in. And the first person I see--I saw do this was John Gartland (ph.), who was medical director of Southeast Community.  And he said, "Madam, you came to the hospital. And we've determined that you need an orthopedist.  You don't have your--an orthopedic surgeon as a, you know, a personal orthopedic surgeon. And we've called--And you don't have a family doctor who can recommend an orthopedic surgeon to you.  Therefore, if you are going to receive any orthopedic care in this hospital for this problem tonight, it's gonna be our doctor, who is Dr. Epps.  Now you have a choice of accepting him as your doctor--okay, he's perfectly qualified; that's why we have him here. Or you can get dressed and leave."  And given that choice, I never had a person say, "I'm gonna leave 'cause I don't want this doctor to take care of me."  Now that put--was a challenge to me now to give this patient the very best care. So they could never say, "Well you called this black doctor in here. And look at what he did to me."  Now that happened a number of times in different contexts. But I've always found that if you treat the patient with professionalism and show them humanity and respect, that they will respond in kind.  And so I've not really had any problems.  But I went to--I was a consultant to a group health association.  Same situation. First black orthopedist down there. And I had no problems there.  I went to the VA as a resident. And then later as a consultant.  I consulted at Walter Reed [Army Medical Center]. I've consulted at the Naval Hospital in Bethesda [Maryland]. And in none of those situations was I ever, you know--did a situation arise where I had to not treat a patient, because the patient refused.  Now I must say that the administration of all the institutions realized that to have allowed that to take place might have put them (chuckling) in jeopardy. Because I'm being discriminated against, if they allow that situation, you know, to occur.  But it does put--I must say ,it puts you under some stress. Because you've got to perform then.  You've got to do all that you're supposed to do and carry it off well.  And I tried not to ever show any expression in my face that I was upset by what these people were doing.  But I can only tell you that when you're the only black in a hospital operating on patients--I mean I always felt that the doctors are watching, the patients are watching, the nurses are watching.  On the other hand, when I would walk down the hall and I would see a black nurse and our eyes met, there was some recognition.  When I would see the janitor who was mopping the floor--These people were so happy to see a black doctor in these situations, that they gave me a signal that always gave me comfort.
Story_ID: 6879
Speaker 1: Let's look back over your, you know, your teaching at, you know, at, at Howard Medical School [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  Can you tell me what students, you know, that we--you know, that you sort of brought through there or have gone on?  And then--But before you do that, can you talk about what you enjoyed most about teaching.
Speaker 2: Well the thing I enjoyed most about teaching is that little glimmer in the eye of a student when they get the message.  And it is something that you can see.  For example, if I'm teaching students about carpal tunnel syndrome, which involves the median nerve compression at the wrist.  And if I have first told them about the median nerve and its distributions and so forth. And then I come back and present them with a patient. And I give them in a little different perspective symptoms that would--should make them call upon their knowledge and understanding of the median nerve to make a diagnosis.  And when they can do that, then it clicks. And you know that what you've been--your message has gotten through.  That's always--gives you a great feeling of satisfaction.  Now the same would happen with residents.  If I'm training a resident and I do an operation on a carpal tunnel. And I showed him how to do it. And then the time comes when he can do one. You know, with my just watching. And I know that he has mastered that technique, that makes you, makes you feel good.  And I've had residents who have gone on.  I've had--There are two former residents who are working at the Dupont Institute in, in Delaware. I've had one go back to--a couple go back to India.  I've had one to go to--back home to Peru.  And there lots of practicing--ones practicing right around here in this neighborhood [Washington, D.C.].  All together I've trained about--more than seventy men and women in orthopedics.  There are some--more than 3000--close to 4000 medical students over the years.  The man who is currently chief of orthopedics at Howard was my medical student and my resident.  When he finished, we arranged for him to go to New York to spend time with a man who took care of the New York Mets and the New York Jets. And he returned with specialties in sports medicine.  Now he takes care of all the Howard [University] teams. And he's also, you know,  chief of the division.
Speaker 1: And his name?
Speaker 2: Terry Thompson.  Dr. Richard Grant, who was one of my medical students. He trained and got his orthopedics in the Air Force is currently president of the American Board of Orthopedic Surgery. Which gives me a great pride.  You know, I was the first [African American] member to go on that Board. And there had been no one on that Board for thirteen years after I left.  And somehow we (chuckling) were able to get him on the Board. And now he's the president.  So a lot of these things happened that give you great pride as a teacher.  And I go to cities anywhere. And there--now there's a large cadre of black orthopedists practicing.  I know someone practically in every city.  And, of course, there's so many more medical students that I've taught that I don't remember first hand. I may have a faint recognition. And they come up and say, "Dr. Epps, I was in the Class of 1989."  And, you know, it just makes you feel good.  Because I taught every class from 1961 up to even now.  I still give lectures to the medical students in orthopedics.  But in my earlier days, I was doing most of the teaching all by myself during the '60s [1960s] and the '70s [1970s] and maybe even the early '80s [1980s].  And as a teacher, that's great satisfaction.  Now let me just share one other thing with you.  This past Sunday, I was invited by Pastor Vera Mitchell.  She's the pastor of the United Methodist Church in Iverson--on Iverson Street--to talk to them about--her congregation about Negro history week. Which I do, you know, somehow, seem like every year, some place.  And so I said, "I'd be glad to come down and do that."  And she told me that I had--her daughter had been a patient of mine.  "Oh," I said, "Oh how nice." But, you know, I didn't remember.  That was over thirty years ago.  So anyway, I went down and I gave the talk. And then she called her daughter up afterwards and said to the congregation that I had operated on her daughter's arm, which had been deformed by a fracture. And she had a tight heel cord and I lengthened that. And she could now wear regular shoes. And she was so pleased.  And she asked her daughter to come up. And she presented to me a present on behalf of the congregation.  And it brought tears to my eyes to--This girl said that I had made her life normal. And she was just so thankful because she could now use her arm normally. And she could walk.  And you know, kids who have deformities often put their arms behind their back. Which is what she did.  But I looked out in the audience. And there were women dabbing their eyes, because it was so touching to have this girl talk. Well that sort of thing makes you feel good.  And I go in the bank, you know. And I'll be making a deposit. And the bank teller would say, "Are you Dr. Charles Epps?"  I say, "Yes."  He says, "Well, you know, I knew you a long time ago and you haven't changed a day!"  Well that makes you really feel good.  And she says, "You took care of my son or my daughter." Or whatever. And it just gives you a feeling.
Speaker 1: What did you find the most challenging about teaching?
Speaker 2: Well I guess it--the volume of material.  You see, orthopedics is a sub--specialty in the field of surgery.  And then there's all of medicine, there's obstetrics, there's psychiatry, there's pediatrics.  So we are just one small area. And everybody thinks that you've gotta know everything about our area.  I don't care about the others, but you've gotta know this.  The most challenging thing is to try to teach them the things that are most important that every doctor should know about orthopedics, whether he's gonna be a gynecologist or pediatrician, whatever.  That's the challenge. To make sure they know these basic fundamentals. Whether they're interested in orthopedics or not.  The ones that are interested are going to want to learn, but those who have some other interest, there's a certain body of information--fundamental information that you wanna get to them.
Story_ID: 6880
Speaker 1: Can we talk a little bit about prosthetics?
Speaker 2: Prosthetics?
Speaker 1: Prosthetics.  Okay. And the developments or lack of developments you have seen over your career life for sensitivity for working with African Americans.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yes.
Speaker 1: You know, 'cause I was even told that the colors weren't, you know. And sometimes we get the hand-me-downs and--.
Speaker 2: Well I'm not so sure we've ever got the hand-me-downs. But the greatest difficulty in dealing with African Americans is that they only had basically one color tone for African Americans. Which was a very dark brown, which on the plastic made it shiny. So that it really didn't look realistic.  Now they have been much more sensitive to that. And they can give you shades of brown and the finish--the cosmetic finishes are so much more superior to what they used to be.  Now this is true just for the artificial limbs. But even more so for cosmetic gloves and cosmetic restorations.  Say someone who loses a hand. And you got a glove to go over the artificial hand.  They've been good at making finger nails and wrinkles and that sort of thing. But now they can make the color close.  They used to, for example, you know--Our palms are not the color of the back of our hands and I've seen gloves that was same brown color all over.  Well now they make a glove that is brown on the dorsum and a shade more pink in the palm, which is very gratifying.
Speaker 1: Did you--Both developments in prosthetics--I mean--just talk about the role of prosthetics and how, you know, how that has sort of developed. Because people before--if you lost a limb, you lost a limb. Right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well the impetus--the great impetus to prosthetics came after World War Two.  And that's when they improved the mechanic--mechanically they were improved. So you had better joints.  You had lighter--weight materials.  And that was because there were so many men who'd lost limbs in World War Two.  So that when the Korean War, the Vietnam War came along, these new improvements were all in place. And those veterans got a much better shape.  The Veterans Administration has always had--since World War Two, a very large enterprise for prosthetics and orthotics, too, I might add.  That's when--that's bracing.  But the prosthetics in the Veterans Administration has always been very good.  And they have even today a very formidable research program.  Now so the mechanical things and the weight of the materials that we use were improved.  Now the thing that has happened since the space age  is that they've been able to use miniaturized motors and even better materials to develop prostheses for the upper extremity.  Because we now have motors that can operate the fingers of a artificial hand. They have proportional control so that you can even pick up an egg and not crush it. And move it to a place and put it down. So--they even have things that now have you proprioceptive feedback.  All of these things have come out of the space age with the miniaturization and the new techniques that have developed there.  So there's been a great development since World War II in prosthetics in general.
Story_ID: 6881
Speaker 1: And what other developments have occurred in the field? You know, during your really forty--year career?
Speaker 2: In my career?  Well take for example arthroscopic surgery.  We use to make a large incision, if we wanted to look in the elbow. Had to make a large incision and open it up widely and then close it up.  We can now place an instrument a little larger than a needle. And smaller even than a fountain pen--I thought I had one there--smaller than a fountain pen, through which you can see.  You have complete visualization of the inside of the joint. And through another puncture wound you place in surgical instruments so that you can manipulate and operate through these--in this manner, which greatly reduces the time for recovery, the pain you have after the surgery. And it's just miraculous what arthroscopic surgery is now able to do.  They also developed artificial tendons and ligaments.  And then there've been great improvements in anesthesia. So that people--it's safer for people to be put to sleep for surgical procedures.  There's also the artificial joints that have been developed.  And now we can replace literally every joint in the body. Including the little joints in the fingers.  We don't bother much about the toes. Although you can replace joints in the great toe.  But you can replace--The hip, perhaps, is the most successful joint replacement procedure of all.  Next comes the knee. Then you have the shoulder.  We have them for the elbow, the ankle, the wrist. It's just marvelous what has happened.  And all that has come about since 1961 when I started practicing.
Speaker 1: And once again, what were the things that were sort of driving it?  Were--Was it the medical profession itself?  Was it certain industries like the sports, you know, sports?  Was it--were, you know, 'cause I thought it was interesting that you said something, you know, some of the technologies came out of the space industry.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Mm--hmm.
Speaker 1: So just wondering what was sort of driving--?
Speaker 2: Well I think that the first scopes that were used were used in the bladder. So that they could crush bladder stones and the like.  And as a matter of fact, in orthopedics the first actual scopes were cystoscopes that were introduced into the knee. To see inside the knee.  Well, once that concept evolved, then the orthopedist collaborated with the--with industry, and developed specific scopes for joints.  And so now they can look in the hip joint, the knee joint, the ankle joint, the wrist joint. And they now use them for abdominal surgery, use them for chest surgery.  You know, one area that makes a development and then it spreads throughout all of medicine.  And that's exactly what has happened.  You develop the technology. And then each branch of medicine borrows from it and applies it to their own special needs. So that now in practically every surgical specialty, endoscopes are being used.  And the first one was a cystoscope looking in the bladder.
Speaker 1: Any other developments that were sort of, you know, sort of important or, you know, sort of--?
Speaker 2: Well they've learned to use laser energy in surgery. Which also helps reduce morbidity.  And you can work in areas where we couldn't before.  We're now using mini--incisions.  We're able to do surgery through very small incisions.  They've also devised new methods of doing cosmetic surgery.  In orthopedics we're more concerned about function, so we don't, you know, have a lot of interest in cosmetic things. But in plastic surgery it's marvelous the things that they are doing to make people look better.  But we've learned how to take care of people better.  We can--we have improved means of anesthesia. We have improved means of pain control.  You can now put a pump on a patient and he can adjust his own medication.  He can administer his own medication, as much as he needs.  We could never do that before. He had to call a nurse, if you needed an intravenous dose of morphine.  But now the patient can control that.
Story_ID: 6882
Speaker 1: Now another interesting thing--Just because your career has been so long--is the area of hospital administration.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Mm--hmm.
Speaker 1: So much has changed, you know, during that time.  And I'm wondering sort of your--You know, what some of the challenges were that you experienced and then some of the things that have been impacted either by--on hospitals? Whether, you know, it's just outright costs or some things that are related to liability. You know, the insurance and, you know--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Mm--hmm.  Well with respect to the matter of hospitalization in general, the greatest change has been the fact that we've converted from an in--patient mode of treatment to out--patient. So that we used to admit people to do a simple bunionectomy or to remove a little ganglion off of the back of the wrist.  Now that's all done as an outpatient.  The patient does not stay in the hospital.  He comes in, the surgery is done. He recovers for a brief period. And then he goes home.  So that has radically changed. And as a result, we don't need as many hospital beds as we did before.  Now wherever there is a--You know, they say nature abhors a vacuum.  And so whatever--whenever we found ways of reducing inpatient care, we've expanded the outpatient care.  And so we can do lots of different procedures for patients now as an outpatient.  The ambulatory surgery--The surgi--centers all over the country where they're not even admitted to a hospital.  They come--You give them instructions so they fast the night before from midnight. They come in, they have the surgery. And they stay for an hour or so. And they go home.  Now most hospitals have risen to meet that challenge. So they have outpatient surgery within the hospital.  And then there are some free-standing surgery centers.  The insurance coverage has still been a problem.  We've got forty-one million people [in the United States] who don't have insurance coverage. And I think that's a problem for all of society.  Somehow we've gotta reduce the cost of delivery of medical care.  We haven't been able to do that very well.  So that it's embarrassing to find that many of these people--perhaps two-thirds of them who don't have insurance coverage are working.  They are the working poor.  We can't provide a salary high enough for them to purchase--or the owner of the company doesn't feel that he can afford to pay, you know, for the insurance.  So--but our whole society has to address that.  We purport to be the--to have the best medical delivery system in the world.  Our patients have the best health care in the world. Which may be true for those who get it.  But until we can take care of those people who at this time don't have it, then I think we--that's an empty boast.  We really can't say that.  But It's a problem that all of us will have to work with.  Now there are other issues, of course. One of which is professional liability.  Now you notice in my CV that I was chairman of the attorney-in-fact, for the National Capital Reciprocal Insurance Company . The commercial insurance that our doctors in Washington [D.C.] had to purchase was gradually--was rapidly increasing in price. So that by 1979--the year I was president of the medical society--we could no longer afford the insurance rates.  And so we decided to form our own company. And we did.  And we formed a reciprocal company.  Now that's an arrangement by which there are two separate companies.  One is in charge of day--to--day operations.  The other is a company that represents the subscribers or stockholders.  And I was chairman of the board when this company came on line. And I became chairman of the attorney-in-fact, which was National Capital Underwriters, Inc.--the operating arm of the company.  And you'd be surprised to know that at that time we could not obtain re-insurance and excess insurance anywhere in the United States.  We had to go to London to get it from Lloyds of London. And we've continued to do that for now twenty more years. But that was the only way that we could re-insure--I mean we could insure ourselves.  Now Washington has a special problem. Because it is the only legal jurisdiction in all the United States that doesn't have some tort reform.  You know the arguments pro and con about that.  But we've just never been able to get a tort reform bill even out of the committee in the D.C. council.  So the council has never had an opportunity to vote on a tort reform measure in committee or at large.  The trial lawyers have just that great a lock on them.  But it was a real education for me to serve as attorney--chairman of the attorney-in-fact for some eighteen years.  And we did our best to hold the prices down. But they're creeping back up again. And it's not a very happy picture.
Story_ID: 6883
Speaker 1: What do you think some of the greatest challenges facing the medical industry are these days?  You know, going forward.
Speaker 2: Well I think the greatest challenge is to find some means of insuring the forty--one million people [in the United States] who don't have coverage.  The second--Another great challenge is the matter of professionalism.  When--before medicine became so highly technical, specialized, doctors used to spend more time with their patients.  You will remember the old picture of a doctor sitting at the bedside waiting for the crisis to occur in a patient who had pneumonia.  And once the crisis occurred, the temperature would come down. The patient would feel better. And he'd be over his pneumonia.  Well, doctors had to go to the bedside and do that.  They don't do that now.  They come in, give the patient penicillin or an antibiotic and the pneumonia is taken care of.  Because we have so many challenges and other things that we have to do and the paperwork, which is onerous, we don't spend as much time with our patients as we used to.  And in fact, in some of these HMO's, they are told how long they can spend with each patient.  See, you're gonna have to see thirty patients in this two--hour period.  You see.  One hundred twenty minutes; that gives you a little more than (chuckling) four minutes a patient.  That's just an exaggeration. But you understand what I'm saying.  Things are becoming so stressed that the patient sort of get short--changed in that.  So we've gotta do that.  We've gotta do a better job of relating to our patients, giving them informed consent. Making them understand what the issues are, what their choices are.  That makes for a happier patient.  But I believe that most of the big problems are not in the hands of--not in the control of the doctors.  And that has to do with how we cost and pay for medical care.  When--see, medicine has become a business now.  You have to make your expenses.  And when--for example, I was in practice with four other orthopedists, we had nineteen employees.  Well you got a tremendous payroll.  Our malpractice insurance was $250,000 a year.  That's an awful lot of money to earn to pay for your salary, for your insurance.  You got rent. You've got supplies.  If you're gonna have a pension plan you have to fund it and you have to pay--you have contribute for your employers--employees--f you're gonna contribute something for yourself.  So that makes your overhead. The burden of overhead of just doing business--so great, in the process sometimes doctors lose some of their professionalism.  Just the stress of keeping up and paying all these bills.  And something has to give there as well.
Story_ID: 6884
Speaker 1: I wanna talk a little bit about when you served as dean [of Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.]. And also Special Assistant to the President.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Mm--hmm.
Speaker 1: And there you were serving more in a decision--making policy--making, you know, over all seeing the, you know, the issues relating to early administration, which is different from teaching.  But very similar to organizational things. You know, where certain issues are being looked at.  And I was wondering what you were sort of proud of the things that you were able to do? You know, in either one of those positions?
Speaker 2: Well as dean you are like the CEO of a major enterprise.  As dean [of Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] I had 450 medical students.  I had about 100 PhD and Master's students, 200 basic science faculty, almost 500 clinical faculty. About 100--200 of those were full--time.  I had eight buildings under my responsibility.  And you're responsible for every aspect of the building. The roof, the mechanical equipment, a fire in the building. Everything flows up to the dean in that situation.  So it's a great responsibility.  There were 350 residents and interns also under the dean. And there are accrediting--accreditation issues for these eighteen residency and intern programs.  And then, of course, the medical school has a accreditation challenge as well.  Now all of that comes up to one person. And they all look to the dean.--who is imagined to be someone of great power and of great resources. Neither of which is true.  The dean (chuckling) doesn't have the money everybody imagines that he has. He's constantly facing budget reductions. And, and of course, he has a lot of power.  He can't fire tenured faculty. You know.  Students are rebellious. Sometimes faculty can be diffident.  And I found that you were imagined to have all these power and all this money which you didn't have, which made it difficult.  Now contrast that with the situation that I had as an orthopedic surgeon.  When you're a surgeon, you're the captain of the ship. you're in charge.  You can only operate on one patient at a time. And you go in and you do that operation. And your success depends upon how well you do that operation.  It's a contract between you and the patient.  On the other hand, when you're a dean, you're in charge of all these people. But--you can't control them.  And your success--you are evaluated by how well they perform.  So that means that you've gotta persuade, coax, threaten, invigor these people to do what's right and what's good.  That's the only way you're gonna look good as a dean.  So it's a very interesting contrast between being a dean and, and being a surgeon.  Now having said that, I must tell you that there was a common expression among deans that "Surgeons make better deans than internists."  And the answer to that--the reason is that a surgeon will make a decision.  And we're trained to do that.  You, you have a patient who has an a crisis, an acute problem.  You size up the patient. You examine them, you analyze, you look at the x--rays, the studies. And you decide, "This is what's wrong with this patient. And this is what I must do."  And you go and then you do it.  Because he's got appendicitis, for example, if you--if you wait too long he'll rupture.  If he's got a fracture and it's open, you've gotta operate within the first eight hours to clean it up and fix it.  Otherwise it gets osteomyelitis.  Now internists can ponder.  You know, they can say, "Let's give the patient a little fluid and some of this medicine and we'll come back and evaluate him."  You can't do that.  If you do that as a dean, things just get worse.  And surgeons tend to make decisions more rapidly than internists just by the nature of the work that they do.  But that was just a little private joke that surgeons had.  Now I enjoyed being a dean, however. Because the happiest day--There were two very, very happy days in the life of a dean.  The first is when you receive the new class. And you've all--you have 125--well one of the things I did while I was dean, I increased the enrollment from about 100 to 125.  They had been 125 at one point, then it dropped.  Well I got it back up to 125.  And when these students come in you've never seen such happiness. Because they're so--they're thrilled to be--this is a life-long ambition.  They're finally there.  They're gonna study medicine.  And the next happy day is when they are--in June when they're all leaving.  And it's happy then, because their parents are there, their families are there. Their significant other, sometimes their children are there.  So everybody is just overjoyed. And that's a wonderful time. Especially for those who are, you know, gonna be graduating.  For most people this has been at least an eight--year grind, from college--four years of college, four years of medical school. And they're finally finishing.  And there's a great relief to get through that.  Most of them have debt.  The average debt when I was dean was around $60--$70,000 for the four years of study.  Some students had more than $100,000 of debt.  But at any rate they go on from that point.
Story_ID: 6885
Speaker 1: As Vice-President of Health Affairs--in Howard there were two divisions, the academic division and the health division.  As Vice-President for Health, I--the dean of medicine, pharmacy, nursing, allied health--See--what did I leave out?  Medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, allied health and nursing all reported to me.  There were five health colleges and the [Howard University] hospital, you know. And the student health center. And the health sciences library.  Now those eight entities represented more than half of the University budget and almost half of the whole University student body. Which is a tremendous responsibility.  And as a matter of fact, the hospital is not an inconsequential part of that.  And in either case, during the two years that I was--doing my--during the two years that I was Vice-President of Health Affairs, I had to become acting CEO of the hospital as well.  And that was a greater challenge. Because there was a great difference between being a practicing surgeon--where again I said you operate on one patient at a time--and being hospital CEO where you've got all of these entities in the hospital.  Now the air conditioner cooler on the roof goes bad, that's your problem.  There's a fire in the laundry room in the basement, that's your problem.  The nurses are gonna go on strike, the pharmacists are unhappy, the social workers are having a special meeting, the house staff--the interns and residents--are threatening a job action--all these things become the concern of the CEO of a hospital.  And so for a year and a half I had not only the hospital operating problems, but I had the problems of the medical school, the dental school, the nursing school and all the others.  So that was like twenty--four hours non-stop of stress.  Together with all that we were having budget crunches. And I had to have two re-engineering or reductions enforced. Which meant we had to eliminate 400 jobs out of that--in that time frame.  And that's very difficult to tell somebody that your position has been eliminated.  Add to that the fact that D.C. Medicaid--which paid low when it paid--dear Marion Barry said he wasn't gonna pay us for ninety days (chuckling). No matter what.  He just said, "I'm not gonna pay anybody for ninety days."  Well he finally had to recant that. But that was a difficulty.  If the Medicare program was late paying, that has a tremendous effect on your cash balance.  If the Blues and the other third--party carriers were late paying--There's a certain cash flow that you have to have when you're operating a hospital.  And the re-insurance--I mean the insurance reimbursements are all decreasing all the time.  So you're constantly juggling.  I salute anybody who runs a hospital.  I think it's one of the most difficult jobs that you could have.  And it may have seemed more difficult to me because I wasn't a trained hospital administrator.  I had to do a quick learn. But--it's a job that has to be done. And I certainly salute the men and women who do it.
Speaker 2: Now how did that happen that you got a, you know, assigned as the CEO?  Was there--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Well yes.  We had a CEO and we had to, for various reasons, dismiss the CEO.  And the President of the University said because I'm the person who supervises the CEO of the hospital--"I don't have a CEO so you're gonna have to be acting CEO until we can find one."  Now we instituted a search but the search just never seemed to have been able to get the person we needed--excuse me--for a year and a half.  So for a year and a half I had that--all those responsibilities. And it was really the most challenging period of my life.
Speaker 2: Now what years were those?
Speaker 1: That was 1994 to 1996.
Story_ID: 6886
Speaker 1: Now I wanna go and just ask about Howard as a medical institution. 'Cause even in the time, you know, one other African American, you know, medical school came into being.  I think just one. Right?  Morehouse?
Speaker 2: Well actually Drew [University of Medicine] came in first in 1970.  And then Morehouse [School of Medicine] came in about six, seven years later.  So that's how there're four.  Now Drew, however, is a subset of UCLA. So it is not a free-standing medical school. Although conventional wisdom and its custom--those practices will consider it a free-standing school.  It's called one of the historically black medical schools. But the--much of the infrastructure comes through UCLA.  Morehouse is a free-standing medical school. But it has a class of about forty and it does not have a hospital.  It's basically a medical school. And, in fact it--in the early years they only had two years of education.  They can now give a degree.  In the early years those students, after two years, used to come to Howard or Meharry or some other medical school and get their diploma.  But it is doing very well now. Louis Sullivan has done a remarkable job with that institution. And it's turned out forty excellent students now.
Speaker 1: Now as someone who was trained by and spent his career with historically black college, you know, training facility, what are your thoughts about the importance of that--of these types of facilities in today's world?
Speaker 2: Well I think they're important. And I say it for two reasons.  First, if you go back in history before integration, or before the elimination of overt discrimination in the medical enterprise, only fifteen percent of the African American students were graduated from Howard and Meharry [Medical College].  I'm sorry--eighty--five percent.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Eighty--five--'cause I was just gonna say--.
Speaker 2: Eighty--five percent were graduating  from Howard and Meharry prior to the mid '60s when integration came about.  And only fifteen percent came from the majority schools.  Now it's reversed.  Fifteen to seventeen percent come from the four historically black schools and the eighty--five percent comes from the--all the majority schools.  Now we still admit students who are top flight students who have the best preparation. But we also admit some students who couldn't otherwise be admitted to medical school. And we turn them out. And they become good doctors as well.  They've done studies that show that at the end of four years these students whose MCAT scores were not as high as everybody else's, are doing well.  They go into post--graduate training programs. They do well in that. And they practice.  Now the thing that's good about them is that more students who have finished the historically black medical schools practice in the under--served communities.  In other words, they go back to the communities from which they have come.  In a far larger percentage than those who've gone to majority schools.  So there's a need for them.  And we're. still under-represented.  We're twelve percent of the population and probably less than five percent of the doctors in this country.

Speaker 1: Where are you right now, Dr. Epps, in your whole--You know, what do you wanna do for the rest of your life?
Speaker 2: The rest of my life?  Well I'm Professor  Emeritus in the [Howard University] College of Medicine. So I still give some lectures to the medical students and to the residents. You know, by invitation.  I never impose myself.  If they want me, they know where I am and I give them.  Sometimes I participate in an ethics course that's given to all the students in the health sciences center.  That meets on Wednesday and I--one year I did that on a regular basis. And now I fill in if they need somebody to help.  I'm at a point where I don't wanna be structured so that every Wednesday at 5:00 I've gotta go down there and do that.  I still am invited to give talks at other universities. And I've been to the University of Pittsburg.  I went to Stanford University--not Stanford. I went to USC since I retired. And I'm going to Marymount University [Virginia] next month.  They're gonna actually give me an award for my work in the field of medical ethics.  And so things like that happen. And, you know, there's a certain amount of preparation for that.  I'm trying to write my memoirs.  I think I've had an interesting life. And I would--I believe that my children and my grandchildren would have some interest in reading, you know, the experiences that I've had and the difficulties I've overcome.  And if the book would be good enough, it might have some interest for people beyond that.  But I'd like to put that on paper.  And so I've got that ahead of me. And there're a few other little projects that I'd like to, to work on.  But meanwhile I seem to be busy enough.  I'm on the board of the National Capital Red Cross [American Red Cross of the National Capital Area]. I sit on the board of the World Rehabilitation Fund in New York and--there're--there're some activities involved with that.
Speaker 1: Now what about the Endowed Chair?
Speaker 2: Well fortunately there's a good story with that now.  But in 1997 two of my younger colleagues--one Dr. Edward [Anthony] Rankin, who had practiced with me for fifteen years at(unclear) ten years younger. And Dr. Richard Grant, who had succeeded me--he had been my student--as chief of orthopedics [at Howard University College of Medicine]--formed a committee to work on a, an Endowed Chair.  I've always been interested in the Endowed Chair because during the time I was dean I had raised funds for four chairs.  The Howard medical school only had one. And while I was dean in those six years I was able to raise the money for four chairs, which made a number five.  They since have got one more chair--six.  But anyway we got started with that campaign and we raised about 300,000 dollars.  And a year ago we reorganized the committee under Terry Thompson, who is the chief of orthopedics currently.  And we started out anew. And most of the monies up to that point had been given by family, friends and orthopedic colleagues.  Since then we've been--in the past year now we've been working with orthopedic implant manufacturers and similar organizations.  And today we're a little over $850,000.  Our goal is one million. And we really hope to get that by the end of June, first of July.
Speaker 1: And this chair would be endowed in your name?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It would be endowed in my name. And it will be in the Division of Orthopedic Surgery in the medical school.  It will be unique in the sense that it will be the only orthopedic chair named for an African American anywhere in this country and anywhere in the world.  Now the chair is an instrument by which there is enrichment brought to the academic unit. Because the monies raised remain in a trust fund in perpetuity.  And the interest once a year is turned over to the occupant of the chair.  And it can be used to defray salary, to hire new people, pay for travel, or books. Whatever. But it can be used as a discretionary instrument to enrich the academic mission of the division.

Speaker 1: When you look back over your career, what do you think?  I mean what are your thoughts about it?  It's--I mean you didn't know that you wanted to be an orthopedic surgeon.  You actually, you know, when you think about it, you wanted to be a, you know, a pharmacist would have been--
Speaker 2: Well I, I, I--That was a backup.  I wanted to be a doctor.  I didn't know what kind of doctor. And it seemed eight years of working my way through four medicine--I mean four college and four medicine just seemed an impossible task.  The first year was--went by so fast and without great stress, I said, "I've done this one, I can do seven more."  And I was able to do that.  Now it was quite by happenstance that I was exposed to orthopedics. And particularly to John [P.] Adams in that clinic where they were treating polio patients that attracted my interest.  And it has become a lifelong--lifelong interest.  And as I look back, I think I could have probably been very happy and content being a radiologist. 'Cause I liked that.  Or maybe at one time I had looked at ophthalmology.  But none of those disciplines excited my interest as did orthopedics.  And I believe I made the best choice for me. And it has made my life very, very happy.  I enjoyed tremendously what I did. Although I worked very hard.  I mean for ten years I was in solo practice.  I seemed to have been working day and night the whole time. 'Cause I didn't have much, you know I didn't have any relief unless I asked someone specifically to cover for me.  And I had a very heavy teaching load.  I had a solo practice. And, you know, it's like a faucet.  When you turn it on, you can't turn it off. It just kept going.  And--But I must say my life was made easier by having a wife [Roselyn Payne Epps] who understood. And my children understood.  They didn't complain.  I mean there were times when we--the picnic basket would be packed, and we'd be all ready to go. And the phone would ring. And then they would have to go on alone.  I'd join them later.  But I always tried to have quality time with them.  For example, I did all the grocery shopping for about twelve years.  And our time was Saturday evenings.  You know, groceries had to be purchased. And I would come home Saturday afternoons from making rounds or surgery--whatever.  And we would--I'd get all four of them together and off we'd go to the Giant [supermarket].  And the youngest would ride in the basket and the other three would walk along.  And they had an interest in going because they liked to pick certain cereals and certain cookies or whatever.  And what was interesting is that one by one they dropped off. Because one time the oldest boy said, "You know, Dad, I can't go today 'cause I've got something else I have to do."  And then the next year or two the second one said, "Dad, I can't go here today 'cause I've got something else to do."  Then my daughter went along for awhile. And--the baby was still riding up in the thing. And she would say, "I'm sorry I can't go this time.  I have to do this."  And then finally the little fellow said that he couldn't go (laughing).  Well when he couldn't go, then I stopped shopping.  But you know, they were very well--mannered. And we would go into that Giant.  And the rules were "You don't touch anything.  We're not gonna buy any candy unless I decide we're gonna buy candy.  You don't pick up any cookies."  Now they would--the lady back in the bakery section loved them. And they'd all run to the back there. And she'd give each one of them a cookie.  And that was it--that they had their, they had their cookie.  But they were good.  They just enjoyed going along.  And it was interesting. Because I would see my friends in there. And they would say, "Man you sure are making it hard on us (chuckling)." You know, because I'm out shopping.  And I would see perfect strangers. And they would say, "Oh mister.  Where's your wife?"  'Cause they would see me with these three little--four little kids (chuckling) going along.  I'd say, "Oh she's fine.  She's at home."  And they would look, you know.  But everybody understood that this was our time together.  And we also did other things together.  We would--We had the little projects, for example.  Having three boys I decided that it'd be nice if we would make rockets.  And I'd go to the hobby shop and I'd buy three rockets. And then they would have a whole week to make these rockets. You know, these self--propelled rockets that ignited by battery.  And they'd make their rockets. And then we'd go down to Rock Creek Park down there and we'd (ssshhheww) shoot these rockets.  And my daughter said, "I'd like to make a rocket--one of those rockets, too."  "Oh. all right."  So I bought four.  And so she would make a rocket. And the four of us would go down there and we would shoot our rockets.  And then we got into these little radio-operated cars.  You know, you'd have a car and you have an antenna and you--it runs around and do things.  We would try to do things on the weekends on Saturday.  We had kites.  We were into kites for awhile.  But we had--one of the smartest things I ever did was when I bought this home was to put a pool in.  And they all learned to swim. And they love to swim.  Reasoning that I would never get down to the beach every week--or if we went down there, I would send her down there with the children on Friday after school.  I would hope to get down there sometime Saturday in time to turn around and come back on Sunday morning.  So I put in a pool. And that was one of the best things that ever happened.  They loved that pool. And they had more fun together. Took a swim a couple of times a day.  So I think I was able to provide for my kids.  And the reason it was so important was because of my own--my own childhood.  It was very happy up to the time that my father [Charles Harry Epps, Sr.] died. And then disaster.  And so I was determined that I would make things better, you know, for  my children.  And my wife and I decided--of course her parents were educated.  They were--They had good jobs. And they also believed in education.  And they sponsored her and her brother right on through medical school.  And it was my determination, and she agreed and we worked--we told our kids that, "We will support you totally to a terminal degree as long as you stay in school and behave yourself, we will--you won't have to worry about being financially supported."  And we did.  And when they finished they had no loans.  And I--I think we both were proud of that fact.  Now they'd--I didn't realize how much that meant to them until my youngest son, who was married to a young lady who was a lawyer--She'd gone to Howard and to Yale.  And after they started practicing in Houston, he called me.  He said he'd gone to a financial adviser. Because now they're beginning to make a little money. You know.  She's practicing law and he's working.  And so they asked, "Do you have loans?"  And she said, "Yes, we're paying off my loans.  We're almost done."  And he said, "How about you?"  And he said, "I don't have any loans."  The man said, "You don't have any loans?"  He said, "No."  He says, "Well you told me you had two brothers and a sister."  He says, "Well none of us have loans."  So the man said, "Well how on earth did your parents do that?"  So then he said to me, "Dad, tell me.  How did you do it?"  You know. And I realized for the first time he had thought about it and he realized that perhaps what we had given them was something special.  So I said, "Well if you think back, Howard, you will remember that your mother and I worked very hard. And we didn't buy expensive clothes.  We took a family vacation, which was always combined with a medical meeting and then we went off somewhere ourselves.  We--I mean you lived in a nice house.  We sent you to private school. But we didn't waste money. And we both worked very hard.  Now if either your mother or I had been unfortunate enough to become ill, then you couldn't have gone to Sidwell Friends [School].  You know, you would have had to go to the public school and you couldn't have gone to Harvard."  Our oldest boy went to Harvard undergrad, Hopkins medicine.  My son Kenneth went to Tufts undergrad and UCLA for business.  Our daughter went to Brown and to Howard for medicine. And the youngest boy went to Harvard and to Hopkins.  And I can tell you that those tuition bills came every six months. And we managed somehow to pay them--all within each calendar year.  And--but it was very important to me to do that, you know, for a reason that I explained to you.  And I feel good about that. Because they all are independent now.  They can take care of themselves.  And by not having to have debts, they got a head start.  Now in spite of my working, when I finished college I had $250--I had $2500 in debt. I had borrowed from a George Washington Foundation in Jerseyville, Illinois.  And they told me when I finished college that I could pay it back when I finished medical school.  It was interest--free. And I did pay them back when I finished medical school.  But that was the only loan that I had.  Now that doesn't sound like a lot of money. But I can assure you that in 1951 $2500 was a lot of money.  But given the choices I had, I was glad to be able to make that loan.  When I finished medical school though, I was debt free except for that college loan--which I paid back as soon as I started practicing.

Speaker 1: Can you comment about the importance of a work ethic?
Speaker 2: Well I think you have to have a--you have to have motivation. You have to be self--directed.  I mean there were so many opportunities where I could have fallen by the wayside.  But I was determined.  I knew what I had to do. And I was determined to do it.  And it always amazed me when I was in college with my meager means that students who lived in the dormitory with me would come to me and borrow money. Because they couldn't keep up with their finances from one allowance check to the next.  But I always had money that I had saved in the summer or I was earning as I worked. So that I--You know, I couldn't afford to get to a point where I didn't have any money. Because there was no place to get it.  So I always had that discipline that I could do it.  And I was also disciplined enough so that I could--whatever sacrifice was necessary, I could do it to get by.  Now I didn't have fancy clothes.  I only owned one suit.  When I came to Howard I'd joke about the fact that I had a cardboard suitcase.  I had shipped my foot locker over to Washington. And I had a cardboard suitcase with my possessions in it--those that I hadn't already shipped.  Interestingly enough when I got to Union Station, I got off there and I went out front. And the cabs wouldn't pick me up.  Until finally a bell--one of those bellhops said, "They won't pick you up here.  Yellow Cab won't pick you up.  Walk across the street to the post office.  Stand over there and one of the black cabs will pick you up."  That was my introduction to Washington.  But I was focused.  I was very disciplined.  It didn't matter to me in high school or in college if the fashions change and people had, you know, a certain kind of sport coat, certain kind of shoes.  I couldn't afford it, I wouldn't worry about it.  When I was driving my cab I wanted a radio.  You know, it gets kind of lonesome in there all the time.  So I went down to Manhattan Auto. And I walked in and I said, "I wanna get a radio to put in my 1971 Plymouth cab out there."  And so we looked at them. And I picked out one that was eighty dollars.  And the man said, "That's eighty dollars, sir."  I said, "Can I buy it on time?"  And he said, "Do you have credit?"  I said, "No, I don't have any credit."  He says, "Well don't you have an account down at Cavalier?"  Well the Cavalier was a--this clothing store where, you know, the in the hood where everybody bought these fashions, you know.  I said, "No, I don't have anything."  I said, "I save my money.  And when I need a pair of pants I buy it, or a coat. And I pay cash for it.  I never bought anything on credit and I don't have any credit accounts."  So he said, "You have to have a signature."  So I went to the man--the family with whom I lived, Louis Johnson.  And he co--signed for eighty dollars.  And I was supposed to pay five dollars a week.  This is 1951, see.  But I paid ten dollars a week. And I paid it off fast.  So I had a card now that showed that my account was paid off in half the time.  And I saved that card because when I got married I went down to buy some furniture.  And I went to PJ Nee, I went to Sears.  I went to PJ Nee first to buy some furniture.  It was a furniture store.  And they said, "Do you have credit?"  I said, "Yes, I have had credit."  I pulled out this card and showed them.  And they said, "Okay."  So they gave me credit.  I went out to Sears & Roebuck and I ordered some household appliances--pans and pots and all those things.  Said, "Do you have credit?"  I said, "I have--yes, I have account at PJ Nee and I've had an account at Manhattan Auto (laughing)."  So that way I got--I furnished the apartment, you know, in that fashion.  And then strangely enough, people started sending me credit cards.  American Express sent a credit card.  Gulf Amoco--all these people started sending me credit cards whether I had asked for them or not.  All because I had, you know, gotten that thing.  Years later, when my wife [Roselyn Payne Epps] wanted a Jaguar automobile, I went back to Manhattan Auto.  And I said--I told the salesman, I said, "Who's your--is your owner still here?"  And they said, "Yes."  I said, "I wonder if I might speak to him?"  So they came out.  So I introduced myself to him.  I said, "You may or may not remember this," I said, "But I bought a car radio from you in 1951.  It was a taxi.  It was eighty dollars.  And you made me go get a co-signer."  The man--(points) "I remember that!"  I said, "Well I'm here today and I'm gonna buy a Jaguar (chuckling)."  And we all got a good laugh out of that.  But that's the way I was with money.  I sent--As I said, I sent money home to my mother [ Marjorie Sue Jackson Epps] until she died.  I sent money to my sisters as much as I could.  But I learned the value of a dime, so to speak.  And I've never worshipped money. But I've always kept one eye on that.  I don't consider myself a business man.  It's nothing.  And I'm not a wealthy man today because money has never been what motivated me to study medicine.  But I never let the lack of money warp my life or change my values.
Story_ID: 6890
Speaker 1: You've got a very strong marriage. And I want to have you comment on how you were able--you know, what makes a good marriage.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.  Well I wouldn't presume to tell anybody--give anybody advice about marriage.  I can only say that I consider myself fortunate.  I met my wife [Dr. Roselyn Payne Epps] when I was nineteen and she was eighteen.  And I fell in love with her.  And I decided early on that this was the girl that I want to marry.  She understood my circumstances and she was willing to wait.  I couldn't possibly have married her. And her father was like the old school.  He didn't feel like he should support the two of us.  And so we waited for five years. And we got married.  Now because she was a physician--and mind you, we had gone through that senior year. And I (unclear) tutor her but we started biochemistry--I mean organic chemistry together, you know.  And--'cause that was my strong suit.  And so I was happy to have her as a classmate and a study partner.  Then in medical school, we studied together through four years of that.  When we became interns, we--In those days you worked thirty-six [hours] on and twelve off.  And when the schedule would come out we would--our colleagues would--most of them were classmates--would help us adjust it so that we were off on the same night.  And then after our first--we were residents when our first child arrived.  We went back to them and they helped us again. Because now some nights one of us had to always be at home.  So we adjusted the schedule so that if I was working, she would be off. And if she worked, I would be off.  And we raised four children like that.  She's a wonderful woman.  And I always say that our marriage has worked because she puts 110% in and I put ninety.  And those together would make it work.  But I consider myself to be very fortunate to have met her.  Her family was wonderful.  Her parents treated me like a son.  And you heard about the step-mother, you know, I mean your mother-in-law.  All those mother-in-law jokes, that was never the case.  Her father was a stern man, a proud man.  And you know, when you're dating somebody's daughter, you kinda feel a little, you know, anxiety.  But he made me feel comfortable.  I remember when I gave her a ring and she called him very excitedly the next day and told him that I'd given her a ring.  So her daddy said to her, "Well he hasn't asked me (chuckling) for your hand."  You know, I could just hear him saying it, 'cause he had a deep bass voice. You know.  So I got busy and I wrote a letter.  And I told him that as he knew I had been dating his daughter for five years. And I loved her very much and I wanted to marry her.  And I didn't have a lot at that time.  I had a 1951 automobile which I used as a cab.  And I had like $250 in the bank.  But in June I was going to be graduated and I'd be an intern and I would make $2876 a year. And she would make the same as an intern.  And I thought that together we could manage.  And I would be pleased if he would allow me to marry his daughter.  And he wrote me a nice letter back.  Now I didn't know then, but he saved that letter.  And when he died, his wife--her mother--came across the letter and gave it to my daughter, which I think she still has.  But you know, we had one son--I mean one daughter and three sons.  And they were spaced, you know, two years, three years and fourteen months.  They were wonderful kids.  And we moved in here when they were young, so we had a comfortable home.  It's been a good life.
Story_ID: 6891
Speaker 1: And what do you want your legacy to be, sir?
Speaker 2: Oh excuse me.  Well I guess I'd like my children to remember me as a father who cared and did the best that he could.  I'd like to be remembered also as someone who was grateful for all that Howard University afforded me and that the profession afforded me.  I would just hope to be remembered as one who gave back.  Not just to the University, but to the--to humanity.  I count one of my greatest assets--the patients that I've treated.  As I said, I run into them all the time. And nothing makes you feel better than to see a patient that you treated thirty years ago who's grown now, happy, productive member of society.  And they remember you kindly and are grateful for what you did.  I used to tell the medical students, you know, when I was dean in '88, [1988] '89 [1989] up to '94 [1994], there were--it was a very bad time for medicine.  The New York Times and the Post--Everybody was writing articles about how bad medicine had become--mostly because of economic issues and that sort of thing.  And the students would always ask--these are new students coming in--"Dr. Epps, What--what's medicine gonna be like?  Why, you know, I'm concerned about what it will be like when I finish, from all these bad things that are happening now?"  And the thing that I would always tell them is that if you went into--if you decided to practice medicine for the right reason, if you wanted to do something where you could help other people, then you haven't made the wrong choice.  And you can still be fulfilled--in spite of whether you work for an HMO, you do private practice, you work for a hospital, whatever.  If you went into medicine because you want to help other people.  Now medicine offers you an opportunity that nothing--almost nothing else does.  Because if you think about it, you can do something very significant on a very personal level to another human being.  And in medicine you can do it many times in one day every day of your life.  Now what other occupation is true--is that true of?  So you can--If that's why you went into medicine, you'll still enjoy it and be happy to have a very fulfilling life.  Now if you wanted to become a rich man practicing medicine, you're not--you're gonna be unhappy. Because you're not gonna become rich practicing medicine today.
