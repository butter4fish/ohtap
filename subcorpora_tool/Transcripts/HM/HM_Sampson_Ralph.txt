Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask you what I call People magazine-ish type questions.  What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I, I will say purple.
Speaker 1: And what about what you like to eat?  What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: I like breakfast.  You know, in fact I can start breakfast anytime of the day.  So breakfast, pancakes, bacon, eggs.  Breakfast is the preferential choice of the meal of the day.
Speaker 1: Now do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I like the fall.  Being where I was raised and born in the Shenandoah Valley of the State of Virginia, when the fall foliage comes, it is the most spectacular color or creation that ever, I've ever seen.  So the fall when the air gets a little bit crisped.  My body knows it's time to go back to work basketball even after I retired.  So I like the fall.
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I'm still trying to find that.  I don't have a favorite one yet.  But I like going back home and relaxing, going back to the country and just enjoying the slow life.  So I would say home is my favorite place to be.
Speaker 1: So that's Virginia?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase?
Speaker 2: Favorite phrase my quote is that I have: it takes teamwork to make a dream work.  That's my quote that I've put together and coined over the years.  Everything begins with a dream and it takes a team to create that and build that dream.
Story_ID: 627913
Speaker 1: Let's begin by talking about what you know about your family history.  And, and we'll begin with your mother.  Tell me her name, where she was born and when, if you know?
Speaker 2: My mother is named, Sarah Blakey, Sarah Frances Blakey Sampson [Sarah Blakey Sampson].  She was born in Virginia.  Don't know the physical location.  Actually ironically, we're doing a chronological history trying to put it all together but she was born in a rural area of Virginia and her birthdate is April 13, 1939.
Speaker 1: Did she share any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  She--you know, one of twelve siblings and very, very active youth life on the farm, a four, four hundred acre farm.  Mom [Josephine Beasley Blakey] and dad [George Blakey, Sr.] worked very hard, grandparents of mine obviously, and played baseball, played basketball, ran with the, with the brothers, (background noise) nine brothers and three sisters and worked very, very hard on the farm as far as just all the chores and all the things that young farm girl would do.  She went off to college at Virginia State University [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia], played basketball there as well and always told me that she had a better hook shot than I did so she had a very, very active youth and adult life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you said that her parents owned a farm, four hundred acre farm. Do you know whether they owned the land and how they acquired it?
Speaker 2: My grand- I actually have a deed of sale that I found many, many years ago but my grandfather bought it for twenty-five thousand dollars.  I forget the exact date but he acquired it and we still own the land today.  So we have different family reunions and different events there during the course of the year but they bought it in the, probably 1920s and just worked the land for many, many years.
Story_ID: 627914
Speaker 1: Now, your mother [Sarah Blakey Sampson] went on to college and what did she get a degree in?
Speaker 2: She got a degree in, in physical education at Virginia State University [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia].  So she went there, played basketball and graduated.  I forget the exact year but did that there for a number of years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now we talked a little bit about your grandfather purchasing the land, did you have a relationship with your grandmother and grandfather?
Speaker 2: No, actually, they passed away before I was born.  And my grandfather passed away before my grandmother and in 1958 my grandfather passed away--my grandmother passed away.  So I didn't get to, get to meet them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me, tell me their names?
Speaker 2: My grandfather on my mother's side is George Henry Blakey [George Blakey, Sr.] and my grandmother is Josephine Blakey [Josephine Beasley Blakey].
Speaker 1: Did your mother share any other stories about them?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  One with my grandfather when she was in college that he at that point in time, he really with transportation, he took a taxicab to Virginia State to watch her play.  Got down there and didn't wanna leave and wanted to bring her back home.  So stories like that and stories of working on the farm, you know, grandfather wouldn't let you do this and wouldn't let you do that so all the little tweaks and stories about you know butchering pigs and chickens (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did she tell you a story about that?
Speaker 2: --all those are historical--
Speaker 1: Well tell us, tell me.
Speaker 2: --were stories that just how certain things were done.  If you, if you didn't cut the meat right or if you didn't plow the garden right, she would tell us that your grandfather will tell you do that because we didn't, I didn't have a relationship with him so just things of how his work ethic back in those days even transcend into her now transcend into me because of the mentality.  I mean just it's, you know in all of my mom's siblings, uncles and aunts have a work ethic that is I think better than anybody in the world because you were raised on the farm and you had to go out every morning and do chores and you had to you know slop the pigs, you had to feed the chickens, you had to plow the gardens, you had to work can, had a cannery on the property.  So every little thing that we did or we do even today to some extent, she might relate to a story that relates back to her youth with my grandfather you know and just different, different things that come across the board when it comes to work.  And it's funny that when you see it today and my sister or somebody sees me and they see my mom and me and then it relates to my grandfather or grandmother and a little thing when we go back and to the butchering like okay fine and we still do it with the old kettles and it's still the old ways, kind of traditional thing we do now after probably fifty years of doing it, but we still do it my grandfather's way and not the new way and my uncles will tell you sit there, it's the day after Thanksgiving we usually do it, and they would sit there and tell you stories, "Well George would--you couldn't do that if he was here," and then they all would laugh and but it's little different things that you know you have to be kind of in the moment to understand and feel because coming from uncles that are in their early seventies and my mom as well, that relate back to their childhood that they remember when their father told them, "Girl, don't do that" or "Boy, do this" and it's funny to hear them talk about it and see them like you know experience and go back in their childhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know about your grandfather and grandmother's education?  Were they educated?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't know like I said we're finding different things over the last year or so going back and trying to put a lot of pieces together.  My grandmother and grandfather was married in Maryland and actually had their marriage certificate and when they were married, date and time, we don't know why they were married in Maryland because they was from--in Virginia but they was married there and I guess migrated or figured out somewhere in Virginia, we just don't know how.  We found a picture of all of my mom's brothers and sisters together but I asked them all, they don't know where this picture was taken and why.  We found World War I [WWI] letters from my uncles to their mother from overseas.  So different things we try to piece together to find out when and where certain things happened.  It's been fun to do.  We just haven't found out all the information yet.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was just wondering because twenty-five thousand dollars back in those days were, you know, was a lot of money.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So I was just wondering how they [Sampson's maternal grandparents, Josephine Beasley Blakey and George Blakey, Sr.] came across that.
Story_ID: 627915
Speaker 1: Any other stories about your mother [Sarah Blakey Sampson]?
Speaker 2: She--no, my mom is just a fun loving, hardworking, motivated woman.  She's--I tell people that it's, it's very hard for me to keep up with my mother, to, even today at seventy-two years old.  She is in the Habitat for Humanity, building houses.  She's on the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] board in the local area.  She takes care of the elderly in the neighborhood.  My aunt that's around the corner, helps take care of her.  She's bedridden in a wheelchair, she takes care of her as well and when I go home every summer, she always have a, has a project for me to do.  So she still, she's still going full speed ahead and I don't see any slowdown in her anytime soon but very well, I guess from my standpoint, very well motivated woman that love to death and just look up to, look up to.
Speaker 1: What characteristic or trait do you think that you got from your mother besides the work ethic?
Speaker 2: Work ethic, motivation, a desire to help people, give back and I think the biggest thing is desire to be the best I could be.  You know she would tell us all the time, "If you start something, you're gonna finish it."  I took piano when I was younger.  Didn't wanna take it, didn't wanna do it but she started, started with me and I had to finish the course.  You know as I was growing, my hands were getting bigger, I couldn't hit the keys one at a time, I was hitting two and just being coordinated and she told me that I would, you know, I had to finish it.  I had no other choice.  My mother's side of the family and her brothers loved baseball so we all played softball and baseball together and I played baseball as a younger kid and didn't really like basketball.  But got to love baseball and then I kind of grew out of baseball with my height, and but she said I still had to finish and when they moved me from first base to pitcher, and my arms start to get a little lazy and lax, I used to throw sod on them and when I started hitting more batters than I had strikes, she said, "You can quit baseball and go into basketball."  So she always even today whatever we start something, we have to finish it.  So I think that's the biggest, the biggest thing even today she gets on me like, "Okay you haven't finished this yet?  You say you wanna do this, you say you wanna do that, when you gonna finish it?"  And so, she, she, she likes to see the end of a project done and then she can start something new.
Story_ID: 627916
Speaker 1: Now tell me about your, about your father.  Tell me his name, where and when he was born?
Speaker 2: My father's name is Ralph Lee Sampson, Sr. [Ralph Sampson, Sr.].  He was born in Rockingham County in Harrisonburg, Virginia, area as well.  Mother and father which my grandparents I knew very well.  They've passed on now but grew up with them as a young kid.  He had one other brother, George Adolph Sampson [George Sampson], that's deceased.  Father is seventy-three years old and still works today again has a great, great work ethic as well.  So I've been very blessed with two parents that have a motivational work ethic that I rarely, rarely see in people that I talk to across the board.  We call my father the mayor of the city, town because he knows everybody and he kind of deals with everybody a certain way and everybody knows him.  His mom and dad, Ruby Howard Sampson and his father, my grandfather Hampton Sampson were from the McGaheysville, Virginia, area as well, married and again I grew up with them and we lived a couple of houses down so I get, you know, got to go to my grandparents' house every day and, and loved them to death.  So it's a great relationship there that I wish I had with my mom's mom [Josephine Beasley Blakey] and dad [George Blakey, Sr.] but again they were a little bit older and I never got to experience them but only in conversation or pictures and experiences.  And my dad's side I got to experience you know life and death and all that so it's, it was a fun, fun time.
Story_ID: 627917
Speaker 1: Before we talk more about your dad [Ralph Sampson, Sr.], tell me about your grandfather [Hampton Sampson] and your relationship with him?
Speaker 2: Grandfather again another hardworking man.  He worked many, many years for Merck and Company [Merck and Co., Inc.] which is a pharmaceutical company.  A very, very good job, very good house in the African American neighborhood in the small town of Harrisonburg [Virginia] in which my mother [Sarah Blakey Sampson] and father live in today.  We renovated obviously and did some things to it but grandfather was a very unique character.  He had a paper route, even in his elder years.  Six o'clock, seven o'clock in the morning, had a paper route, delivered twenty, thirty papers to a local neighborhood in the country somewhere.  You know, he's the old school guy that had money in a sock in a drawer that, always for a rainy day.  He would only take baths on the weekend.  You know, we work hard all week long; you don't want the water bill to go up.  You know, his car was always clean.  He was always clean.  Hair was always cut, you know.  Was always really sharp, had hats on, Sunday hats on, white suits and, you know, so was always sharp as a tack but worked very, very hard in his industry.  I remember a time when I was playing in the NBA [National Basketball Association] and they called me and told me he was in the hospital and doctors couldn't do anything for him and my dad actually was very close to my grandfather, so called me and told the team that I need to go home, my grandfather's probably not gonna make it and I need to go home to support the family.  So I flew home, got there that night, sit there all night long.  My grandfather, my dad in the room, didn't know what was gonna happen, talked to him all night long and about twelve o'clock the next day he woke up and ready to go home.  And he lived many, many years after that.  And he, he's, he was a character.  He was special and hardworking.  Not gravely educated but knew right from wrong with what he had and studied it every day and then my grandmother [Ruby Howard Sampson] the matriarch basically, made sure he did what he needed to do.  You know, she's--and my mom is my heart, but my grandmother is my mind, she's, you know, even today she's still with me every day in some respects because of her mentality and, and, and love for me and my, my sisters [Valerie Sampson and Joyce Sampson Franklin] as well.
Story_ID: 627918
Speaker 1: What did your [paternal] grandfather [Hampton Sampson] do for the pharmaceutical company?
Speaker 2: He was a, he mixed the drugs up for Merck [Merck and Co., Inc.] down in (unclear), the plant's still there today but we always would go there and visit and it had this really bad odor but he would be telling, you know, and he was not, he wasn't a chemist or anything like that but they would tell him what to do and he'd go get the formulas and he put them together and we didn't know all the secrets that they have but he'd put them together and make it work.
Speaker 1: And, so you remember some of the visits there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we used to go.  My dad [Ralph Sampson, Sr.] would take us down and visit him at work.  He would take his lunch, you know, whatever it might be and we'd just kind of go there, you know, periodically and see how he was doing, and this is my grandkids and, you know, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, just ride down and see how he was, make it a day.
Speaker 1: Was that a major employer in that area?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Still is today.  Merck, Reynolds [Reynolds Group Holdings Limited], Coors [Coors Brewing Company], Merck has been there a gazillion years and Reynolds the aluminum wrap and foil and stuff like that has been there many, many years as well and then recently in the next twenty years Coors just come in as well.  So those were the industries back then that offered the best jobs and he and a couple of other African Americans in the neighborhood had those jobs.
Story_ID: 627919
Speaker 1: Now tell me a little more about your [paternal] grandmother.
Speaker 2: Ruby Sampson [Ruby Howard Sampson], she's a, she was a housewife.  She worked a little bit and she cleaned people's houses and did things like that, iron clothes stuff like but she mainly was a housewife.  My grandfather [Hampton Sampson] made a good living for her to be able to do that to some extent.  But she always wanted to do something.  So she really was the ground wire to a lot of the family, especially on my dad's [Ralph Sampson, Sr.] side.  She, you know, had a sweet spirit with her, carried with her every day.  Everybody in the neighborhood knew who she was.  She, you know, the house was on the main corner of the neighborhood which just sits there today and you would not go by there and not speak to Miss Ruby because she sit on the front porch and wave to you and every kid in the neighborhood knew her, every wino, every person that--I mean everybody literally knew her and they really respected her and, I mean even today there's this guy there that can reflect back to her and they happen to be walking down the street intoxicated, they straighten up real quick because they didn't want her to see them that way and she would you know you don't supposed to be doing that so.  And so all the stories with her are just massive because of, you know, one that I can recall is I was always growing faster than most kids and she would always buy clothes for me during the course of the year, going back to school or Christmas whatever.  So she would take me to the downtown, go to the department store and at a certain in point in time I couldn't fit anything.  You know size, waist, lengths whatever so she started to have things made by a seamstress in the neighborhood so you know from suits, to coats, to the leisure suits to whatever thing may be she tried to have those things made and my mother [Sarah Blakey Sampson], my mother worked in a--she was a accountant in a, in a, in a pants factory and so that's how I got all my clothes made.  Between my grandmother and my mother knowing people that could sew and find the right clothes for me at that point in time especially pants.  I can find shirts and t-shirts and stuff like that but she'd always take me down to the, to the lower department store and--, "Let's see how tall he is this year," and then be an inch or two inches taller than the previous year.  So everybody was tracking my height at the department store at that point in time with her going every year because it would be a standard yearly thing that she would do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what about your grandmother's education?
Speaker 2: Very limited, limited.  Don't know all the total how far she went there in the neighborhood there and we're still trying to chronological, chronologically put that together.  There's a old African American school called Lucy F. Simms [Lucy F. Simms School, Harrisonburg, Virginia] that's now been renovated but my mother and father went there and I don't know if my grandparents went there at that point either but we're still trying to research that.
Story_ID: 627920
Speaker 1: Now back to your dad [Ralph Sampson, Sr.], tell me about your relationship with your father and what trait or characteristic did you get from him?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, my dad is--everybody always wonders, you know, when they ask me how tall is, how tall is your parents?  How tall is your dad?  I tell them my dad only 6'1".  That's, "Wow, where you get your height from?"  So we still researching.  Got some great-great-grandfathers on both sides who were 6'5", 6'6" somewhere down the line but my dad again the work ethic is there.  The stories with him is, when my grandfather [Hampton Sampson] told my dad one time when he was younger said, "Boy, you know, you gotta get a job and by five o'clock today when you come back home I don't care what you do, you gotta find a job."  So my dad got all nervous he said, "And I gotta get a job, I gotta get a job, dad told me I gotta get a job," so he came back that afternoon with a job and he was a shoeshine boy downtown on Main Street [Harrisonburg, Virginia] and he, but he got a job.  So at an early age even instilled from grandfather that he had to work, had to get a job and make money and so my dad has the sweet spirit of my grandmother [Ruby Howard Sampson] and a, and a sweet spirit of my grandfather.  My dad's brother [George Sampson] had the outgoing spirit of my grandfather and a little bit of sweet spirit of my grandmother.  So it was a different, different brother relation, they had a great relationship but what my dad had instilled in me is just the respect of people, the respect of others, the motivation that he has, the work ethic that he has and again as I said earlier it's weird to have two parents that work ethic is very extremely hard 'cause we all now have the same body shape, same characteristics and when people are around us even my uncle as well, there is no stop, there's no quit, there's no, if there's a project we gonna get up the next morning and work on the project and get it done one way or another.  My dad has a job with the city at this point and he can retire and do anything that he want to do and retire you don't sit at home and do nothing so he like I'm not stressed out with this job.  He opened the city government building in the morning, goes in and checks everything, goes home for a couple hours, hangs out have lunch, goes around to all the departments in the city, checks on everything, five o'clock he closes the door and comes home.  So it's not really taxing on him from that perspective.  He makes it taxing sometimes because he doesn't know how to quit.  But the instilling of not quitting and not letting us settle for what God has and then what they have instilled in us not settling for other than what is the best for you.  And I think is what he most instilled in me even today.  He worries about me all the time today, but and it's funny because I could go home today and even my sisters [Valerie Sampson and Joyce Sampson Franklin] go home today and when we leave there he's gonna give you a couple of dollars.  You know, "Here take this you need some," you know.  It might be twenty, it might be two hundred.  But he's gonna give you something before you leave there because that's just and that's been since day one.  "You going, you going away on a trip, take a couple dollars."  And my grandfather was the same way.  Back then it might have been a couple dollars today, it might be a couple hundred dollars but my grandfather might give you a roll of pennies because that's what he had.  So I think that trait from my grandfather to my dad even to me, when my kids leave and go off to college whatever, "Here, here's some money."  I make sure they okay but it's funny how that kind of correlates from grandfather to dad to me down to my children.
Story_ID: 627921
Speaker 1: What did your dad [Ralph Sampson, Sr.] do for a living before he had his, his city job?
Speaker 2: His--it's funny his main occupation in that market, there was a company called Kawneer that made aluminum doors and windows for major buildings across the country.  So they take the big rolls of aluminum coming on a train, they mold it, shape it, dye it, fry it all that kind of stuff and they ship it out.  And he was the oxidation operator so when they made it he put it down into the big acid tanks and controlled the knob to do that, pull them up and ship them and made the colors for whatever that aluminum was gonna be and it's funny and the house that my mom [Sarah Blakey Sampson] and dad live in, which it was my [paternal] grandparents' [Ruby Howard Sampson and Hampton Sampson] house, you walk in it's a split level house.  You walk down the steps and on the wall there, there's a plaque that says, "For Good Services" because the company went out of business.  And on the plaque it says "Kawneer, Congratulations Ralph Sampson, Sr., twenty-four years, so many days, so many months."  And he missed four days in twenty-four years.  So he had the gold plaque and had to tell him all the time, you know, and he always tell me, you know, "Why don't you get a job, you know, you need to get a consistent job," and I said, "Dad, they don't make those type of jobs any more where you can work that many days."  I said, "Look what you got after that.  You got a gold watch, a gold plaque and you worked twenty-four years.  You missed four days in twenty-four years and you got a gold plaque on the wall and whatever pension and whatever you got which was not enough to live on."  And he realized at that point in time saying, "Yeah but I did what I had to do back then to make it work, to put food on the table for you."  I said, "I understand that" so we laugh about it all the time because not too many people can say they worked that many years and miss four days.  Never take vacation and worked, took days off yes but really never went on formal vacations.  If he did we were always home and enjoying what was around the house.  And even today in his job currently, he never takes vacation until the end of the year.  So he'll, he has six, seven weeks' vacation from August to December, he'll take one week a month.  So he works three weeks, come off a week, but in Christmas and December, he takes a whole month.  So he's I mean smart in his own way with what he wants to do but the job he had even before that when I was younger, he did the same thing.  He did the same thing.  You know he worked, worked, worked, got a better job, worked, got a better job.  And then when his company went out of business, he got laid off, not laid off, went out of business got severance and all that kind of stuff as well you know and work--out of work for about a year.  Saying, "I can't, I can't do this, I gotta get a job."  So he went and got another job.  And that didn't work out like he wanted to 'cause that's too much and then the city gave him a job and he's been there now sixteen years.
Story_ID: 627922
Speaker 1: I don't think we covered what your mother [Sarah Blakey Sampson] did for a living?
Speaker 2: My mother, as I said a little bit earlier for many, many years she, there used to be a company called Metro Pants [Metro Pants Company] and they made jeans.  And she was the accountant department coordinator.  So she would do all the timesheets and I can recall being at home with her and instead of having it automated the way it is today probably, so everybody would clock in with these timesheets.  So she had stacks of timesheets that we would actually help her go through and calculate people's hourly time and she'd, we'd mark it up and she'd take it and she do her thing.  So she did that for many, many years.  And I think she probably even my first, I think she probably quit when I got to the NBA [National Basketball Association], 1993, '94 [1994].  So she did that.
Story_ID: 627923
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother [Sarah Blakey Sampson] and father [Ralph Sampson, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: Mother and father met.  What I can remember, my father was in a band and he played the saxophone.  My mother played sports in school and back in those days basketball, especially on the female side you would play three on three or six on six.  But you could only come to half court.  So if you play defense, you play defense, if you play offense, you play offense so it would switch over.  My mother was on the offensive side and the other girls were on the defensive side.  So between the school and the band and somehow the story goes that they met at school at a function or a party that the school was giving and again the school that they went to was right in the neighborhood we live in but it was the only thing back that was there.  So everybody was kind of bused in or you had to drive into where the school was but it was nothing around the school whatsoever, but the school [Lucy F. Simms School, Harrisonburg, Virginia].  And my mother lived in the country and my father lived in the city and more and more well, what they call the city now, but not too far from where the school would have been today and somehow they went to this party or function and they met and then it kind of went after that.  He, you know, courted or dated her and at some point got married.  So it was basketball and music and that whole school thing that kind of made them meet.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A little more about your mother playing basketball because obviously that's something that you picked up (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Yeah, a little bit.
Speaker 1: --from her.  But how tall is your mother?  We didn't talk about her height.
Speaker 2: Yeah, again, we--my father 6'1", mother is 5'9", 5'10".  So not too, not overly tall parents but you know I guess back in those days they were fairly tall compared to most people.  But what we somewhat found from a height standpoint from what I've been told on my mother's side, there was, there was a tall grandfather, great-great a couple greats down the road again still trying to research who that was.  Then my father's side, my grandfather [Hampton Sampson], my dad's dad had a uncle named Kenwood Sampson [Kenwood Sampson, Sr.] that was still only about six foot tall and he's deceased now.  But he would tell stories about there was some tall genes on the Sampson side of the family but he didn't know where they were either but he knew it was like back when that was and, there was some people that were taller than he was and that's, you know, they can relate my height to back then because six foot, 6'1" in their days were, was tall and then when you pop up and in the ninth grade you 6'7", they like oh wow, you know you know you tall and then all of a sudden where you get that from?  And then they start thinking about oh, yeah uncle we had that was or a cousin that was or somebody along the line that was but no one ever kept those type of records.  So you know to find out really where it came from it has been a little bit difficult.
Story_ID: 627924
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your early years and if you can remember tell me, what is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Earliest childhood memory.  Don't know what year it was or date but I was a young kid and me and my two sisters I can remember my mother [Sarah Blakey Sampson] bringing home my youngest sister from the hospital.  We all are two years apart so she would have been probably, I probably would have been seven or eight, my other sister been four or five.  So I can remember bringing her home from the hospital.  And mom was coming home bringing baby with her at such and such time we went to my [paternal] grandmother's [Ruby Howard Sampson] house and so I remember that and my dad's [Ralph Sampson, Sr.] car, old don't know the year but one of them old bigger Buicks that they would be historical but I remember them bringing, bringing her home.  Also remember, and there's pictures of this as well somewhere, and, you know, old photos that I have at my mother's house that because of our height, my sister is, my younger sister is six foot two so she's fairly tall as well but they would put you in a car seat in the car but sometimes it would be over the door outside the window of the car so that picture I think they was just staging the picture where that was happening.  So I can remember vaguely taking those pictures of my youngest sister and then also remember some Christmases that we all grew up together and probably before I was ten years old.  They were always, Christmas was always special because they, you know, my mother and father worked hard and we didn't get everything we probably wanted but we got everything we needed.  There was one year that probably in our eight, nine, ten years old range where one of my uncles brought us a Christmas tree from the country.  We didn't go downtown and pay thirty-four dollars for a Christmas tree.  We go in the back woods of the farm area and we cut your tree.  So he cut a tree and and brought it to us and the tree was so sparse that you know it had a branch here and space not branches you know and stuff but ended up probably being the prettiest tree we ever had and the best Christmas we ever had so he brought that and decorated it and did everything from that perspective.  So Christmas was always special.  But the earliest memory, remembering going back was by bringing my sister home from the hospital.  And then understanding, you know, what was going on.  My mom's coming back from the hospital and why and, you know.  Well, we got a, we got a sister.
Speaker 1: Well, two things.  One, tell me your sisters' name, the both of them?
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest and then there's Valerie Sampson and then the youngest is Joyce Sampson and her married name is Franklin [Joyce Sampson Franklin].  So we all getting--are two years apart and Joyce lives in Lynchburg, Virginia, and the regional manager or assistant manager for T.J. Maxx [TJX Companies, Inc.] and Valerie lives in Harrisonburg [Virginia] at home and she runs her own spas and beauty salons.
Story_ID: 627925
Speaker 1: And now, tell me why was that particular Christmas with the--sounds like a Charlie Brown tree--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --(Laughter) why was that one of the best Christmases?
Speaker 2: Because we had, you know, you go down and cut down your own tree.  I think that was that may have been the year that and probably was that we kind of found out there was no Santa Claus either.  And I think back at it at this point because that tree was my sisters [Valerie Sampson and Joyce Sampson Franklin] remember that tree very well as well even today.  And it just was one of those years that everything that, that if you look back at it now you realize that parents [Sarah Blakey Sampson and Ralph Sampson, Sr.] may have been a little stressed out financially and trying to get things done because, you know, it could have went down three blocks and bought a Christmas tree, but we went to the country and cut one down.  So I think that type of symbolic adventure going to the country and cutting a tree down instead of going and picking one up, put it on your car dragging it home made it more special.  As far as remembering how it was done because you can do that every year and go down to the lot and pick one out but if you go in the country and chop one down, I think that's more, you would remember that a little bit more so and realizing that you can kind of see how that kind of affects a young kid and chopping it down and bringing it home and putting it up and making sure it has water on it, make sure it still want to live a little bit and then you go through the Christmas not knowing, you know, as a kid what that all means but also that we can remember back I think we were in our car and mom and dad were shopping and we were all in the backseat and they were getting stuff for Christmas and I was a little bit older and I can see they put the trunk up.  I looked under the back window and you can see toys and stuff in the bag and said, "Oh, that's our toys."  And they would close the trunk pretty quickly and say, "Oh, no, that's just stuff, that's just stuff we got."  So, you know, like okay is there a Santa Claus, is there not Santa Claus, well, kind of what's going on with that.  So that whole Christmas had a lot of that around it, the food, just the, you know, the being home spirit back then where it was very peaceful, very quiet, very symbolic to me as far as cutting down a tree and then also having those toys there under that tree as well.
Story_ID: 627926
Speaker 1: Where you lived, where you, where you grew up, I want you to describe the neighborhood in which you lived.  I wanna know say if you took me on a tour of a square block of your house--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --who lived next door, who were your friends, who were the merchants in the neighborhood and maybe even if you knew what your friends' parents did for a living?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, that's, you know, I grew up in a village.  I mean, Harrisonburg, Virginia, in an African American neighborhood which is, which is what it was.  It was the village of the people that you knew everybody in every house and every block and what was going on.  In the center of the neighborhood there's a cemetery where my grandmother [Josephine Beasley Blakey] and father [George Blakey, Sr.] on my mom's side, my grandmother [Ruby Howard Sampson] and grandfather [Hampton Sampson] on my dad's side, some cousins, some uncles, aunts are buried in that cemetery and you have all the little passing away ceremonies there as well.  There's the block over from the cemetery there is the school, Sim- Lucy F. Simms high school [Lucy F. Simms Continuing Education Center, Harrisonburg, Virginia], the school that's there now is a continuing educational center today but that's where I play basketball every day inside the gym and there were outdoor courts as well and any given particular day, you know, my older cousins would be playing basketball there and I'd be watching and then I'd get into the last game okay like fine, we're going to ten, they go to five and they all tired but you know lights go out and then you run home.  So the neighborhood was very consistent with people that you knew and you loved and they loved you.  But being the fact that on my mother's side as well, as large as this family is, I had cousins first and second and sometimes third on every block and sometimes we didn't know who was your cousin, who wasn't but we knew the first cousins.  So my [paternal] grandparents lived in the house on the corner, where my mom [Sarah Blakey Sampson] and dad [Ralph Sampson, Sr.] live now.  We lived up the street in a project, which was two--a block up and behind there was a park, behind our house that like I said when my mother before she got a job at the pants factory [Metro Pants Company] she was a park direct, director and she ran the park.  My aunt that lives around the corner right now from my mom is bedridden, she ran the pool.  So we'd swim every day, we go to the park.  My dad worked, uncles on one corner, around the corner that my mother's youngest brother [Wilson Blakey], he worked at the Reynolds aluminum factory place [Reynolds Group Holdings Limited] and his wife [Patricia Johnson Blakey] was a school teacher.  So we in school where she knew everybody was school and I had another uncle that wife was a school teacher, he was the barber.  So we had a village of family but also friends that you grew up and it was--I tell people today and me and a couple of friends of mine talk about it all the time when we go back home, the street I lived on was called Myrtle Street and Myrtle Street was kind of we call it the valley and then you go up the hill to the cemetery and then you have the other areas of the town up top there and we call it the hill.  So you know but Myrtle Street, we call it the Myrtle Street gang.  Everybody on our street a gentlemen called Edgar Johnson has passed on now, me and his son a guy named Brent Johnson [ph.] are very close, very best friends but Mr. Edgar Johnson would be on his front porch and whistle, had this very pronounced whistle that he would whistle for his kids to come home to eat and when that whistle bellowed out over the neighborhood, we were playing you know playing basketball or whatever it was, they're--his kids would drop everything they're doing because they knew and they'd run home to eat and then that would be it.  So between the whistle every day, walking home from school and the confines of this neighborhood and understand it was the black neighborhood, so you didn't have anybody else, non-blacks come to the neighborhood.
Story_ID: 627927
Speaker 1: There were certain lines drawing that any whites or anybody else would not come into that neighborhood.  There was a pro- pronounced corner, that's the corner of the neighborhood where my [paternal] grandparents [Ruby Howard Sampson and Hampton Sampson] lived and across the street there was a corner house where you know they shot, people shot craps, they drank.  They did whatever on the corner but you knew, everybody knew who was there.  The corner bums, the corner drunks or what but you knew all of them.  And then there's the community store that was down the street from the corner.  So you had the little store, the five and ten cent dime store that the lady that ran it also ran the church and then I think in all-black neighborhood you had about five churches so everybody has their Baptist, A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] Methodist churches in the neighborhood.  So it was a neighborhood of that I call a village that I would not trade it for the--I wish my kids could grow up in that type of setting because we had that small city, small town, and then we had the farm that we had to go work the four hundred acres that was twenty minutes away.  Then we had to work as well so the neighborhood was really, really, really, really tight.  I mean, growing up there and having cousins and friends and uncles and aunts and people in the neighborhood that you knew if you got in trouble that I don't care who it was in the neighborhood that lady's gonna tell on you and she might not be any kin to you but you gonna get back to your mother before you get back home or my aunt was gonna tell you from school that this person got in trouble.  And when you got back home you know you was, you was gonna get in trouble or you were gonna get it before even got home.  So you really didn't have many problems.  And people always ask me today and, you know, and most of them are deceased.  But I--growing up and, and being there and playing basketball and doing what we did back then, I know everybody in the neighborhood from the lady that ran the store that had a ritual with me in middle school [Thomas Harrison Junior High School; Thomas Harrison Middle School, Harrisonburg, Virginia] to high school [Harrisonburg High School, Harrisonburg, Virginia] that I had to go down and get a candy bar or something from her before every game to the wino on the corner that after many years of me coming and going.  I used to go back for their funerals because we were that close.  They would be in the stands and they would know to come to the games not drunk at all and they cheer and so because it was an event around that and I see them around the next day and they be back at doing their, doing their thing, but oh great game.  So it was a, it was a village of people that, you know, are very special to me.  Very, very special going back there and like my friend up the street we call the Myrtle Street gang and we always bring our kids back even today and they'll run up and down the street, my kids are older, but they remember and when they were younger to come back and you can, you can open the door and let 'em roam.  You know, we really didn't have to worry about them being picked up or ran over or whatever.  You can run in grandmother's front yard and run up the street to the neighbor's house, you can eat up the street, you can eat at our house and some of that you can still do today.  But it, it definitely has changed dramatically because it's now infiltrated with different other cultures as well.
Story_ID: 627928
Speaker 1: What about school?  Tell me about your elementary school days?
Speaker 2: Well my--it's funny because the, even the neighborhood the--I, I go back, I can go back to my first grade year in elementary, the teacher that was there a lady named Mary Fairfax they're deceased and she was the organist in the church.  So you know organist and I have to sing in the choir with her when I was older but one incident my first grade year, she had, gave us a coloring project and you had to color and stay within the lines and she gave me a sheet of paper that had nurses on it, in nurses outfits.  I always thought a nurse had a white outfit.  So I just traced the outside of it and turned it in.  She said, "You need to color it."  Well, I said, "Nurses had only white outfits."  So she would get on me even today and she was livid about that but I went to Waterman Elementary School [Harrisonburg, Virginia] and had a great elementary school experience.  It was probably six blocks from my house and we walked it to and from every day.  My dad [Ralph Sampson, Sr.] would take us some days during the winter when, because he worked the second shift three to eleven [o'clock] so he'd take us to school in the mornings, drop us off and we walk back in the afternoon.  Elementary school was fun.  There were two different elementary schools that split the valley to the hill so the people on the hill went to Spotswood [Spotswood Elementary School, Harrisonburg, Virginia], people in the valley went to Waterman and so we always had that rivalry between the hill people and the valley people when it came to any sports or anything from that perspective.  But my elementary school years were really, really fun.  I can remember my first grade teacher Mary Fairfax to my sixth grade teacher Ms. Fawcett [ph.] that were there and, you know, just different things and again it was always fun to go back the next year because everybody was worried about how tall I was or how much I've grown or what size shoe I had on after a while and so I enjoyed my elementary experience.
Speaker 1: What type of student were you?
Speaker 2: Elementary wise I mean I was average, quiet kid that kind of laid back a little bit.  I worked hard academically.  I didn't get straight A's anything like but it would require my household you can get a C you can't any Ds and Fs and a C is okay but you need to work harder to get it done so we, you know, my dad worked from three to eleven, my mom worked from nine to five so between hours of getting home after school we would have to be home when we were younger we have to be at our aunt's house because we had to be watched. When we got a little older we could watch ourselves but before we got out and when Sarah Sampson [Sarah Blakey Sampson] got home at five that homework better be on the table and done and then you can go play.  If it's not, then you can't get out.  So we made sure anyway, you had to have that routine down so we worked very hard academically.  In the early years that gave us the ability to do well in high school [Harrisonburg High School, Harrisonburg, Virginia] and college as well.
Speaker 1: Now were you a mischievous--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No.
Speaker 1: --child?
Speaker 2: No, I was little a little bit more introverted, quiet.  Due to height a lot, you know, you a tall skinny kid in the neighborhood, basketball in the late '70s [1970s] wasn't as it is today or even years later than that.  Everybody like played it though.  I mean everybody loved to play it but people always thought to some extent that something was wrong with me.  My mom even at an early age, my grandmother [Ruby Howard Sampson], my dad's mother would take me to the doctor and say, "He's, what's wrong, he's--look like he's malnutritious or he's growing too fast. There's something wrong with him."  The doctor said, "No, ain't nothing wrong with him, he's healthy as an ox."  But no one realized you know at that point in time because it wasn't the norm that people would be this tall.
Story_ID: 627929
Speaker 1: When did you start growing to the point where they thought it was something different?
Speaker 2: Well, every year.  I mean--
Speaker 1: But what age did it start?
Speaker 2: It started even as a very young kid, five or six years old.  Like I said I can only remember back to ninth grade when I was six foot seven.  But even in the earlier years, when my [paternal] grandmother [Ruby Howard Sampson] and mother [Sarah Blakey Sampson] would take me to the doctor because I would be the next year I would be two inches taller.  Like oh, no, what is, this is crazy.  Every year it went between one to four inches.  My biggest growth year was four inches from the time I got to high school [Harrisonburg High School, Harrisonburg, Virginia] and when I got to high school as a senior, I was seven foot tall and I still grew four inches in college [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia].  But no one knew what, I mean didn't have a clue 'cause it wasn't like I said there wasn't--very few people at that height so everybody was always concerned that something was going on, something was wrong so which made me more introverted than most kids because, you know, now you can't play football.  You can play baseball.  Basketball was there and you can play that a little bit and then once it got more prevalent when I got to basketball then there were certain rules that we get into have to follow but so I laid back in my own perspective because I was taller.  I mean we go to middle school parties and I'm the flower on the wall because I'm so tall and, you know, do you dance?  Don't you dance?  You go, you know, you don't have a girlfriend.  You go to a house party within a neighborhood or whatever and you like okay nobody wants to dance with you because he's so tall.  And, so I kind of laid back a little bit at that, at that stage, very, very quiet, very shy kid and just kind of in my own little, little world, and realizing okay wow, my hands a little bit bigger, my feet a little bigger.  I mean, every year my shoe, my shoe size grew every year.  When I was eight, I wore a eight.  When I was nine, I wore a nine until I got to seventeen years of age.  So getting shoes to--after size eleven then where do you get shoes at, at twelve, thirteen, fourteen, where you get that at?  So everybody was always interested in what's going on with Ralph [HistoryMaker Ralph Sampson] this year because let's see how big his foot is and how tall he gonna be.  I'm like okay wow that's made me a little bit more reserved.
Story_ID: 627930
Speaker 1: I just wanted to ask about the two schools, the one on the hill, was that a, a black neighborhood as well?
Speaker 2: Well, it's all connected--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but where the lines drew as far as the demographic in the school system, it was all within the black neighborhood but the guys on the hill went to the other school and we went to the other school.
Speaker 1: So where did you go to junior high school?
Speaker 2: Well, both elementary at that point in time merged into one junior high school which was Thomas Harrison Junior High School [Thomas Harrison Middle School, Harrisonburg, Virginia] so we all kind of merged into that school which Thomas Harrison was actually linked to the high school [Harrisonburg High School, Harrisonburg, Virginia] so it's all in the same school building to some extent.  So Spotswood [Spotswood Elementary School, Harrisonburg, Virginia], Waterman [Waterman Elementary School, Harrisonburg, Virginia], the elementary school system kids when we got to high school and middle school, we all kind of then saw each other at that level and back in those days high--middle school was only seventh and eighth grade so we spent two years together before we then went to the, to the high school building as well.
Story_ID: 627931
Speaker 1: Now you talk a little bit about your extracurricular activities. Was this the time that you were--your mother [Sarah Blakey Sampson] made you take piano lessons?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, well--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I did that in elementary school [Waterman Elementary School, Harrisonburg, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Elementary school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Elementary to middle school [Thomas Harrison Junior High School; Thomas Harrison Middle School, Harrisonburg, Virginia] with piano, piano lessons, baseball, singing.  I had to sing on the, I had to sing with the church choir.  I took band in elementary school.  Even today there're stories out there the lady [Mary Fairfax] that was the organist I mentioned that was the first grade teacher then there was another lady that was the soloist piano player, both deceased now but you need to be 'cause, you know, the quiet, shy kid, everybody you know, "Oh yeah he's a good kid," this that and the other you need to be in the choir and oh, you need to be in the band.  So recall in elementary school in the band, taking band classes, well I got moved from the trumpet to the clarinet to the drums, just to the cymbal 'cause I couldn't hit low notes on the trumpet and I couldn't, I just couldn't, my voice and whatever couldn't, couldn't adapt to that and even though the choir they realized because my dad [Ralph Sampson, Sr.] sings very well.  They thought, if dad can sing, you can sing.  So they realized that I didn't have that talent so I just was a body and my mom realized one time when was in the choir with me, said, "Look you don't sing, you just move your mouth, don't say, sing a word" because I couldn't carry a note.  I couldn't carry a tune.  So that's why in the band they moved me to the cymbals.  I couldn't, I couldn't mess that up.  So I did that and so she let me finally quit the choir and quit band and said, "That's not where your talents are."
Speaker 1: But you enjoyed the baseball.  Was it a organized league?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Organized like somewhat of today's day but very organized.  They call it the Pony League.  There's Little League, major league and Pony League.  We play on the Pony League teams.  And like I said earlier it's--I started my sports interest.  Basketball I didn't, really wasn't interested in because I was so tall or growing so fast that I wasn't coordinated enough to get out there.  I had cousins that were really, really good.  I could play with them but I--you know, they were older and they didn't want me to get beat up or broke up 'cause they know my mom would get on them.  You took him to the part and you got him beat up.  So baseball was easy.  I could play first base and play in outfield so when I got good at baseball you know I start to grow a little bit, I played first base and the guy would throw the ball to my wrong hand so I'm right handed, I catch with my left hand, but the ball be over here and I have to catch it with my right hand and my mom said, "Well, you gotta be in position, you can't catch it with your bare hands."  It's easier for me to catch it that way.  But it's a hard ball and you can break your hand so and she talked to the coach and said, "Okay, well he can pitch.  Well, let's pitch."  So he let me pitch a little bit and then I was a pretty good pitcher and I was throwing side arm and the ball would come in and curve and strike and when my arm got a little lax it stopped curving and so for a right handed batters, they just start hitting right handed batters.  He said, "We can't let you 'cause you throw very hard but, we can't let you just continue hit everybody."  So they moved me to the outfield and I realized outfield is not where I wanna be because you gotta run a whole lot to get the ball and so from outfield, I just moved to basketball and she, she let me do that.
Story_ID: 627932
Speaker 1: If I were to ask you about a sound, a sight or a smell that takes you back to that time, what would you say?
Speaker 2: Well, a smell would be the fall air.  The brisk, you know, when it's not totally cold yet but you feel the cold coming, whether it be a clean crisp smell and the leaves are changing and I can smell it at that point and time and you can smell all the different things of the neighborhood.  That's one smell and then the other would be in the Shenandoah Valley [Virginia] it, even today is supposed to be it's the largest or is it turkey and chicken capital of the world.  So we had all these chicken and turkey farms all within the valley so Tyson [Tyson Foods, Inc.] and Perdue [Perdue Farms, Inc.] and all these big chicken producers have factories there.  But there's a certain whiff of chicken feed that you might smell during the course of the day.  So those smells know that you were in the valley as well.  As far as a taste or even a sight, it just, you know, the, going to the country and smelling country ham or something that is from there that you would recognize.  It could be a certain potato chip that's there that you won't get in Atlanta [Georgia] or anywhere else.  There is a certain aroma from the pig farms that were there obviously but also during the course of the winter when you would butcher there's that certain feel and smell from that as well that's unbeknownst to any, anywhere else that I've ever been in my life.  And a sight would be just the camaraderie of the neighborhood and the kids playing.  Even today when I go back and you can see a kid that I don't know that may even be cousins I don't know and you see them running and playing and know that they are in a safe haven neighborhood.  Even still today, and they, but they don't really realize it.  They think their life is so bad probably because of where they are and what they have that they don't realize it's worse places to be than Harrisonburg, Virginia, so going back those are the things that--and I missed some of those even today.  Every time I go home or come back there's always a case of those potato chips in my car.
Speaker 1: What's the name of those potato chips?
Speaker 2: They're called Martin's [Martin's Potato Chips, Inc.].  They are a barbecue ruffled type barbecue potato chip and ironically this past week as my sister was through here, she brought a bag with her for me and we always tease each other that I'm home and I have Martin's and then there's a world renowned hotdog stand that's been there for probably fifty-five or sixty years.  Everybody comes in that corridor of the valley knows this place called Jess' Quick Lunch [Jess' Lunch, Harrisonburg, Virginia] because the god, the Greek god that came from Greece and had this hotdog recipe with chili that made millions off hotdog and the stand and the place is still there downtown.  So those are the things, the little special quirks about that area that, that, you know, I miss that every time I leave there and drive back, there's a certain level of, you know, I know I'm home when I drive in there.  There's certain, I know I'm in the valley and then when I leave there I'm like oh wow, I'm leaving, I got to go.  And then I know I'm out of the valley as well.
Story_ID: 627933
Speaker 1: We're at junior high school [Thomas Harrison Junior High School; Thomas Harrison Middle School, Harrisonburg, Virginia] and tell me about your, your, your days and maybe some of the teachers.  If--Was there a teacher that was someone who you looked up or remember today?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean there's quite a few teachers I had.  All my teachers were really, really good.  Ironically going back to elementary school [Waterman Elementary School, Harrisonburg, Virginia] to junior high school and even in my basketball career wise, in elementary school I--there's a guy named Jimmy Kramer [James Kramer] that was a teacher and coach and I started from baseball to basketball in the elementary league in basketball you can only score sixteen points in a game and, but you can rebound and do anything else.  Anyway going through my personal belongings recently, actually I saw this scorebook from those games and I scored sixteen points and I couldn't, couldn't do anything else.  So that started my basketball career and we played on eight foot rims.  And we had a pretty good, fairly good team and some of us played high school, some of us went on to college as well.  So a guy named Jimmy Kramer was one of my first coaches, even at the little league level that transcended from a teacher to a coach and then my middle school coach and math teacher, a guy named Mr. Jack Smith that took me into middle school level and kind of taught me some things that were the structural things that I needed to know from a basketball perspective during the course of a game as a teacher.  I really learned the game of basketball and some things from that standpoint from cousins, friends and guys that were older than me that took me by the wing and said, "Here, here's some things you need to know," and then we, you know, we even until today a little bit older than I am and we kid about it say, "Remember when we did this or we did that?" Say, "Yeah, yeah, I remember that."  And it's funny how that has because I went back and got some young kid as well and did the same thing to him.  So those two teachers were very influential to me as I was coming along middle school and high school [Harrisonburg High School, Harrisonburg, Virginia] and then there's a plethora of teachers.  Probably the most special teacher in middle school was my typing teacher because she was like four foot eleven, five foot tall and, you know, I'm growing 6'7", 6'8" and so the height difference was something that really kind of brought me out of the shell where I saw from her view and her world but she saw from mine as well and really made it fun for me in middle school to go into high school.
Story_ID: 627934
Speaker 1: Were there any- anything that happened during your elemen- I mean, I'm sorry, during your junior high school years [at Thomas Harrison Junior High School; Thomas Harrison Middle School, Harrisonburg, Virginia]?  You said there was a story about middle school.
Speaker 2: Middle school--just, just the whole era of middle school and basketball and teachers.  You know, transitioning from elementary [Waterman Elementary School, Harrisonburg, Virginia] to middle school is a big difference, you know, going from a structured just day to day classroom to multiple classes in a, in a bigger building where you always wanted to, I wanna, wanna go to the high school [Harrisonburg High School, Harrisonburg, Virginia], I wanna go to the middle school I'm ready to do that.  I'm tired of elementary school.  It's a big jump and then you try to figure out what life's all about and you get there and you realize that, you know, it's totally different structure, it's a totally different feel, you get your feet wet, then I'm playing sports as well, then I'm on the middle school basketball team, and we going around to these different schools now playing these other teams.  Once everybody realized from a coach's standpoint that there was this tall African America kid six foot seven in eighth grade that can play a little bit then I was kind of the hunted, you know, in that valley area.  So I can recall a basketball game against which became the archrival of ours, middle school where I got kind of jumped on a little bit and then I realized that if I don't get physical or play a little harder that I was gonna get beat up.  So a couple games later, after my cousin had taken me to the side and said, "Look, here's some things you gotta do and here's how you need to play."  I then took it upon myself to take what my mom [Sarah Blakey Sampson] and dad [Ralph Sampson, Sr.] taught me previously and being motivated and want to finish where it got physical so I start being a little bit more physical.  I can recall even in a game where a guy fell on the ground and I fell on top of him to get the ball.  I got the ball and got up and accidentally step in his chest, which you know like, and then the fans like, "Oh you stepped on our player."  I said, "I didn't do it intentionally but that's part, that was part of the game- you on the floor, you gonna get stepped on."  So those type of things happened in middle school where from a quiet shy kid in elementary to now being this kid that's walking the halls of middle school taller than everybody else and now playing basketball and getting some recognition at that level and now trying to figure that out.  So Jack Smith and even the high school coach, Coach Roger Bergey, would talk about that and was very influential in kind of taking me by the wing but my mom and dad as well and said, "Okay, here.  Let's just make sure this is a process that he's enjoying in elementary to high school, high school, I mean, junior high to high school," where it's enjoyment for me not something that's gonna be kind of a fiasco.
Speaker 1: And what about your grades?  Are you still keeping your grades up in middle school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, middle school grades were good and I was always conscientious about grades.  Again my mom and dad, we had to prepare- we had to have our grades and stuff ready to go on the, on the, on the table before dinner and any homework necessary that needed to be done when it got to the level where middle school, even high school you know kept a couple aunts that were educated as well.  We had to--they helped us, tutored us a little bit and we got through it.

Speaker 1: What were your thoughts about, about life?  I mean, you know, every young child has a dream of what they would like to become and most times it changes, you know.  At, at this time in your life, what did you think you might become?
Speaker 2: I didn't know.  Like I said back in the late '70s [1970s] basketball wasn't as prevalent back then as it is today or even when I got there.  So I didn't realize that, you know, I could play basketball professionally, especially in middle school [Thomas Harrison Junior High School; Thomas Harrison Middle School, Harrisonburg, Virginia].  I knew that I could go to college possibly and get an education and play basketball at the college level and then who knows what will happen after that.  But, you know, I was deeply rooted in the neighborhood, deeply rooted by my college coaches and also my sisters [Valerie Sampson and Joyce Sampson Franklin] and family 'cause of their ability to understand kind of where we were and where we came from.  My sisters ran track, they played basketball as well.  Even though the early days my sister played basketball in the fall, I played in the winter and my sisters ran track in the spring.  So if you were not in sports, you cleaned the house and you cooked and you made sure everything was ready to go when mom [Sarah Blakey Sampson] got home.  So I got, I tell, I tell my dad [Ralph Sampson, Sr.] I got, I got two seasons of it.  So I got the fall season and the spring season when, and y'all just got the winter season of your chores and stuff like that so we were deeply rooted in fundamentals of life I think at that point in time even today where things stayed kind of quiet and same until, you know, I moved up the ladder a little bit more.
Story_ID: 627936
Speaker 1: We did talk about you singing in the choir but we, we didn't talk about religion in your home.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What church did you attend and were you required to go to church?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I was born and raised in the Baptist church, church every Sunday, Sunday school every Sunday, [paternal] grandparents [Ruby Howard Sampson and Hampton Sampson], grand- mom [Sarah Blakey Sampson], dad [Ralph Sampson, Sr.], dad, mom.  Dad sang in the choir, everybody in the neighborhood within the valley structure went to the Baptist church and everybody in the hill structure went to the Methodist church.  So, you know, we did a lot of church, a lot of church associations.  My--after years of middle school [Thomas Harrison Junior High School; Thomas Harrison Middle School, Harrisonburg, Virginia] and high school [Harrisonburg High School, Harrisonburg, Virginia] as well, we were in the Baptist association [Augusta Baptist Association], we would go to the huge association meetings and really my, I would call him this, he's passed on now, my spiritual mentor was a guy named Reverend Scott White, Sr. out of Steelton, Pennsylvania, and we would go to the association meetings and his family was very, very large.  He had sixteen children of his own and even today as that family has expanded, all of them could sing.  I mean, and really--so we'd go there and do that as well and deeply entrenched in that whole culture of life.  Even when I got to the NBA [National Basketball Association] he was with me and got me through some, some things that I don't believe in that.  Told him let me make sure 'cause I need to go back to somebody I know that knows what the real deal is.  So we, we did a lot of church, a lot of church.
Story_ID: 627937
Speaker 1: Now on to high school--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what was the name of the high school again?
Speaker 2: Harrisonburg High School [Harrisonburg, Virginia].
Speaker 1: So tell me now about your transition because now you're getting a little recognition from the junior high school [Thomas Harrison Junior High School; Thomas Harrison Middle School, Harrisonburg, Virginia]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --as far as playing basketball--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --so you move on up to high school, so tell me what happens next.
Speaker 2: Again like I said earlier I have even today a great relationship and had a strong relationship back then with my high school coach, Coach Roger Bergey so going into the ninth grade, you know, six foot eight tall, probably 150 pounds soaking wet, kid that's, you know, big Afro into the high school area, I played junior varsity.  I didn't play on a varsity team going in because he was, you now, and he also has some very good varsity players at that point in time as well but as I worked my way through the process, we got on the weight program, you know, the weight room at the high school level at that point in time was one universal machine.  You had to create your own stuff to do.  There really wasn't no program back then that just said, "Do this, do that," because it just wasn't like it is today.  So my coach worked very, very hard to understand and give me the ability to be a normal student but also give me the tools and ability that he had at that point in time to be successful.  So we worked out religiously all the time in the gym, did certain things.  By the end of my freshmen season on the junior varsity, I got moved to varsity and we ended up going to the state championship.  I played sparingly but we, again we had four or five good guys on the team that were seniors that played very, very well so in respect to that we went to state championship and everybody kind of saw that this and the high school was losing a lot of seniors but then we loaded with that junior varsity team because the junior varsity team just won the state championship in junior varsity with the schools so we got this core guys that's coming right into varsity.  So between my freshmen and sophomore year, the summer was a huge summer.  You know, went to basketball camps probably every week during the summer.  My coach took me to camps, parents [Sarah Blakey Sampson and Ralph Sampson, Sr.] paid, my cousins, uncles paid for me to go.  So I grew up really from one year to the next both athletically and academically because it became, you know, now I'm a little bit more known and it's a funny story that, you know, again unlike today back then it was like one or two scouting reports and people that knew across the country where the players were and there was one other actually out Georgia called Bill Cronauer scout report had this kid named Wayne Sampson, not [HistoryMaker] Ralph Sampson, Wayne Sampson.  Nobody knew who he was and so I go to these camps and I'm Ralph Sampson.  They like, "Who are you?  We don't know your name, you're not on the list.  There's a Wayne Sampson."  I said, "I don't know who that is."  But he said, "He's from your hometown."  I said, "I still--that must be me but I don't know who it is."  So I go to this big camp down in Milledgeville, Georgia, and my name's on this list with all these players under Wayne Sampson.  I walk in, no one knew who I was.  Like who's this tall, skinny kid?  So by the end of that camp and people have to understand that people who are breaking out today, that the class of 1979 which was with my senior year.  We had supposedly in history the best high school class ever.  So you had from Isiah Thomases to myself to Sam Bowies, I mean it's like twenty-five number one draft picks possibly--James Worthy.  So anyway we go to these camps and my name is now Wayne then transpired between those years as Ralph so then I go into my sophomore year and now I'm getting more recognition of Ralph Sampson instead of Wayne Sampson in basketball camps.  And then academically because my high school coach knew and wanted me to make sure both things were balanced and so, you know, from being tutored or catching up on things to make sure everything was fundamentally right, then I was pretty much solid and ready to go into my sophomore year of high school because we had to take a new core of guys in from the junior varsity to the varsity to play varsity basketball at that level.  So we did that, we did it very well.  We end up going and winning the state championship that year, actually going to state championship and losing that year.  We won my junior and senior year.  But we had a very good team and that's funny as well going into that after that year, my--the rivalry guy that I stepped on in my middle school years, which was one of their best, better players, transferred to our school to play with us.  So we had a ball and within those years and just like the academics start to increase, the athletic things start to increase, the, the whole aspect of working out increased.  My motivation kicked in from my parents and my dad, mom, sisters [Valerie Sampson and Joyce Sampson Franklin], uncles, you know, to be the best I could be but at that point in time you didn't have a clue what you could do, you just wanna be the best you could be that day and that's kind of how I even live my life today.
Story_ID: 627938
Speaker 1: Who are some of your teammates on the varsity team [at Harrisonburg High School, Harrisonburg, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Well, again, we had the neighborhood guys from the, the, the valley and, and the, and the hill and they're all converged into, into one.  So we had a very good point guard named Tiny Williams [ph.] that was the quickest guy in the city, you know, and maybe the state.  We had--and he wasn't a cousin but he was a good friend, still is today.  We had a guy named Tony Carter [ph.], was another guard.  Actually, he is a second cousin.  We had Clarence Whitelow that was a first cousin, Courtney Whitelow that was a first cousin.  Dwight Blakey that was the first cousin.  We had a couple Caucasian guys- Joe, Bill Hall [ph.], Joe Astock [ph.] that went on and played basketball and you know go off in the college level as well.  A guy named Roland Dickerson [ph.] that was on the hill up there.  We had a guy named Vincent Washington [ph.] that was on the hill as well.  We got Russell Dickerson [ph.] that was another Caucasian guy.  Ricky Lingin [ph.] that was another Caucasian guy.  So we had a plethora of guys that came from the junior varsity into the school that were anywhere from 5'8", 6' to me, 6'11", and very good strong solid team for the next sophomore, junior and senior year that end up winning two state championships.  So, you know, it was a fun chore at that point.  I mean we had some arch rivalries with different schools and a couple would get into as I get to be a junior and senior that became very significant in my life even today.
Speaker 1: Well, we're gonna go to the, your junior and senior year, but this is the first time I hear you talk about white students.  Before that time, were all the students in the schools that you attended all black?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  The ratios in elementary [Waterman Elementary School, Harrisonburg, Virginia], middle [Thomas Harrison Junior High School; Thomas Harrison Middle School, Harrisonburg, Virginia] and whatever were predominantly Caucasian.  My graduating class, 1979, was four blacks, so never were there a plethora of blacks in the school.  I never had the opportunity to go to the all-black school because when I started school is when desegregation was in and I got to go to the, to the Caucasian schools.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, but for my understanding, so let's just go back to clear this up.  That the school, the elementary school was in the black neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well, there's a school in the black neighborhood--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --called Lucy F. Simms [Lucy F. Simms School, Harrisonburg, Virginia] but in 1965 or so I think it is when I was going to, when I was going to kindergarten, that's when the school segre-, you know, split and you could go to the other schools so that school shut down and I was able to go to the, to the, other school--
Speaker 1: So you went out of your neighborhood to school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Story_ID: 627939
Speaker 1: So let's talk about this junior and senior year, some significant things happened (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, so junior year, you know, we had a pretty good run our sophomore season.  Basketball, academics are very solid.  I go in the summer doing camps and clinics again, going to different teaching and my college coach [sic.] taking me around where I need to go, parents [Sarah Blakey Sampson and Ralph Sampson, Sr.] as well.  I go off with my cousins to camps.  I was at basketball camp every week trying to get better at this sport and then come back and really play for my junior and senior year.  By that time I was a little bit more recognized in the world of athletics, being recruited and it kept just kind of going and going and going in my junior year.  No one really knew the capabilities at that point in time but we worked again very hard in the weight room, very hard academically, very hard on the court but again I had great parents, great friends, and a great, great high school coach [Roger Bergey] that made sure that my high school career to the last day was a high school career and I didn't, wasn't harassed or bothered or, or anything as far as basketball was concerned because I was focused on academics and athletics.  And he made it, made it that way.  So everything had to go through him, every call, every letter.  I mean I got 'em, when I got 'em, every day we talk about certain things so you could see this kind of grounds where between my junior and senior year where you know a few letters started trickling in from a couple of colleges from a recruiting standpoint interested and saying, "Okay, possibly you can go to college and play basketball.  Okay, great."  To the senior year where now you got thousands of schools sending letters in on a day to day basis, coaches coming and knocking at the door by the end of my junior.  So we go into the junior year with a very solid basketball team with another school actually up the street about twenty minutes away called R.E. Lee High School [Robert E. Lee High School] in Staunton, Virginia, also had a guy about six foot five about 280 pounds center that became my archrival.  We played them a couple times a year.  So when R.E. Lee and Harrisonburg [Harrisonburg High School, Harrisonburg, Virginia] played, it became the spectacle event of the year when we played.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Mike Madden.  He went on to play at a small school, Radford University [Radford, Virginia], but the coach there is now one of the hottest coach in the State of Virginia and you know all kind of other awards and what not he's older, but it's funny those games themselves we call my junior year but we, you know, had a gym that would hold maybe three, four hundred people and then we had to take our games over to the local college because they could hold ten thousand people in their gym.  Actually, eighty-five hundred people in their gym and we would hold our games in their gym.  We had some games in our gym because of schedule conflicts but we would get more people in our game than the local college would get in their games.  Even the fact of the matter is that they had a coin flip between those years between us and Robert E. Lee.  They had won a game and we had won a game in my junior year and we almost had the same identical record going down the stretch so that's like oh do we flip a coin or do we play it off?  So they ended up playing the game off and we took that game to the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia] where it was ten thousand people.  So in one of my high school games we had ten thousand people watching this high school and this was a game that people wanted to see but it was just like who was seeded where within the standings of going into the state championship.  So we played that game over there and we went on to win the state championship that year and my senior year.  But the games at that point in time were events from college coaches coming to see us play to people that were scouting from wherever they were scouting from coming see us play.  And I had the best time ever because they couldn't talk to me.  My mom and dad got bombarded by coaches and my cousins and everything else got bombarded by coaches. I could walk in the gym and hang out do what I need to do and didn't have to worry about being bothered.  I could play and then I leave the gym and they could say hello and then I leave to go home.  But my college coach he'll tell you the stories today that he'd get called in the middle of the night, called in the day.  He was on the phone all the time but he didn't mind.  He didn't mind that at all because that's what he was committed to and he loved what he was doing.
Story_ID: 627940
Speaker 1: So tell me about the last year and how you prepared to transition and how you decided which college you would go to?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well again, going in my senior year I was now highly recruited.  Thousands of schools and letters daily, coaches calling, you know, trying to make sure I experience a senior year with the prom and just different things as a senior that you wanna experience before you get out of high school [Harrisonburg High School, Harrisonburg, Virginia], trying to understand that and try to build that to the point where I was a normal student within all respect.  Biggest thing between my junior and senior year is how tall was I realistically.  I had the ability to have a locker and then the shortest girl in school was aside my locker and we would always chart how tall are you and I kind of got stuck at 6'11" between those years, didn't grow a whole lot because my body was filling out.  So we measured myself one day and I finally reached seven foot tall so I got tired of so many people asking how tall I was I created--we had, we had t-shirts made and on the back it says, "I am seven foot tall."  Everybody would know so I would wear that shirt every couple days to school and then I end up giving that t-shirt to the little girl that was next door to me and we, and we had a thirty year reunion that we had before but anyway long story short, that we, we continue to do that and then we went into our, into our senior year and we try to make sure that it was very solid academically and athletically.
Story_ID: 627941
Speaker 1: So you're being recruited heavily and how do you decide which college you're gonna go to?
Speaker 2: You know, like I said senior year I didn't quite know.  Coaches were calling, letters were coming in and my college coach [sic. Sampson's high school basketball coach, Roger Bergey] was pulling his hair out a little bit.  We had many, many different opportunities offered.  My college coach could have went on and coached somewhere, if I had gone with something so different things that were going on that were kind of crazy.  So we try to control that as best of our ability.  So what we did was created like they do the Final Four [NCAA Final Four] today.  And we said, "Okay.  Here's school that we know we're not going to."  You know, we just exed them out and put them on, in this pile over here.  We'd keep the letters and keep them coming.  But here's the top fifty or 100 schools that we think we might want to go to.  So he put them in a pile and then we weed them out as well.  So we created a system where we had a, the final four, we had the final four school then we weed someone out they did something wrong, if the coach didn't do something right, or he got fired or, you know, certain things transpired there to make it work.  So we whittled it down to the final four and at that point in time you could take so many visits.  And I didn't want--I think you could take seven college visits.  I took four.  I didn't wanna take all the visits.  I didn't want--you know, you can go to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], go to Hawaii, you could take all these fantastic trips but realistically was I gonna go to school there?  Probably no, too far from home.  So my criteria was that I wanted to be academically solid.  I wanted to have a good coach.  I wanted to be in a good conference.
Story_ID: 627942
Speaker 1: Do you remember the four, the--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the final four schools I chose I was saying the--I went to--of seven visits, I went to four and first visit was University of Kentucky [Lexington, Kentucky] where Joey Hall [Joe B. Hall], Leonard Hamilton was the coaches and they had a plethora of high school All-Americans that was coming into University of Kentucky, Dirk Minniefield, Derrick Hord, John Hurt [sic. Charles Hurt], Sam Bowie and myself we could have went there and had a very, very, very good team.  That would have been probably one of the best teams in college basketball history.  And when I went there, I had a great visit.  I'm gonna go to Kentucky.  This is, this is where I'm gonna.  When I left there I mean we had the Joe B. Hall arena, we had the Wildcat Lodge [Wildcat Coal Lodge], it was the absolute best basketball visit that a recruit could go on.  So I get on the plane and tell my mom [Sarah Blakey Sampson] and them I think I'm gonna go to Kentucky.  Well that's my first visit, didn't, didn't have a clue.  And she said, "Well, you know, wait until the other ones go and you'll see kind of some other comparison schools."  I said, "Okay, good.  But I wanna go to Kentucky."  Okay, good.  So from Kentucky I went to Virginia Tech [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia] and Virginia Tech, I had a pretty good visit there as well.  They had a good coach; they had a solid nucleus of players although they wasn't in a very good conference at that point in time that I thought I would be in a conference that was solid.  And then from there, I went to University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia] which was my worst visit.  The weekend, they had heard through and, the grapevine that I went to Virginia Tech which was their rival school and I went to Kentucky and maybe I would end up at Kentucky so they was like we gotta do something to get him to Virginia so they wanted me to come a weekend which was in my mother's birthday weekend.  So they picked me up in a van because it was only an hour away from my mother's house, father's [Ralph Sampson, Sr.] house.  Picked me up in a van, we went over and had donuts and coffee and stuff and went and did all that just a breakfast and I ended up not staying the whole forty-eight hour whatever timeframe because I wanna get back for my mother's birthday.  But I get there and stayed in a hotel and they take me around the campus and, you know, one of the previous players there had taken some black paint and went up on the outside of the arena which the arena building roof is like a honeycomb and he went up there and painted, "Ralph's [HistoryMaker Ralph Sampson] house" in big bold letters on the top of the building at which was a feat beyond just my own imagination and then they end up giving me a helicopter ride around the campus on the, on the lawn and all that kind of stuff as well, which now after that became illegal to do to give those type of rides on the campus all good stuff as well.  But I cut that visit short just because it was my mother's birthday and then after that when I went to the University of North Carolina [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina], and had a great visit there, Dean Smith, and that whole regime and James Worthy which was a friend of mine that was going to school there, we were the same class and Jimmy Black and a couple of other guys, we would have gone there and had a very, very, very good team as well and so after all that and visits whatever I said, "These are the four schools that I would want to attend.  I want to attend and we'll figure out."  So I went back and forth, back and forth.
Story_ID: 627943
Speaker 1: I was the--still didn't know where I was going to school.  I had the ability to try out for the 1979 Pan American team which I made, first high school player to make that team.  And that was in Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana] with Bobby Knight [Bob Knight].  I still hadn't picked a school so now he's recruiting me again and I'm on the campus and he got me there for a month and I'm playing and training and working out and maybe go to Indiana.  I said, "No, no I don't wanna go to Indiana," you know, Bobby Knight that whole thing I didn't wanna quite do that.  So I still didn't know where I wanted to go to school and then when I got back from that training and I make the team and we go for the summer to play and my mom [Sarah Blakey Sampson] said, "You need to make a decision, you know, the time--."  I said, "I just don't know where I wanna go to school."  So we set a date and said, "You gotta make a decision by this date," so setting this date so we had all the meetings and all the press and fanfare, press conference such and such et cetera and I still didn't--that night before I didn't know where I wanted to go so there was a lady that was very close to my mother at work and her family whatever, almost like a godmother and I went to her house that night, spent the night and the next day didn't go to school 'cause I--nobody--he didn't want nobody harassing me.  Like I said, I don't know where I'm going to school, I didn't really know.  So if you can imagine being in the, in the field house in this high school gymnasium and the stands filled with people outside the door and not even the top four University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] and Lefty Driesell knocking at the door, "Don't go to no school.  Let me in.  I need to talk to you one more time."  He had a guy named John Lucas [John Lucas II] that I became friends with 'cause I, one of those years that I went to camp in Maryland and John Lucas became a friend of mine even after the fact played with him in the NBA [National Basketball Association] and don't go, don't go to Maryland, go to (unclear) we'll give you a job and all this.  Okay, great.  He was at the door beating at the door so I come in the back of the gym. By that time I was still debating where to go to school and then when I get to the gym, I get there and tell my mom, I said, "I wanna cancel this.  I don't, I don't really know where I wanna go."  And she said, "Look you make a decision today so you go back there and you figure it out."  So when I get there, I come out, I start evaluating I said, "Okay, I'm going to University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia]."  So told my coach [Roger Bergey].  He called the other school and said, "This is where he going to school at and this is what he's gonna do."  So I get to the podium and they introduce, introduce my mom and dad [Ralph Sampson, Sr.] sitting beside me and we were talking about it and I said to the media, I said, "I think I'm going to University of Virginia."  That word, "I think" became "you don't know," you know.  I gave my reason so I did that so this whole business so he thinks he's going to Virginia but there might be a chance that he won't.  So anyway then after I signed the paper then it's, you know, I'm at Virginia.  So that happened, big hoopla and radio station and all the stuff in the State of Virginia and things happened so now I'm (unclear) Virginia Cavalier and so on and so forth, and then after the fact a couple days later, the coaches came over, we signed the papers and, and I became a Cavalier.
Story_ID: 627944
Speaker 1: And that's funny that today, in the news, today LeBron James who's a Cavalier [Cleveland Cavaliers] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --had this same type of media thing when--now when you were debating and had people waiting for your press conference because you really didn't know where you wanted to go, I just wanna get your opinion about I mean, because people are talking about how LeBron waited and just made the announcement about that he was going to Miami [Miami Heat].  Do you think that he should have did it the way he did?  I mean which he's getting a lot of criticism about that you didn't know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --he probably knew.  Your coach [Roger Bergey], your coach called the other schools and told them that you weren't going to those schools, the other coaches for these other teams didn't know until they saw it on the media where he was going to go--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --just give me your opinion about that right quick.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I think the mere fact that and I know LeBron, met him when he was in high school [St. Vincent - St. Mary High School, Akron, Ohio], his mom [Gloria James] as well and all that good stuff but very, very solid human being.  I mean very, very, you know, for his years and where's he come from and whatever so I respect his game and his life and everything else so that, that's first and foremost.  I think the aura of back when I made the decision to go to college you know there wasn't as much ESPN and media there and then the media kind of created its own story back then and I think it even created its own story today.  So I don't think LeBron even could conjure up, you know, kind of how this thing happened.  I mean look at Chris Bosh.  Everybody following the media, "What he's gonna do? What's going on?"  The key is for me in that whole thing is when Wade [Dwayne Wade] and Bosh went to Miami but they hadn't signed the contract and they didn't know how much money was gonna make.  So at that point in time I knew LeBron was going to Miami.  Nobody could tell me any different because if they would have been solid enough to understand that their contract wasn't signed, especially Dwayne Wade because he's already from there and they wait and see what LeBron's gonna do and told me he was going there.  So the media created this hype a year ago with what's LeBron gonna do with New York [New York Knicks], then Chicago [Chicago Bulls] and then any of us was gonna go and everybody thought he was gonna go to New York City [New York, New York] and then all of a sudden bam, he goes to Miami.  So in LeBron's mind and heart, what's the biggest thing for him to do?  He has got every accolade in the world, he's got millions of dollars and really only thing left for him to do is win, is win so this type of team put together like Boston [Boston Celtics] has done with their big three like L.A. [Los Angeles Lakers] has done with their guys, now Miami has the ability to do it with LeBron and their three and people are complaining that, you know, he's not like Michael Jordan where he was able to do it by himself.  Well Michael Jordan didn't do it by his self.  Magic Johnson didn't do it by his self.  Kareem Abdul Jabbar didn't do by his--everybody, Larry Bird didn't do it by his self, they had the big three as well so he just wants to be in a situation where he can win and win a lot.  So I think that Miami has given him the ability with someone I highly respect, in Pat Riley to be able to do that and change the game up a little bit but also change the marketing of the NBA [National Basketball Association], which, you know, marketing is down now, they say they lost $400 million, teams are not that good, blah, blah, blah but everybody now is gonna wanna watch Miami.  They wanna watch him in Cleveland, but he took it to the ceiling in Cleveland.  He wasn't able to get anything else out of that.  So I think he in his mindset what else can I do at Cleveland, I can win a championship but are you gonna give me the tool and the resources to be able to win a championship?  Or do I go somewhere else and get it?  So the marketing dollar, you know, the NBA contract dollar may be a little bit less, but the marketing dollar is much, much more at Miami if they win the championship than it would be in New York.  If he go to New York, he's not gonna win in New York.  Chicago he might been a little bit better but he got to stick with Michael Jordan over in Chicago well I don't wanna go in and do that and follow in that footsteps so let me go somewhere else.  If I can't do in Cleveland I may as well go somewhere else that's gonna benefit me and then we can stir this thing up a little bit. So everybody's up in, in an uproar and the Cleveland owner [Dan Gilbert], the Dallas owner [Mark Cuban], 'cause they gotta face that and they know that we might, we might not be able to win over the next couple of years.

Speaker 1: The other thing is you didn't go to one school because they weren't in a good conference.  Tell me what that means, what the conferences, what's the differences between the conferences?
Speaker 2: Well I mentioned Virginia Tech [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia], they were in a Conference USA or back then whatever conference [Metro Conference] they may have been in they didn't (unclear) the Atlantic Coast Conference but the ACC, Atlantic Coast Conference in my opinion, is over the years they've been the top conference with schools that you have to play against.  So I get, got to play against the North Carolinas [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina] of the world, I got to play against the Marylands [University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland], I got to play against the best of the best that there was and I got the opportunity to go to a school or university that hadn't been quite a, quite the best in that aura or those schools, so I got to go there because we had a nucleus of players that were kind of on the brink of becoming really, really good but they needed a piece.  They needed a center or somebody and once I got there we created that.  When it was a two year period of time we go to the Final Four [NCAA Final Four].  So between that, and Kentucky [University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky] was in SEC [Southeastern Conference] where the SEC's football is king but Kentucky basketball dominates anywhere in the country, even today.  So they, you know, anything about it, but I know I couldn't win in Kentucky but we were dominating the SEC conference at every level so competing against somebody in that conference might not have been like competing against a Michael Jordan in ACC or a Sam Bowie in the SEC or James Worthy in ACC or Buck Williams at Maryland ACC.  Every team in the ACC you had players that went on to the NBA [National Basketball Association] and they had players that were good on every team.  So every night it was very, very competitive and that conference wise is kind of why I picked that conference and two schools in that conference in Virginia [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia] and North Carolina and being that Virginia was a little bit closer to home, my mom [Sarah Blakey Sampson] and dad [Ralph Sampson, Sr.] could see me play every night.
Story_ID: 627946
Speaker 1: Now let's go on to when you get to college.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So talk to me about the transition now from high school [Harrisonburg High School, Harrisonburg, Virginia] to college and, and what goes on now.  'Cause now you're very well known.
Speaker 2: A little bit.  I mean I'm known a little bit better.  The State of Virginia is little a bit more relaxed because it's an upstanding state.  You know, it's funny 'cause I don't, didn't realize that, the magnitude back then that I do today or some things that happened in the course of time.  Going in from high school to college is like I the, I'm here and one of the reasons that I chose Virginia [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia] as well as the athletic was the academic side.  Virginia is almost like an Ivy League school and my academic side of things if I go there and do well, I could--if something happened knee wise or injury wise in college or NBA [National Basketball Association], then I'll be very solid academically.  So in choosing a school I knew that I was gonna be solid that way.  But I was also nervous because it was put out in the print by a guy named Howard Cosell that why would he choose Virginia because he's not gonna make it academically there.  He's gonna go in the NBA in a couple years and it's not gonna make any difference.  So I was hearing all these things about Virginia and academics, athletics, nervous as a young kid going in coming from the Pan American Games overseas and then transitioned right to college.  Like wow man I gotta, I gotta you, know, a lot of things I gotta do here and kind of a whirlwind when I look back at it now.  But I get there and get set up, get organized, you know, again having another great coach, Coach Terry Holland, and just gave me the world of the ability to academically be on point and athletically be on point so you can imagine University of Virginia not being in the spotlight at that level within--in my first year going from my first year academically making sure I was solid to the athletic side of things during the course of my first year, winning the NIT, National Invitational Tournament [National Invitation Tournament], in New York City [New York, New York], becoming the player of the, of the tournament, MVP, winning the title against Kevin McHale and University of Minnesota [University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota] and UNLV [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada] and all the teams that we played against.  We didn't make the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] tournament but we made that tournament, but we win it, we go to New York City and now the sky is open with the media a little bit more from a young, shy quiet guy that had a one office big as this room possibly, sports information department at University of Virginia to the next year having a whole building.  And one person staff to five people on the staff, to winning that championship and going next summer and really working out like I said the transition from my freshmen year to my sophomore year in high school now from my freshman year to my sophomore year in college, working out with weights and having my you know not one weight coach but two weight coaches at University of Virginia and building my body and my academics, you know, that summer to go into my sophomore season at Virginia ready to go with a very solid fundamental basketball team to go in from NIT to the Final Four and now getting attention all over the world.
Speaker 1: I just need you to explain NIT and what the Final Four is?
Speaker 2: The NIT is the, is probably the, the most historical before there was NCAA Final Four tournament, there was a National Invitational Tournament where people got invited to that tournament.  So it's a little bit more prestigious than the NCAA tournament.  Over the years the NCAA tournament, the Final Four, has taken more hold than NIT so people that don't make the NCAA tournament, the field of sixty-four today, all then go into the NIT.  So you get invited there so the NIT waits for these people to get selected and then if you don't get selected you go in this other pool which is another tournament so you can continue to play a little bit.  So we did not make the NCAA tournament my freshmen year. We made the NIT tournament.  We got invited to that tournament and then we ended up winning that tournament as I said in New York City.
Story_ID: 627947
Speaker 1: You graduated from high school [Harrisonburg High School, Harrisonburg, Virginia] in?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 1: Seventy-nine [1979].  Okay so you're--we're going into this was '80 [1980] your freshmen year.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: We're going into '81 [1981].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So your sophomore year.  So tell me how things progressed.
Speaker 2: So after winning like I said the National Invitational [National Invitation Tournament] my freshmen year, we just kind of get up for my sophomore year.  My sophomore year with Jeff Lamp, Lee Raker, Terry Gates, Craig Robinson, Ricky Stokes, Othell Wilson.  We had Jeff Jones, we had a plethora of guys that were seasoned before I got to Virginia [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia] that had been through some trials and tribulations as far as winning or losing but like I said it was one of my reasons for choosing University, University of Virginia was they needed a piece of the puzzle and I could go in and start and I could play pretty much right away when I got there.  They needed a center and that's what I was.  So they were able to do that our second season at University of Virginia my sophomore year, we were able to go to the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] tournament and also get to the Final Four tournament [NCAA Final Four].  We were ranked as one of the predominantly number one teams in the country for the year pretty much and was able to reach the pinnacle of NCAA basketball by going to the Final Four.  We end up losing to North Carolina [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina], our archrival, in the semifinals which was the year that Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan], the president, got shot that we didn't think we would end up playing those games because of that, but we played them, we played them.  They let us play.  But Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana] won that Final Four that year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But in 1981--well, tell me the year that--you won three Naismith Awards [Naismith Men's College Player of the Year Award] right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me the years.  And tell me what the award is?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Naismith Award, so in my freshmen year at college was '79 [1979], '80 [1980] NIT championship so '80 [1980], '81 [1981] we go to the Final Four subsequently in my junior and senior year when I graduated in 1983 I had the opportunity to win three national player of the year awards in college basketball.  So there were multiple awards there, the John Wooden Award [John R. Wooden Award], the Rupp award [Adolph Rupp Trophy], then the Naismith's player award which Naismith is--Naismith's name created basketball.  It supposedly back in the day and the peach basket and all that so the award is the Naismith Award which is the basketball hall of fame award so they elect a player every year to become the national college player of the year and I was able to win that three years in a row from my sophomore, junior and senior year.
Speaker 1: Were you the, were you the only player that got the award three times?
Speaker 2: Subsequently there is me and Bill Walton that received those awards three years in a row.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was only two of us.
Story_ID: 627948
Speaker 1: About the next year (laughter)?
Speaker 2: So you know so going in that sophomore year to junior year again highly, highly ranked team in the country.  You know, we go in, go in there ranked and doing very well, we end up that my junior year losing to University of Alabama, Birmingham [University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama], and the regional finals or the southeast region, our point guard goes out with a thigh bruise and I had an ankle sprain or whatever, but we lose on the, like the last second shot to that school that year.  Made it to the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] final, final--NCAA tournament but not the Final Four [NCAA Final Four].  You know, had a really good year.  Disappointed that year we didn't go to the Final Four and win but we were very, very highly ranked team in the top two in the country play all year long and played very well the team, very impressive academically and athletically.  Subsequently the years of my college, I had the, in going back a little bit, I had the ability to go into the NBA [National Basketball Association] every year and so my freshmen year, I go back even my high school year from senior year on [at Harrisonburg High School, Harrisonburg, Virginia], I had the ability to go into the NBA.  I can recall my freshmen year in college and even before that going to college my high school year we had the Boston Celtics come to my mother [Sarah Blakey Sampson] and father's [Ralph Sampson, Sr.] house and saying, "You can go into the NBA from high school," which at that point in time, I really didn't think I was ready obviously, wasn't really physically or mentally for that daily grind into the NBA.  I had the ability to have Mr. Red Auerbach who has now passed on and the owner of the Boston Celtics come to my mother's, father's house with a briefcase that had a million dollars in cash in it, sit on my kitchen table and said, "We want you to come out of high school and play (unclear). We got the number one pick in the NBA draft and we will select you as number one pick in the NBA draft in 1979 to come with the powerful Boston Celtics."  They had Larry Bird at that point and time and Kevin McHale.  They didn't have Robert Parish and a couple of other pieces. They needed a center and they thought I be the one that would be their center.  Subsequently I told him no and went on to college.  My freshmen year as well I had a chance to come out of college and go into the NBA and my sophomore year and my junior year as well.  So at the end of every year, I had a decision to make on what was I gonna do, was I gonna go into the NBA, was I gonna stay in college?  And every year I went and came back and chose to come back to school.  Couple of reasons being that, you know, we know the financial status would change going to the NBA but were my parents okay?  Were they happy?  Were they financially stable?  Did they need anything?  Was I on course to graduate?  My academics were solid and was I on course to graduate and were those factors in my decision making process so I went through a couple weeks of really hard core, soul searching and trying to find myself.  What do I really want to do and every year I came back to the point where I want to go back to school.  I still had some things for my upbringing as I said earlier.  I need--some things I need to finish in college.  I want to finish my degree and also I want to win a championship.  And so and that kind of led me back every year so I had this decision to make and this hoopla, he's coming back to school, he's going back to school and make a decision he's not in the NBA draft.  One of those years I could have came out and the biggest thing there was the coin flip.  I didn't--If I had known maybe I was gonna go with the Lakers [Los Angeles Lakers] one year, I probably would have maybe have gone but between the Lakers and the Indiana Pacers and it was 50/50 chance that that coin flip was gonna land with the Lakers.  I said, "I don't wanna go to Indiana."  I mean, you know, if I go to Indiana and play there for a minute is it really where I want to be?  Probably not.  So I'm not gonna take a chance on a coin flip and leave college where I'm happy and successful to go to Indiana where I'll be miserable. If I knew I was gonna go to the Lakers, I probably would have maybe jumped ship a little earlier so I didn't take that chance because I was happy where I was at.  I was on course to graduate and I had a very good solid team around me that we can win a championship that also back then when I look at it today, actually increasing my stock and my value by going back to school and playing and winning and doing and winning another player of the year award which now you know only a few people have done.  So I went back to school and end up graduating in my senior year and walking on the lovely lawn at University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia] and moving onto the NBA.
Story_ID: 627949
Speaker 1: Did you think any more about how what Howard Cosell said when you decided to go to his school?
Speaker 2: No 'cause I had the, I had the ability to meet Howard Cosell a couple of years after that with Muhammad Ali in, in Arizona at a function and I was on the podium, I got to speak about a little bit and said, you know, it was one of my player of the year award speeches.  I said, "Well, I'm very proud of myself and my teammates too to win this prestigious award but the most prestigious thing in my life right now is I'm on course to graduate.  With some people like Howard Cosell didn't think I would make it at University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia], a highly acclaimed Ivy League type of school."  So I got to dig back at him a little bit after the fact and everybody kind of laughed oh, okay well I met him after the fact.  Said, "Oh, yeah, I knew you'd make it but I didn't, I didn't--." I said, "You said--I heard it on the radio, I heard it on the radio you didn't think I would make it at the University of Virginia because it was academically strenuous there," but I got to dig back at him a little bit.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's good because actually that school has the highest African American graduation rate of all public universities in the United States--
Speaker 2: Oh, wow.
Speaker 1: --in the last fifteen years (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --running so (laughter).
Speaker 2: So it's come up a lot since I've graduated which is good.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So graduation and it's time, now you're of course being recruited so tell me about the process now because you are definitely gonna decide to go play for the NBA [National Basketball Association], is that right?
Speaker 2: Well, I graduated so I got no other choice but to be in the NBA draft and I'm becoming a senior and, you know, I know I'm gonna be drafted.  I knew who I would be drafted by, by the Houston Rockets, and right now so my spring of my senior year in college, I'm just trying to figure out stay on point to graduate and just kind of stay out of the mainstream of life to be safe and sound so nothing happens and nothing gets in my way.  So I do that and I make sure that I protect myself in all ways and one incident that we can talk about from college is you know I'm on point to graduate, I'm in the house, I'm working out every day, I'm trying to be quiet and I'm going out with my teammates to a function on the lawn at the University of Virginia that's kind of celebrating all the graduates and I get into an altercation.  So that, that things--those things happen and then also we try to make it work where I make sure I'm on point to do what I need to do.
Story_ID: 627950
Speaker 1: The process on how you go to the NBA [National Basketball Association] is a little different as far as being chosen or picked, draft pick, so can you explain that a little bit?
Speaker 2: The college, the college area you're, you're being recruited by whatever teams that want your services and then you have a plethora team.  I had a, over a thousand some schools that I could have chosen and I got an invite with those schools myself and see which one I wanna, I wanna go to academically and or athletically.  When you finish your career or you decide to go into the NBA if it's early and free as a freshmen, sophomore or junior or you graduate or you finish your four years at an institution and now you wanna go into the NBA, you go into what is called a draft and due to the NBA's perspective you don't know who you's gonna, who you gonna go with back in those days which is why I stayed in school to some extent because they didn't determine early on what team had the number one pick.  Today they do with a lottery but a young kid today still not gonna know where he's going and just kind of word of mouth until all of a sudden they pick who's gonna be drafted where so in my case, I didn't know what team, those years that I would be drafted because there was a coin flip and then coming out of college the rules changed a little bit after the fact where this team that was at the bottom of the barrel in the NBA that had the worst record nine times out of ten had the first pick because they wanna make those teams better in the NBA.  So I knew to the fact that even, I thought going into my senior year I'd be going to the Philadelphia 76ers because they had the worst team.  They traded Moses Malone that was a Virginia product into Philadelphia where they end up winning the championship which you're serving that crew so trading from Houston to Philadelphia so now Houston becomes the team that is the bottom of the barrel.  So at that point in time I had no choice.  I can't go back to school.  You know, there's no coin flip so I'm open, open game in the NBA and whoever gets the number one pick, that's where I was slated to go so Houston got that pick.
Speaker 1: So tell me about what happens?  I mean, you negotiate a contract, what goes on--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --behind the scenes there?
Speaker 2: Well, you get picked in the NBA draft so I go from graduating college on the lovely lawn of University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia], Thomas Jefferson facility, on a rainy afternoon.  That was probably the best experience of life knowing that I got this piece of paper four years and what I accomplished again for my mother [Sarah Blakey Sampson] and father [Ralph Sampson, Sr.] to finish something where I started off finishing in college to walking down and getting this diploma that I finished this process, a part of my life so now I'm going to the NBA and accomplishing another dream to get there as the number one pick which didn't know that was gonna be the case going in but it happened due to hard work.  Going to the NBA with the Houston Rockets.  So get drafted in New York City [New York, New York], with hoopla, with the NBA draft how it is today and New Jersey held up a baseball cap one night to getting call from Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] the president that night saying, "Congratulations on being the number one pick," to the next day getting on a Learjet with me being the number one pick and Rodney McCray from the University of Louisville [Louisville, Kentucky] being the number three pick flying from New York City to Houston [Texas], getting introduced to the fans and Houston.  Still not having a contract and still not, you know, understanding the financial impact this gonna be later on in my life, waving to the crowd and wine and dine and all that kind of stuff, well now having my agent and being in, negotiating with contract.  So subsequently I go back to Virginia and just put myself on the shelf until that contract is signed until they start negotiating back and forth what they wanna do.  So when my agent called me and said, "We're in the process of negotiation, we need you to fly to Houston or after we sign the contract in Carmel, California [Carmel by the Sea, California]," because that's where the owners had a house.  So we flew to San Francisco [California], went to Carmel and we start negotiating with agent and myself what the contract was gonna be.  So after that negotiation we kind of sit down, sign it and then it's off to the races after that.
Speaker 1: Tell me who your agent was.
Speaker 2: Had a guy named Tom Collins.
Story_ID: 627951
Speaker 1: How did this, this change your life?
Speaker 2: You know, it, it--
Speaker 1: Or did it change your life?
Speaker 2: It, it, it--I mean, you become, not the first supposedly is, what they said the previous year was James Worthy, which his initial contract was about eight hundred thousand dollars probably.  I may have been the first million dollar guy out of college supposedly.  I don't know all the factors went into that, really don't make too much difference.  But it did, it changed the mere fact that I was growing into my own world academically and athletically but was still very rooted and grounded with my family understanding what we need to do and how we need to get it done.  So doing it didn't change a whole lot.  It just kind of what my course of life was.  You know I--it's funny because my first year in the NBA [National Basketball Association], I drove a station wagon, a Chevrolet station wagon.  I didn't have a car.  I had a rent a car whatever I drove 'cause I didn't know what kind of car.  I mean I wouldn't go buy a fancy car and instead I drove a station wagon.  So I not only had an NBA contract, I also had a shoe endorsement contract that my shoe endorsement contract gave me a car.  So my first Mercedes [Mercedes Benz] was endorsement from a shoe contract.  So I really never--really never bought cars until later, later in my contract because they always have them in the contract.  So it never really changed me a whole lot.  When it came down to financial, I made sure my family, mom [Sarah Blakey Sampson] and dad [Ralph Sampson, Sr.] was secure, you know, and make sure they was able to do what they wanted to do.  My mom and dad always told me said, "Don't matter what we doing, we been living this many years without that" and that was a decision I made in college [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia], you know.  Were we secure, were we okay?  We can still work and we'll be fine.  It didn't make a difference, we'll be okay.  So it changed not in many ways.  I didn't, I didn't change a whole lot.
Story_ID: 627952
Speaker 1: Now tell me about your teammates?  Who were your teammates that first year?
Speaker 2: Well, going into my rookie year in the NBA [National Basketball Association] I had some widely seasoned veterans that were people I had looked up to prior to me going into the NBA even in high school [Harrisonburg High School, Harrisonburg, Virginia].  One of them was a guy named Elvin Hayes that had played many, many years in the NBA and my freshman--I mean my rookie season was his last year.  And I recall just being with him and trying to understand all the quirks and history and dos and don'ts of what he has experienced in NBA so I wouldn't get into a bad world or at least how to navigate this thing a little bit.  And one of the funniest stories is that, you know, we wasn't going to the playoffs somewhat like the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] tournament in college different playoffs in the NBA.  We wasn't going into the playoffs that year and he was approaching his, some milestone with minutes played in his, in his career and one of the last two games I went to the coach and said, "You know, let him play.  Let him, you know, let him get his milestone.  I don't wanna play.  We're not going--I don't, I got many more years, I'm not gonna play, you know, any more so let him play," and the coach got mad at me 'cause he didn't think I wanted to play and I wanted Elvin to play.  So a lot of things happened that year.  I had Elvin Hayes, Tommy Henderson [Tom Henderson], Caldwell Jones, Major Jones, guys that had been in the NBA for a number of years that taught me kind of how to navigate the NBA in the right way.  So I'm very fortunate with that.  Then I had a cast of young guys, me and a guy named Rodney McCray that became lifelong friends and a couple of other guys that were on the team that were kind of just beginning our careers, we had a great opportunity to see those guys work and play but also here I think the most valuable thing to hear their stories about what to do and what not to do.
Story_ID: 627953
Speaker 1: That first year as a rookie, do you get to play as, you know, as much as--I mean, how, how does that work as, as a rookie?
Speaker 2: Well, it's funny as a rookie or a number one pick you, you know, you gonna start, you gonna play.  You, you know, and it's kind of weird how it works you got a guy named, like Elvin Hayes or Caldwell Jones that's got ten years plus in the, in the league and they kind of are put out to pasture and so the new guys coming in that have the legs and not as many pains and quirks that they may have start played the most minutes.  So I got to play home a lot, start, play whatever while these guys that I respected and looked up to are sitting on the bench and they get to play sparingly when they get to play so it was a little I've been experience because okay I got these guys, how I'm gonna get some playing time?  You know with these type of people on the bench but also then understanding the game when I got there that wow these are guys that are in their mid-thirties, I'm twenty-one years old and they're kind of, career is kind of passed and they're getting ready, ready to retire at a, at a young age.  And like wow it's kind of, kind of a little backwards to me but it is what it is because it's a sport.
Speaker 1: So, now this was--you stayed there for how many years?
Speaker 2: I stayed in Houston [Houston Rockets] for six--'83 [1983] to '87 [1987], six and a half years, six and a half years [sic.].
Speaker 1: And then there's another player which becomes a part of the twin towers.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You wanna talk about that?
Speaker 2: Well subsequently after my rookie year we didn't make the playoffs so we got the opportunity to get another high draft pick because of the way the system was and there was a gentleman by the name of Hakeem Olajuwon that played for the University of Houston [Houston, Texas] that was from there, that, a very good player and that was slated to be a number one pick.  So we got the number one pick for the, for the second year, well my year and then we missed a year and then the year after that we got number one pick again and, and we chose Hakeem Olajuwon and we then subsequently became the twin towers of the Houston Rocket years and he played center and I played forward which my ability and skills and his as well were very complementary to each other where we could kind of fit on the same court at the same time.  So that started a new trend I think in the NBA [National Basketball Association] where most people had to have seven foot players or at least two big guys that were agile and mobile to compete with us across the board because we would be starting that trend and we were pretty, pretty dangerous when we, when we played together and played well.
Speaker 1: How tall is Hakeem?
Speaker 2: He was seven foot tall--
Speaker 1: Seven foot, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) seven foot tall.
Speaker 1: And you by that time you had grown to your height of 7'4"?
Speaker 2: Seven foot four, yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Well, talk more about anything that might have happened during that time at Houston or if you wanna?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Houston years were you know as I look back on my NBA career were that was my NBA career I mean I played with other teams but we had the opportunity to play at a very high level in Houston, had a lot of great friends and players around me and me around them and, you know, go from the second year of my NBA career having Hakeem Olajuwon on the team to my third year of going to the, to the NBA finals against the Boston Celtics so that whole experience was one that actually when people look at [HistoryMaker] Ralph Sampson today will go back and remember my Houston Rocket years because of the twin towers, one because of hitting the last second shot against the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference finals to go to the finals and NBA against the Boston Celtics where Hakeem got thrown out the game and we had some fights and all kinds of different things going on there but very good game for us to play and win and I tell people about that whole experience in 1986 that we had come out of the West and won a grueling battle with the Denver Nuggets and seven game series.  We had to go then exactly and play the Los Angeles Lakers two days later.  No time to transition and go home to change clothes to do anything.  We going from one city to the next and playing and the Lakers beat us pretty bad the first game and again since like I said it's a seven games series so they beat us pretty bad.  Subsequently after we got our legs under us and rested, we won the next four games straight.  So they didn't want another game after that and people were like oh I didn't realize and they would have won the fifth game, they still would have had--we still would have been up three games to two and going and going back home to Houston [Texas] where we don't really lose, hadn't really lost a game there in a long time.  So anyway we had a chance to do that and go to the finals and really enjoyed that experience in the NBA and again, I'm on top of the world trying to get to the finals again.  Hakeem Olajuwon, twin towers a very good nucleus of players and a very good city which I still love today and enjoying that whole NBA experience was phenomenal.

Speaker 1: They have all-star, NBA All-Star Weekend.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You played in that as well?
Speaker 2: I had an opportunity to play in five all-star games over my period of time all within the Houston [Houston Rockets] timeframe.  I actually played in four.  I got injured in my fifth one before the game--two weeks before the game so I played in four of them and in 1985 I happened to be the MVP of the all-star game in--was in Indianapolis, Indiana, at that point in time.  They move it all over the country, but anyway played with Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul Jabbar in the West and we ended up winning the game but I was the most valuable player of the game.  That was one of my most highly memorable moments in the NBA as well.
Story_ID: 627955
Speaker 1: Do you get married during this time or after this time?
Speaker 2: After about three years in the NBA [National Basketball Association] and the regular NBA life whatever I found a female that I'm highly attracted to and we end up getting married in 19--let me go back 1985, '86 [1986] when really the height of my career and everything is going extremely well and trying to figure out what's happening at that point in time in life and she was in the modeling field and we hit it off and got married.
Speaker 1: So how did you meet her?  And tell me her name?
Speaker 2: Ironically we met in that year going to the finals.  My sister actually met her.  I was focused on the game.  We were in Denver, Colorado, and I was playing a trick on Bill Russell and Bill Russell had become, you know, decent friends over the years and he would be commentating games and he said, "Well, that [HistoryMaker] Ralph Sampson, whatever, you can barely hear him running down the court.  He's like twinkle toes.  And he--you need to put bells on his shoes to hear him coming" so I got a pair, I found out his shoe size, I got a pair of shoes that were Pumas at that point in time what I wore and before the game, well a couple hours before the game me and my sister that was at the game, visiting, watching, I go to the mall and I'm making these tassels with these bells on it to put on the shoes and they green Boston Celtics colors so forth and so and so.  So before the game I'm giving him these shoes with these tassels on it but while we going out and looking for the tassels, I'm focused on the mall 'cause I need to get down and get rest.  My sister with me and then she sees these girls over to the side of me and they models for Ebony Fashion Fair et cetera, et cetera, et cetera and there's some nice looking girls, whatever but that's okay I'm going, I'm going on.  I didn't pay attention to her at that point in time.  Came back to the game and then we lose the game and the guy on the team, on the opposing team (unclear) knew a couple girls in that same group.  He says, "Man, come on go out, go out."  I said, "Man, we lost I ain't going out."  Said, "Man," and we end up having the same agent as well.  "Go out, go out."  I said, "No," so he begged me to go out so we go out and he introduced me to these females and then subsequently we started talking shortly after that and exchanged numbers.  She was going on her way, I was going on mine.  We talked on the phone every day and kind of just built a relationship after that.
Speaker 1: Tell me her name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Aleize [Aleize Dial Sampson].
Speaker 1: Okay. And you have children?
Speaker 2: We have children.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your children?
Speaker 2: We have four lovely children.  The oldest is Rachel Sampson and she is subsequently had just this year graduated from Stanford University [Stanford, California], doing very well, very well young lady and very well I mean just off the chart.  A couple things about Rachel she has got the--my mom's [Sarah Blakey Sampson] side, my dad's [Ralph Sampson, Sr.] side motivation and focus.  She has juvenile diabetes but she was in the top two of the class at Stanford (background noise) this year and so very proud of her and degree and she's going to grad school either Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] or Wharton business school [Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  She played tennis and basketball in high school and played a little tennis in college and has the desire to just be very good at what she does and be writing books and being in the movie business.  I have a son Ralph III [Ralph Sampson III], that's at the University of Minnesota [University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota], playing basketball as we speak and going into his junior year and six foot eleven, pretty big boy and just kind of winding into shape right now academically and athletically and hopes to aspire to get his degree and also play in NBA as well.  I have a six foot nine entering freshman.  So what two kids this year graduate from one high school and one college on June the 12th and June the 13th?  So one day on the one coast and next day, the next coast.  His name is Robert Sampson and he is attending University of East Carolina [East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina] and right now he's in summer school and playing very well.  Kind of winding into shape in the basketball and academics as well.  And then there is with my ex-wife now there's a, the youngest is Anna Sampson and she's eleven years old and I would say and she was the and is the must say the beautifulest, the most gorgeous baby ever born and she's a big girl.  She's about 5'11" at eleven and just recently got accepted to go to Walt Disney World [Walt Disney World Resort, Orlando, Florida] in December for modeling and academics.  So got my hands full with, with kids all over the place trying to make sure they do what they need to do.
Story_ID: 627956
Speaker 1: So when did your tenure with the Rockets [Houston Rockets] end?
Speaker 2: I got traded in 1987 I believe it was, get all the dates right in like December 1987 into the Golden State Warriors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And ended up playing there Golden State for a few years having subsequently knee injuries and in Houston the year after we went to the finals and get traded and go to Golden State and have a few more knee injuries, play there for two years and then subsequently getting traded to the Sacramento Kings and playing there for two years there as well and then after playing there really deciding to kind of leave basketball for a minute playing wise, took a year off, went overseas to Spain and had one of the best experiences of my life in a training camp while meeting some people, seeing different part of the world but played in Spain for about six months then came back from there and coached at James Madison University [Harrisonburg, Virginia] and then went back to the NBA [National Basketball Association], played for a year on, with the Phoenix Suns but never made the full roster because they had too many people on the roster and then retired in 1995.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You went through that kind of quickly.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  Well, we have the timeline anyway but explain to me about being traded.  Why and how are you traded and were you ever a free agent?
Speaker 2: I was never a free agent.
Speaker 1: But tell me what that means?
Speaker 2: Free agent means that your NBA contract that you are currently under is over and then you became free to explore the market and your value and where you wanna be and how much you're really worth in the market.  So I never became a free agent in the NBA.  I wish I would have.  But during the time and effort contract wise it wasn't right for me.  How it feel to be trade?  I--you know, when I got traded the first time I was traded from the Houston Rockets to the Golden State Warriors and didn't know it.  Didn't know it was even in the works.  We end up, we was in Chicago [Illinois] playing against the Bulls [Chicago Bulls] actually and Michael Jordan and we end up winning the game and coming back home to Houston [Texas] and I get in the airport in Houston land and the coach comes up to me and says, "I need to talk to you."  Okay, great.  "You've been traded to the Golden State Warriors."  I'm like huh, you know, what are you talking about?  And so you get this real calmness that come over you and that's a kind of a calm mad because you know you can't just can't kind of go off but you can be mad about it.  At that point in time, my wife [Aleize Dial Sampson] was, my wife was pregnant with my first child [Rachel Sampson] and I'm like okay I can't leave her, I can't do all this kind of stuff as well.  I gotta figure it out.  I'm traded to a team that's not even good, to a team that I'm on that we went to the championship where we got to possibly do it all over again and I'm traded.  So I was really devastated to the point where I was going from a very, very good situation to a bad situation.  My first kid was due any, any day and I was leaving kind of the group of people that I've, have grown to like and be with for the last six and a half years.  So it's funny because they give you forty-eight hours to get from one place to the next and I have to regroup and say how I'm a do this and get my, everything together.  So they gave me a little bit longer time period to get there, like seventy-two hours to get there and then I regrouped and went on to the Golden State Warriors.
Story_ID: 627957
Speaker 1: And so, you weren't looking to be traded again, but it was, was it as devastating or not the second time?
Speaker 2: Well, the second time, you know, you know, it's, it's really the, you understand the business of basketball at that point in time.  We talked about earlier LeBron James and kind of what he's facing and the sport on the court is the fun part.  When you're playing and you're kind of in your own world, I have control over that, LeBron has control over that and any player that plays has control over that.  You get control over the things you can control: working out, eating and sleeping.  Those things you have control over but the business of it the trade and kind of what goes on outside of you have no control over it.  The owners and the league and just, people in the media have control over some of those things so you got to work on what you can control so I understood the business of basketball at that point in time.  The first time traded and then the second time traded so it really didn't have a major effect on me at that point in time.  The saving grace being traded second time is, was Bill Russell was the general manager so I knew that my dealings with him from college [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia] on to the NBA [National Basketball Association] was something that I respected and he, if he was there, cool I could deal with it for a minute and I can go there and just kind of recoup my career a little bit and figure out what's what not knowing kind of all the pieces that were there at that point in time but the owner and how creative he may have been and so forth and so on but I did respect Bill Russell and his decision to bring me there.
Story_ID: 627958
Speaker 1: How do you transition to play overseas?
Speaker 2: Well, after two years there at Sacramento [California] when things were kind of going astray a little bit with the Kings [Sacramento Kings] and the owner and not knowing what they were doing and different coaches, different general managers, you know, not playing at all now, you know, sit the bench and dedicated to that role, you know, I still thought I had some abilities to play.  We sit down and negotiated a kind of a buy out of my contract over a period of time so we did that and then I became kind of free to do what I wanted to do.  I got picked up by the Washington Bullets at that point in time, now the Washington Wizards for, you know, a couple of contract, couple ten day contracts so forth and so on.  Again they had so many people there they couldn't get me on full time so I said, "This is crazy."  I had an opportunity with another friend that knew some people overseas that said, "You know, you can go to Malaga, Spain, and play in the European league [EuroLeague] and make this amount of money and it's tax free and all the other perks," and I said, "Let me think about that," so got together and decided that's what I'm gonna do and he took me over and I didn't speak any of the language and he stayed with me for a couple of weeks until I got my feet wet and I stayed there for about six months playing and enjoying what life had to offer over there and really using that as training camp for myself to get back in better shape to come back to the United States and play in the NBA [National Basketball Association] again.
Story_ID: 627959
Speaker 1: Did your knee injury have much to do with all that was going on?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, you know, when I was at Houston [Houston Rockets] I had my first knee injury and having the injury and then with my body structure, having what is called a torn meniscus which is I call it a brake disc between your joints, that's really what it is.  It's kind of a small cushy pad that takes the shock and being my ability and size when I tore that, it kind of took away from my mobility in Houston and then also in Sacramento [Sacramento Kings]--I mean in Golden State [Golden State Warriors] I did it again and so I became almost bone on bone and then subsequently having it done the third time in my other leg it's like now three operations in a very short period of time because of the wear and tear on my body from the NBA [National Basketball Association].  I got operations and decided whatever and then all of a sudden when I go to Spain, I'm dealing with certain things like, you know, swelling of the knees and sticking needles in them and draining them and stuff like that on a regular basis that became evident from my Houston Rocket days and playing you know that strenuous type of basketball so it had a major effect on, on me as far as mentally and or physically and then on playing as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 627960
Speaker 1: Tell me about the, the first time that you met and played Michael Jordan, what team was--?
Speaker 2: Well, ironically my college, to bring up a couple points, my college career enabled me being in the ACC [Atlantic Coast Conference] and we had to play against some of the best people out there.  One being Michael Jordan in college.  I played against him for two years and obviously a very good player in the college level but obviously wasn't what he was in the NBA [National Basketball Association].  I can recall we getting ready to win the game in North Carolina [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina] when their court and one of our point guards is bringing the ball up and he happens, very tight game, we got the ball going down, getting ready to win the game and he plant a guy and he steals the ball from the guard, takes it down dunks it.  We bring the ball back up, timer runs out, they win the game.  So we kind of knew he was gonna be very, very good in the college market but we didn't know how good he was gonna be in the NBA market.  So I had an opportunity to play against him in college and also the NBA as well in a very competitive environment.  In the NBA now we knew each other from playing against each other in college, respected each other's game.  I had the better team early on 'cause with the Houston Rockets with Hakeem [Hakeem Olajuwon] and so forth and so on he was growing into what he was doing and everyone knows that, you know, only person that held Michael Jordan under twenty points with Dean Smith at North Carolina because he got NBA scored a lot of points.  But I had the opportunity also play like I said earlier against a lot of good people in the college and or NBA and one of the quintessential games in sports history was when Virginia [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia] played Georgetown [Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.] with Patrick Ewing and myself and the cover of Sports Illustrated and all that kind of stuff as well where it was kind of the game of the decade.  You know, he was a sophomore, junior.  I was a senior in 1983 and we played against each other.  We won, we won the game in a, in a blizzard snowstorm and all kind of stuff was going on but you know it was a packed house and we played in Washington, D.C., on their home court and so anyway long story short I got to play against some of the best people in my era, also college and or NBA as well.
Speaker 1: Were there any other besides those two with Jordan (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Those two were the main ones but I played against Buck Williams at Maryland [University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland].  We played against like I said the ACC has so many players that went onto the NBA that were either number one picks or highly rated in academics in the college market, also in the NBA market.  Those two games, especially the Georgetown game in spite of that the college highlight of, of my college career.
Story_ID: 627961
Speaker 1: Now you talked about coming back from, from overseas and becoming assistant head coach or a coach?
Speaker 2: Assistant coach at James Madison University [Harrisonburg, Virginia], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And who was the head coach?
Speaker 2: Lefty Driesell at that time that was actually the guy that was knocking on my window before I made my decision to go to college [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia], he was the head coach at that school at that point in time so we had a relationship from way back when.
Speaker 1: So how was that experience being assistant coach?
Speaker 2: Loved it.  I know I had aspiration like I said if I didn't play basketball I'd be involved with kids or working in that, in that arena somewhere.  I knew that before I even started playing basketball in my hometown, but enjoyed, I tell people all the time, enjoyed the experience with Lefty Dreisell because he's a guy that left no stone unturned when it came to recruiting or academics and knew the game very well.  Also had a very good worth ethic and so I learned a lot on what to do and what not to do under his tutelages for the, the year I spent with him at James Madison University.
Speaker 1: So was that something that you thought you might be your next career or not?
Speaker 2: I thought so and still think so today.  I would love to coach.  I love to teach.  Either at the high school, college level, or the NBA [National Basketball Association] level, depend upon what opportunity exists but also was dedicated as a father to get my kids out of high school.  So I knew that if I coached that I would not spend the quality time with my children over the years so that's al-, that's always hampered me from, from being a, a, a college coach.
Story_ID: 627962
Speaker 1: So what happens next in your life?  I know in 1996 you're inducted into the hall of fame, is that right, sports hall of fame?
Speaker 2: In 1996, I was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame [Virginia Sports Hall of Fame and Museum].
Speaker 1: You did, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  In Portsmouth, Virginia, there's the hall of fame there exists so like I said there's a plaque downstairs somewhere when I was inducted into the hall of fame 1996.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you have some other awards, the ACC fiftieth anniversary. Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Well, the ACC had picked the top fifty players in the Atlantic Coast Conference over the history of the league.  It was the fiftieth I guess anniversary of the league and the ACC conference so they had a ceremony where the top fifty players and I was one of the top fifty players.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now what happens next in your life or what do you do next?
Speaker 2: Well, after, you know, the coach, coaching James Madison University [Harrisonburg, Virginia] for a year and deciding to go back to the NBA [National Basketball Association] and see if I could resurrect the career a little bit I had an opportunity to try out and play for a little bit there with the Phoenix Suns in 1994, '95 [1995] when they had Charles Barkley and that crew kind of sit the bench a lot on the sidelines waiting for my opportunity, was in great shape, probably the best shape of my life as far as physically.  I couldn't do the things that people would say [HistoryMaker] Ralph Sampson could do.  I couldn't jump from the free throw line, I couldn't feet off the ground as fast as I used to but I was probably the heaviest I've ever been in life, in the best physical shape and mental shape but again the numbers didn't work out as far as people and so I decided to retire in 1995 officially from the NBA and move on and subsequently start really, really focusing on my kids and life and what happens after basketball and people I think understand that, that's one of the hardest things you have to to deal with when you've been doing something since the third grade that you have a passion and love that you really can't do at that level anymore so I always looked at something when you can't do it at the level that you wanna be successful at then you need to leave it alone.  And that's what I--decision to retire and said, "Okay I can't do it any more. I can't do it a level that I'm gonna be satisfied doing it so let me move on to something else."  So I put the focus into, to kids.  Put the focus into my children, put a focus into what I'm gonna do next and I dibbled dabbled in a lot of different things to try and figure it out and I found myself into sportswear and built a company called Sampson Sportswear [Ralph Sampson Sportswear, Inc.] in '95 [1995], '96 [1996] in which where I didn't know what I was doing in the business world.  I subsequently only really wanted to give back for scholarship at University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia], realized with one t-shirt that I created that I need the license and I need all these other particular things that I--no one told me but I did a t-shirt design, somebody printed it for me and I was giving money back to the school and when I realized that that was a business there, that was a licensing business, that was a multibillion dollar business that I knew nothing about.  So I took a year of study about business and I went back to school a little bit at University of Virginia in the business school [University of Virginia Darden School of Business, Charlottesville, Virginia], I went overseas to Peru and understood how a t-shirt was made, sewn and how many stitches it takes and the whole gamut about the t-shirt business, came back and created Sampson Sportswear where we became a licensing sportswear company for the college market with my mention being that I would trade this for one or two t-shirts that would be given back to a scholarship fund for kids coming to school there.  So I did that for a number of years and then it kind of just spun off into other things.  I didn't realize that it was a licensing (unclear) product for pens, pencils, cups, mugs and that type industry and there was no minorities people in that business, multibillion dollar market again all these contracts out there but we wasn't in the business.  So I got, if I can print a t-shirt for the college market, I can print t-shirts for United Airlines or the Texas Rangers, so on and so forth.  So got in that business as well within the company and it's a lot of business and got some minority contracts for airlines and the Texas Rangers and stuff like that, produced that and just started my life in the business world.
Speaker 1: When did you get your degree?  I don't know whether we mentioned that or not but in college, what was your degree in?
Speaker 2: I graduated in 1983 with a degree in communications and a minor in psychology.
Story_ID: 627963
Speaker 1: Tell me about it [The Winner's Circle Foundation, Atlanta, Georgia]. I'm not gonna ask you.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You tell me.
Speaker 2: Well, subsequently from the Sampson Sportswear [Ralph Sampson Sportswear, Inc.] industry and business that I was in and back, back in my Sacramento King [Sacramento Kings] days, you know, every player (unclear) had a foundation in their name or they do something in their name.  I've done basketball camps in my name for twenty something years and stuff like that.  But in 1999 as well and even back like I say when I played with Sacramento, I always sensed that it wasn't about [HistoryMaker] Ralph Sampson, you know, it wasn't about the name because my name in the basketball world while you're playing means something but when you get away from the game all of a sudden your value kind of goes down a little bit, except for when you own market and then I realized that it wasn't about me at that point in time, it was about kids ruling and reigning and winning life.  So everywhere I've gone from my Houston [Houston Rockets] days to my Golden State [Golden State Warriors] days to my Sacramento days, I always brought kids to games or something.  You achieve certain academic success I'll give you tickets to the game.  So I had sections at games.  I had different things at games and didn't really want any notoriety for it because that's, that's just me, that's what I wanted to do.  So everything transpired and I changed the name because it was some kids tell me we feel like we winning in life so to the Winner's Circle Foundation from Ralph Sampson and now to a Winner Circle company [Winner's Circle Enterprises, Atlanta, Georgia] that feeds the foundation financially so over almost eleven years now things have transcended from, you know, 1995, '96 [1996] retiring from basketball going to the Sampson Sportswear business, selling those things off in '99 [1999], 2000, moving to Atlanta [Georgia] in 2000.  I coached a year there with the International Basketball League in '98 [1998], '99 [1999] in Richmond, Virginia with the Richmond Rhythm.  We went to the finals in that league.  That league dissolved, moved to Atlanta, what'd I really wanna do?  I came to Atlanta to build a sports and academic facility.  Found out Atlanta was a big place and realized there was some facilities around here but they were all about basketball.  There were not a lot of academics so kind of squashed that a little but, was gonna buy a building here and got into a little racial spiff with the owner of the building and so I walked away and decided to do my own thing and after that just kind of been mulling around trying to figure out what Ralph Sampson wants to do with his life and with his kids, focus on my children and a lot of other kids.  So subsequently the Winner's Circle was now all about helping kids be successful on and off the basketball court but more off the basketball court.  So we started programs in the Atlanta market under the foundation and also with the for profit company so the foundation runs after school programs.  We realized when I first got to Atlanta that the athletic stuff was okay, the academic stuff was weak.
Story_ID: 627964
Speaker 1: So, I work with kids everyday academically and athletically and subsequently couple years later after that there was a young lady that I started to train in this market that came to me as a freshman or sophomore in high school and I--said, "I wanna work out with you, I wanna work out with you.  I'm (unclear)."  I said, "I mean you really don't wanna work out with me.  I mean, I'm, you know, you're scared.  I mean, I'll be serious about it whatever" so only child in the family came to say she wants to work out.  I say, "Okay.  After your season and after your thing you can work out, we'll spend the summer; we'll work out, put you in a program."  So she stayed in the program two and a half, almost three years and every year since 2001 I've been able to send seven to ten kids to school academically or athletically on scholarships up until this year.  Well up until two years ago, 2008, until I revamped everything.  So by the time she was a senior, I had her signed, delivered, we had taken her academics from Cs to A's, from 27 percent body fat to 11 percent body fat, going to University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] on an academic scholarship and athletic scholarship.  So she was six foot four and she was really ready to go.  Probably would have played in the WNBA [Women's National Basketball Association].  She was in Atlanta [Georgia] and subsequently her parents got relocated like midway through their senior year to North Carolina so she was already signed, ready to go so it really was a wash, she goes to North Carolina.  Long story short, she played there half a year in North Carolina and became all-state and state championship in North Carolina again long story short, part of that process graduation day I'm going to see her graduate, we in the auditorium waiting for her to come to graduation and she never shows up.  She, subsequently we get a call and she gets hit on a little turn going to school, white cap and gown by a drunk driver and killed instantaneously at that site.  So I would, I stopped working with kids, I stopped--if there was anybody I kind of been in a funk.  Because, understand my house at that time; I had kids in my house all the time.  My kids, their friends, other kids so forth and so on and then for two years from 2006 to 2008 I only focused on my children.  So if anything happened to mine, I'd be very devastated.  I was devastated by her and ironically the parents it's their only child.
Speaker 2: What was her name?
Speaker 1: Her name was Kristal Watson [ph.] and I say ironically the parents came to me and said, "You know, Kristal loved you and you did so much for her," and, you know, I mean, I knew everything about her that the parents probably didn't know.  And they were able to move on and they started adopting kids.  I mean, wow.  I mean that's very strong but I still couldn't get over it so I revamped everything from the foundation [Winner's Circle Foundation, Atlanta, Georgia] and I revamped everything from the business [Winner's Circle Enterprises, Atlanta, Georgia] because of that situation and my children. I said, "Let me focus on mine, make sure mine get from point A to point B," and so we did that and 2008 I started going back to work, working with kids.

Speaker 1: I realized at that point in time my, my two boys [Ralph Sampson III and Robert Sampson] were going to school, especially my youngest son was practicing basketball at six o'clock in the morning until 7:15 going to school, all day long and then get out at 3:34 and then during the basketball season go to practice at four from four to six so he's gone from six in the morning to six in the evening.  And they had the late practice because the girls had to have the gym, he was going from six in the evening 'til eight o'clock so from six o'clock in the morning, eight o'clock some days, I'm like oh wow that's a long day and we want him to be academically solid and he wants to get on the court and play this sport he loves and every other extracurricular activity a high school kid has and it doesn't, it doesn't work.  You can't be efficient and effective.  So we started an after school program and my boys didn't want it to be called the tutoring program.  I said, "Okay, fine."  So I came up with the academic MAP, math motivation attitude and plan sessions after school.  That's how we invented, reinvented the foundation [Winner's Circle Foundation, Atlanta, Georgia] and went through the red tape of the school and, you know, I'm going to have to, I'm a come after school and we gonna sit on the hall way and we gonna do your homework.  I'm a bring you food and we gonna sit there for an hour and half do homework.  Everything's gonna be done.  When you get home you can sit down have dinner and rest of the evening you can study more if you want to.  We started getting kids that were not athletes that were lingering in the halls sitting down.  We started getting other athletes that were just there and we would give them attention but we had so much red tape with the school 'cause we can't be in the school, we--I mean, I'm not, I don't have my CPR license, I'm not a teacher, I'm not all these other things that went on and on and on.  How do I get around that?  So I went out and hired a substitute teacher to come in because they had the accreditation in the building all that kind of stuff, to come in to help me out.  The second year, the school gives me a classroom and now every seat in the Atlanta [Georgia], now 350 some kids strong and four schools we do that program.  And now it has expanded to Virginia and other schools as well.   So that's what the foundation is all about.  We give them a roadmap to success from ninth grade to a senior and here's what you need to navigate and what we found in the ironic audacity for the State of Georgia, any state out here you can get a high school kid three different degrees.  A basic degree is not gonna get you anywhere, a middle degree might get you somewhere and if you take the higher class you can get to college and we giving these degrees out but nobody understands it until they become, until they become a junior and like I wanna go to college but I don't have the right classes.  I'm working with three kids right now today that have great grades but they don't have great classes and so anyway I can go all into that different stories but that's what I do today and the foundation exists and then the for profit Winner Circle Advantage Program [ph.] is people become members and they help me support the foundation.

Speaker 1: You recently completed a book and who did you collaborate with on this book?
Speaker 2: We, we started our book process as a coach out of Maryland called Coach Godwin [Koran Godwin] and it's called 'Winner's Circle:  What Do You Do Before, During and After Basketball Games' ['Winner's Circle, The Ralph Sampson Game Plan: What Great Players Do Before, During and After the Game,' Koran Godwin and Ralph Sampson].  So we are putting together a series of eBooks and also in the process of finishing my first book called 'Handle Your Damn Business Before Your Business Handles You' [ph.] so we will hopefully get that out next year.
Speaker 1: And what is that book about?
Speaker 2: 'Handle Your Business Before Your Business Handles You' is different subject matters that you know as I said earlier things that we can control, we control in handling your business and being efficient and effective so taking a situation about a kid going to college, handle your business before you get to the point where your business handles you and you go somewhere you really don't wanna go.  Everything in life that, that, that has an issue even in sports with me and my issues and personal things and private things and good and bad from other athletes as well to mom [Sarah Blakey Sampson] and dad's [Ralph Sampson, Sr.] issues and to to whatever it may be we have a series of those and we also have, we finished something that's called, winning circle, winning affirmations so we have a series of about 150 winning affirmations that we've created, you know, and hopefully it'll come out as well.

Speaker 1: Is there anything that we have not talked about--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --that you would like to talk about?
Speaker 2: Oh, we covered a whole lot.  I mean just the, the aura of [HistoryMaker] Ralph Sampson, the son of Sarah Sampson [Sarah Blakey Sampson] and Ralph Sampson, Sr., the grandson of Ruby Sampson [Ruby Howard Sampson] and Hampton Sampson and George [George Blakey, Sr.] and Josephine Blakey [Josephine Beasley Blakey] the only thing I would talk about is the work ethic and where I'm at today is not I think that where I'm at today is gonna be bigger and brighter than where I was in the NBA [National Basketball Association] so when you look at Ralph Sampson, you don't look at the basketball player, look at the person and look at the things that (background noise) he's about and not what you think he's about because you know I think there are greater and better things ahead than things of the past and I mentioned earlier the spiritual mentor that I had and then his family whatever, and he, he's the one that guides my direction because before he passed I was in his hospital room, he says, "You can do better things than you did when you played basketball."  So that sticks with me on a day by day basis and it directs my path most days and it makes me understand kind of why I'm here and what I'm doing and why I exist.  So those things I will cover more than anything else about me than being seven foot tall or a basketball player.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, if you were to look back over your life, will there be anything that you'd change?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sure.  We all have things in life that we would do better and that we would change and that we would grow from.  I also think that if we didn't go through those things, we wouldn't be the person or people that we are.  So in teaching my kids today good and or bad things they may go through, I make everything a lesson.  And, but there's no negatives, there's no I can'ts, there's no negatives, there's no bad days.  Every day is a good day. If you talk to people that know me today, why are you so cheery or why are you so motivated?  And there's no bad days.  It's the options, the things we choose that direct us and you gotta understand the consequences that you take in taking those actions that you do that lead you where you wanna go.  So I don't have any regrets whatsoever about anything.  Everything's been a lesson to me and I can only hope I get, get to be the best I can be on a day by day basis.

Speaker 1: Because this is gonna be available for students, well for more than students, but years and years and years to come, if you had to send a message to the future generations, what would it be?
Speaker 2: You know, I'd take the ability to learn from my past and learn what motivates me from my grandparents to my mom [Sarah Blakey Sampson] and dad [Ralph Sampson, Sr.] to the people and friends that's been around me throughout the years and the one thing I would say is that never ever, ever, ever go to sleep without making sure you're at peace with yourself, you know, with your friends and family.  I don't care how much money you have, I don't care what lifestyle you have living, but go to bed with peace in your heart and mind and you never know if you gonna wake up the next day.  Make peace with everybody that you love because the most precious thing we have is not money it's, it's somebody that really loves you, somebody that really respects you and you can, you can be at peace with.

Speaker 1: You're very young, but--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --I still wanna ask, what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: You know, I'm still in search of that, but my dream and I mention with the Winner's Circle and my kids will tell you as well that's been on my heart for many, many years, I'm, I wanna build a Winner's Circle hall of fame that shows people how to rule and reign and win in life that's not the basketball player that's inducted into this basketball hall of fame, it's not the rock and roll singer, it's not the NASCAR driver, it's not the baseball, football, it's people like what you guys do to some extent that make it worthwhile to follow and understand that this is how this, there's a gentleman up in Chicago [Illinois] or somewhere I believe there's a Detroit [Michigan], in one of those cities, there's a trash truck driver that's a millionaire because he did the right thing, saved his money et cetera.  My father [Ralph Sampson, Sr.], I don't know how much money this man has, you know, and he won't tell us and we don't wanna know but I know that it's substantial to some extent but he doesn't (unclear), how did he do that so I wanna induct those type of stories.  How did Oprah Winfrey become Oprah Winfrey because she didn't just overnight do that and she started somewhere but nobody really understands or is that documented somewhere and induct her into this hall of fame or Bill Gates or Bill Cosby or somebody like that.  So I want this place to be where the destination where people can come and understand how do I win in life if I'm just successful by planting a tree, that's how I win.  So what does that look like and how does that feel.  We live all this glitz and glamor stuff everyday but that's just what it is.  NBA [National Basketball Association], when kids see it, it's glitz and glamor because I can be a rock star whatever but they don't understand I teach kids all day as a million dollar phenomenon.  You get a million dollars today what is most people can't compute what tax bracket you in when you get a million dollars.  And I talk to young kids every day, they don't have a clue.  When I tell them it's 20 to 30 percent what, how much is that of a million dollars, they still can't give me the answer.  They can give me what kind of car they gonna buy, what kind of rims they gonna put on it, what type of stereo system they gonna put in it, they can do all that but they don't understand the multitude and factors of that dollar and how it works.  So I want some, I want a place where they can go and have, and be educated and can also understand how to win in life.  I don't care what area of life you in.  How to win in life.  So if it's me and people look back at [HistoryMaker] Ralph Sampson that, that would be my legacy.
