Speaker 2: I was born in Blackville, South Carolina, August 17, 1933.
Speaker 1: What is today's date?
Speaker 2: You got me--It's June 20th, 2007.
Speaker 1: Where are we conducting this interview today?
Speaker 2: This interview is being conducted at my home at 1706 Washington Avenue, Charlotte, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): It's the 21st.

Story_ID: 551841
Speaker 1: Just to get things started, I'm going to ask you some People magazine style questions.  What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: The kind of cuisine that I like best is French cooking.
Speaker 1: What about your favorite time of the year, your favorite season?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure I have a favorite season.  However, I believe that if I were to try to guess and make one, it would be spring.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My color at one time was blue.  I've gradually gone away from blue now, and I'm not sure what that color is (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No, I like exciting places, and by exciting places, I don't mean places with a lot of pizzazz and fun.  I prefer warmer climates, or moderate climates, I should say, some beach weather, and a limited amount of activity.  I don't like places where there's thousands of people.  I like quiet, secluded spots.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite saying or quote?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know that it's a favorite saying, but one saying that I like very much which comes from my father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] is that: God gave me a brain to think for myself.
Story_ID: 551842
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your family.  What was your mother's name, full name?
Speaker 2: My mother's maiden name was Mattie Lee Belton [Mattie Belton De Laine], B-E-L-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: And, spell her first and middle names, please.
Speaker 2: M-A-T-T-I-E and Lee is L-E-E.
Speaker 1: And it was Belton?  Where was she born, and when?
Speaker 2: My mother was born in Fairfield County [South Carolina] in a community called Longtown, South Carolina.  And, her birth date was December 1, 1907.
Speaker 1: And, what was her profession?
Speaker 2: She was a schoolteacher.
Speaker 1: In South Carolina?
Speaker 2: In South Carolina and in the State of New York.
Speaker 1: She was educated?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Where did she go to school?
Speaker 2: She did her undergraduate work at the Benedict College [Columbia, South Carolina] and Allen University in Columbia, South Carolina.  And, her graduate work was at Hunter's College [sic. Hunter College] in New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: What did she study?
Speaker 2: Elementary education.
Speaker 1: And, did she teach at an elementary school?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I clarify elementary school.  In South Carolina in the early days, schools for blacks, in some instances, carried elementary through high, and at some point in her teaching career in South Carolina, she was in the elementary through high building, but teaching elementary children.  In New York State, she taught in elementary school for a while, and then with the special education group, which were the learning impaired children.
Speaker 1: Do you know the names of those schools where she taught?
Speaker 2: In New York State, I cannot give you the names of the schools, however, she taught in the Buffalo, New York system for about two years.  And, she then taught after that in Mineola [New York], which is in Nassau County, New York until her retirement.
Story_ID: 551843
Speaker 1: Do you know your maternal grandparents' names?
Speaker 2: My maternal grandparents--my grandfather was David George Belton, Sr. [David G. Belton, Sr.] That's D-A-V-I-D, George, G-E-O-R-G-E, Belton, B-E-L-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: When was he born and where?
Speaker 2: I cannot give you the dates of his birth.  However, my guess is somewhere around 1860.
Speaker 1: And, where was he born?
Speaker 2: In Fairfield County, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: What was his profession?
Speaker 2: Farmer and laborer, I guess that's a handyman.
Speaker 1: What type of farmer?
Speaker 2: Well, when I say farmer, an agrarian person who worked the soil--cotton, corn, et cetera, and later in life moving to an urban community, he worked more as a handyman, or a do it yourselfer.
Speaker 1: Did he go to school, was he educated at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Elementary, high school?
Speaker 2: I would say in those days, I'm not sure blacks had the opportunity for education, and if so, it was self-taught, or taught at home by someone or at the church.  And, I would venture to guess that it was probably a second or third grade education.
Speaker 1: Do you know, beyond that, your great-grandparents' names? On your mother's [Mattie Belton De Laine] side.
Speaker 2: His father, David George Belton's father, was Levi Belton, L-E-V-I, and his mother's name was Martha, M-A-R-T-H-A, Roach, R-O-A-C-H Belton [Martha Roach Belton] B-E-L-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: Do you know approximately when they were born or where?
Speaker 2: I can- They were born in Fairfield County, South Carolina.  I cannot give you the dates without going back to some of my notes.
Story_ID: 551844
Speaker 1: Are you familiar (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I, I, I'm sure that both of them were born before the end of slavery.
Speaker 1: Do you know which plantation, by any chance?
Speaker 2: There is some question about the plantations.  The name Belton, is what we would assume to have been the plantation--but, in my research I find very little indication of records from a Belton plantation.  I have found some Beltons that I believe they were associated with, but as I trace those Beltons, they married into the Peay family, P-E-A-Y family, and the people that I think were the owners of my grandparents [sic. maternal great-grandparents, Martha Roach Belton and Levi Belton], died early and left their property to a daughter, to an only daughter with indications in their will that the slaves were never to be sold outside of the family.  However, she married a Peay, and when I research the Peay family, I find that they, being a very wealthy family in that area [Fairfield County, South Carolina], had acquired many other plantations through marriage into their family, and it became controlled by the elder Peays.  That family seemed to have kept these other plantations with names--the Belton plantation, the Ross plantation, et cetera.  And, in one case we were able to trace kinship into Mississippi.  On the Ross plantation, who was married--this Captain Ross [Isaac Ross] was married to a Belton.  And, we found a kinship of the slaves from that plantation and the origin of them, also from South Carolina, from the Peay plantation.  Now, the Ross plantation in Mississippi has quite a bit of notoriety, because when Ross died, his will indicated that all of his slaves were to be set free, and that the farm, the plantation, was to be sold and the money used for these slaves to return to Africa.  That never happened.  It was challenged by his descendants.  And, the money was ultimately spent in court fights, which they lost.  The will was upheld.  During the time of the court fights, apparently some of the slaves burned the plantation house, hoping to kill the descendants so that they could get their freedom and return to Africa.  They only succeeded in killing one person, and that was a child.  Ultimately, about 130 of these slaves set out to return to Africa, to the country of Liberia under the--I think it's the slave relocation act, but in their trip to Mississippi to New Orleans [Louisiana], about half of them died from yellow fever.  But a segment of them did return to Liberia, and established roots there, and in the records they're all listed as the Ross plantation, or the Ross Negroes.  But, among them, when I look at the correspondence that came back, we find several Beltons listed, writing the master in Mississippi, pleading to let their children come, and also explaining how hard life was in Liberia, but they would prefer being there rather than here.
Story_ID: 551845
Speaker 1: Well, now let's turn to your father's side.  Your father's name?
Speaker 2: My father's name is Joseph, J-O-S-E-P-H, Armstrong, A-R-M-S-T-R-O-N-G, De Laine, D-E L-A-I-N-E [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.], and there's a space between the D-E and the L.  And, Sr., because, I'm Jr. [HistoryMaker Joseph A. De Laine, Jr.].
Speaker 1: When was he born and where?
Speaker 2: He was born July 2, 1898 and he was born in Clarendon County, South Carolina near the town of Manning, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: His profession?
Speaker 2: He was a minister and a schoolteacher, and I should say jack of all trades, including farming, carpentry, et cetera (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, what about his education?
Speaker 2: He was a college graduate.
Speaker 1: What school?
Speaker 2: Allen University in Columbia [South Carolina].  He received his baccalaureate's degree from Allen University in Columbia, and his theology degree from Allen in Columbia.
Speaker 1: That was a master's [degree]?
Speaker 2: No, Bachelor of Theology.  He also had some honorary doctorate degrees.  I don't recall all of them.  One I do know was from an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] college, Monrovia College [Monrovia College and Industrial Training Institute, Monrovia, Liberia] in West Africa, and one from Allen, and I think there was one or two others.
Story_ID: 551846
Speaker 1: What about his mother's name?
Speaker 2: His mother's name was Tisbia, T-I-S-B-I-A, Gamble, G-A-M-B-L-E, De Laine [Tisbia Gamble De Laine].
Speaker 1: And, when was she born and where?
Speaker 2: I don't have her date.  She died in 1940, and I think she was about eighty-two or eighty-three when she died.  Correction, yes, she was born in 1867, I believe.  Because as I understand, she was born about two years after the end of slavery.
Speaker 1: Where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Clarendon County, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Was she educated?
Speaker 2: No, probably home schooled.  Both of her parents were children of their masters and she did live a more comfortable life than many of the former slaves as a child.
Speaker 1: I'm going to get to them in a second.  Did she have a profession?
Speaker 2: No, none other than housewife.  Now, I might clarify that.  Her primary profession was housewife, but as I look back through court records, I see that she was involved in a number of business involvements.  I hate to put it that way, but I think that was as a consequence of her husband's [Henry De Laine, Sr.] finagling, okay.
Speaker 1: All right.  Her parents' names?
Speaker 2: Her father's name was Charlie Gamble [Charles Gamble (ph.)].  And, her mother's name was Caroline Gamble [ph.], C-A-R-O-L-I-N-E.
Speaker 1: When were they born and where?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: And you said they were both children of the slave master?
Speaker 2: They were both half white, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you know the name of the slave master?
Speaker 2: I believe it was a Gamble.  Now, that's as much as I can (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did they have different slave masters?
Speaker 2: I think there were, but I'm not sure.  But I do know that one of them, from what I recall as a kid--because, you get a little bit of this through folklore, and other parts of it, tidbits, we got through interface with people and some whites who said that they are relatives.
Speaker 1: So, did you meet these white relatives?
Speaker 2: As a child I bumped into them, yes.
Speaker 1: Did they have the same last name?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was the last name?
Speaker 2: Gamble.  Now, whether or not that was in reference to my great-grandfather or my great-grandmother, I don't know, but it was something that was recognized and kept quiet.
Speaker 1: And, the white family knew it, and the black family knew it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did anyone recognize it publicly?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Privately?
Speaker 2: Privately, there were instances.  For example, after one of my uncles died, and this is about the time that I may have been twenty, in my--I was an adult.  There's a story about my aunt, his wife, going to a store to purchase supplies, farm supplies.  And, she was first told no, and the owner of the store came out and interceded, and he says, "Oh, no, she get's anything she wants. She's family."
Story_ID: 551847
Speaker 1: Any other family names on your father's [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] side?
Speaker 2: On my father's side?  Well, we haven't gotten into the paternal side of the family.  We only did the maternal.  So, you'd like the paternal side?
Speaker 1: Sure.  So, that's it on the maternal side of your family.  His father?
Speaker 2: His father was Henry Charles C-H-A-R-L-E-S De Laine [Henry De Laine, Sr.], and I guess we should say Sr., because there were two, a son named Henry Charles [Henry De Laine, Jr.], also.  And, his father was a minister and I have seen records of him teaching school.  I don't know anything about his education, I think he must have been self-taught or tutored, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: When was Henry Charles born, and where, do you know?
Speaker 2: He was born in 1849 in Clarendon County, South Carolina.  He was not a slave, but born as a free person.
Speaker 1: How did that come about?
Speaker 2: I am not sure how the family came to this country as free people.  Family lore tells us that their origins were North Africa, probably Tunisia or somewhere up in that area, or Morocco, and that the original ancestors, which would be two generations before Henry Charles, came here and settled here in Charleston [South Carolina].  And, in the case of my line, the ancestors migrated to Sumter County, South Carolina and then to Clarendon County.  Now, during those days, people of color who were free had to have white protectors, and they had to pay these people to protect them from being sold into slavery.  I understand that the protectors for my father's family, for that side of the family, were the Andersons at the Borough's plantation [Borough House Plantation] in Stateburg, South Carolina.  One of the parts of this riddle that I never did under- that I didn't understand for a long time, was that with that being the basis of their protection, how did my family get to Clarendon County, which is the adjacent county?  I think that was finally solved recently by someone related into that family, telling me about some members of the family relocating to Clarendon County, and possibly my ancestors moved there and continued that protection situation through those members living in Clarendon County.
Story_ID: 551848
Speaker 1: And, the reason that has been of a concern to us is because it--on the home place of my father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] and great-grandfather, that land was owned before the end of slavery and used in that area by my family before the end of slavery, and part of that is still owned by members of my family.
Speaker 2: And, do you know the process of ownership?  Did they purchase the land or did they inherit the land?
Speaker 1: Well, initially it was purchased.
Speaker 2: Do you know who purchased the land?
Speaker 1: I have no idea, but I think it may have been my great-grandfather, because he lived on that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What's his name?
Speaker 1: Charles De Laine [Charles De Laine, Jr.].
Speaker 2: And, that land remains in the family?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: How many acres of land?
Speaker 1: At this point, I'm not sure, but I think there's probably about 150 to 200, however, at one time it was two to three times that size.
Speaker 2: And this was land that the slaves worked at one point?
Speaker 1: I would think so, looking at history, I would think so.  And by saying that, the practice of freed blacks at that time, was that they tilled the soil, but they also hired slaves to help.
Speaker 2: Family members did?
Speaker 1: Yes, a freed slave could help.  If you look at the written history on Charleston [South Carolina], in terms of slaves, they were hired by freed blacks because most of them had trades, beauty shops, barbershops, and these kinds of things.  And, if they hired a slave and trained the slave, that's extra money coming into them and then they pay the slave.  So, I would say that this myth that we hear about getting a slave to help them get their freedom may have been altruistic in a sense, and in another sense, the ulterior motive may have been financial, which is the same reason that the whites were controlling slaves.  So, I don't know, when it comes to my family.
Speaker 2: Do you know beyond Henry Charles [Henry De Laine, Sr.], do you know his parents?
Speaker 1: Henry--well let's--Charles--Henry's father Charles, was married to a Caroline Garvey [sic. Caroline Garry De Laine], who was my great-grandmother.  Caroline Garvey was from Laurens, South Carolina, L-A-U-R-E-N-S.  I'm assuming that Caroline was free in order to marry him and move to Clarendon County [South Carolina].
Speaker 2: Do you know when they were born approximately?
Speaker 1: Henry Charles [sic. Charles De Laine, Jr.] was born about 1823, I believe.
Speaker 2: He was born free?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And Caro- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And he was born at the Borough's plantation [Borough House Plantation] in Stateburg, Sumter County, South Carolina.
Story_ID: 551849
Speaker 1: I mentioned to you about the ancestors, and I mentioned the Celia Mann house [Mann-Simons Site] in Columbia, South Carolina, which is a historic landmark in downtown Columbia.  Celia Mann is listed as the wife and slave of Ben DeLane.  Now, the spelling of that name is D-E capital L-A-N-E.  And, he is listed as a shipbuilder from Charleston [South Carolina].  We are assuming by everyone that we can pick up, that this Ben DeLane was the brother of either my great-grandfather [Charles De Laine, Jr.] or my great-great-grandfather [Charles De Laine, Sr.] because we have connected with black descendants of Ben DeLane.  Ben and Celia had no children.  She had two children by a previous marriage, but they had no children, and also he had a family in the area of Hartsville, South Carolina, or descendants in that area and, we are almost certain it's the same Ben DeLane, a shipbuilder from Charleston.
Speaker 2: And, his race is white?
Speaker 1: Ah, some places it's listed as white, some places it's listed as mulatto. (Laughter) I don't know, but apparently he was a man of wealth.  When she died, her property value was worth eight thousand dollars in downtown Columbia, and this was before the end of slavery, or just after the end of slavery, rather.  But, her house was used for the organization, I think, of Second Calvary Baptist Church [Calvary Baptist Church of Columbia; Second Calvary Baptist Church, Columbia, South Carolina], which is a Baptist church, and they consider that it started as a clandestine movement in the basement of that house.  But, we're almost certain that this Ben DeLane was a relative of ours.
Speaker 2: Celia, was she listed as mulatto as well?
Speaker 1: No, the only records we found of her was slave and wife, and that she was purchased somewhere in the Lowcountry near Charleston and brought to Columbia.
Speaker 2: Do you know if that was a common practice in South Carolina, to purchase a slave and marry the slave?
Speaker 1: In some instances that did occur.  But, you also had periods of time in South Carolina where the purchase did not mean freedom, and I think when it says purchase slave and wife, that's what it implied to. Because at one time in the state you could purchase, or upon demand, set the slave free.  The master could do it, or if I purchased and became the master, I could do it.  Then it became illegal, and it had to go before a commission at the state level to determine who's set free and who's not.  And, most of the cases at that time were turned down, but if there was a purchase by a person of color, they could then have the opportunity to ease that person's life.  I'm not saying it was done in all cases, but that was a possibility.
Story_ID: 551850
Speaker 1: You had mentioned your great-grandparents, your paternal great-grandparents, Charles [Charles De Laine, Jr.] and Caroline [Caroline Garry De Laine].  Do you know your great-great-grandparents on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Charles' father was also a Charles De Laine [Charles De Laine, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Do you know when he was born? And where.
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  My guess is somewhere around, based upon my great-grandfather's age, I would say that it was probably around 1780 or 1790 that my great-great-grandfather was born.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: South Carolina?
Speaker 2: He may have been born in South Carolina, he may have been born in North Africa.  Family lore has been one that some brothers came here together, and as close as we can figure it, we think it was that Charles, possibly the Ben [Ben DeLane] that I referred to, a Lawrence [ph.], whom we know very little about--we know nothing about other than the name has been passed down in descendants in our line.  So, I don't know.
Speaker 1: And, was Charles married?
Speaker 2: The mother--I don't know that he was married to her, but the mother of Charles, Jr. was a Maria [ph.] and we have been told--I have no proof of this--that she was a Mohawk Indian [Native American] from New York working on the Borough's plantation [Borough House Plantation, Stateburg, South Carolina] as an indentured.  I have no proof of who she was.  I have found the record from the Borough's plantation that states that Charles was born to Maria, but it does not tell who Maria is, or anything else about it, and we sort of assumed by pulling in the family lore.
Story_ID: 551851
Speaker 1: Are you ready to begin discussion of your birth and early childhood?
Speaker 2: Okay. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, again, when were you born and where?
Speaker 2: I was born August 17, 1933 in Blackville [South Carolina], which is in Barnwell County, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: What are your earliest childhood memories?
Speaker 2: Oh boy (laughter).  I guess I was a rambunctious boy and I also didn't take no for an answer, and as a consequence, I witnessed my brother's birth, by peeking.
Speaker 1: Where did that happen (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, I know, I remember it and based on our ages, I had to be four or five years old.
Speaker 1: When was your brother born?
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty-seven [1937] or 1938, one of the two.
Speaker 1: What's your brother's name?
Speaker 2: Brumit, B-R-U-M-I-T, Belton, B-E-L-T-O-N, De Laine [HistoryMaker B. B. De Laine].
Speaker 1: And you have a sister as well?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What's her name and when was she born?
Speaker 2: Ophelia De Laine, O-P-H-E-L-I-A, De Laine Gona, G-O-N-A [Ophelia De Laine Gona].
Speaker 1: When was she born?
Speaker 2: In 1937 or 1938, I think maybe hers is '37 [1937] and his is--no, she must be '36 [1936], and his is 1937.
Speaker 1: So, you witnessed your brother's birth?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It was inside your home?
Speaker 2: Inside my grandparents' home.
Speaker 1: In the bedroom?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I remember going with my uncle to get the midwife and his discussion with me was that I would have a little brother or a little sister.  But, it didn't impact upon me at the time.  And, we brought the midwife back and all of the men went out to the front porch and sat and waited, and I was told to go play.  As I recall it was a beautiful gray (unclear) in the backyard and very cool under there, and there was some other kids from next door, something of this nature, and I'd go and play with them.  And, I decided I wanted to know what was going on in the house.  So, I snuck into the adjacent bedroom which had an enjoining closet and got a chair in there without them detecting it, and cracked the door, and I saw everything.  And, I was too stupid to keep quiet, and my mother [Mattie Belton De Laine] was screaming or moaning or something, you know, sounds of pain.  And, I decided to bust into the room and find out what's going on (laughter).  Well, needless to say, I was sternly chastised by my grandmother [Josephine Weldon Belton], who got me out of there to the front porch by the nape of my neck and turned me over to my father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] and my grandfather [David G. Belton, Sr.], who proceeded to give me the worst spanking I ever had (laughter).
Speaker 1: And you were four years old at the time?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Um-hm. So I do remember that.
Story_ID: 551852
Speaker 1: Describe your home.  Did you live on a farm?
Speaker 2: No.  When I was born, my parents were living on a school campus.  My father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] was the principal of the school--
Speaker 1: What school?
Speaker 2: --and it was a boarding school. It was Macedonia High School [Blackville, South Carolina]--high school or Macedonia School.  This was a school that was financed by a consortium of black Baptist churches for the education of their children.  There were no public schools or high schools around in that area at the time.  So, it was a boarding school, and when he was hired for the position, there was the expectation that he would become a Baptist minister.  However, he was already ordained as an African Methodist Episcopal [A.M.E.] minister, and he refused to change his denomination.  So, after about two years or so, his employment there, and my mother's [Mattie Belton De Laine] employment as a teacher there, were terminated. And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you said your dad's position was?
Speaker 2: Principal.
Speaker 1: And you lived--was there a separate home on the campus?
Speaker 2: On the campus, it was a home there for the principal.
Speaker 1: How long did you live on that campus?
Speaker 2: They lived there for I think two years or so.  And, I guess I came along at about the end of the first year.  And, after that--and he was pastoring at A.M.E. churches in the meantime in that area, and when they moved he returned to Clarendon County [South Carolina], which was his ancestral home, and on a temporary basis lived in his father's [Henry De Laine, Sr.] old home on the farm that I mentioned until he could provide accommodations for himself.
Story_ID: 551853
Speaker 1: He [De Laine's father, Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] was assigned to a church in Clarendon County [South Carolina] by the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church and a parsonage was erected on that property and that's where we moved.
Speaker 2: What was the name of that church?
Speaker 1: Springhill A.M.E. Church.
Speaker 2: In Clarendon?
Speaker 1: In Clarendon, addressed to the town of Summerton [South Carolina], but a rural community, part of the county.
Speaker 2: So, describe your home there on the farm.
Speaker 1: That's at the church (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At the church, it was at the church?
Speaker 1: The home in Blackville [South Carolina] was on the school property.  The home where they moved to at Springhill Church was on church property in a rural community.  This is adjacent to the church, and farmland was around, but we were not a part of a farm.  Ultimately, my father bought several hundred acres of land near that place, but that's where he started out and he was teaching--my mother [Mattie Belton De Laine] was teaching at the Spring Hill School [Springhill Elementary School, Summerton, South Carolina] which was a two teacher school being conducted in a Masonic temple adjacent to church property.
Story_ID: 551854
Speaker 1: And, my father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] taught at a two teacher school as principal, about six or seven miles away, and that school was the Bob Johnson School [Clarendon County, South Carolina].  This was a school, atypical of most black schools at that time, not on a church property, but on a piece of land probably donated by someone, and built by the community.  And, that's where I started in first grade by him taking me to school.
Speaker 2: The Bob Johnson School?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: What was that school experience like?  Where there classrooms or was it a one room school?
Speaker 1: It was a two room school, a modest wooden shack and with two teachers.  Of course, it was very simple and not--by today's standards.  I remember very little about it.  Some parts of my life I don't really remember that well, and I remember very little about that school.  But, it was, you know, the type of place where if you needed heat, the parents had to come in or the children had to come in and handle the heat, or the teachers handled it.  There was no air conditioning, except for the wind blowing through the cracks (laughter).  So, I can't tell you the details about it, because I just don't remember them.

Speaker 1: What about your home at the time?  How long did you live in that house?
Speaker 2: We lived in that house from 1935 to 1940.
Speaker 1: And, tell me, how many rooms did the house have?  Did it have an outhouse?
Speaker 2: Three bedrooms, there was an outhouse and then a separate garage for the car.  There was a wood stove, for cooking.
Speaker 1: You did have a car?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What kind of car?
Speaker 2: Oh, my.  When we moved there we had a Ford, I think it was probably a '34 [1934] Ford, and then we got a '37 [1937] and after that a 1939 Ford.  And when we moved from there, we had the '39 [1939] Ford.

Speaker 1: What were holidays like in your home? Christmas? Can you share a memory (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Rarely--rarely did we spend a Christmas at home.  Usually, Christmas was spent at my grandparents' [Josephine Weldon Belton and David G. Belton, Sr.]--my maternal grandparents' place in Columbia [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: What was that like?
Speaker 2: Very festive, lots of food, and there was lots of visiting to other relatives during the holidays.  What I remember most of all is the amount of food, which was a lot (laughter).
Speaker 1: Traditional African American cuisine?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Presents?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any presents you received?
Speaker 2: Well, as kids it was primarily toys.
Story_ID: 551857
Speaker 1: Do you remember the racial situation at the time in Clarendon [Clarendon County, South Carolina] in the '30s [1930s] and early '40s [1940s]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.
Speaker 1: What was it like?
Speaker 2: In my interpretation today, I would say oppressive.  In my experience at that time, it was not so much oppressive but was a way of life, and with my knowledge that this was wrong, and a lot of it, I took as a joke.  Fortunately, my parents [Mattie Belton De Laine and Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] were the type of people that taught us the facts of life, and what existed, and explained how it existed.
Speaker 1: What did they tell you?
Speaker 2: About the racial--what to do, what not to do, what to expect.
Speaker 1: What did they tell you to do and what not to do?
Speaker 2: Take low on circumstances when you're not--when you're by yourself.  Don't confront when you're by yourself.  My father would confront.  As far as his children were concerned, he was to protect.
Speaker 1: Do you have any specific memories of racial injustice or conflict?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I can remember going into a dry cleaner and taking my aunt's dress, and I'm sure I was not more than ten years old, and the lady asked for the name, and I said Mrs. R. Oliver [Rowena De Laine Oliver], because I was aware that it was Auntie, it was Uncle, or the first name and I wasn't about to do that.  And, the woman looked at me and she says, "You're talking about a nigger.  Don't you ever put no damn Mrs. in front of a nigger's name to me."  So, I just snatched the dress up and walked around and walked out.  Now, maybe I should have left it, maybe I shouldn't have, but I wasn't going to leave it.  But, I think that based on my experience with my family, that's what I was supposed to do.  Or, for instance, I can remember going into the service station, just out of Charlotte [North Carolina] in Rock Hill [South Carolina].  Now, I was driving a Packard, which was a super luxury car at that time.  So, she asked first if they had a bathroom, and the man told her the bathroom for niggers was around the outhouse--no, he didn't have a bathroom for niggers.  So she says, "Well stop the gas because your gas ain't good for niggers either."  Then we went to another filling station.  But, you know, things like that happened.  We knew don't stop if it's at night, especially if you're driving a nice car.  We knew be cautious about where you went.  We knew to take some food for ourselves so we wouldn't have to stop and try to find some, or starve on the way.
Speaker 1: And at a young age, you realized this was unfair?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  I was taught it was unfair and I recognized that it was unfair.
Story_ID: 551858
Speaker 1: What about the community in which you lived?  Was it segregated?
Speaker 2: To the nth degree. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Describe it.
Speaker 2: Ah, there was a clear cut demarcation of where you lived, especially if it was a town or a non-rural situation.  You live over here, and we live over there.  Occasionally, you may find one of us living over here as an exception, but not too often.  This was clear and still is clear today, in terms of the church you attend, maybe not as rigid as it was then, but it's still a divider that was there at that time.  There was the opportunity of movies but what kind of movies, and under what condition?  You sat in the buzzard's roost, that's what we called it, and my folk, my parents [Mattie Belton De Laine and Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] did not allow me to go to the movies for that reason.  The only time that I went to see a movie was when we took a vacation north (laughter).
Speaker 1: Where did you go north?
Speaker 2: We went north to Detroit [Michigan] or New York [New York] or someplace like that.  Then I would get in the movies.  But, to come to Charlotte [North Carolina], Charlotte was very segregated then, there were one or two black movies here where they showed second rate films.  So, if you wanted to see anything that was first rate, either you sat in--I believe there was only one movie around here that would allow you in the buzzard's roost.  Otherwise you had to go to Concord [North Carolina] or to Gastonia [North Carolina], twenty miles one way or the other to see a movie.
Story_ID: 551859
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.].  I know he was quite a leader in the community.  How did all that start?
Speaker 2: Well, there was no design about it, but I think that sometimes, and I think most things of that nature evolved because of the personality and foresight of the individual.  My father had always considered himself as someone who had to give back to the people, or help his, quote, unquote people, not to take advantage of anyone, but to give back to.  So, from the onset and I shouldn't say from the onset, because before he moved to Clarendon County [South Carolina], or returned there, this was his philosophy.  But, he had always envisioned himself as going back to Clarendon County and working with people there.  And, that was a part of working with quote, unquote underprivileged, uneducated people.  And, that's where he saw his role.  As he proceeded with this role, I think he evolved into that leader that we respect him for today.  And, that comes about through many ways.  He took advantage of a federal program in the mid-'30s [1930s] for agriculture, to become an expert in the growth of farm things, and so forth to help local black farmers.  And, combined with his role as a preacher or a teacher, somehow they all seemed to mesh.  Most publications like to talk about his experience with his parishioners.  That's hogwash.  The experience was with people, it wasn't his parishioners.  If he visited you when you happened to be picking cotton, it was okay--you stand up and talk to me for a while, and I'll pick your share of cotton.
Speaker 1: What was he talking to people about?
Speaker 2: If he did a visit for his church, or if he did a visit to talk to them about some personal, social, financial problem, what have you, or, if he's going out to help them with some farming techniques.  He became a part of them.  He was an immaculate person as far as dress is concerned, always the suit, well creased and the clerical collar, and this business.  But, his constituents, being primarily farmers, or people that worked through the sweat of their back--he went out in that collar and suit and if it meant getting on his knees to pick some cotton and share with them, he did it.  And, it was almost like a way of portraying that I'm one of you while I'm helping you as well.  His philosophy in the church, and I know you're going to bleep this because it was very different from what we find these Charlottean black ministers doing today, but it's--God gave you a brain to think for yourself.  Have the faith, but you've got to do something for yourself, nobody's going to bring it to you.  So, that's the kind of attitude, and I think that's what drew people to him and drew not only his parishioners, but other people that he worked with, as teachers or as farmers or whatever.
Story_ID: 551860
Speaker 1: We talked about my father, and how he related to people, but we have to understand also the culture of the people in Clarendon County [South Carolina] at that time.  Clarendon County was listed as one of the poorest counties in the United States.  The population of the county was majority black, and it's a part of what is now known as the 95 corridor [Interstate 95], the counties on the 95 corridor, which are majority black and still economically the poorest area, or one of the poorest areas in the country.  People in the county at that time, African American people, rarely finished elementary school, much alone high school or college.  The bulk of them could not read or write, and I'm talking about 1940 to 1950.  They were dependent upon others for almost everything, if you can't read or write.  And, if they were going to get justice they had to depend on someone they trust, as a leader or a guide.  And, you've got to have confidence in the person that's doing it, and I think that within these circumstances as one demonstrates a caring need, or love for the people, a confidence in the people, they are automatically thrust into that role of leadership.
Speaker 2: And that's what happened with your father (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think that's what happened with my father.
Speaker 2: Joseph De Laine, Sr. [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.]?
Speaker 1: Right.  Here's a man that they could go to, they could give their most innermost problems, and they didn't hear them on Sunday morning.  However, he did give some advice.  They didn't hear it anywhere afterwards.  Here's a man that one could go to if he didn't know how to count money.  They could dig their little coins up out of the backyard, take it in and say, "Count this and tell me how much I have, and what--how much can I buy with it."
Speaker 2: Do you remember a single event?
Speaker 1: Yes, I remember one man whose total goal was to purchase a piece of land so that when he died, his wife and children would have their own home, and he could not read or write.  And he saved his money in a tin can buried in the backyard and he would occasionally go out and get that can and bring the money to my father to count.  And, when he had enough money to buy the piece of property, he came to my father to go with him to buy the property so that he could put his X on the paper and so that my father could check it to make sure everything was all right.  I can give other examples of the kinds of confidence.  I ran across something since his death when I was trying to clear out his papers to turn them over to the historical library [South Caroliniana Library, Columbia, South Carolina].  I found a letter in there that I promptly destroyed.  It was one of the most innermost secrets of a lady's life, as she wanted to confess her error of adultery.  She went to him, she wrote him, indicating to him what she wanted to do and what she had done, and she needed advice.  Now, this is the kind of thing, that even in his death--and I'm sure he thought he had destroyed the letter, it should not be out to the public, I don't care how many years it was later.  And, when I found it, I was sitting in the back there going through these papers, and when I found it, I didn't tell my brother [HistoryMaker B. B. De Laine] about it. He was here, because he was going through something.  So, I just immediately ripped it up and took my lighter and torched it, and that's one piece that will not go anywhere.
Speaker 2: He would help people, people trusted your father?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, and I can remember a situation of a family that my father built a home for, near our house, and the agreement was that when we're away, you will look after the house for us and you'll see that the grass is cut and things like that.  And, this was a recovering alcoholic, and this is something my father was doing for him.  And, his son had congenital syphilis--they had no idea what it was, and the boy was going blind from it.  And, I remember my father taking this boy to Columbia [South Carolina] to State Hospital [South Carolina State Hospital] for treatment of congenital syphilis.
Story_ID: 551861
Speaker 1: Was your father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] respected in the white community as well?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.  We have to understand the culture of the white community.  There were many members of the white community who saw the ills of that society, but they felt helpless to do anything about it because they had to live there, so they kept their mouths closed.  And, if they opened their mouths, they knew that they were doomed.  So, what occurred was not done by everyone, but it was done because of a fear that was placed on everyone.
Story_ID: 551862
Speaker 1: Tell me about the busing situation--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in Clarendon County [South Carolina].  I understand there was some disparity.  White students were bused to their schools, black students were forced to walk.  Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Let me go back further than that.  I don't have all of the details in the story, but if we look at public schools in South Carolina being funded by the state, this is something that white South Carolinians resisted for many years, because they thought it was very chic to send their kids abroad, or to the North for schooling or bring tutors in.  And, I don't know whether that was a fear of the education of black folks or what, but it was not until you had the Reconstruction days where blacks were elected to office and when, in South Carolina, the effects of the black portions of the legislature caused public school funding, which was never carried out to any degree of efficiency, but at least it was there.  Now, what happened over the years is that as the school system grew, it grew primarily for white children.  The blacks were several years behind in terms of the benefits.  In the 1940s, the schools were, the white schools, were consolidated.  By consolidated, I mean there was no longer the one or two rural elementary schools, or go out of state for high school, or whatever.  But, they consolidated the program so that you had convenient white high schools and elementary schools for children.  The black community still existed under something that was unique to them, because they were denied all of this to begin with.  But, people within the local community got together and formed a school.  It could have been through the church, or a Masonic temple, or a group of individuals that just went out and built a school for themselves, and initially paid for teachers, as whites had done fifty, seventy-five, or a hundred years before.  But, now the whites are enjoying the consolidated schools and buses and the blacks are still going to the one or two room schools and when they finish the sixth grade or seventh grade, wherever it goes, that's the--either the end of the education or you walked to the nearest high school, or a school that goes beyond the seventh or eighth grade.
Story_ID: 551863
Speaker 1: Now, in the--what happened in Clarendon County [South Carolina], which is no different from any other rural community in the United States, there were people living seventeen, eighteen miles from the nearest school.
Speaker 2: Black kids in this case?
Speaker 1: Black kids in this case.  Now, the only way that they got into the school and maintained themselves, is if the family was able to board the child with a family in town or get that child to be boarded with a relative living in town, or walk every day.  Now, I'm getting ahead of the story, but I'll come back to it.  In the case of the Pearson situation for buses, people today say that "Well, Pearson only lived eight miles, seven to eight miles, from the school, yet you quote ten miles."
Speaker 2: Well, let's tell that story.  What was the situation involving Levi Pearson?
Speaker 1: Okay, but there were other families there that lived seventeen, eighteen miles.  Now, what happened was, Pearson, along with a group of sixteen other families, got together about the trek that their children had to take to get to a high school.
Speaker 2: And what year was this?
Speaker 1: This goes back into the '44 [1944], '45 [1945] era.  And, they raised the meager sum of, I think it was three, four hundred dollars to buy a bus that had been used as a hen house, and repair that bus to take their children to school.  And, the bus broke down and they had no money to repair it.  And of course, they were paying for the gas and paying for the driver and everything.  And, then they bought a second bus.  And, there was a route--and when I say a route, history tells us it went to Levi Pearson's house.  That's malarkey.  There was a route that the bus took to pick up all the children.  And Levi lived about seven or eight miles from it, but there were kids that I know that lived twelve miles from the school.
Speaker 2: Who were some of these kids who lived--?
Speaker 1: Okay, I'll give you one example, Clara Gibson [ph.], she's Clara McKnight [ph.] now, who lived on the property that we owned, and she rode that bus.  So, the bus is making a circle--so now when you look at history and they say--what they're implying is--from the school to Levi's house, and that's it, but, that's not the case.  Anyway, when the second bus had a problem is when the group talked to my father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] about helping them approach the school board or school officials for simple maintenance and repair of the bus.  And they were told no.
Story_ID: 551864
Speaker 1: That then evolved to the filing of a lawsuit with Levi Pearson as the plaintiff.  Okay, so that's why his name has become the martyr on this [Levi Pearson v. Clarendon County and School District No. 26].  But, when you look at it, you're talking about at least seventeen other people who had put and vested money in this bus, and who were the spurs of getting the bus.
Speaker 2: So, what happened next?  What did your father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] do?
Speaker 1: The suit was filed and, of course, you're dealing with poor people--there's no lawyer in the county, so how do we do all this stuff.  So, my father had a link that takes him and connects him to the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and convinces the NAACP to entertain this--underwrite this as a case.  And, of course, the results of that case was that it was withdrawn from the courts on a technicality, that Levi had filed a suit and his property tax, by his poll tax statement, was in a different district and it was in a district that would say that his kid needs to go to Manning High School [Manning, South Carolina] and not Summerton High School [Summerton, South Carolina].  And, you see, compounding the situation is that you had three districts for white schools, you had over fifty districts for black schools, but each one of those black school districts had no high school, so you had to be told which one are you eligible to go to.
Story_ID: 551865
Speaker 1: So what happened after that lawsuit [Levi Pearson v. Clarendon County and School District No. 26] was dismissed?
Speaker 2: When that lawsuit was dismissed, they then decided that we don't want to drop this battle, that we want a case that will do something to improve the situation for our children, so we're going to ask NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] to sponsor something that will force some improvements in the schools.  We don't know what it is, but we want improvement.
Speaker 1: So, the focus went beyond just busing. Extended to education?
Speaker 2: The focus all along was on education.  You're getting a situation where I'm sure that most of these people did not envision what they were leading up to.  I'm not too sure my father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] envisioned the whole thing at first.  But, we're looking at a situation that is intolerable, a situation where our children are not getting their education, a situation where the parents of that era--and I'm amazed that they're so different than the parents of today, but I remember talking to people and people would tell me, "Look, I wash clothes and I don't want my children washing clothes for a living, so I want them to get an education, and I want to make sure that they can get it right here."  That was the kind of expectation and tenacity that I saw as a young man at that time in those people.  And, I didn't get that from one, I got that from all.  Now, people will say--we talk today about our platitudes of Uncle Toms and all this business--half of the people that we labeled as Uncle Toms weren't Uncle Toms.  I talked with a lady, not a girl, she's my age, not too long ago.  Her daddy was a bootlegger in town.  And, he kept his name as far away from all this stuff as possible.  She's a Ph.D. and her husband's a Ph.D.  I was talking to her and she says, "Well, he couldn't afford to because the only way he knew how to make a living was this."  But, all of his children are educated and if we go back and look then--
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Smith, we called him Monkey Smith [ph.], I don't know if they want that publicized or not.  Anyway, but if we go back and look at then, money was being slid under the table for the movement from him all along.
Story_ID: 551866
Speaker 1: Well what happened to Levi Pearson?  I understand he became active with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]?
Speaker 2: Okay, let me go back and kind of clarify all of that. And I have to use my father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.], because my father was the mastermind of the whole thing.  My father was responsible for bringing the NAACP into Clarendon County [South Carolina] around 1940, which is just after it became a state organization.  I think it was '39 [1939] when they formed the state conference.  And, it was clandestine because, you know, they were labeled by the state as suppressive.  So, the thing was kept sub rosa, but that was an organization that was viable.  My father got sick and spent about a year in the hospital in 1944.
Speaker 1: Do you know his illness at the time?
Speaker 2: Pleurisy.  And he--the chapter sort of went under.  There were some key players in that chapter.  One was a lady--my Alzheimer's is taking over, I'll think of her name in a minute--but anyway she was the home demonstration agent for the county and of course she couldn't afford to be known with it, but she was very active with civil rights, and later fired for civil rights activities.  And then, a Reverend Seals [J.W. Seals] was active and my father had Mr. Pearson involved too at that time.  Well, after his illness, the thing went under and then when we came back, my father sort of reinstituted--tried to get it going and there were some difficulties because people didn't want to, or were afraid, to get involved.  And, when the bus transportation came along, that's when the interest began to pick up, and Mr. Pearson was made president, and he kind of said, "Look, I can't handle this because I don't know how to talk to people," which was true.  He and his brother [Hammett Pearson] were very committed to the cause.  His brother was very hot-tempered, so he was always--Levi was always put out front because he was a more mild-mannered person.  That's how his name gets to be the one that's used.  And, so finally he gave up and they elected a president who was a retired schoolteacher, and happened--and his wife happened to be a cousin of my father's.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: John T. Boyd [ph.], Bey-O-Y--B-O-Y-D.
Story_ID: 551867
Speaker 1: So, what happened next? In the fight. What did your father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] do?
Speaker 2: So, then after the case [Levi Pearson v. Clarendon County and School District No. 26] was
Speaker 1: Dismissed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) dismissed from court, they insisted that something be done.  They wanted the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] to do something, and of course, in order for the NAACP to do something of the magnitude that they were talking about, they had to have the blessings and okay from the national office, and the state was interested, but it would have to be approved.  Finally, there was a meeting granted with Thurgood Marshall who came down to South Carolina to talk with my father about this matter.
Speaker 1: What was Thurgood Marshall's position at this time?
Speaker 2: He was legal counsel for the NAACP.  This was before the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] was organized.  In a letter, which is in the archives of the Carolinian library [South Caroliniana Library, Columbia, South Carolina] now, that letter indicated to my father, from Harold Boulware [Harold R. Boulware], in Columbia [South Carolina] who was the attorney for the state NAACP, that Marshall would be there to discuss the request on X date, please be present--almost an invitation--you come and you present your case as to why you think that this should be done.  However, what happened, was that my father did attend and he brought along six other people, seven other people, who were from the community.  Many of them were from the Pearson family.  The only one that remains alive today that was in that meeting is a Jesse, J-E-S-S-E, Pearson [Jesse Pearson] who lives near Columbia, and he's in his mid to late eighties now.  But, he was with the group and when Marshall indicated to them that they would not entertain another case from Clarendon County [South Carolina], the group pled for a re-consideration.  Now, the reason for that, and maybe this is conjecture, but I think I'm correct, the NAACP is totally dependent upon contributions for support.  And, Clarendon County is an unheard of, unknown, destitute county, or community, in South Carolina.  That is not the recipe to raise funds.  I feel that that is the reason why the decision was made.  However, before Marshall left that day from that conference, he had a change of heart.  And, he agreed to take a case from Clarendon County, and that case was for equalization of educational opportunity.  Now, this was March of 1949 when that was done.  They left the meeting elated, went home and immediately scheduled four strategic meetings at churches in Clarendon County to tell about the possibility of what they had, and to determine who would be willing to become plaintiffs.  Now, all of this is occurring before any final details about the case has been made, so they jumped the gun.  Now, according to many quotes in history, it says that Marshall said, "Get me twenty plaintiffs."  I don't know how these stories come about or what, but when I look at the activities, I refute the fact that this was said at that time.  Now, it may have been stipulated somewhere along the way, but it wasn't said then, because they would not have gone back and blatantly gotten a hundred plaintiffs, you understand what I'm saying?
Story_ID: 551868
Speaker 1: While all of this is going on, something else is happening in Clarendon County [South Carolina].  The community of Summerton [South Carolina], even though they'd gotten plaintiffs from Summerton--people willing to be plaintiffs--that was the one community that was most hesitant to do this.  But, the problem that existed there in the school system had reached a boiling point.
Speaker 2: What was the problem?
Speaker 1: The principal who had been there [Scotts Branch High School, Summerton, South Carolina], real respected by the community, was terminated, and his termination appeared to be because he would not discourage Negroes from registering to vote.
Speaker 2: Was he white or black?
Speaker 1: Black.
Speaker 2: What was his name?
Speaker 1: His name was Mr. Anderson [A.M. Anderson].  I can't think of his first name right now, but a Mr. Anderson.
Story_ID: 551869
Speaker 1: As a side issue, there was a problem in Summerton [South Carolina] with the school's background of that is, that Maceo M-A-C-E-O Anderson [A.M. Anderson] was principal of the high school, and was terminated after ten years of service.
Speaker 2: Which high school?
Speaker 1: Scotts Branch High School [Summerton, South Carolina], S-C-O-T-T apostrophe S, Branch High School.  And, it was rumored that he was terminated because of his resistance in discouraging blacks to register and vote.  This was at a time when blacks had gained the right through court order, to vote, to register and vote, because South Carolina had declared the one party system and the Democratic Party as a private club for white men only.  Therefore, to qualify to vote, you had to be a white male in order to register for the Democratic Party.  When that was ruled illegal and the vote was extended to blacks, and I think at that time it was also extended to women, and there was strong resistance for blacks to become qualified.
Speaker 2: What year (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They had to pass either an intelligence test or had to have paid their income tax--I'm sorry--their poll tax or show proof of ownership of a minimum requirement of land, and of course, most of them didn't own land.  Most weren't educated and probably hadn't paid a poll tax, which was an extra tax that was added on that was done as a device for voting.
Speaker 2: What year are we talking now?
Speaker 1: We're talking around 1948. Forty-seven [1947] or '48 [1948]--I think the thrust was to vote in the '48 [1948] elections, national elections.
Story_ID: 551870
Speaker 1: And, as a problem of this principal [A.M. Anderson] being fired, and a new principal coming in, and apparently the white school board had gotten someone that would dance to their wishes--my perception of this new person coming in, a Mr. Benson [I.S. Benson], was that I firmly felt that he was an alcoholic and there were other problems.
Speaker 2: He was a white or black principal?
Speaker 1: Black, black.  The class of 1949 at Scotts Branch School [Scotts Branch High School, Summerton, South Carolina] revolted because they were being charged a fee for graduation in order to receive a diploma.  They accused the principal of being incompetent.  They claimed that funds raised during the year, primarily from students, was not accounted for, which they wasn't.  And, there were some other minor charges.
Speaker 2: So, tell me about your education at this point.  I know you attended two schools, including this one.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: When did you enter Scotts Branch School?
Speaker 1: Let me lead up to that.  As a consequence of this, the revolt--the class called a meeting of the white school board, and parents.  The white school board did not attend, the parents did attend, and became alarmed.  And, this was right at the time of formulating this new case to form some equalization.  So, this cohesed the community, and the attorneys, Thurgood Marshall, et cetera had contacted us, saying we want to focus on one community that has a white high school and a black high school.  That's why the case evolved to Summerton [South Carolina], because the attorneys preferred Summerton as compared to Manning [South Carolina], because the conditions were more traumatic.  Okay, now during that period, the school had deteriorated greatly, in terms of its academic standing and recognition in the state, from average to very sub-normal.
Speaker 2: Which school?
Speaker 1: Scotts Branch High School.
Story_ID: 551871
Speaker 1: I had attended the Scotts Branch High School [Summerton, South Carolina] in the ninth and the tenth grades.
Speaker 2: What year to what year?
Speaker 1: In 1948, I would have been coming out of tenth grade.
Speaker 2: So, you were--?
Speaker 1: Forty-six [1946] to '48 [1948]. Yeah
Speaker 2: You were attending this school during the revolt (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes. Yes.
Speaker 2: --and the shift in principals?
Speaker 1: No, I was attending it up until that point.  At that point, there was an alarm, that not only is it maybe a mediocre or less than mediocre school, but kids coming out of school may not be able to get into college because the school is not accredited.
Speaker 2: What, what were your classes like?  Did you feel like you were learning--reading, writing?
Speaker 1: You were learning some things, but there were also many things not taught.  For instance, we didn't have a library.  You had a school building with eleven rooms, sharing over eight hundred students, from first to eleventh grade, and going into twelfth grade, because forty--'50 [1950] is the first year that the twelfth grade was added.
Speaker 2: Were the teachers well educated?
Speaker 1: Some of them were, yes.  Most of them were, but here again, the quality of teachers depended upon who the school board hires.  It is in a low economic area, so therefore the salaries are not competitive, so all of this impacts upon the school.
Speaker 2: Do you remem- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You're talking about a situation with outdoor toilets, running water by a faucet outside, no science lab, a makeshift--at that time boys were required to take shop--but a makeshift shop area, a so-so decent home economics room which girls had to take cooking and sewing, and all of this with eight hundred students from first through twelfth grade.  So, you can imagine the quality of an, of an eleven room school with that.
Story_ID: 551872
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: Probably a good stud- no, I was a good student, but that is not based on the school.  That is based on my parents [Mattie Belton De Laine and Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.].
Speaker 1: So what happened at home (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Our library at home was better than most schools (laughter).  Because of this concern, many people who could afford it, took their children out of the school.
Speaker 1: Including your parents?
Speaker 2: Yeah, including my parents.  They took me out and sent me to a boarding school. Others--some went to boarding schools, some farmed their children with relatives or friends living in another town.
Speaker 1: Where did you go?
Speaker 2: I went to Mather Academy in Camden, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: What kind of school is Mather?
Speaker 2: That was a high school, a private high school, founded and operated by the New England Methodist church.
Speaker 1: Was the education you received at Mather quite different?
Speaker 2: Oh, very different, yes, very different.
Speaker 1: How?
Speaker 2: The quality of it.  The commitment, well, I shouldn't say the commitment of teachers, because we had commitment there [Scotts Branch High School, Summerton, South Carolina], but here the teachers had the latitude and the resources to educate.
Speaker 1: Better books?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Science lab?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: These were white teachers?
Speaker 2: White and black teachers.
Speaker 1: We're going to get back to the lawsuit, but I want to understand Mather Academy.  Do you remember a class in particular, to give us a sense of the education?  Your favorite class?
Speaker 2: Well, I--let me sort of change that.  The school provided structure that you would not get in a public school, which I feel sometimes is good for education.  The school had adequate libraries that you were forced to spend time in, and do your homework and your reading assignments.  So, it was not just being in class or at school from nine [o'clock] to three [o'clock], or whatever, but you had your classes then you had scheduled times in the evening where you spent X number of hours in the library with assigned projects.  Where you had other kinds of activities there that were meant to educational in nature, but these were extracurricular activities.
Speaker 1: Do you have an example of that?
Speaker 2: For instance, let's see, discussions on community responsibility, which was, you know, you wouldn't find even today in a public school.  Of course, being a religious school, a Methodist church, there was also the religious aspect, which was--not during school hours, but additional.  There was also the general living portion of it, etiquette, dress, certain things you must do.  For instance on certain days, you wore certain kinds of clothes.  I think, as I recall, on Thursday, boys wore dark suits, a shirt and tie.  You went to your meals--breakfast, lunch and dinner, and there's a monitor elevated above in the dining hall that's observing your actions--your etiquette actions.  And, if they weren't correct, you were reviewed (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you have to eat with the proper fork, knife (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. Yes. Um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: Do you remember [HistoryMaker] Jeanne Brayboy while you were there?
Speaker 2: Jean Brayboy was--she is from that town and she went to that school before I did.
Speaker 1: Any other students that became prominent people in their adult life?
Speaker 2: Well, Congressman James Clyburn [HistoryMaker James Clyburn] is a graduate of that school, after me.  Offhand, I can't think of any right now.  There's a number of people I know that became prominent physicians and things like that.
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from Mather?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty [1950].
Story_ID: 551873
Speaker 1: And so, meanwhile what was going on with this lawsuit?
Speaker 2: With the lawsuit, that was in the works during the time of the evolution to Briggs v. Elliott, when the revolt occurred by the students, and it cohesed in Summerton [South Carolina], as that's where the case is going to come from, and the rest of you will just be supporters or observers of it.  And, I can--I'm fuzzy now, and I can't remember exactly what happened, whether it was a threat on my father's [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] life or what, and this was during the spring of 1950 that all of a sudden there was a student assembly called one evening and the superintendent of the school, our nickname for her was the Hen, but she was a white New Englander, who called this thing.  And, everybody came in, and they were explained what happened to my father, and they talked about the social implications of this, and why it had occurred.  Then she had the chaplain of the school to give prayer, you know, and everything would be saved.
Speaker 1: Now, where was this meeting held?  At Mather Academy [Camden, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the auditorium, the school auditorium.
Speaker 1: And when you say she was explaining what happened to your father, what do you mean, the death threat?
Speaker 2: No, this was a--I don't recall if this was a death threat--there were so many things of this nature that happened, but there some incident at that time that happened, and I didn't know about it, and the first time I heard what was going on was when I went in there.  I knew that these things were possible, but I didn't know that this incident had happened, and she called this thing, this assembly, and reviewed it and then talked about it with the students, and this was to calm them.  And, ironically this happened just a few weeks after I had blessed out a policeman in Camden [South Carolina], and the police chief demanded that she bring me down to the police station for a lecture.
Speaker 1: What had you done?
Speaker 2: I had been working--volunteering as a school crossing guard.  The black public high school was directly across the street from us, and that street was Highway 1, U.S. 1 [U.S. Route 1], which was a high traffic road, allegedly controlled by the state police department I guess, not the town, but the town police were to assist us with crossing the road, and we had volunteers from the public high school and volunteers from the private school to act as school crossing guards.  And, the police were very irregular about sending police out, and we were used as target practice.  And so, I picked up the phone and called the police chief, and I blessed him out. And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, when you say used as target practice, what does that mean, exactly?
Speaker 2: That means when kids would stop to cross the street or when I got out there with my little regalia on, and say, "Hold up, let these kids across," these cars aimed at me or the children, and ignored us, so we were scurrying out of the way.  And so, I picked up the phone and called and blessed the police chief out about it and told him what I thought.  And, it was, how dare some little N-boy talk to me, Mr. White Man.  And so, I had to go down, and she had to bring me down there.  Well, little did I understand the dynamics of the situation from the fact that she is a white woman and she's not well regarded because she's down here teaching black kids.  So, the pressure is on her just as great as the pressure is on me.  And, I sort of looked at her taking the role of the subservient Negro woman to apologize for my actions, and that she will take full responsibility of talking to my parents and giving me punishment.  Now, that was her ploy to him to drop the matter, because she wants to live in peace.  So, I had to kind of take low and let it go as that.  That was her wisdom and that was her best way of getting out of it.  Well, she did, and I'm sure if she did it for me, she did it for other students as well, maybe not the same thing but something similar to that.
Story_ID: 551874
Speaker 1: What was the next action in the lawsuit?  Thurgood Marshall, what was his role?
Speaker 2: Thurgood Marshall, from the time that he decided that, his role was always as a lead attorney.  One of the misconceptions, one of the errors that's printed in today's history, is that Thurgood Marshall argued all five cases.  That's not true.  If you read those cases you will find that Thurgood Marshall argued one case.  That was Briggs v. Elliott.
Speaker 1: That's the one that began with your father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.]--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --South Carolina?
Speaker 2: That's right.  Now, all of the cases were reviewed by the Supreme Court, and Thurgood Marshall was the lead attorney for the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.], because it involved a split from the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and the lawyers went with the Legal Defense Fund, and formed it.
Speaker 1: You're talking about the Brown cases [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, now the Brown--you have five cases that are considered under Brown.  Briggs v. Elliott is one.  Now, when they were heard, they were heard as Brown, but they were all argued separately, and if you look at the arguments and the volume of arguments, the only one that has meat to it, is Briggs v. Elliott, and that was argued by Marshall.  Three of the other cases were argued by, well, I guess you could say all four of the other cases, but three of the other cases were argued by Marshall's subordinates.  The fifth case, which is the Delaware case [Belton v. Gebhart], was not a case from federal court.  That was a case from state court.  The state Supreme Court [Delaware Supreme Court] appealed to the United States Supreme Court because they knew these other cases of similar dispositions were there, which was a state NAACP lawyer.  Now, when you look at it you also find that John Davis [John W. Davis] is credited with being the defense counsel for Brown v. Board.  It ain't true.  John V. Davis [sic.] was hired by the State of South Carolina to defend them on Briggs v. Elliott.  He is not the defense lawyer, even by record, on these other cases.
Story_ID: 551875
Speaker 1: And so, what was the outcome?
Speaker 2: Of?
Speaker 1: Of Briggs v. Elliott.  What happened with that case?
Speaker 2: All right, Briggs v. Elliott went to federal court.  Because the case challenged state law, it had to be heard in federal court by a three judge panel, which is--most cases going to federal court are heard by the district judge first, and then the appellate court and then the [U.S.] Supreme Court.  Because this was a three judge panel, the case could bypass the appellate court and go directly to the Supreme Court if the case is appealed.  All right now, the three judge panel consisted of--well, let me not get into names because I might get one of them wrong, but the decision of that was a split decision.  The dissenting judge was J. Waties Waring [Julius Waties Waring] who, in his decision said that segregation was unconstitutional.
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: That's 1951 or 1952--no, not '51 [195l], must have been '52 [1952]. Fifty-two [1952] I believe.  All right, the other two judges, which is a majority, said that this does not violate the constitutional rights of blacks.  However, they did admit in their decision that the schools were unequal, and would be remedied.
Speaker 1: What was your father's [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] reaction, and next steps?
Speaker 2: Well, I think there was a reaction of joy, because you had not a won situation--not a winning situation, but you had a situation better than what you had before, where a federal judge is now saying--okay, at that point the case was appealed directly to the Supreme Court.  It went to the Supreme Court and it was returned remanded to the lower court for review, and the reason for the review was that the majority decision was that the schools were in- inequitable, but they were doing something to address the situation.  South Carolina had effected a 3 percent sales tax to correct the inequities, and this is what they hanging their hats on to avoid desegregation of schools.  And, they sent it back for a progress report.  Now, in my paranoia, I feel they sent it back for another reason.  I'm not going to get any legal mind to side with me, because nobody goes against the Supreme Court.  But, when that case went back to the district court level for the three judges, Judge Waring had retired, really he retired out of pressure.  And, I'll get to his story differently if you want to discuss that.  But, the three judges that looked at the case then, came back and said, you know, we stand by our decision that we're making changes and we're doing this, that and the other.  They'd given them buses, and they'd built two or three new schools.  Now, when the case went back to the Supreme Court, it was then joined by Brown v. Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], and right afterwards the other cases, all of which were initiated after Briggs v. Elliott.
Story_ID: 551876
Speaker 1: And what was going on in your home at this time?  Was your father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] talking about the inequities and this case [Briggs v. Elliott]?  Were you very much aware of history in the making?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  During that time, our house had been burned by arson in 1951.
Speaker 1: Burned completely down?
Speaker 2: Completely.
Speaker 1: What were the circumstances of that?  Were you at home at the time?
Speaker 2: No, I was away--I was here in college [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] at the time.  But, the house was burned, and the fire department sat across the street and looked at it and said, "It's twenty feet across the town line," and said, "We can't do anything about it."  And, they sat there with the equipment and watched it burn.  Now, the argument becomes that my father was not living in the house.  We were.  Now, what happened was that the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church forced my father to take a different pastorate which was in Lake City [South Carolina], fifty miles away, and required him to live in a church parsonage.
Speaker 1: Because of the threats?  Because of the fire?
Speaker 2: No, this is before the fire.  I feel, I personally feel, and I have no proof, but I think the bishop was paid off.  I'll be blunt about it.  Because why would you take someone who is leading this kind of effort, who has committed himself to the pastoring of rural people, and send him to a town church fifty miles away, other than to get rid of him from where he is [Summerton, South Carolina].  You understand what I'm saying? And, in a town that's rabid with the Ku Klux Klan [KKK].
Story_ID: 551877
Speaker 1: Tell me about the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] in that town and how visible they were.
Speaker 2: Well, let me put it to you this way.  I was away in college when--during the time my father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] lived there.
Speaker 1: At Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: First at Smith and then at Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania].  I was home one summer for a few days.  I didn't spend very much time in Lake City [South Carolina].  Home for a few days, and went out with a young doctor and he had to go--nothing to do, so I just followed him around, and he had to go up to a chain gang outfit for treating a patient.  On our way back to town, we're on U.S. Highway 52 [U.S. Route 52] and we notice this huge cross being built out of straw and so forth, and we stopped to find out what's going on.  This is a Ku Klux Klan meeting here tonight.  So, I went back to his house and we talked about it, and we said, "Let's go back up there tonight."  So, we went back.  That's my first and only time for observing a Ku Klux Klan meeting.
Story_ID: 551878
Speaker 1: --Story about my experience with the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] meeting.  Once we found out that it was a KKK meeting, we decided to go back and observe that night.  Well, it's right on the highway, and the highway is public, and this is just after several burnings of Jewish synagogues in, I believe, Savannah, Georgia and Jacksonville, Florida which had received a lot of notoriety, and I think a couple of incidents may have been in South Carolina as well.  Of course, the police had no leads on who the perpetrators were.  And, so we got there and we drove in.  And they, hold on, out.  So, Dr. Lee [ph.], the guy I was with, turned the car around, and we drove out and went across the street and parked and sat on the railroad tracks.  There were state troopers there directing traffic on a state highway, and we sat there and the meeting started and they lit the cross with fire, and they all hooded, were there, and they sang 'The Old Rugged Cross,' and afterwards they had prayer, and they admonished God for letting the burr-headed nigger and the hook-nosed Jew get out of hand and that since he hadn't done anything about it, they had to take matters into their own hands.  And they gave awards to the people who had torched these Jewish synagogues in Savannah, Jacksonville, and I think, South Carolina was included, and honored them and praised them as heroes, and the state police were right there.  Then after that was done, they passed a resolution to get rid of the disc jockey in Lake City [South Carolina].  Now, this was a white male who had the--who was the sole disc jockey for the town, and a very popular disc jockey.  And, he had programs geared towards ethnic groups.  In other words, he had a hillbilly program on at 11:00 to 12:00, he had a gospel program on 12:00 to 1:00, and he had a blues program on from 1:00 to 2:00!  And, for each program that he did, his dialect was of such that you could not tell--you would swear he was a member of that ethnic group.  And, they didn't like it, and they said the resolution was passed to have that station get rid of him, and we all kind of knew what that meant--let's tell the station to fire him.  Well, it wasn't two weeks later before he was drafted into the [U.S.] Army, and he was like at the--bordering on the maximum age (laughter), so that's how he was gotten rid of.
Story_ID: 551879
Speaker 1: And your father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] received several death threats?
Speaker 2: Okay, let's go through that.  When my father came to Lake City [South Carolina], he understood the circumstances, and he limited his activities in Lake City to pastoral duties.  However, he was very active back in South Carolina, which is where everything is occurring on the desegregation case with Briggs v. Elliott.  In 1955, after the second decision on Briggs v. Elliott, and this is with all deliberate speed, the White Citizens' Council had gotten a foothold into South Carolina and they were recruiting members.  The secretary to the White Citizens' Council happened to have been an attorney Rogers [S.E. Rogers] from Summerton [South Carolina] who was also at one time the defense attorney for Briggs v. Elliott, who was an advising attorney for Briggs v. Elliott even at the [U.S.] Supreme Court level, or an assistant attorney.  But he came to Lake City recruiting members, and indicated that the perpetrator of this whole situation they were in was living in Lake City, and how come you folk are allowing him to live here.  You need to get rid of him.  The rumors started.  The harassment started, and the stoning of the house with garbage and fright was put into local people, et cetera.
Speaker 1: Where were you at this time?  In college [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: No, I was in Korea.
Speaker 1: Your father, has he described these events to you, or your mother [Mattie Belton De Laine]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: What have they told you about?
Speaker 2: Well, most of what I relate to you came through them.
Speaker 1: I mean, was there a lot of fear on their part?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but my father was an unmovable man.  And, that lasted for about three months and at that time, a letter was delivered to the house, to the church parsonage, to leave town within ten days or die.  And, in that letter there was a reminder: ask the Negro postmaster what happened.  In 1898, there was a Negro postmaster in Lake City.  At that time, postmasters were appointed by the president of the United States as a political payoff, and a Negro postmaster was there, and he was told to resign, and he didn't.  And, he was forced to watch his house burn with his family burning in the house, and then he was murdered afterwards.  And, that was a Mr. Frazier [Frazier Baker], F-R-A-Z-I-E-R.  I know that they never got a post office after that.  As I understand it, even today the post office in Lake City is a rented building with the mail delivered to a little hamlet north of Lake City and then transported back.  I don't know how rigid that whole--but I understand it's all coming from that, so I don't know.
Speaker 1: Did your father leave?
Speaker 2: That letter came when he happened to have been in Charleston [South Carolina], and my mother took the letter to him and the bishop immediately transferred him to Bermuda, and he refused to go. Made arrangements for a transfer to Bermuda and he refused to go.
Speaker 1: The country?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 551880
Speaker 1: And he went back to Lake City [South Carolina], and--no, no, no, no, no--before he got back to Lake City on the sixth day or something like this, of the letter, the church [Greater St. James African Methodist Episcopal Church, Lake City, South Carolina] was destroyed by arson.  Then on the tenth day, which is after he returned because he said he wasn't going anywhere, there was a shootout at midnight.  And, so, the third time of the shootout, he started shooting back and nobody knows what happened.  It is said--the papers admit that there were three people injured.  The grand jury report says five people were injured by him.  The local people says that one police officer had a funeral.  Now, we don't know what happened, but he fled that night to a town about forty miles away, and escaped the next day to New York State.  Someone came back and got my mother [Mattie Belton De Laine].  And the family who lived next door were members of his church, and also the aunt of [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis, Ossie Davis' mother's sister.  They are the ones who protected my mother that night.  And her name--all I know is his name was Webb, his first name W-E-B-B, Eady [ph.], and she was Viola Eady [ph.].  The arrangement for his getting out of the state was, I guess, masterminded by an Attorney Williams [ph.] in Florence [South Carolina] and a Mr. Guile, G-U-I-L-E.  I can't think of their first names.  Guile's wife is still alive.  But, they went back and got my mother and smuggled him into Charlotte [North Carolina].  My uncle lived next door and one lived up the street, and they stopped up the street and made arrangements for him to take a plane that night out of here.  And, the problem was, they weren't sure where to go.  He first took a flight--he took a flight to Washington, D.C.  Now, of course, he was on his own at that point, and when he got in Washington he called his cousin, and his cousin said, "No, this is worse than being in Mississippi, so let's get out of here right now."  So, my father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] took a cab to his house and they jumped in his car and they started heading north, and ended up in New York.  That's how he ended up there.  And, the State of South Carolina attemp- they appealed to the attorney general at that time, which was Richard Brownell [sic. Herbert Brownell, Jr.] and to Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower], to invoke the federal fugitive act [Fugitive Felon Act], to return him, and that was denied because my father had let them know exactly where he was every step of the way.
Speaker 2: But, he'd been writing the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] for years, documenting the situation?
Speaker 1: That's right, right.  And then after that in the State of New York, before South Carolina even got to the point of asking for extradition, the State of New York reviewed the case, and determined that they would not honor any extradition, so that's what kept him safe in New York State.  Now, they moved back--they moved here in 1971.
Speaker 2: To Charlotte, North Carolina?
Speaker 1: To Charlotte, to this house, because my father knew that he was not probably going to live very long and he wanted to get my mother close to family members, an uncle--a brother next door, and one up the street.  So, that's why they came here.  But he at that time did not have a safety clearance for his legal problems, but it was ignored in the State of North Carolina, and the warrant for his arrest in South Carolina existed until the year 2000, which was twenty-six years after his death, before it was lifted.
Story_ID: 551881
Speaker 1: Did he [De Laine's father, Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] continue to stay in touch with the folks in South Carolina?  Did he in some way continue his work?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.  Now, it's difficult when you're not there, but some of the more serious retaliations took place after he left the state.  For instance, as Jet magazine put it, operation starve, the refusal of grocery stores to sell Negroes food, the refusal to sell the black merchants things for their stores, the refusal to gin their cotton or if they got it ginned, to buy their farm produce.  It became a big problem, and my father was very instrumental in some of the contacts that he had in New York to help with sending food by the truckloads down, or getting the attention and influence of people like Walter Reuther, to aid with that service.
Speaker 1: Did you come in contact with some of these leaders like Thurgood Marshall?  Did you see him?
Speaker 2: I--with the--I met him.  I met Roy Wilkins a couple of times.
Story_ID: 551882
Speaker 1: To be very a- frank with you, I was very bitter at that time.  I was bitter with the church, and I still am bitter with the church because I don't think that they treated him [De Laine's father, Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] fairly.  I feel that he was put out to dry, or die by himself, you know, too bad.
Speaker 2: How would you describe your father's temperament and character?
Speaker 1: He never felt bitter about anything.  It was not his personality.  He wouldn't hold a grudge like that.  I hold grudges.
Speaker 2: A gentle man, obviously?
Speaker 1: Very, very, very much, and very above board and very open to discussion about anything.  And, whatever is handed down, I will take it and I will live with it when it came to the church and I will find my ways around it.
Speaker 2: Was he a strict disciplinarian to his children?
Speaker 1: In a sense, yes, but he was more of, shall we call it, a teacher.  Now, I look at this--I'm not sure how my brother [HistoryMaker B. B. De Laine] looks at this because I never talk to about it, but I have to some extent with my children, with my sister [Ophelia De Laine Gona].  I feel that my parents did a lot of growth in their time.  I'm not too sure I could have made all the changes that they made.  Coming from a culture that they came from, there was a big transition.  You know, you're talking about an era where planes didn't exist when they were born.  There are certain social mores and other things that were very rigid at that time, and to see our society evolve through the years, and much of this had a bearing on how you related with people, and I could see in their earlier lives where, yeah, they conformed very much to some of those societal attitudes.  But, I can see in later years where all of that was by the wayside.  Now, what I do see with him, a strong consistency, both of them, would be their faith and their Christian values, and having that not clouded with a lot of the other crap that comes with it.  Whereas, I'm the type that--I'm not going to be bothered with that, you understand what I'm saying.  So, I see a big difference in their attitudes.

Speaker 1: I want to take you through your own progression, your own evolution through education.  I know you left Mather [Mather Academy, Camden, South Carolina] and went on to Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina].  What year did you begin at Johnson C. Smith?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty [1950].
Speaker 1: What did you study there?
Speaker 2: Biology.
Speaker 1: Were you a good student?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that campus when you arrived in 1950.
Speaker 2: Well, it was not my school of choice, and I had a strong negative feeling about that.  That was my parents' [Mattie Belton De Laine and Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] choice.  And, it was my parents' choice because I don't think they wanted me to get too far from home, and they wanted me close to some supervision.  And, my uncle that lived up the street was on the administrative staff of Smith and another uncle right here.  But, my choice of schools at that time was Lincoln University [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] or Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  And, I really did not want to be here.
Speaker 1: Why did you want to go to Lincoln or Fisk?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not sure of the total reasons.  One was to get away from home, but I saw Lincoln as probably being the kind of school that I would want to go to, and that I would be attracted to, and Smith--and Fisk because of its historical aura.  With my father being an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] minister, most people expected me to go to Allen [Allen University, Columbia, South Carolina], and I would have quit school before I had gone there.
Story_ID: 551884
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So tell me about some of the highlights at Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you involved in any clubs?
Speaker 2: Well, I joined the Omega Fraternity [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity].  I'm not an active member today, but I did join the national Omega then.
Speaker 1: Was there a rigorous pledge period?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How long was that?
Speaker 2: Well, actually the pledge period was one semester, and---
Speaker 1: Some of it is secretive.  Are there any parts of it that you can share?
Speaker 2: Well, I think typical of most of these secretive societies.  What I guess I appreciated about it, what I valued in it, was the camaraderie of brotherhood with, you know, the people.  Since that, I've gone through some very lukewarm stages because I don't really like some of the things that occur in fraternities today, particularly undergraduate chapters, but as I got out of school, I found that much of this thrust was social, and it's who could top who, and I found that repulsive.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your fraternity brothers?
Speaker 2: Ed Smith [ph.].  There were thirteen that went over with me, and I can remember a few of them, but you know, most of them are dead now.  My best friend in college was a Cecil Dennis who became foreign minister for the country of Liberia, and executed in the government coup of 1980.  And, he and I, after we went to Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania], became extremely close and after his execution, I'm the one that got his family here and am still very closely in contact with his children and wife--or widow.
Story_ID: 551885
Speaker 1: My escape to Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] was through the efforts of Judge J. Waties Waring [Julius Waties Waring], who was that federal judge I mentioned with the dissenting viewpoint.  And, this was done, we were at his place for a Christmas dinner in '52 [1952], no, '51 [1951], and he started questioning me about why did I pick Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina], because he didn't think very much of Smith.  There were only two schools, black schools [HBCUs], that he thought highly of, and that was Lincoln and Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  And, so I told him I didn't pick it, I was forced.  And, it was right in front of my father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] and mother [Mattie Belton De Laine].  So, we got into a discussion about it, and he wanted to know where did I want to go, and I said Lincoln or Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  And, he said, well what about Howard, and I said no way.
Speaker 2: Why, because of Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 1: Well, my attitude of Howard was that it was very well--a good school for reputation but a very snobbish black school.  I didn't like that.  My brother [HistoryMaker B. B. De Laine] went to Howard for a short period and he got the same--as a matter of fact, he just about dropped out for that reason.
Speaker 2: What year did you leave Johnson C. Smith?
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-two [1952].
Speaker 2: And, so you finally entered Lincoln?
Speaker 1: And he interceded and within a month after this discussion we had, I got a call saying, hey, these people are waiting for your application, you've already been accepted (laughter).  So, that's how I got to Lincoln.  And, of course, you know, he talked with my father and said let the boy do what he wants to do.  So, it was good in a sense and bad in a sense.  I got away from home, but I also started aspiring to what I wanted to do, and that was the party life (laughter).
Speaker 2: Ah ha.
Speaker 1: So, every time they looked for me, I was either in Boston [Massachusetts] or New York [New York], or somewhere else.
Speaker 2: Partying, huh?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 551886
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the campus of Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] like at this time, I mean you're up north now in Pennsylvania.  Is it very different than the South?
Speaker 2: No. Lincoln a rur- in a rural community.  It's Lincoln University [Pennsylvania], which is the post office address, four miles out of Oxford [Pennsylvania].  And, when I arrived there, the year before, they had just had Lincoln students sitting in at the bars and the movies in town.  Because at the--even when I was there they had, you go into--and I call a bar the cafes and things like that, as well.  And, the first two seats, when you come in, were reserved for black folk.  The movies, you sat up in the buzzard roost.  The motels, the hotels, you couldn't--there were no accommodations for you, you know, if your parents were coming up for graduation what have you.  There were no accommodations there.  So, this is like twelve miles north of the Mason-Dixon Line, and if you went over to Wilmington, Delaware, segregation was loud and clear over there, so your only escape without segregation was into Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  But, you know, when I arrived there I was thinking, you know, this was Pennsylvania.  But, now as I got there and I started meeting my schoolmates, and I looked at those that came from Harrisburg [Pennsylvania] or from places like that, my god, they were in the same school with the whites but it was just as segregated because--the white prom and the black prom, you know, and it just went right down the line like that so, it was the same kind of thing, all over again.
Story_ID: 551887
Speaker 1: Did you major in biology?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I finished in--graduated with biology, and then after goin- when I entered graduate school, pursued biochemistry.
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty [1950]. No, '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: Fifty-four [1954]. And were you--even though you did party, were you a pretty good student?
Speaker 2: Fair student, yeah.  I could have been better.
Speaker 1: Any clubs?
Speaker 2: No, basically what I did there--
Speaker 1: Omega [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] continued?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I helped out with the--let's see is it the '54 [1954]? Forty- no '52 [1952]--when was the presidential election then? Whichever one it was, Adlai Stevenson [Adlai Stevenson II] and Dwight Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower], I did a lot of campaigning in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] for Adlai Stevenson.
Speaker 1: You did campaigning for him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well busloads of us from the school were taken up to knock on doors and that whole thing, so that was an experience.
Speaker 1: And then you went to graduate school in what year?
Speaker 2: I went into the [U.S.] Army after college. To Korea (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you drafted?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then I went to graduate school.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about Korea, though.  You were in the Army, sent to Korea for the Korean conflict, the Korean War.  Were you integrated?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was at, almost at the point of integration.
Story_ID: 551888
Speaker 1: The conflict in Korea, the Korean War, was that a difficult time for you?
Speaker 2: Well, it was only difficult, I guess, from two points of view.  This is the period of time when my father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] had to flee South Carolina and, in a sense, I resent the way in which I found out about it, and then when I questioned is it true, the message that came back from the Red Cross [American Red Cross] was, "Everything is all right, nothing's happened."  That was one resentment that I had.  The other resentment was that here I am in the [U.S.] Army, expected to give up my life for this damn democracy, and here's how I get paid off, with the situation with my father.  So, I had strong resentments.  From the point of view of the [U.S.] military, I feel that there was some benefits to me, and that I matured while I was in the Army, and I think had I not gone to the service, I may not have matured as quickly, and maybe I should have been matured then.  So, that's a positive aspect of it.
Speaker 1: How old were you at this time?
Speaker 2: Twenty-one, when I went in, when I was drafted.
Speaker 1: And, you did have friends in the Army, white and black?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was that different for you, or was that seemingly normal?
Speaker 2: You can say it was different, but I saw it as normal.  Probably, unfortunately, I'm not in contact with any of my Army acquaintances, but I think among those that I felt closest to, were two white guys.
Speaker 1: What were their names?
Speaker 2: Well, one was a Robert Dodson [ph.] from Lawrence, Kansas, and the other was uh--Alzheimer's takes over at times--Harold Dubin [ph.], from Detroit, Michigan.  Harold and I were roommates at an aid station as medics in an ordinance battalion at the time when all of this happened in South Carolina.  And, without my knowledge that Harold was doing this--he had written his parents--and they had gotten in contact with their congressman from Detroit, I was getting more information through that congressman than I was getting from South Carolina and the Red Cross (laughter) and, we remained friends and stayed in contact after the service.  Over the years, that has waned, and I've lost contact with both.  I went on the computer the other day with Dodson, because I found his wedding invitation with the wife's family, the address, and I found a Dodson, in, not in Lawrence, but in that section, and I really want to call them, but I don't know if that's the right one, and I haven't confirmed that.
Story_ID: 551889
Speaker 1: But you didn't feel the racial tensions that you felt here in Pennsylvania and South Carolina?  Within the [U.S.] Army it was different?
Speaker 2: I felt some of it.  I felt some of it, and I'll tell you where I felt it from.  There was--there were a lot of New Englanders in my outfit, white New Englanders.  And, most of those who were college graduates had come from Ivy League schools, or wealthy finishing schools, and they were ultra snobbish, and anytime they could throw off on you, they would.
Speaker 1: How?
Speaker 2: You know, for instance, speech--a detectable southern whatever, and it seems as if I was targeted because there were not too many blacks in my outfit that were college graduates.
Speaker 1: How many were there?
Speaker 2: There might have been two or three of us.
Speaker 1: Who were college educated?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And there were other blacks?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because I was with a medical battalion, but most of the folk in there, the blacks, were not college graduates.
Speaker 1: How many blacks compared to whites in your battalion?
Speaker 2: I don't know, a third of them were.
Story_ID: 551890
Speaker 1: All right, then you completed your tour?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, you entered graduate school?
Speaker 2: After coming back, my family was now living in Buffalo [New York], so- and I found this out en route home, that I would not be going to New York City [New York, New York], I would be going to Buffalo to see them once I got my discharge.  So, I went to Buffalo and decided, well, I'll look around here, and that's when I fully understood the nature of what was happening with my father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.], and the fact that he was sent to Buffalo, really, to get rid of him by the church.  See, I would have told them to go to hell.  And, he started a church there, which is in existence today, and we probably could have stayed there and he could have made a successful venture of it.  However, we considered Buffalo as an isolated area, away from family and away from the mainstream of everything, and I was not going to stay there.
Speaker 1: What was the name of this church?
Speaker 2: The church my father founded is De Laine - Waring A.M.E. Church [De Laine - Waring African Methodist Episcopal Church, Buffalo, New York].  That's De Laine hyphen W-A-R-I-N-G.  So, my mother [Mattie Belton De Laine] and I forced him to really consider leaving, and we had purchased a home there where we had the church.  The A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church was allegedly going to help him get established and didn't do a damn thing, and you can quote me on that.  And, so he talked with his bishop about moving back to New York City, and they definitely did not want him in New York, there was too much publicity that he'd gotten.  And, they sent him--a church in Brooklyn [New York] requested him, and he was told okay, but when the assignments came out, he was assigned to a church in New Rochelle [New York], with about five members.  And, so, anyway he took it, and in the meantime we decided to do something about where we were going to live there in New York.  And, so my sister [Ophelia De Laine Gona], who is now out of college, and I, went over and purchased a place.  This a year and a half after I got back.  And, we put a deposit on a place in Queens [New York].  Well, unfortunately, my naivete caught up with me, because I couldn't buy in New York because I worked in Buffalo.  That just isn't done.  You buy a house where you're going to live, and where there's reasonable transport to get there.  So, finally, the purchase of the property was transferred to my mother because, by that time, she had secured employment in Chappaqua, New York, or one of those towns up in Westchester County [New York].
Speaker 1: Teaching?
Speaker 2: Teaching.  But, before she signed the contract, she'd gotten a job in Nassau County [New York], so that worked out well with this purchase that we were doing in Brooklyn, and at that following conference, my father got the church in Brooklyn that had originally requested him [Calvary Fellowship African Methodist Episcopal Church, Brooklyn, New York].  So, that situated them to live in Queens, and he pastored in Brooklyn and she worked in Nassau County until their retirement, and they moved here.
Story_ID: 551891
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And where did you go to graduate school?
Speaker 2: I went to, I did a few courses at the University of Buffalo [State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York], and when we came back, I enrolled in NYU [New York University, New York, New York], and after I got into the program I started having second thoughts about what I wanted to do and what was my life's interests.
Speaker 1: What were you studying?
Speaker 2: Biochemistry.  And, I'd been working in Buffalo [New York] and in New York [New York] in cancer research. I finally (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What year is this?
Speaker 2: Excuse me?
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, what year is this?
Speaker 2: Oh boy.  Buffalo would be '57 [1957], '58 [1958], something like that, then back to New York about '58 [1958] or '59 [1959] with a job at Sloan Kettering Institute in cancer research.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that, cancer research at Sloan Kettering [Memorial Hospital and the Sloan Kettering Institute; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Well, I think with all of the research work, you're working on various aspects of understudying and understanding the growth of cancer and the responses or effects that agents have on it.
Speaker 1: And this was around what time?
Speaker 2: Around--from 1950--my first job, was at Roswell Park [Roswell Park Cancer Institute] in Buffalo, which was also in cancer research, an institute set up for that.  And, that was because of my science background.  So, it just continued along those lines.  When I went to New York, it was like natural to get into Sloan Kettering, and I then enrolled in graduate school, which is almost--if you're in research, it's almost like you've got to go until you get your Ph.D., and this is all a part of the understudy on that, and these schools are connected with universities.  And, I started having second thoughts about the whole thing, so I left Sloan Kettering.
Speaker 1: Well, were you one of just a few black people at Sloan Kettering?
Speaker 2: There were blacks there.  I wouldn't venture to say how many, but there were blacks there.  But, you're dealing with a more academic environment and so, among those, I had--among our black friends at Sloan Kettering, most of them left the United States and went to Europe for med school, because at that time, it was very difficult to get in med school here.  You had not only the costs, but just the space.  And, there had been attempts to persuade me to do this, but I was a little chicken.  But, I had friends going to Heidelberg [Germany], Bologna [Italy] and Italy and those are the main two that I recall.  I had met a fellow from Krakow, in Poland, and we had become good friends.  He was a professor at Krakow, and was over here on an exchange program.
Speaker 1: So he was Polish?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, he tried his best to get me to come to Poland, and that I could live on less than a tenth of what I live on here.  But, I wouldn't budge on that because of, I don't know, I was a little too brainwashed with this whole crap in this country about democracy, henceforth, and communism, and that was a Communist country.
Story_ID: 551892
Speaker 1: Did you get your master's degree?
Speaker 2: No. Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: What year did you leave NYU [New York University, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: I spent two years there.  I was going to go for a doctorate's degree.  I spent two years there.
Speaker 1: Until about 1960?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I dropped out.  Then, I started taking courses at NYU or a city college [City University of New York, New York, New York]--
Speaker 1: How long did you consider your work with cancer research?
Speaker 2: I worked in that until about 1960, and some phase of it, until about 1965.
Story_ID: 551893
Speaker 1: And you were up north?  The racial climate at this time? Civil rights, it was just after--what was it, how would you describe that?
Speaker 2: Well, I was not too involved.  I kept up with the Civil Rights Movement, but I was not actively involved in it myself.  I was too busy trying to find out what I was doing.  My father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] attended some of these events and I was definitely afraid of that, with him.  I did not want him to go and I tried to shield him against going to a lot of things, but he went down to Mississippi, and we went a couple of other places.  But, I felt that, look, you've paid a price, which means I've paid a price and I'm not going to risk anything else, because I already see that when you get in trouble, you fend for yourself, and there's nobody going to help you.  And, that's the way I felt about it.
Story_ID: 551894
Speaker 1: What did you do after your work with cancer research?
Speaker 2: I went on a concerted effort to find something outside of the sciences, that I thought I would be happy with, because by this time I had given up my ideas about leaving the country permanently, because I had on two different occasions really had planned that, and I had gone scurrying out and looking.  But, as I searched, somehow I focused on the pharmaceutical industry as a way out of it, and because I could then use my scientific background as part of the asset, but I still got to get the business aspect of it.
Speaker 1: Where did you work in pharmaceuticals?
Speaker 2: With a pharmaceutical firm, with Hoffmann-La Roche, Incorporated [F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.] in Nutley, New Jersey, and I went there.
Speaker 1: What did you do (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I went there as a salesperson to learn the operations.  And, within a year out of that, I took an assignment with designer educational programs to train salesmen, and from there to a promotion manager, and then I got involved with acquisition of new businesses, and from there, director of EEO [equal employment opportunity], and then back into the pharmaceutical aspect as director of sales administration, and then retired.
Story_ID: 551895
Speaker 1: Did you along the way have the desire to take on some of the battles your father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] had begun for civil rights?  Was that ever a part of your mission?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.  It was only a part of my mission from the attitude of burn, baby burn (laughter).  That's the way I saw it.  I had a very comfortable, easy life, particularly when I was with Roche [F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.], and I ran into a lot of obstacles because I was black.
Speaker 1: Can you name a couple of obstacles?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I can name a lot of them.
Speaker 1: Give me one.
Speaker 2: First of all, you go with a company like that at that time, and whether you admit it or not, you were window dressing.  And, the next thing that you find out after a couple years of working there, is that you were hired at a lower salary than anybody else.
Speaker 1: This is the 19--?
Speaker 2: Sixties [1960s].
Speaker 1: Sixties [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And, the way I found it out, was when legislation came about on equal pay.  And, all of a sudden, there was just a broad category raise in salaries for the economy inflation aspect.  Then, you find that, hey, I haven't been paid standard wage, and all of a sudden, now, I'm brought up by this inflationary standard, which puts me at minimum pay, but it does nothing for my merit.  And, I tell you, overcoming that battle was difficult then.  I think that--I don't think the industry--any industry has changed today.
Story_ID: 551896
Speaker 1: And, once you retired, you became involved with the foundations?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.  Once I retired, I became--my first interest, was to find something to do.  And, I felt that this business of import items may be good, but I think that I was a little, not a little, but way ahead of time in Charlotte [North Carolina].  Plus, I also found that there's an element of racial prejudice that goes along with that.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about the import business, the name of your business, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Joseph's Imports [ph.].
Speaker 1: One more time?
Speaker 2: Joseph's Imports.  And, this was in downtown Charlotte.  My first problem was that I knew funds were available to assist operations such as this in a downtown area. (Unclear) downtown, the need for revitalization, et cetera.  The areas, including this house, all in a cordoned off area as needy, so to speak.  Yet, I found from a community development office of the city that funds were being returned to the federal government because there's nobody qualified to take it.  And, when I went down, it's, "No, no, you can't get it, because you've already put X number of dollars into a building and you didn't ask our permission."
Speaker 1: What year is this?
Speaker 2: Around '86 [1986], '87 [1987], somewhere in there.  But, my point is that going into the business, I had to foot the expense myself.  There was no help from a small business corporation, or nothing.  I got my sister [Ophelia De Laine Gona] and brother- or brother-in-law to be partners with me.  And, true, I wasn't working.  I had cash on hand, I'm paying cash for everything, and I've got them working with a substantial income, and being hassled by banks about qualifications, and submitting a stack of data that high, to be told, "Well, no, we aren't going to do this," when I know, that if I were white, I would have given that much, and gotten it.  And, I'm talking now about an owner of a building that I paid two hundred thousand cash for.  And, they're saying, "But you didn't come through us for approval."
Speaker 1: And you feel that these were racial obstacles?
Speaker 2: I think they were, yeah, I'm sure they were.  That's part of it.  Then, after you get into the business, and I had a very favorable--I should have taken some of this out to show you but I didn't--a favorable review from the newspaper, the daily newspaper.  And, this boosted it for a few weeks--lots of curiosity seekers.  And, people would come in, "Well, where are you from?"  I'd say, "America."  "No, no, no, no, I mean where are you really from?"  "America."  "No, you know what I mean."  Now, what you're asking me is, "We see the color of your skin, but you're not one of these blacks from around here.  Now, did you come from Haiti, or--?  Now, do you see what I'm saying?  Because, you wouldn't be in this business if you were."  That kind of stuff.  Or, for instance, you get in a conversation about some of the items in the store, and you casually mention, "Well, I picked these up in (unclear) in Indonesia."  They'd say, "Did you go there in the [U.S.] Army?"  "No, dummy, I went to buy these damn things!"  "Well, now how could you afford that?"  That's all racial.  I'm sure if they walked into a store with a non-person of color, those questions wouldn't have been asked.
Story_ID: 551897
Speaker 1: How long did your import store [Joseph's Imports (ph.)] remain open?
Speaker 2: For about four years.
Speaker 1: And, then you began work- began work with foundations?
Speaker 2: No, I went broke, or presented going broke.  You see, this was during the time that my mother [Mattie Belton De Laine]--she seriously became ill, so I devoted most of the time, during her illness, with her, plus paying for twenty-four hour care.
Speaker 1: Here in Charlotte [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, here in this house, with her, and I moved into this house as well.  Then around '93 [1993], '94 [1994], I started an involvement here with the community and with the community development corporation [Northwest Corridor Community Development Corporation, Charlotte, North Carolina].  And, I really went in as a board member, and that's all I'm going to do, and I find myself as chair of the board, so I had to get involved with the projects here, which included development of a shopping center not too far from here, a senior citizens' home, not too far from here also, and several other things of this nature.  And, this was also approaching the anniversary of Brown v. Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], and I'd been asked to speak a couple of times on that, and as the approach neared, I got more involved with Clarendon County [South Carolina], because I wanted to see them get a pretty good share of publicity out of this thing.  I knew that the leadership role down there was bad.  So, I got more involved in that, and found that I was named to the presidential commission [Brown v. Board of Education 50th Anniversary Commission], which gave me a little more clout, and I began to speak to far more people.  And so, it just evolved from there.

Speaker 2: My father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] died in 1974, my mother [Mattie Belton De Laine] died in December, 1999.
Speaker 1: What would you like your legacy to be, and the legacy of your father and family to be?
Speaker 2: Let me start with my mother, and we've discussed this, and I don't know how it's going to be handled, and I don't know what the legacy is going to be, and I think it's going to be forgotten.  But, there's an old saying---I'm a bachelor, but there's this old saying: behind every good man is a good woman.  And, I'd like to expound on that a little further when we come back.

Speaker 1: You mentioned your mother, Mattie Belton De Laine.  Did she have several siblings?
Speaker 2: Yes, she had seven brothers, she was an only girl.
Speaker 1: Do you remember their names?
Speaker 2: Yes, her oldest brother was James D. Belton [James Belton], B-E-L-T-O-N, who resided most of his life in New York City [New York, New York]; Eugene Belton, who resided most of his life in Kinston, North Carolina; David Belton [David G. Belton, Jr.], who resided in South Carolina, and was a county farm demonstration agent there; Joseph C. Belton [Joseph Belton], who was a school principal here in Charlotte, North Carolina and lived next door; Moses Belton, who was a minister and also a staff administrator at Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] for many years; Willis Belton, the youngest brother, was a veteran of World War II [WWII], and somewhat shell shocked, and did nothing in life, probably because of that, and he was the earliest to die, of all.
Speaker 1: And your fa- (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think that covers the seven.
Story_ID: 551900
Speaker 1: Did your father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] have several siblings?
Speaker 2: My father had twelve full sisters and brothers, and two half-sisters and brothers--sister and brother.  The oldest child was Sarah [Sarah De Laine], who was a half-sister, who had a very traumatic life.  Her husband was murdered, through racial problems.  They were a very comfortable, well off family for Negroes of that time in Hartsville, South Carolina.  I have tried to find details on their situation.  I haven't gotten them, but I know it was connected with the Coca [ph.] family that controls Conoco gasoline [Continental Oil Company; ConocoPhillips].  But, she had a mental breakdown behind all of this.  This is in the early 1900s, and as a consequence, her children were reared by my grandfather [Henry De Laine, Sr.], and by the husband's family.  So, I have very little knowledge of them.  The--next, was a brother, who died during his infancy, I think he was about one or two years old.  My father's--my grandfather's marriage, there were thirteen children.  My father was the seventh of the thirteen.  The oldest was Henry Charles, Jr. [Henry De Laine, Jr.], who lived in Clayton, North Carolina and was a farmer in that area.  The next child was Robert De Laine, who was a brick mason by trade and lived in a number of places, but settled in Manning, South Carolina.  Moses De Laine, a rebel, who, because of some racial incidents in the South, lived most of his life in Superior, Wisconsin, and finally retired in Charlotte--in Clayton, North Carolina.  Leo De Laine, a farmer and a non-achiever, that lived in South Carolina most of his life; a sister, Rowena De Laine Oliver, who lived in Wilmington, North Carolina, until widowed, and returned to South Carolina after that, and spent her remaining days in South Carolina. In Clarendon County [South Carolina] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Rowena, spell that please?
Speaker 2: R-O-W-E-N-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Arlonial, A-R-L-O-N-I-A-L, De Laine Potter, P-O-T-T-E-R [Arlonial De Laine], lived primarily in New York City [New York, New York] and Detroit [Michigan], and in Detroit until her death.  Carrie Martin [Carrie De Laine Martin] C-A-R-R-I-E, a sister, who, during her married life, lived in Detroit.  That was her second marriage, and I won't go into the first marriage.  She put her first husband through medical school, only to find out there was another sweetheart, so that was a heartbreaking failure.  Louis De Laine, a brother [sic.], next to my father, who had a--I think it was cerebral palsy at an early age, and was somewhat handicapped but lived a productive life as a farmer in Clarendon County, South Carolina; twin sisters, Mamie Spearman [sic. Mamie De Laine Taylor], M-A-M-Y-E, [sic.] Spearman, S-P-E-A-R-M-A-N, and Mattye, M-A-T-T-Y-E Taylor [sic. Mattye De Laine Spearman].  Mamye Spearman lived in Lenoir, North Carolina and taught school in that area.  Mattye Spearman, the other twin, lived in Detroit, Michigan, and I believe she was just a housewife during her productive years.  A sister, Margrett Gordon [Margrett De Laine Gordon], who spent most of her life in Detroit, was a mortician, and a brother, Leroy, the youngest, Leroy De Laine who lived in Buffalo, New York, and he ran a grocery store, a mom and pop grocery store, there for most of his life.

Speaker 1: Let's talk about legacy of the family.  Your mother [Mattie Belton De Laine]?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I feel that my mother should really be recognized very prominently in that legacy, and I think that she will not be.  She was a very quiet, unassuming kind of person, but my father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] did nothing without consulting her.  And, it was her wishes that were carried out.  So, when we talk about the success that he has, that success would not have been there without her.  I firmly feel that way about it.  As far as my father's legacy, I'm delighted to see that here in later years, some recognition is given to him for the role that he played.  Unfortunately, he did not see this when he was alive.  And, it was almost like being thoroughly ignored by certain aspects of those who could record that.  Even at his death, the church played absolutely no role in the recognition of any contribution that he made.
Story_ID: 551902
Speaker 1: He [De Laine's father, Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] should be remembered as?
Speaker 2: He should be remembered as a person of leadership ability and a person who affected some change.  Now, we sit and we look today at quote, unquote leaders and I realize that most of the leaders that we idealize have been made leaders by the press.  But, everyone forgets about what happened before the '60s [1960s] and the sit-ins.  And, we look at the Civil Rights Movement as being the thing that caused all of this.  It's not.  If it were not for a change in the laws that existed to give some validity to the sit-ins, it wouldn't have happened.  And, the leaders, or the efforts that transpired before those sit-ins, have not been glamorized, so nobody knows anything about them.  And, nobody's going back to look, and that, I find regrettable, not just for my father, but for all of those who've contributed and shared into that process.
Story_ID: 551903
Speaker 1: Now, as far as my legacy, I don't care if I'm forgotten tomorrow.  As long as I feel within my heart that I have done something to contribute to the welfare of this society, and I feel that I have done my part, maybe not as much as some people would like to see me do, but in the giving of myself, the participation and projects--I feel that I've been involved in enough to say that I have contributed.
Story_ID: 551904
Speaker 1: The presidential commission [Brown v. Board of Education 50th Anniversary Commission]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --was important.
Speaker 2: The presidential commission was important.  The presidential commission, I feel, was an underfunded thing by the federal government, but it did allow for some benefit.  I feel that for my role, it has helped me spread the word on the significance of Brown- of Briggs v. Elliott in that movement.  It has also allowed me to establish some contacts that I would not have established before, that can help me with other efforts.  For instance, with the Clarendon County [South Carolina] involvement that I have today, that's a benefit.  I'm sure that if I had not been involved in that commission, I may not have been elected to this international African American museum board.  My involvement at the Levine Museum [Levine Museum of the New South, Charlotte, North Carolina] here, and I don't know if you've gotten into any of that, with the 'COURAGE' exhibit ['COURAGE: The Vision to End Segregation, the Guts to Fight for It'], but the 'COURAGE' exhibit is something that they developed as a story of my father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.], which won them the highest award given to a museum in the United States, for the year 2004, and, it was presented by the White House to the museum.  It has also provided them with a half million dollar donation to make that exhibit a permanent exhibit in Charlotte [North Carolina], for years to come.  The exhibit right now, excerpts from that exhibit, have been in South Africa now for almost two years, and it has been shown at the Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg [South Africa].  It is right now in the process of closing in Cape Town [South Africa], and it's going to open in Durban [South Africa], in January.  And, all of this came out of this little unknown museum here in Charlotte.

Speaker 1: So, you feel your family has made significant contribution (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.  And, I think there's not only significant contribution in the light of what my father [Joseph A. De Laine, Sr.] did, but I think that with each one of us, we have made individual contributions in a number of areas, and that probably has resulted--it has been a result because of the kinds of teaching that we had.  For instance, after the Vietnamese war [Vietnam War], I sponsored Vietnamese families in this country, and took some in my home until they could get adjusted.  In 1980, my friend [Cecil Dennis], my closest friend, who was the foreign minister for the Republic of Liberia, was jailed in a coup and murdered.  I got his family here, and I'm still until this day, in contact with his wife and their children, in terms of their welfare.  They're doing all right now, but I still keep in contact with them.  These are some of the kinds of things in lending a hand outside of the norm, to help people, that I think each of us, in some way or the other, are involved with, which you know you don't see on the surface.

Speaker 1: This is a photograph of me, Joseph A. De Laine, and a friend, taken in Tokyo [Japan] while on rest and recuperation from the Korean war zone.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: This is a photograph of the governor of South Carolina, Jim Hodges, with my brother, Brumit De Laine, and myself, Joseph A. De Laine, taken about 2004 at the state house [South Carolina State House] in Columbia, South Carolina.

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a photograph of me, Joseph A. De Laine, with Agnes Cooper Dennis, who was the widow of my closest friend, and college roommate.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Cecil Dennis, and he was the foreign minister for the Republic of Liberia, and executed in a government overthrow, or government coup, in 1980.

Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is a photograph of Joseph A. De Laine, taken in Tokyo on rest and recuperation while serving in the U.S. Army in Korea.  It was taken about 1955.
Speaker 2: Okay, tell us about that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) This is a photograph of me, Joseph A. De Laine, Jr.  I was a toddler, I have no idea of the age, but I would say that it was taken probably in 1933.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCISSION)
Speaker 1: Oh, are you ready?  This is a photograph of my mother and my grandmother.  My mother is Mattie B. De Laine, and my grandmother is Josephine Weldon Belton.  The other three ladies in the background, I don't know who they are, but I believe they are relatives.  That photograph was taken around 1931, shortly after--sometime right after my parents' marriage, I believe.
Speaker 2: Can you point out your mother and grandmother?
Speaker 1: My mother, Mattie De Laine, on the right.  In the black, my grandmother, Josephine Weldon Belton.
