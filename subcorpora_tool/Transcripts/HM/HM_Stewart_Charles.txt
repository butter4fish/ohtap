Speaker 2: A real nice neighborhood.  This is where my father met these Patterson [ph.] and Parker [ph.] these two electricians and then he went and worked with them.  And then he start doing doorbells and things of that sort.
Speaker 1: Now this is your stepfather, Sam Taylor, Taylor, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Tell us about him.  Now where was he from?
Speaker 2: Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And he met your mother [Mary Annie Knox] in Nebraska?
Speaker 2: No, he met my mother in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So she moved to Chicago by herself at first and then she met him?
Speaker 2: I suppose.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And so what kind of person was, was Sam Taylor?
Speaker 2: He was a good father.   He was a, a good father.  That's the best I can say for him.  We went hunting together.  He bought me my first Winchester, brought my brother-in-law one too.  And so then we used to go to Lake Ivanhoe, Wisconsin and to Michigan (unclear) everywhere to hunt and whatnot.  And whenever he had the time, 'cause he went to work for Blue Star Auto.
Speaker 1: Right that's the, was it, was it still on State Street right where it is (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was still on State.
Speaker 1: Same place.
Speaker 2: 21st [Street] and State, 20th [Street] and State, across from Warshawsky [Company, Chicago, Illinois].  So whenever he had the time he would always take off on Saturday and Sunday and we'd go hunting.
Speaker 1: So you went hunting a lot then?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, then back when I was 12, 13, 14, 15.  And then if I got busy after that, then I didn't go hunting.  I--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you go to school in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, where did you go here?
Speaker 2: I went to, I'll think of it about midnight tonight and I'll call you.

Speaker 2: That's right, just to hunt.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, okay.  So hunting plays a big part in what you're doing on both sides, I guess, in Chicago [Illinois] and in Omaha.
Story_ID: 252927
Speaker 1: What were race relations like in Omaha [Nebraska] first and then, then in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Being a kid we really didn't experience too much racial differences there.  The white people lived up over the hill and they come down to the school, we lived down below the hill and we went up to school.  They had maypole dances and things of that sort at different schools and the kids from Howard Kennedy [School, Omaha, Nebraska] or whatnot would go over to, to these different schools and dance with the white girls as well as the black girls.  Nobody thought anything about it or said anything about it, so we didn't, we didn't (unclear) face too much racial differences there in school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how many, I mean, how many black folks, I, I, I don't want an exact number, but what's your impression of the number of black people in Omaha in those days, were there a lot of black people there or just a few or what?
Speaker 2: There were quite a few, quite a few black people there.  Let's say from Cummings Street all the way through about 3000 South and from about the 12th Street all the way to about 30th Street, east and west.  That was the territory that most of 'em were in in North Omaha.  In South Omaha there were twice that many people because the packing houses were in South Omaha and they didn't wanna go that far--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to the jobs, you know.
Story_ID: 252928
Speaker 1: Did you ever hear about lynching when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Not in Omaha [Nebraska], though they did have this race riot in 1919.  But I was there, I, in fact (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, what--you know, tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, the police separated them and the whites were on the, one side of the street and the blacks were on the other and they were calling people different names, throwing lots of, brooks, brick, bricks and bottles and whatnot across the street every now and then but that was about the extent of that one that I know of.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it wasn't any wholesale destruction--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --there were no fires or anything?
Speaker 2: Well it was, it started off when they pulled a fellow off of the streetcar that was supposed to be coming from South Omaha to North Omaha on the streetcar.  And then there was a big fight on the streetcar for this fellow's life.  I don't know whether they conquered him or not, you know, but that was the end of that that that I know of.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well why was he pulled off the streetcar, was, was he sitting in the wrong place or something (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, this was when, in the beginning of the riot that because all of these people that we had on, on 11th Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But that's not, I mean what, do, do you, do you have any idea of what started the riot?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) okay.  All right.  That's just one of the incidents?
Speaker 2: That was all.  We were just as onlookers that's all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in Chicago [Illinois], now you got to Chicago in 1920?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And that's the year after the Chicago riot?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, so you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And so the riot was about the same time there as it was here.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And I just heard about this one but didn't know nothing about it, just heard about it.

Speaker 1: In the neighborhood you lived in the, did you ever go to the Abraham Lincoln Centre [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know what I'm talking about on--
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Oakwood, okay.
Speaker 2: On Oakwood Boulevard and Champlain [sic. Langley Avenue].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I never went.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was that a place that a lot of black people went for--
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.  Everybody was there proclaiming [President Abraham] Lincoln to be great, you know, for the black people.  They hadn't read on page ninety-six that Lincoln says that if he could free the, if he could free the country without freeing the slaves, this he would do.
Speaker 1: Yes, that's true but most people, people, never heard of that right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's a, that, that point.  So do, do, do you remember the Chicago Defender in those days?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --I sold the Chicago Defender.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were some of the other papers out then?
Speaker 2: The [Chicago] Bee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's all I know about then.  The [Chicago] Citizen wasn't ready then.  Yeah, N'DIGO wasn't, well she [HistoryMaker Hermene Hartman] hadn't grown up yet then.
Speaker 1: She hadn't been born yet at that point, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right she hadn't been born yet.
Story_ID: 252930
Speaker 1: So what was, how, can, can you describe what Chicago [Illinois] looked like in those days as opposed to what it looks like now?  I mean, you know, most, most kids who, who are, are gonna watch this video or see it they're gon' wonder like, you know, what, what's the difference between, you know, Chicago now and what it was like when you got here in 1920.
Speaker 2: Well the kids at that time well they were trying to be little gangsters like Al Capone and his bunch, and whatnot.  But it didn't, didn't work out to well because I think the fellows was buying guns and whatnot and carrying guns and getting put in jail.  So then that stopped that so they just started going to nightclubs and night places to have a good time like the Regal Theater [Chicago, Illinois] in the dance hall upstairs, the Warwick Hall [Chicago, Illinois], the one [The Forum, Chicago, Illinois] on 43rd [Street] and Calumet [Avenue], I can't think of the name of it now.  And this is when I was telling you about that, they put me to work at, at 15th [Street] and Wabash [Avenue].  That's, that's about it.
Story_ID: 252931
Speaker 1: Now did you like music?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I studied the piano for twenty years and I know just as much about it now as I did then when I, when I started.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you start when you were young?  Did you start when you were--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother [Mary Annie Knox] started me with the violin.  Well I could squeak it and squeak that's about all.
Speaker 1: Did you like playing the violin?
Speaker 2: I liked trying but every now and then it didn't, it just didn't work out, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So you, did you start playing the piano around the same time or--
Speaker 2: Oh, I, well way before that I started going to piano.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you start in, in [Omaha] Nebraska playing the piano?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 252932
Speaker 1: Now was, was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: No.  We all went to the Catholic church in Omaha [Nebraska], and I think we went there about 10 or 12 times that I can remember.  My mother [Mary Annie Knox] (unclear) at that time the women had to wear something on their heads, you know, they couldn't go in Catholic Church without it, so my mother would slap something on her head and take us down and forty-five minutes we were back home--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and whatnot.  And so I liked the Catholic religion but then, you know, it just didn't faze me after a certain length of time.  I (unclear) the priest was going to send to the Pope to get me married in the church but it didn't work out so I forgot about the church.  So it was just here lately I went back to the church, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And since I gotta have some kind of vehicle to get into heaven so it might as well be what I know about and that's the Catholic religion.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So where do you go now?
Speaker 2: St. Anselm's [St. Anselm Catholic Church, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 61st [Street] and Michigan Avenue.
Speaker 1: Right, right--
Story_ID: 252933
Speaker 1: Now what school did you go to here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I went to Dore [Elementary] School [Chicago, Illinois] at Halsted [Streeet] and Harrison [Street].
Speaker 1: What, what was the name of it?
Speaker 2: Dore--
Speaker 1: Dore?
Speaker 2: School, um-hm.
Speaker 1: D, D-O-O--
Speaker 2: D-O-R-E.
Speaker 1: D-O-R-E, okay.
Speaker 2: Dore School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Halsted and Harrison.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: They transferred me to Wendell Phillips [High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then Phillips High School.
Story_ID: 252934
Speaker 1: Are there any teachers in high school [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] that you remember as being outstanding or, or that were good role models for you?
Speaker 2: There was an electrician there that I, I got acquainted with but I can't remember his name now.  Plus I think he's been dead quite a little while now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: Did he teach you some, in any--
Speaker 2: I got some insights from what he was teaching by going down and talking with him and whatnot.  But it, this wasn't too many times, five or six times.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But did, did they actually teach electricity, I mean elect--
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hum, they taught electricity in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  In those days were, was Chicago [Illinois] actually wired up, was it completely wired up yet?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was completely wired up 'cause most all of the buildings, all (unclear) what, 15 and 13, 15, 17, 25, foot high but they were all wired with electricity and the, they had that great big electric boards in the basement and whatnot, the great big switches and whatnot, so.
Speaker 1: Now did, did were, were most of the, the homes wired for electricity when you were a kid?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They were wired but they were just wired for light alone not for appliances of any kind.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were, I know radios didn't, weren't invented until 1920, I didn't, didn't then, well there was no radio station until 1920 or so, but do you remember radios when you were growing up, you know, at all?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had one radio, I don't remember whether that was Zenith or what but it had a, a little pick on it with a crystal on it.  You had to pick this stick at the station that you wanted out of it.  And soon we got rid of that because they come out with another one that they said that it was gonna be a new type of, of television and, and, and everything else, that all you had to do was plug into this little plug (laughter) and that little plug wasn't nothing.  You couldn't plug it in, get anything out of it.
Story_ID: 252935
Speaker 1: So you went to [Wendell] Phillips [High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] for--
Speaker 2: About a year.
Speaker 1: About a year.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I went to Greer College [Chicago, Illinois] because of the job.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now why, now why did you go to Greer College again?
Speaker 2: Well, Sam Taylor had a license, city license and so he was pulling permits for Greer, whatever was needed, at the time.  So he was working there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you didn't have to finish--
Speaker 2: I should have--
Speaker 1: --high school?
Speaker 2: --but I didn't.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, Greer was, it's like a, it's a trade school basically?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, so, how long were, were you at Greer?
Speaker 2: About two and a half years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so I guess it, until you're about seventeen?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So by, by age of seventeen did, did, did they have, did you have a certificate for, for a, for a skill or something at that point?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So what did you study in Greer?
Speaker 2: Nothing but electricity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Wiring and how to cut the joists and whatnot, how to get a line over when it seems like there was no other way to get it--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --over and whatnot.  And how to connect that with how many volts can be on the line and how many amps can be on a circuit and so on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well how many other black students were in school with you?
Speaker 2: One, named Hamilton [ph.].  Hamilton is now dead, he used to have a shop right here at 71st [Street] and St. Lawrence [Avenue].  He owned the building there and a couple of buildings across the street.
Story_ID: 252936
Speaker 1: While you were in trade school [Greer College, Chicago, Illinois] were, were you working too with your stepfather [Sam Taylor]?
Speaker 2: Every now and then, yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So did, did, did you have to do anything else for a living other than doing electrical work?
Speaker 2: No, that's all I ever done for a living.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: So you didn't have to shine shoes or any of that kind of stuff (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't have to but I started out, I'm greedy and I like money so naturally I shined shoes and but I couldn't shine shoes and get money.  I sold papers, newspapers.  I did anything that would make you some money.
Story_ID: 252937
Speaker 1: There were only two, two black students at Greer [College, Chicago, Illinois], did you have to do anything special to get accepted to Greer?
Speaker 2: Nothing special.  All they had to do is, the group had to accept you that's all.  So what happens is, is that I'm wiring around Greer and whatnot and so then I'm going to a class and one of the instructors would ask me a question about it and whatnot and so they just from that, each time I'd go there, again his name is Johnny [ph.] and your name is Harry [ph.] and her name is Willie [ph.] so, they accept people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so you kind of, well you sort of learned the school by helping your, your father [stepfather, Sam Taylor] with a job there?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: That's what you're saying.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  So did they ever reject you, I mean did you, did they accept, accept you from the beginning?
Speaker 2: No.  Well when I first went in there they, you know, everybody would just about turn their backs on you.  In other words they wouldn't run you out of there or anything like that but then you, the instructor didn't ask you any questions, you were just there that's all.  So when you went off from there you were in bad a shape as you were when you went.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the instructors tried to ignore you?
Speaker 2: They ignored you too, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so what did you do when, well were there any teachers there that took an interest in you?
Speaker 2: Yes, one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who, who was he?
Speaker 2: I can't remember his name now, um-hm.  But he had a Packard car and he wanted to sell it and so I asked him about it and so he, he thought about it and whatnot.  So he was one of the ones that knew about Oklahoma because he had been there, you know, the time it happened.
Speaker 1: Oh, about the, the riot in Oklahoma (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The riot, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we just started talking, you know, and so he, then he started showing an interest in me by asking me questions about where would I put the switch, how would I put it in and what and, of course, I'd demonstrate what I would do.  Sometimes I'd do it on the model they had there, sometimes on paper.
Speaker 1: So he knew that you had aptitude for it (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: To be an electrician.  And so he was the one that helped you get in, in school and get (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes and no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Explain (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, its self-explanatory what happens is, is that I'm just there and so after we started talking about the car, and whatnot then he started asking me questions about what would I do, knowing that I wanted to be an electrician too 'cause we had talked about that even when we were talking about the car and so then he just worked me right in, that's all.  So, yeah, let's say he was an instrument in getting me in.
Story_ID: 252938
Speaker 1: Now is it tough to be an electrician?
Speaker 2: I don't know if it's tough or not because the to, to me it was just a job and I had one of those attitudes that whatever I'm doing make myself satisfied or either change and that's the way I did it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there, is there, what, what's the hardest thing about being an electrician?  I mean when, when you were learning how to be an electrician what, what, what was the toughest thing about it?
Speaker 2: I didn't find anything, with climbing the poles was music to my ears, I could run up a pole and then I was 200 pounds and hang on the side and disconnect it, connect the line and whatnot.  But the hardest thing to do to, to do as an electrician is to keep your hands off of hot lines, that is a necessity, don't do that.
Speaker 1: And I know that my grandmother was born in 1901 and she was, until she died, she was afraid to touch most appliances and I guess she, as if they, you know, she didn't want me to touch the television antenna 'cause she thought that would shock me (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Going to shock you.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Right.  But I think a lot of older people were afraid of electricity and they, do you have any stories about that or do you, do you understand what I'm talking about?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Static electricity, a brand new rug and a switch on the wall that is not grounded can give you a shock that you feel like it's trying to kill you.  And it, that you, a lot of people have gotten rid of an electrician because they thought that he rewired it, he wired the joint wrong, he wired the apartment wrong.  So but a lot of times they just didn't know that there's static between that switching that switch on and off and they scuffle across the rug would shock you but it, it still do that right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it has to be the, the sockets gotta be--
Speaker 2: Grounded.
Speaker 1: --grounded?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Right.  But people didn't know to do that in those day as much?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They didn't know to do that.
Speaker 1: So a lot of people weren't--
Speaker 2: It called for a ground but then a lot of people didn't, didn't ground it.
Speaker 1: So if you didn't know what you were doing and you wired a, a socket somebody could really could get knock down by walking across a rug?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, um-hum.  I did a few dances myself when they'd send me out and they said that when they touched the faucet they got a shock.  They had switched polarities on it and the system wasn't grounded and so you would have to find that and then ground it to be sure that you didn't get that shock.
Story_ID: 252939
Speaker 1: Were there were very many black electricians when you started out?
Speaker 2: No, there was about fifty that I knew of.  And when I say I knew of it was all of these electricians on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] and some on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] we were trying to get together to get into the local and to do so, they had, had to get together.  So we all got together and met at different places, first we met at the musicians' hall on State Street.  Then we went to Samuels [ph.] shop at 46th [Street] and State Street.  Then we went to the church building on 51st [Street] and [Martin Luther] King Drive which was South Parkway at that time.  And we'd meet at different places and whatnot.  And, of course, electricians were about fifty, something like that.  And all of 'em didn't have steady jobs, they just had, whenever they could come across a job like that or like would give them some revenue, then they needed that for house rent and whatnot, and, you know, house rent wasn't near what it is today.  So they kept the money but we met just the same, would then take up a collection and whatnot.  In the collection we had the one leader, Ed Lauter [ph.].  Fellows that said they could lead but we had one leader who was Herman Washington.  And he went to bat with Local 134 [of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers].  And he went directly through Mike Boyle [Michael "Umbrella Mike" Boyle] who assigned Bobby Brooks [Robert P. Brooks, Jr.] as the go-between, between him and Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: At that time the war [World War II, WWII] was starting and whatnot and, and the government was demanding 3 point something percent of blacks on these jobs.  And so Mike Boyle and whatnot would figure out where to send them and, of course, Washington had built up a crew and I was a foreman.  And there were four to five of us and we went to the Buick [Motor Division] plant, the Ford [Motor Company, Torrence Avenue Assembly] Plant, Chrysler [Motor Corporation] plant.  We went downtown to two or three big buildings and whatnot.  And this man takes me in this building that I'm calling at 15th [Street] and Wabash [Avenue], down there.
Story_ID: 252940
Speaker 1: Let, let me go back to, there, there's a story around, around when you were studying to be an electrician and, and about trying to get the books, it was hard to get the books, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well Dad [Stewart's stepfather, Sam Taylor] was trying to get these books from, we saw the, the advertisement in the magazine and we were looking at Atlas in the magazine--
Speaker 1: Charles Atlas (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Charles Atlas the strongman.  And, of course, though that's when he seen this ad learn electricity, go to so and so electric companies and whatnot.  And so the course would cost so much and so much and so Dad wrote for the books and whatnot but the, I guess, the name Sam Taylor emphasized that he was black and so as a result they didn't, he heard nothing from it.  So he was telling Mike Rickerts [ph.] who was owner of a shoe shine parlor at Harrison [Street] and Halsted Street [Chicago, Illinois] but that he was trying to get these books and he couldn't get 'em and so Mike said to him well I'll get those books for you.  And so he advertised--he used his name and got the books sent to our address which was at 510 West Van Buren [Street] and so that's the way we got the books.  And, of course, when Dad learned it was the thing to do is study these books then when you finish the first course, seconds and up to the tenth, then you sent these books back in that rotation, first, second, and third and so on to the company and they would verify if you made it or not (unclear).  Worked out pretty good, I guess, because the, I never worried about whether it got a diploma or, or an award or anything for finishing the course, you know.  So, after a certain length of time I just went on off about my business and forgot about it 'cause I was doing all right without it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is, you were studying these books before you went to Greer [College, Chicago, Illinois] or afterwards?
Speaker 2: This was before.
Speaker 1: Before.  All right.  That's what I thought, okay.  So you got these before you went to Greer?
Speaker 2: Oh much (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: --earlier.
Speaker 1: So you were, when you were doing, helping your father with the work at Greer--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you had, it was based on the knowledge that you gained from these books--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and, and working with him, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Now, when you graduated from, from, well, well, when you finished Greer or when you left Greer--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Now did you graduate, did they give you a (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I didn't graduate, I should have graduated 'cause Hamilton [ph.] did, they gave him a diploma but I left it earlier because of the work that I had to do.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And when you were studying these books before you went to Greer, that was like when you were early teenager right, I guess?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: So about fourteen, fifteen?
Speaker 1: Fifteen.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 252941
Speaker 1: So when you, when you came out of Greer [College, Chicago, Illinois] and you were just telling us about before--with the break, we were talking about how you all made a move to get involved in [Local] 134 [of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers] but, now let me take you back further than that and, and tell us about the idea to form a black union, how did that idea come, come about and how did, I think you told me off-camera that Oscar [Stanton] De Priest had something to do with that or something?
Speaker 2: Well, first we were trying to get into Local 134 and we could never make it in.  So as a, I moved that thing.  I'm sorry about that.
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's all right.
Speaker 2: Is that thing all right?
Speaker 1: Is it okay?  It's (unclear).  Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I'm trying to gather my thoughts together to come up to the 9632 [sic. charter #9362], whatnot that we got from Oscar De Priest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were about fifty of us electricians and we were trying to get into the local and nobody could make it into the local so Washington, Herman Washington, just graduated from Tuskegee [Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], and so he come to Chicago [Illinois].  And then he started to work with the group to get them together and as I say it was about fifty of us and we'd meet at different places and whatnot trying to establish a bulkhead, I guess, that would get you into the local.
Speaker 1: Now why was it important to be in the union?  I know it's a, it's a obvious question but some people may not know that's important.  Why, why, why is it so important to get in the union?
Speaker 2: Well, the union was the ruler of every trade in Chicago.  And if you didn't belong to the local and whatnot, these different people would come out and maybe disrupt your job, hurt you, shoot you, cut you, beat your pipe, and break your wires and all that kind of stuff and whatnot.  And so to keep from having to run from anybody you wanted everything that you needed to work with to make a living in this city, and that was the reason you, of going to Local 134 'cause there was no other local--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at that time.
Speaker 1: Well that put black people, black electricians at a, at a kind of in the, right in the middle right?  'Cause you couldn't, they didn't want you to work without being in the union, and they didn't want you to be in the union, right?
Speaker 2: That's right, um-hm.  So then since they were breaking our pipes and beating the wires and things of this sort, we got together and, and Washington says we need a lawyer.  The lawyer, I forget who he was now, but he got us in touch with the (unclear) congressman.  Congressman got the permit for us to work without being molested in Chicago.  So then--
Speaker 1: So this is kind of, this is Oscar De Priest, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The black Congressman?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: The, the only black congressman in [U.S.] Congress.
Speaker 2: He was in Congress at the time, that's right.  And he got the permit to go for us to work without being molested.  Then Local 134 only became interested in us to the point of getting this 9632 because any person, anybody could come along and take this and make a union out of it which would be against Local 134 because they'd have permission to work just the same.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when you, when you all received the, the permit it had the potential for you to form your own separate union, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: It gave you the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the capacity to form your own union?
Speaker 2: That is it exactly.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: That was the purpose of it, um-hm.  So then that's when the Local, Local 134 got interested in it because they didn't want any competition in the city and 9632 was that competition.
Story_ID: 252942
Speaker 1: Did you ever finish a job where the union [Local 134 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers] came and destroyed your work after (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I won't say the union, I'll just say that they, these white fellows come and destroyed the work.  You know, many a time you'd try and finish the job in that same day in order to get your money or otherwise they'd be--that next day when you get there they have hammered the wires in the pipe, beat the pipe tight together and filled it with sand, anything.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So these weren't necessarily the union members but these could be any white--
Speaker 2: Right, that's right.
Speaker 1: --men that didn't want you all to do that work (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Didn't want us to do the job.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's all I can say about it.
Story_ID: 252943
Speaker 1: How long did it take to get your permit, you know, from the congressman [Oscar Stanton De Priest], did that take years or did it take, did, did it happen fast or how long did it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it taken years.  It, it first come along and we got the permits to work with Local 134 [of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers].  Then in 1943, is when we were accepted as union members in the local.  All the other times we were just, I can't put the word to it now.
Speaker 1: But you, you were, you had a permit to legally do the work but you weren't union members, so.
Speaker 2: We weren't Local 134 members.  We were--
Speaker 1: You had your own black--
Speaker 2: We were just of that 9632 [sic. charter #9362].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did 9632 have a, a pension fund or anything or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Nothing.
Speaker 1: Nothing.
Speaker 2: No, it was just in its infancy.  And so from it we were supposed to work up whatever was necessary to take care of, of, of the members.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So in 1942, I think we wrote this down in '42 [1942] you all got the permit, right and in '43 [1943] they put, they, they accepted you into 134 is that, is that how it happened?
Speaker 2: No, we got the permit before that.  We got the 9632 way before that.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  What happens is, is that they made us, let's say an apprentice to the local and this is the best I can describe it.  So then this goes on because we're doing these jobs and, and the war [World War II, WWII] is coming on as I was saying before and whatnot and so they're building plants and, and, of course, these plants don't go up in a day.  So with Mike Boyle [Michael "Umbrella Mike" Boyle], Bobby Brooks [Robert P. Brooks, Jr.], Herman Washington, we were able to work because he would send us on different jobs around the--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was Mike Boyle's position?
Speaker 2: He was business agent of Local 134.
Story_ID: 252944
Speaker 1: Do you remember like what, the day that you all were, were, I mean, you know, when you found out, where were you when you found out that you all were, could be union members, a, a full union membership?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  All I know is that we were all called to the hall, and when we say to the hall we, wherever we were meeting at was the hall, 'cause as I said before, we had the musicians' hall down at State Street, Samuelson's [ph.] store on, on 46th [Street] and State Street, and the musicians', well no, the church building over at 51st [Street] and [Martin Luther] King Drive or where, wherever we were at, we were all called in and we were issued a piece of paper or a card and the card had three months, six months, nine months on it that you paid your dues and you were some kind of member of, of Local 134 [of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now in your opinion would it, well could you have, the, the black, now you really didn't have a black union then, right, then, I mean, you had like a--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --you had a permit [charter #9362] (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We just had a black group that was all--
Speaker 1: Group, okay.
Speaker 2: --was trying to be electricians.
Speaker 1: All right.  So--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --all right.  So, it wasn't really a full-fledged union as such, I mean not a--
Speaker 2: No, we were trying to get in the union.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But you got a permit, yeah.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: So it was legal for you to operate but you weren't in the union?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So when they let you in, how did things change when they let you in?
Speaker 2: Well then they stopped breaking our pipes and, and beating our wires and things like that.
Story_ID: 252945
Speaker 1: Did you make more money?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because you could get more jobs and more people catered to nonunion electricians because or let's say to one of us because we were cheaper any way.  We were cheaper because, we didn't have an established price as to how much to charge for an outlet or a ceiling outlet or a switch on the wall, plug on the wall.  So, then after (unclear) told 'em how much they would, all that you're supposed to be, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have better benefit, I mean did you have benefits in the Union?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, they, there were benefits then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were most of the black electricians satisfied that they got in the union [Local 134 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers], I guess, right?
Speaker 2: They weren't satisfied.  A lot of 'em didn't make it until we got the card in 1943.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Some of 'em went on about their business, some of 'em died and whatnot, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we're talking about, I guess, about now, a good maybe fifteen years that you were an electrician without, before you got in the union I guess (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Something like that, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 252946
Speaker 1: What were some of the places that you've worked on, you know, what, what were some of the projects that you've worked at?
Speaker 2: I worked at 87th [Street] and the [Dan] Ryan [Expressway] at the Jewel Store [Jewel-Osco Grand Bazaar, Chicago, Illinois] and whatnot, turnstile next door.
Speaker 1: Was that, that Grand Bazaar?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So you, you wired that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was the foreman on two floors of Goldblatt Building [Goldblatts department store] at 333 North State Street.  I, I can't think of the big real estate man on Monroe [Street], I was sent over to his office, Mr. Horowitz [ph.] who had all of the restaurants and whatnot, I rewired carts and things for him there.  I worked at Chris-Craft Boat[s], rode the boats, rode the outboard center (unclear)
Speaker 1: Oh, so Sam, they, are they related to Sam Rhody [ph.], the alderman, (unclear).
Speaker 2: No, not the alderman.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous) not that Rhody.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is John P. Rhody [ph.] then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Bob Rhody [ph.], Bill Rhody [ph.], Jack Rhody, these are, and back in their, their day a little tow truck could pick up a car without permission from the police to do so on the street because Rhody had most all of the towing.
Speaker 1: That sound like the same Rhoadys [ph.] (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Fred Rhoady [ph.], that's not, it's not--
Speaker 2: No, no Fred (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They're not related to Fred Rhoady?
Speaker 2: They weren't no relation to--
Story_ID: 252947
Speaker 1: In the early days you did some electrical work for Al Capone that's what I heard?
Speaker 2: Well this is mostly lights and bells and things of this sort.  I worked 22nd Street, 21st Street, Red Sullivan [ph.], Denny Cooney.  We did the Colosimo's Restaurant at 2126 South Wabash [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Jim Colosimo.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was the, that was the Colosimo's that I was talking about the, where they sent me and the fellow said he didn't work with (unclear).  That's 15th and Colosimo.  And so we did all those little hotels, we were on there and whatnot.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any interesting stories from being, being an, an electrician at a place like run, run by Al Capone or--
Speaker 2: No, we worked in the, that hotel, those, 24th [Street] and Michigan Avenue, it's tore down now and to--this was when he had 22nd and Michigan.  That's about all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I, I heard now, one of your relatives told me that you wired the trap door in the [Lexington] Hotel [Chicago, Illinois] over there on 22nd, 2nd and Michigan that Al Capone stayed in, that you did something, you, you had something to do with wiring some of his secret routes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, like I say this was mostly bells and stuff like that.  I had put a doorbell button underneath the foot of a chair that a fellow named Sikey [ph.] sat in this chair and if the police pulled him up out of the chair and it rang a bell upstairs in the hotel or the building that the women who were in the red light district know to move to another place and whatnot.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the bell was under his foot or something?
Speaker 2: Under the foot of the chair.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The chair just like I'm sitting in.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  So if the police--
Speaker 2: Now he would lean back like this in the chair--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --when, if he come down on that bell, the bell starts to ring.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just like sending a switch on, of, of a light, you know.  So, that's what.  And then, then what I did for Red Sullivan, the people who were too anxious to see the women and whatnot, we had to put the girls outside so that they collected the money before they got in where the girls were and, of course, that's been many, many years ago.
Story_ID: 252948
Speaker 1: Now you knew the Jones Brothers [Ed Jones and George Jones] too, right?  And you did some work for them?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did most all of their buildings.  Oh, well almost anything that the Jones' owned or built I was the electrician for it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were the electrician for Harold's Chicken [Shack, Chicago, Illinois] (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, um-hm.  We did three or four stores for Harold [Pierce] and then serviced the, the chicken shacks after they're sold, you know.
Speaker 1: Now one big project I heard you worked on was River Oaks Shopping Center [Calumet City, Illinois], now it's a mall but when did they start building that and how did you get that job?  That's a big job.
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't get this job, this almost all of this work that you're talking about now must have come through Berry Electric [Contracting Company], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I worked for Berry and--
Speaker 1: So you started with Berry in 1943, I believe, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, 19, yeah, 1943.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, cause, yeah, um-hm
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  All right.  4-19-1943 [April 19, 1943].  So--
Speaker 2: But most of the work was through the, he had the contract.  We did the building on 41st [Street] and [Martin Luther] King Drive [South Parkway].  We remodeled it, it's seventy something apartments.  Then we did the, the hotel, the Vienna [ph.].  We had The Grove [ph.], The Elephant [ph.], the Garfield [ph.] and we did the Spencer [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now, now your name is out there some place at River Oaks, right, in a fixture (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it would be down in the vault down there because we finished the vault.  And then we, from it we sent all the circuits out to the different stores and then hooked 'em up and whatnot.  But I ran that when we first started building the, the vault.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was just back where J.C. Penney's at.
Story_ID: 252949
Speaker 1: What was the most complicated job you ever had to do?
Speaker 2: I was working at a, well it wasn't complicated.  What happens is that the engineer on this job was gonna cut a piece of copper for me and it stressed me out because he went to put his hand in there and I said don't do that but it was too late then and so here we had this plastic placement was down and we had just got in the backup with about 12,000 volts or something like that.  And this guy put this piece of copper in, in there (laughter) and it burned the whole system out, so.
Speaker 1: So he cut, cost somebody a lot of money, I guess.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Then we had another job over here at 525 76th Street [Chicago, Illinois], this is a big compound back in there.  And Berry [Electric Contracting Company] had almost every building that was in there and, and when I say I did the work, I mean, I was foreman over the group that did the work out there.
Story_ID: 253070
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about supervising white people and others, you know, was it, was that difficult when you were made a foreman on the job?
Speaker 2: No, because I always used the term we, we're going to do this, not I want this done or I want that done, it was always we're going to do it.  And so that's what we did, we did the job and most of the fellows, now there would be fellows like when we were doing, I can't think of the name of the company now but we were doing this big job and it was a welding company and they welded these water tanks and things like the bottoms and whatnot and then then they'd run 'em through the machine and folded 'em, when I say folded to make 'em round and all that kind of business.  So we had a fellow there and he was a steward on the job but I had put him and another journeyman together on the job and what they did in the course of the day it just wasn't, this is the only man I ever fired from any job, so I had fired him and, of course, it was twelve o'clock at night when [Robert] Berry finally got me and he says you can't fire him.  I says don't tell me I can't fire anybody I says no, 'cause either he's got to go or I got to, one of us has got to go.  So the next morning we were there and whatnot and I showed him what he had done, I says he dropped the wire down from the ceiling, he already had the measurements so he dropped the wire down from the ceiling over this machine and over that machine, he'd taken one two inch elbow and ten feet of pipe and one two inch elbow and ten feet of pipe.  I said this is two journeyman, electricians, I says and that's all he tried do, I said I could have did that with my eyes closed without the extra man.  So they let him go, then rather they sent him to another job, you know.  He didn't stay there.  It was either, I told him, either me or him so I stayed instead of him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I figure that my work was showing for itself, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did, did anybody ever refuse to work with you or walk off the job or anything when you were--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --a foreman?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  We were working in Leighton Township [ph.] on a streetcar turned around, and everybody showed up at this job but this one fellow and he finally showed up.  And so when he showed up he yelled said, who's the pusher on the job, (unclear) that's foreman.  So I said, I am.  You are?  So he gave a big jump and so he said I'm going to my car and get my tools I'll be right back.  So he went on off and so I told Fred [ph.] I says he's, he's not coming back.  And he says a nickel says, I says no.  So anyway it went on like that so about nine o'clock I called the office and I says there was another man, this was during the, as I say the war [World War II, WWII] hadn't started but everybody was getting prepared for the war, so I says I had five men here but this guy left and so Bud Miller [ph.] says you wanna know what we told him?  I says what did you tell him?  We told him that if you work for Berry [Electric Contracting Company] one of these days you have to work with Charlie Stewart [HistoryMaker Charles Stewart, III] so you might as well start it now.  So we'd give him his pay and let him go.  So that was the kind of feeling that I had with my company, you know.
Story_ID: 253071
Speaker 1: Do you think that, that Berry [Electric Contracting Company] kind of stuck their neck out for you or, or was it that wasn't that big a deal that what, what they did I mean in, in terms of hiring you?
Speaker 2: Really it, it was that big a deal and it wasn't that big a deal in terms of the fact that all we're doing is working for a living, you're doing your work and I'm doing mine so if I'm on the machine here and you're on the machine there we're just trying to produce what that company is making and get it out, that's all.  But I had another job that we were in Harvey [Illinois] I think it was, and so [Robert] Berry calls me and he tells me what he wants me to do at this job and way out north some place, I can't think of the name of the little town, but anyway he says that we're doing a store there and they're gonna start putting the ceiling up about ten o'clock we're going to start throwing pipes in the ceiling, that's when they start putting pipe, the metal ceiling up.  And so I'm writing it all down so that when I get to the job and whatnot we fool around 10, 15 minutes before time to go to work and so (unclear) so then I says, okay lets go.  So the guy says I thought I was running this job, I says no, now I had brought an Italian kid with me 'cause he told me to take Sammy [ph.] with me.  So I was telling him, I says well Mr. Berry called me and told me what to do, I says so all I'm gonna do is what I'm told.  Give him a nice big smile.  So anyway he says well I ain't gotta work here.  I says okay.  So I says you can hang out here until nine o'clock I says, then you can call the office.  But he hung around till nine o'clock and he called the office and the office told him that I was the foreman.  So he says well what do you want me to do?  And I says well we've already got everybody set up to do what their supposed to do.  Now you can start taking the part, the fixtures out of the case and whatnot, I says getting them ready for hanging.  I says and don't throw the cases, boxes away 'cause we use them and send them to junk yard and get coffee with them.  So that's what we did with that.  So he stayed there, we did this job taking us about two weeks or three weeks to get it done.  And he says to me, when he got ready to leave, he says, "Charlie [HistoryMaker Charles Stewart, III] you are about the whitest nigger I ever met."  He was from Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he just said it like that he just--
Speaker 2: Just like that.
Speaker 1: --just like that.
Speaker 2: So you couldn't do anything but laugh 'cause that's the way he said it, that's the way he meant it, and so I didn't take no offense to it.  So off he went and I never seen him again.
Story_ID: 253072
Speaker 1: Were you ever in a situation where you, you know, were kind of a little fearful for your wellbeing, I mean, amongst some of these construction types and, and people in Chicago [Illinois] can be a pretty rough place so?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, not really.  What I, I laughed about that 'cause I, I went back to my father [Stewart's stepfather, Sam Taylor] then I said to myself well, this old man gave me the same kind of strength that he's got and up until my arthritis started acting up on me, I felt like that if I was on the second floor and you were falling from the fifth floor, and I caught you, I could hold you.
Speaker 1: So you're tough?
Speaker 2: I felt like, yeah.  Plus the fact that I boxed.  I went to Eddie Nichols' gymnasium and I boxed.  I went to the CYO [Catholic Youth Organization], I boxed there about nine.  And I, I wrestled.  And so anything I wanted to do I did.  So without being boisterous about it, yeah.  So I never was (unclear) well, I was, what, ninety-four years old before I realized that I wasn't as strong as I thought I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 253073
Speaker 1: Yeah, tell us about your, your sister [Iola Toler].  Now your sister was quite a, a, a figure out in Harvey [Illinois] right, or Phoenix, Illinois (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, she was working for District 151, the school board out there and whatnot.
Speaker 1: She was a, a teacher?
Speaker 2: No.  I don't know exactly what position, yeah, I know at one time she was a truant officer and she would go get these kids and bring 'em to school and make 'em go to school and all that kind of poppycock, but Willis, I guess, you remember Superintendent Willis--
Speaker 1: Ben Willis.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  So what happens is, right across the road in South Holland [Illinois], they start building the school up there and so that zoned District 151 out of that district so the black kids that was going to school in Phoenix couldn't go across the road to that school over there.  And so they fought it, her and her friend and another teacher fought it and they got them kids over there to that school.  And then they got a, a vacation to Florida for what they had done, you know, for the board of education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, your sister and her husband [Frank Toler] were building a house and you did the wiring for that house but there is a story behind that right about the, about someone coming by when the house was in construction and asking about who was gonna, asking who was gonna--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --do it.  Tell us that story.
Speaker 2: Well, I was just measuring the house up, it was just a frame then.  The builders come out and they build you a frame and then you do the inside work and whatnot then they come back and finish but they had to do like the plumbing and the electrical work.  So I was measuring it up and these two lads come by wanting to know what was I doing.  And so I'm, I says I'm fixing to do the electrical work here so I was measuring it up to see how much material and what kind I need.  He says, "You're gonna do the electrical work?"  I say, "Yeah, me."  And so he looked at it and he says, "Well we'll see" or words to that effect.  And so I says okay we'll see.  And so I called [Herman] Washington and told him my sister wanted me to wire her house, can you talk to Mike Boyle [Michael "Umbrella Mike" Boyle] about it, so he says yes.  So he talked to Mike Boyle and Mike Boyle says it's okay.  In fact, he sent me the slip.  I kept it up until, I guess, all of a sudden my son comes and he wants me to, all these papers that's got your social security number on it and burn 'em and put 'em in the whatnot.  So but anyway, so they come back when I was doing the work and show them and he says, you got a ticket?  I says yeah I got a ticket.  So he looked at the other one and laughed 'cause he thought that, nobody had, but that's when we had just got these permits from Local 134 [of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: So I showed him the, the permit that I had from Local 134 so that sent them on their way so they know that the job is okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just don't, I don't, I can't read it, (laughter) just give me one second, pause one second.
Speaker 2: Starting to seem as though young Jackson [ph.] and his father (unclear) down there at 54th [Street] and Wabash [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Jimmy Moore [ph.] who was our second black business agent and, and Herman Hartman used to hunt together.  And that's what I was saying, I was saying that I know Herman, knew Jimmy Moore and I knew him, I'm sure she knew that he was from, with Local 134.
Story_ID: 253074
Speaker 1: There's a recent, I think one of our, one of the people we've interviewed, [HistoryMaker] William Bonaparte [Jr.], there's an article in the paper that cited him as being the first black person to be in [Local] 134 [of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers] and I, I think, it's really he was the first black phone man I think with Illinois Bell [Telephone Company] but he, he wasn't the first black in 134 I guess, right (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Not by a long shot.  He wasn't even born when we went in to Local 134.  But that's what excited me was the fact that he said that he figured he was the, the first and only black in Local 134 and here I'm almost doing sixty years right then, right, that I'm doing sixty years because, excuse me, between the 1924 and 1943 which is nine [sic. nineteen] years, you know, that we were still working and every now and then some of it was Local 134.  And then here Bonaparte says that he's the first black in Local 134.  So I was telling her I says, write him a letter, do something to let him know that there were fifty of us or more that, I don't know just how many it was because we should have counted 'em--
Story_ID: 253075
Speaker 1: What would you consider, I guess, the highlight of your career as an electrician?  What were some, what's the, well what's, what's been the highlight of it?
Speaker 2: I've done some foolish things and, I guess, one of the highlights of mine, there was Terry's [department] store at 47th [Street] and [Martin Luther] King Drive [Chicago, Illinois] next to the South Center [department] store.  And naturally when they put the boilers in for the South Center store they didn't expect another store to go on that east, on that west end of South Center.  But Terry from 12th [Street; Roosevelt Road] and Halsted [Street] built a store over there at 47th and King Drive and it was attached to South Center store.  And so I drilled the, if they cut the power off the base, basement might flood this is what they had figured out, engineers had figured out, so I says I'll drill it hot.  So with an electric drill and another electrician I went in and I drilled all four of those holes in this copper and just one inch one way or the other I would have been burned to a crisp.  So that was one of the foolishest things (unclear) (laughter) that I had done.
Speaker 1: But did you realize it was, I guess, you realized it was dangerous (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I realized how dangerous it was when I first went in there.
Speaker 1: But you, why did you do it, did you just--
Speaker 2: I really and truly and don't know, I guess I thought that, well, well I can do it; that's all, and when I set my mind to it, I did it and, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Then Terry bought out at 63rd [Street] and Green [Street] and I did that store out there.
Story_ID: 253076
Speaker 1: Did you do anything to help other black electricians get in the union [Local 134 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, sent 'em to different people or whatnot different inspectors.  Say well if you wanna get in the local go see so and so and so and so and whatnot and go see [Herman] Washington.  Well, of course, Washington dealt with 'em as best he could, you know, but a lot of 'em would pay him so much money and when I say pay him so much money, mind you this is their dues into the place and then they'd go off and then come back.  When they did come back whatever he was going to do for 'em he couldn't do then because at that time it expired, other people that he was going to see.  Didn't help any, yeah.
Story_ID: 253077
Speaker 1: We always ask this question of people what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: (Unclear) I, I'm a senior citizen and which you know, and I sit up there at McDonald's where you go order the coffee in the morning and I watch these people and I say to myself and whatnot, the Mexicans come here from Mexico and they set up a neighborhood, their neighborhood flourishes and whatnot.  We come along and we set up a neighborhood and we have a cleaners and grocery stores and laundry mats, gasoline stations, sell it all to the Arab.  Now that Arab (unclear) he don't live in my neighborhood, he wouldn't live in my neighborhood, he lives way out north or he lives in one of them downtown apartments or something like that.  And so I'm just wondering how many years I'll be dead before the black man wakes up and realizes that he's killing himself.  He ain't doing nothing for himself when he lets the business go to the Arab instead keeping it himself.  So that's the best I can tell you about--
Speaker 1: So you think--
Speaker 2: --us.
Speaker 1: --we need to be more--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --more conscious of keeping businesses in the black community?
Speaker 2: That's right, um-hm.

Speaker 1: Your sister won us a, now she took her case to, to [U.S.] Supreme Court in '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was the purpose of the vacation that they got in Florida, a weeks' vacation with pay because they took that case, this was the Willis [Wagons] deal and [Local] 151 when they didn't want blacks to cross that street and to use the street itself, you know, to say that that's one reason that they didn't want blacks to come because of the, the ratio of killing that would happen with the cars and the, and the kids going back and forth across there.
Speaker 1: Well what's your sister's name (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Iola Toler.

Speaker 1: Tell me, when you look back at all the things you've done so far, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Not a thing, nothing.  All that has ever happened to me from the time I was born up until the present, I did it to myself, even the arthritis.  I'm washing the windows on the outside here, come down and I missed the bottom step of the ladder, I go stumbling back until I land on that concrete on my hip and that's the one that's given me a lot of trouble.  My knee, I, I don't even know how I got it (unclear).  I do know that one time I was working in the Jewel[-Osco] store out on a 159th Street and I hit that knee on a, one of those push wagons that we pushed around to put you up into the ceiling.  And so they sent me to the Smith [ph.] and he drew a little water off of it, it never bothered me again.  And so then all of a sudden one day, this is twenty years later, I went to stretch it out, that knee popped and it hasn't been the same since.  So like I say everything that has happened to me I did it to myself.
Speaker 1: Well, now, oh, do you think that when you look back at, at the things you've done as an electrician or, I mean, if, is, had you been white instead of black what would you think would have been the, would there have been any difference?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I never thought about being white, (unclear) even with my mother [Mary Annie Knox] being white.  Now when I say my mother being white, my mother could walk into St. Patrick's Catholic Church at Adams [Street] and Desplaines [Street, Chicago, Illinois], nobody look at her the second time but the minute she brought these two, Iola [Toler] and me, you can't bring your, come in here, well that's the Catholic church.  So like I say for sixty-two years I forgot about the church (unclear).  This is lately that I went into the church because I felt like I needed the vehicle to get into heaven but other than that, poo.

Speaker 1: --Were your parents proud of you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  They thought that the sun rose and set in me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'll tell you how proud, my mother [Mary Annie Knox], I'm in Salt Lake City, Utah or some place and I'm on my way home but I, I did, decided to go by Omaha [Nebraska], my mother was mad with me 'cause I needed, needed to be because she has a new tree that had just peared and I love, love pears, she wanted me to be the first one to pull a pear off of this tree.
Speaker 1: That's an interesting story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a true story, um-hm.  So all we could do is say, well sorry ma but didn't make it, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did, now were, were you, were you able to help any of your offspring to become, now you've got a son right?  (Unclear)--

Speaker 2: Well but I got a son that he's an electrician.  I got a grandson he's an electrician.  Iola's [Iola Toler] son is an electrician, good electrician (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you kind of spread the wealth around the family, right?
Speaker 2: No, he's, he just, he can't stay off of that stuff and as a result he's sad to his mother and the family.  So who else?  That's about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about Frank [ph.]?
Speaker 2: That's Frank.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  Well, Frank is the one that--
Speaker 1: Frank Sr., right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, Frank, Sr. that's right too, he, he went up in the, I got him in the Local 134 [of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers] and he was working at a bed factory.  I, I forget what it was now and he was an electrician out there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for I don't know how long.

Speaker 1: Sir, your, your stepfather [Sam Taylor] started his own business as a result of his electrical studies, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He, in fact, he's one of the few electricians that had a license to do the electrical work but the license didn't help to much at that time because he was nonunion but as soon as he got union then everything leveled itself off.  The business is still going--
Speaker 1: So Taylor Electric [Company], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  So his son come back from Germany, Rufus [Taylor], and he really gave the business a boot and it went skyrocketing.  It, they still, they do fire departments in Chicago [Illinois] now, old folks homes, senior citizen houses, and malls.  And, in fact, they do almost everything, they're really into the business now.  And Rufus is dead now.  He was shot in a robbery that they come to his house and beat it in the garage and caught him unaware of what was happening and so they killed him.  But his wife and the kids is running the business pretty good 'cause it's still prospering as of today.

Speaker 1: Now when you look back at everything you've done this, you know, what, what, what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I really don't know how to express myself other than the fact that whatever I did, I tried to make myself happy in doing it.  If it seemed to bother me or bothered me too much, I divorced myself from it.  So, I guess it's my ease of being able to let things go if they're not right and stick with 'em if they're right.
Story_ID: 252963
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As somebody that tried to help somebody along the way.
Story_ID: 252964
Speaker 1: Do you have any advice for people that wanna get involved in, in the field of, of electrical work or, or contracting?
Speaker 2: If you feel like you're suited for it, stick with it.  Give it all you got.  If it don't work out then it wasn't for you in the first place.  Move on to something else, something that you like to do.  But I loved to do electrical work, loved my job and tried to do it as best I could all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you sir.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Thank you.
