Story_ID: 667194
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family--
Speaker 2: Um-hm--
Speaker 1: --and your father's [Charles Whigham] side.  But--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --we'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Marie Doris Foster Whigham [Marie Foster Whigham].  M-A-R-I-E, D-O-R-I-S, F-O-S-T-E-R, W-H-I-G-H-A-M.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: May the 27th, 1923, Newark, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Now what can you tell us about her side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and, and do they have any other origin other than Newark--?
Speaker 2: I can go back as--my mother has three sisters and two brothers, her father was a railroad man, her mother [Vera Foster] was a homemaker.  I was blessed to have met my grandmother's mother, who was a Father Divine [Reverend Major Jealous Divine].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And we could not call her grandma, we had to call her Miss Irene [ph.], or either Sister Irene.  So many times, when we would be out in the public, and I would say, "Well this is my great-grandmother," they would say, "Well why do you call her either Miss or Sister Irene?"  It was based on her religious origin [International Peace Mission Movement].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's what I know about on my mom's side.  My grandfather was from the New Jersey area but was actually raised in Virginia--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so I know very little about his side of the family, he was much older than my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Now this is the railroad man, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, from Virginia?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And his name was John Foster, Sr.
Story_ID: 667195
Speaker 1: Did you mother [Marie Foster Whigham] talk about growing up in Newark [New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what it was like?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) My mother worked for the ODB [Office of Dependency Benefits] back in the day which was the company that prepared the parachutes [sic.] for the troopers that were going out of the country, she met, that's where she met my dad.  My dad was actually a usher, I guess that's the term you could use, an usher at one of the local theaters.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he also did cleanup work at one of the doctor's offices and that's where he met my mom, and it's a very interesting story about my parents, if I may?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: My dad always wanted to be a medical doctor but he was raised by a single mother, so financially they were always on welfare.  This particular doctor was the first African American physician in the City of Newark, his name was Dr. Walter T. Darden.  Dr. Darden told my dad well from a financial standpoint, "Charlie [Charles Whigham] it's possible you will not be able to attend medical school, but why not choose the career as a funeral director?"  And that's who got my dad started in the career of the funeral industry, Dr. Darden.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 667196
Speaker 1: Since we're on your dad, what's your dad's full name?
Speaker 2: Charles Lemar Whigham: C-H-A-R-L-E-S, L-E-M-A-R, W-H-I-G-H-A-M [Charles Whigham].
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and--?
Speaker 2: February 27th 1921.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: Sparta, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And is there a story about how he came to Newark [New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: My grandmother and my grandfather, whose name was Albert Fos- Albert Whigham, Sr., met in Georgia.  The story is that he was very abusive to my grandmother, my grandmother migrated here to New Jersey to get away from him.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Bringing along with her my father, his next brother Albert [Albert Whigham, Jr.] and his youngest brother, E.J. [E.J. Whigham (ph.)], so she came here to New Jersey with her three sons and she raised them.  My uncle E.J. was killed in the war, he was in his barracks and one of the gentlemen was cleaning his gun and accidently killed him.
Speaker 1: Was that World War II [WWII]?
Speaker 2: World War II.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: As a result of those funds that the government gave my grandmother, she gave those funds to my father to open the funeral home [Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Now that's something.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, you wonder how some of these things get--
Speaker 2: One ties into the other.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's, that's something.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So he had the advice of Dr. Walter T. Darden, and then the funds--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, came from the result of the death of his brother.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Came--hm.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now did, did your father serve in the war?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He had flat feet.
Speaker 1: Oh really?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes.
Speaker 1: Now you would think in a time of crises that wouldn't matter as much (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. That wouldn't matter but it did.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he had flat feet.
Speaker 1: Hm.
Story_ID: 667197
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they say that my dad was a little lover boy (laughter) and all the ladies kind of chased him, he was always, my dad always liked to read and he loved to study the--he was not a drinker, didn't attend the bars or the--or whatever.  Whereas my mother loved to go out and dance and have a good time and my father wooed her and there was another young man that my mom supposedly liked but my grandparents [Vera Foster and John Foster, Sr.] were telling my mother, "Charlie [Charles Whigham] is a good opportunity, you know?  He's got his head on straight he, he wants to get a career going so Marie [Marie Foster Whigham], you need to start looking at him."  Well they did get married and it seems as if in the course of their marriage, my mom left my dad seven different times because she was so spoiled in not having her way.  So finally, the last time my grandfather, her dad said to her, "You cannot come back here anymore, you're married to Charlie, you're gonna stay with Charlie," and therefore, they stayed together (laughter).  But they had a wonderful--my parents, you know, probably different than a lot of people, my dad was a workaholic.  I, I never, I never--until my father became ill, my father when he would put his pajamas on, the button, top button of his collar was buttoned, always just so neat and, you know, pristine.  I, I never sa- I never saw my dad walk around in his underwear, always just, you know, neat and perfect.  My mother was the same way, my mother loved to shop and they had, they had this deal going on and this was the deal, "Marie, if you let me run the funeral home [Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey], you can do anything with the money," (laughter). "You wanna go shopping?  Go shopping," she didn't care for the career of the funeral industry, maybe because of the hours, you know, long hours, you're on call twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, but eventually it became, she because adaptable to it because she then began to work in the funeral home doing the hair and cosmetics.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So it just kind of shows you the yin and the yang, but they were married, my parents were married for fifty-seven years and in the course of the fifty-seven years, it was myself and my older brother [Lemar Whigham], and that was the story.  We had a summer home in Hackettstown, New Jersey, that my parents purchased in 1952, and it consisted of twelve acres of land, and on this property, each of us had our own individual homes, my parents had a house, I had a house, my brother had a house and my father's mother had a house.  We entertained our company, we could have our friends come up, we had a swimming pool, we had a tennis court, we had horses, we had cows, we had chickens, we had a garden.  I learned how to, I learned how to pick, pick vegetables, I learned how to raise chickens from chicks, and at the end when they grew up to be nice beautiful hens, I knew how to kill 'em and clean em turn around and eat 'em for dinner that night.  So, the exposure that my father and my grandmother gave to us as city children was quite different because none of my friends had ever had that exposure. We had our own horses, so I had to maintain my horse, I had to feed it, I had to bail, get the hay down, I had to wipe it down, I had to wash the horse, just the exposure, even, even raising chickens and how the rooster was the king of the house and if you bothered a certain hen, how the rooster would react.  So, I probably had a different childhood than my average friends.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Because of the exposure of not only knowing city life, but also knowing the rural areas of, of the country.  And every summer we would go up there and I would invite some of my friends and they would spend like a month with us, go back, go get another set of friends; and that's how we grew up.
Story_ID: 667198
Speaker 1: Tell us about your brother, now he's younger than you, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My brother's five years older than I.
Speaker 1: Oh, he's older than you? Okay.
Speaker 2: My brother's five years older than I.  He's--
Speaker 1: Yeah, now what's his name?
Speaker 2: Lemar, L-E-M-A-R--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Charles, C-H-A-R-L-E-S, Whigham, W-H-I-G-H-A-M [Lemar Whigham].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, is he still with us?
Speaker 2: My brother's still living.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He actually lives--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --at this property [in Hackettstown, New Jersey]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that I just give reference too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he lives there with his wife and he now maintains it, he doesn't have the cows, he doesn't have the horses, but he has the pool, he has the garden.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: He has the chickens, he has goats now--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause the goats cut the grass for him, (laughter).  I questioned him, I said, "Lemar, why do you have goats?"  My nickname, he calls me Peewee, he said, "That way I don't have to get out and cut the grass. I can just do a little bit around the house and let the goats go out and they'll eat all the grass up," I never knew that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now why the name Peewee, 'cau- were you really small when you were little 'cause--
Speaker 2: I was small.
Speaker 1: --you're not that--
Speaker 2: They called me Peewee.
Speaker 1: --that, you know, a whole lot of--
Speaker 2: I've always been called Peewee (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You're about an average size woman--
Speaker 2: Average size.
Speaker 1: --I guess--
Speaker 2: That's what my brother called me.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: That's what my friends called me, Peewee.  My friends from youth called me Peewee, my friends now call me the Little General.
Story_ID: 667199
Speaker 1: Now you've described some of this already but what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness, well I can give you, I'll give you both aspects of it, the good aspects of it was the exposure of living in a rural area [Hackettstown, New Jersey] in the summertime and getting to hear the crickets, getting to hear in the middle of the night how the wind would blow quite differently when you're in the city, you know, you don't--you hear the horns, you hear the ambulances, you hear the sirens.  Then from a negative standpoint would be my experience of the, of the riots.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was seventeen years old when the riots, and they actually came directly in front of the funeral home [Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and at that time that was my first time ever seeing soldiers with bayonets on the end and, and, and your big tanks and soldiers marching on foot in long processions through the City of Newark [New Jersey], the opportunity of seeing properties being destroyed.  I live--the funeral home is approximately two blocks from Springfield Avenue and I don't know if that's, if it's significant to you--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but it's a very significant street in the City of Newark.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Totally Jewish at that time--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I would--I saw, I literally was able to see how they went in and just destroyed and, and burnt up and broke windows out and all of that during the riots.  So, it was, it was an experience of--when you say sights and sounds, so different in comparison of me living in the summertime up in the country, then living in Newark during the regular business days of going to school and then the influx of the riots coming, shooting of the guns and the tanks and all of that.  So those are the things that come to mind.
Story_ID: 667200
Speaker 1: I didn't ask this question, I'm, kind of back up a little bit, but--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --when you think about your parents' personalities and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --dispositions, how they walk, talk--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --sense of humor--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what they look like--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, every--everyone makes the comment.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: My, my demeanor how I walk, how I hold my head, how I conduct funerals, all of that and truly my father was my idol.  I--if my father took two steps, I took three--
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: --(laughter) simple as that, if he took four, I took five.  Every Saturday, every Saturday, I would be up dressed to work on funerals with him.  I learned to drive at the age of six, my father had a 1945 Jeep, stick, he took blocks and put them on the bottom of my shoes that I was able to reach the peddles, strapped them on with.  With a belt--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and that's how I learned how to drive a Jeep.
Speaker 1: Did you learn how to drive on the farm [in Hackettstown, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then people would see the hearse move in the cemetery, they couldn't see me 'cause I was so short, but I was moving the hearse through the cemetery, and people would say, "Charlie [Charles Whigham] the hearse is moving." He'd say, "Ah that's my daughter, seven, eight years old driving, crazy right?"
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But these are the exposures that my parents gave to me that other kids--you know?  I think about my childhood and some of the things that I've experienced in comparison even to the kids today, roller skating, just street skating, putting on a pair of skates and just riding through the streets, playing stick ball with a, with a, with a broom handle, not a baseball bat, with a broom handle, just the difference of exposure of how you make fun and how you have fun.  Whereas, what our kids are not--have the privilege of having now a days, they have to have a basketball court, they have to have a gym; we didn't have all that, we made our own fun.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We could get an alley, give me an alley, we can do it (laughter) it's just the difference.
Story_ID: 667201
Speaker 1: Was there a name for the neighborhood you lived in in Newark [New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: We were on what is called, it's no longer called that, we were on a street called High Street, H-I-G-H Street, it's now Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard [Martin Luther King Boulevard].  But that is the street that most of your prominent African Americans lived on, all your doctors lived there, Irvine Turner [Irvine I. Turner] the former mayor, he lived there, all your African American doctors and dentists lived on that street, Dr. Carr [ph.], Dr. Haling [ph.], Dr. Shelton [ph.], these are prominent African American doctors.  I don't know what you know a little bit about north--there was a woman named Louise Scott--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --who owned Scott hotel [Scott Cultural and Civic Center, Newark, New Jersey] and eventually started a beauty culture school and she bought what is called the Krueger Mansion [Krueger-Scott Mansion].  The Krueger Mansion is a building that is still existing in the City of Newark, it is an archive, it is a historical building that is sitting vacant now that consists of unimaginable, it sits on the corner, it's, gotta be worth, it's abandoned, if someone could ever come in and take it over, $20 million easy.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It's, it's a beautiful structure.  So, there's a lot of history on that street, a lot of history.  There's an article, and I have it for you where I did an article for The New York Times regarding the development of Martin Luther King Boulevard.
Speaker 1: The boulevard?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's, it's okay.  Just High Street?
Speaker 2: Yes, H-I-G-H.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And, wh- what's the demographics of Newark when you were growing up, was there like a black side of town or, or, you know?
Speaker 2: You know that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, well yeah but I'm just, it's a rhetorical question.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Where we lived was predominately African American.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 667202
Speaker 1: I'll have to share this story with you.  I went to an all Catholic school, first through the eighth grade.  Where we, where the funeral home [Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey] is located, directly to the right of the funeral home is a school called, Arts High School [Newark, New Jersey].  It is a school basically for music and art, two blocks from there is a school called, Central High School [Newark, New Jersey] and about ten blocks is another school called Southside [Southside High School; Malcolm X Shabazz High School, Newark, New Jersey] and another school called West Side [West Side High School, Newark, New Jersey], those were my four choices of schools to attend. Well, that didn't sit well with my dad [Charles Whigham].  There was an article in The Star-Ledger that there was a new high school opening up in the lily white community called Vailsburg [Newark, New Jersey] and that it had open enrollment and my dad said, "I don't want you to go to the schools in the local area, I want you to go to Vailsburg." Vailsburg is about a thirty minute ride from where--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the funeral home is.  So that morning of open enrollment, the very first day, we arrive at the school and as we're walking up the entrance of the school, the lady sitting at the top of the step closes her book and she says, "Oh I'm so sorry open enrollment is closed, we've met our quota"--
Speaker 2: She just--
Speaker 1: Now this--
Speaker 2: --just did it right?
Speaker 1: --this is at--
Speaker 2: You--when she saw--
Speaker 1: --nine, ten in the morning.
Speaker 2: --you coming up the--
Speaker 1: Yes--
Speaker 2: --stairs (laughter).
Speaker 1: --you, you're reading me right?
Speaker 2: The book is closed.
Speaker 1: The book is closed.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So my daddy turns around and he paused, he says, "Well are you sure?"  She says, "Yes sir, I am we, we've met our quota."  He says, "Well didn't--the doors open at nine?"  He says, "Well it's about ten minutes coming in."  "Well I'm sorry." So my dad says, "Well, you know, driving up here I noticed several homes were for sale," he said, "so we have two ways to handle this, I can go and buy five or six homes up here and bring some children from the inner city to live here which means they will be in this locality, they have to attend the school or you can open the books and you can enroll my daughter."  She opened the books and she enrolled me.
Speaker 2: Now see--
Speaker 1: My first day of school, this is the truth, my first day at Vailsburg High School [Vailsburg Middle School, Newark, New Jersey], I was the first black, every teacher knew my name before I even sat down in the classroom.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know how they would call roll?  Well when they got to Whigham, they knew to look right at me.
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: They already, they were prepared.  But it was a wonderful, wonderful experience.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I got to experience attending school because my, my Catholic school was all black, black and Spanish--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but I had--
Speaker 2: Wh- what was the name of your Catholic--
Speaker 1: St. Mary's Roman Catholic--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --school [St. Mary's School] in Newark [New Jersey], M-A-R-Y'S--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and that's on King Boulevard [Martin Luther King Boulevard], well High Street then.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I had the opportunity to attend school with, at that time, the mayor of Newark, Addonizio [Hugh Addonizio], his daughter was my classmate.  There was a gentleman who was an extreme racist, made it very clear what he felt, but his daughter was in school with me also. I'm gonna call his name in a minute, I've just had a brain freeze on it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But it gave me an, an exposure of meeting children and meeting kids from a different walk of life and the main thing they would say to me is, "Carolyn [HistoryMaker Carolyn Whigham] you're different than the other colored kids." And I would say, "Why?"  "Well the other colored kids, you know, their hair's not done, they, you know, their clothes--." I said, "It, it's not that I'm different, I'm the same, but I know how to take care of myself, I know how to groom myself, I know how to clean myself up."  I said, "But some of the kids that you see, they don't have the same opportunity as I, not that I'm different, I'm the same, just like you," I said, so, and with that we grew, we all grew.  When we graduated from high school, the after, the after prom party was at the funeral home, we moved out all the caskets in our caskets showroom and we had our prom party there.  And we're still friends we just had a reunion last April.
Speaker 2: So when you graduated, how, how many African Americans came--
Speaker 1: When I graduated--
Speaker 2: --came out of your--
Speaker 1: --there was twelve.
Speaker 2: --in your cla- twelve.
Speaker 1: Twelve.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Twelve.
Speaker 2: Out of what, how many?
Speaker 1: A hundred and seventy-two--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --students.
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: In my--
Speaker 2: That's pretty--
Speaker 1: --graduating--
Speaker 2: --good.
Speaker 1: --class.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --yeah, that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There were twelve of us.
Speaker 2: --not bad.
Speaker 1: So we, we--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but they migrated into the school because they moved to that area.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I was the only one out of the area to go there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Story_ID: 667203
Speaker 1: Oh, was there a name for that black community?  That's what I was trying to get at.
Speaker 2: Oh where we lived?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Not really, just High Street [Martin Luther King Boulevard], it wasn't, it really wasn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Just High Street? So, so people just referred to it like that?
Speaker 2: Well, Central Ward [Newark, New Jersey], you could say the Central Ward.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Central Ward, High Street, that's what they referred to but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --not anything beyond that.
Speaker 1: Because usually, I mean, you've got The Ville [St. Louis, Missouri], the as--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: 'Cause where I come from is the West Side [Newark, New Jersey]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, it--
Speaker 2: But it was Central Ward--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --if anything.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right Central Ward, all right.  So, so now your father had all but the--that, that was the first black funeral home [Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey] in the--
Speaker 2: My father, my father opened the first African American bank [City National Bank of New Jersey, Newark, New Jersey], it was not the first African American funeral home.
Speaker 1: Okay, the first bank?

Speaker 1: Now that's, that's--
Speaker 2: --first bank.
Speaker 1: --really a--

Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: And '72 [1972]?
Speaker 2: --yeah, that's--

Speaker 2: He was asked to and my mother [Marie Foster Whigham] said that she would divorce him.

Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --to run, this was before Ken decided to run and my mother made it very clear, "If you do Charles [Charles Whigham], I will divorce you."  Therefore, Ken Gibson ran--
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Wi- with--no be- before you--

Speaker 2: In 1943.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah, '46 [1946]--

And we entertained him, we had a big party and it was, he was running for office at the time and my dad hosted an event for him.

Speaker 2: In high school?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I loved playing basketball, I was also, I was also in the band, but my favorite, my favorite topic was typing.  I type 120 words a minute.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: My typing teacher, I loved her, 'cause she was on point as far as being, you know, real technical about positioning your fingers and stuff?  So, typing and bookkeeping, accounting were my favorite topics, I, I loved working with math.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 2: --I was actually standing to go into my locker when it was announced that he'd just been assassinated.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And the school just--we just, just all went crazy--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know?  It was just--that was one president and we've had several, but that's one president that I had a lot of respect for.  Being young, never paid attention to politics or government issues, but with him there was, there was a tenacity about him and his wife [Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis] that I think attracted most people of my age at that time, him with the children [Caroline Kennedy and John F. Kennedy, Jr.], you know, his appearance.  I, I, I admire a clean cut well dressed man, I admire a woman that looks very dainty and very pretty.  So, with them, you know, they were kind of like the apple of my eye, even though they were white, but they were still something that I could look at and, and kind of symbolize with.  So yeah, the Kennedys I, I, I thought were right, they're really cool.

Speaker 1: Also, like the March on Washington was going on, and--
Speaker 2: The March on Washington (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: --was going on; you had the, the Muslims where their location was [Temple No. 25; Masjid Imam Ali K. Muslim, Newark, New Jersey] and it's still there now is about four blocks from where the funeral home [Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey] is located.  So, you had, you had the Muslim people coming in and, and--

Speaker 1: So who is the, like civil rights leadership in, in Newark [New Jersey] (unclear)?
Speaker 2: In now, in Newark now--
Speaker 1: I mean in those days?
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: When you were growing up?
Speaker 2: --back then?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: There's a gentleman that I would tell you, and he is still, he is still very active, he--his name is, oh Jesus, what's his last name?  It starts with an H, Harper [ph.]?  I think it is--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --I think it's Harper.  But, you know, back then now you--Ras' dad, Amiri Baraka?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Amiri Baraka was very strong.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: He and my dad [Charles Whigham] went to school together.  His birth name is LeRoi Jones.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Changed it to Amiri Baraka, he was prominent, I would tell you out of all of them he was the most prominent and he did it poetically.  At his house on South 10th Street, his doors were never locked, you could go to his home at two o'clock in the morning, down into his basement and there was always some type of either poetry reading, some type of someone speaking, something that would enlighten us as blacks, which we were called then to enlighten us about our history.  Ironically, even driving home, I thought about this month being Black History Month, the sad part is we don't teach our kids about the black historians that are from our own community.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: We deal with those who invented the co- [cotton gin]--Eli Whitney, we deal with those who invented stuff in the '20s [1920s], back in 1800s, but we don't know our own history now.  The prominent people that, just in the City of Newark, that I know our kids don't know anything about and yet they walk up and down these streets where they're named--these streets have been renamed about these African American people but the kids do not know who they are.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: No idea.
Speaker 1: So, did you participate in the--what, what was it--he, he had come to Newark at one time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I, I was a part of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And they had what, what was it Spirit House over there or was that a, a New York [New York] thing?
Speaker 2: That was New York.
Speaker 1: New York, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right so--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --so Newark--and so he was prominent as a playwright and--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --as a poet--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and as an activist?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And you know the governor, the State of New Jersey took his, his laureate away from him because he wrote a certain poem ['Somebody Blew Up America,' Amiri Baraka].
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  State of New Jersey took his poet laureate.
Speaker 1: Now when was this?  When was this?  They--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --they made him the poet laureate when he was Le- LeRoi Jones?
Speaker 2: --that's cur- no--well yes--
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: --and they'd--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, when he was Amiri Baraka--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and they--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --took that from him.  I'm not good with the year but it was--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --maybe ten years before his death easy.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yes, and that was--that--Jersey was upset about that.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: We were very upset about that, but then you have--this is where you have, you know, your white demographics of people coming and saying, "You can't say this, you can't say that."  Wh- the poem had something to do, talking about the government and the operation of how the government is ran or the state is ran, and they got angry with him and they snapped that title right back.
Speaker 1: Now this is--this kind of poem would not be a new kind of poem to--
Speaker 2: No, not for him.
Speaker 1: --Amiri Baraka?
Speaker 2: No, not at all.
Speaker 1: Amiri Baraka, if anybody--
Speaker 2: He would--
Speaker 1: You couldn't get--
Speaker 2: --punch--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --he'd punch.
Speaker 1: --much harder hitting--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Amiri.
Speaker 2: It wasn't a slap, he'd punch.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that's right--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --there--it was witty, too.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It was funny and it would hit--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --hard too.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: He, he was--
Speaker 2: He was a good guy--
Speaker 1: Yeah, some of the stuff people didn't agree with, they had to laugh--
Speaker 2: You still had to laugh--
Speaker 1: --'cause it was--
Speaker 2: --about it.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: 'Cause it was so witty.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: You know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he had a sense of humor.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He was, he was so talented that he could take his work and put in from, from seriousness to being jovial, you know?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You, you, you couldn't help but laugh.  And you'd say, "Man I ain't think about that. Did you ever think about saying it like that?"
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: It's just as crazy.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: He's a good guy.
Speaker 1: --I remember he had a book called 'Race,' you know, R-A-C-E--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: 'Raise'--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: 'Raise, Race' ['Raise, Race, Rays, Raze: Essays Since 1965,' Amiri Baraka]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Ri- you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --all the--
Speaker 2: All the Rs.
Speaker 1: --all, you know, all--the three titles in one.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know?  Yeah, so he was--yeah, a national, national leader and he became part of the national political movement, National Black Political--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Assembly [National Black Political Assembly]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and all of that.
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, so he, he was--'cause we, you, you never know though until you ask--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --how prom- prominent somebody is in their own hometown--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know?
Speaker 2: Right, right--
Speaker 1: 'Cause there, they may be a national figure but--
Speaker 2: Sure but it may not at home.
Speaker 1: Yeah, nobody's thinking about it--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --on the home court.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.

Speaker 1: The events leading to the riot--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in '67 [1967], now this is the year before Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So that wasn't the cause of it?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: But what, so what did you as a, as a teenager did you sense this, this build up?
Speaker 2: Well, if I go back in, in, into my memory bank, during that time of the, of prior to the riots, there was a lot of incidents with police brutality.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You had incidents where police were pulling, in fact--my, my son [Steveland Whigham] had the experience, he's older now but a similarity that you drove, drove in certain areas of the city such as if you went into the Bloomfield, New Jersey area, which is still Essex County [New Jersey], it'd be nothing for a white cop to pull you over if you were black.  You know, I, I've been pulled over, I drive, I drive, I drive a nice car, "What are you, what are you, what are you doing with that car?"  I've been on the New Jersey Turnpike--now this wasn't--this, this is not now, this is back when I was seventeen, eighteen years old.  I was bad, I bought myself a Corvette, a orange Corvette Stingray [Chevrolet Corvette Stingray]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and I'm on the New Jersey Turnpike--
Speaker 1: And you were seventeen years old?
Speaker 2: I was seventeen years old.
Speaker 1: So the funeral business is a--
Speaker 2: Oh, I know how to save my money now.
Speaker 1: --just to go back to the, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --business is really good.
Speaker 2: It's a good business.
Speaker 1: And your--
Speaker 2: It's long hours, it's good money--
Speaker 1: --your family business, you were the top funeral home [Whigham Funeral Home]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in, in Newark [New Jersey]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that I--
Speaker 2: To God I give that glory there, it ain't about me--
Speaker 1: I'm just saying--
Speaker 2: --it's about Him.
Speaker 1: --that the funeral dir- directors in the black community--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --are some of the most prosperous people--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in the community.
Speaker 2: It's, it's a good, it's a good career.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But it's a calling, it's not meant for everyone.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There are some of us that do it strictly for the money, they won't last long.  If it's, if it's not in the passion of your heart, it's not gonna work, it's not gonna work.  But anyway, I'm on, I'm on the turnpike and this cop pulls me over, "What are you doing driving this car?"  "Why can't I have this car?"  "Let me see your license and registration."  Wasn't speeding, wasn't doing anything wrong, but that profiling was going on and I think when these riots started out, it was a young kid that got shot by a white police officer--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --was killed, little or no investigation, and I think Newark was just tired of it, it wasn't the first one--
Speaker 1: Yeah wha- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) wasn't the second one--
Speaker 1: --one person, John Smith, does that ring a bell?
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Yes.
Speaker 1: That's it--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --okay.  A taxi driver?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Was--okay, and people just had enough?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.

Speaker 2: Not good, not good.  It, it--you, you had, you had economically our African American, our black people were struggling, jobs, all this, this the same thing that basically is happening now.  It was a poor job market--
Speaker 1: Wh- what was the major employer of black folks would you say or, or, or, or which--what industries were, they involved in?  I know when you looked at Detroit [Michigan], it's the auto industry.

Speaker 2: You also had Blue Cross Blue Shield [Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, Newark, New Jersey], and you had the airport [Newark International Airport; Newark Liberty International Airport, Newark, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You had a lot people that worked at the airport whether it was bu- luggage claims or on the planes or whatever, or cleaning the planes, you had a lot of that.  So yeah, I would tell you--but, I mean they, they were, they were blue collar workers, they weren't' making, they weren't making big money.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't sound like these kind of--
Speaker 2: Naw.
Speaker 1: --these are, these are service jobs.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and blue collar workers, they ain't--
Speaker 1: They existed and--
Speaker 2: --you know--
Speaker 1: --others did--
Speaker 2: --they're not union, we're not talking about union people.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: You're not, I think, I think subsequently as time went on, is that they became educators, they became principals--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --they became doctors and nurses but, not then, not then that's what I'm saying, even with Dr. Darden [Walter T. Darden], I mean, he was one of the first African American doctors, this is back in my dad's [Charles Whigham] time.  So subsequently as, as time went on, they became the educators, but not back then when I was a kid, they, you didn't have that.  I, I, I cannot, I cannot recollect seeing--now I'm going back--high school [Vailsburg High School, Newark, New Jersey], I don't recall seeing many black police officers--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --patrolling, whether they were walking the streets or riding in a car, that's entirely different now--we've--that quota has changed, but as a kid in school, you didn't have that, there was always white police officers.  Oh, crossing guards, they were white, I never--I can't remember a black crossing guard with the vest on, I, I, I don't--bus drivers--I'm--you know, it's really clicking now.  I used to drive--I used to ride two different buses to get back and forth to, to school, I cannot recollect an African American bus driver, I don't remember.  Coming home from school I had to walk two blocks from the bus stop, there was a Greek guy who owned a deli and two blocks from there, closer to the house was a Jewish guy that owned a restaurant, I--only person I could tell you that was doing well was a woman named Amelia Stewart, she was a self-employed--A-M-E-L-I-A, S-T-E-W-A-R-T.  She started out selling stockings and wigs on a street called Prince Street, P-R-I-N-C-E, which was predominantly Jewish, she was one of the first African Americans--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --to get on that street--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and she became very successful and opened up her own soul food restaurant like Ms. Sweetie Pie [ph.]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yes, and she--we, we buried her, she died about fifteen years ago.  But she was one of the first ones to break the color barrier on a total Jewish street and that would have been Prince Street.
Speaker 1: Hm. Okay, Prince Street, okay.
Story_ID: 667210
Speaker 1: I remember when I was in college, this is interesting, now I just remembered this--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --had an art professor named Kadisch [ph.]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and his bo- Baraka [Amiri Baraka], as LeRoi Jones grew up next door to the Kadisches--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and it--
Speaker 2: On South 10th Street?
Speaker 1: I guess so--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --'cause he said that his, his dad was close to LeRoi Jones or--
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: --you know?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He said, it wa- I don't know how we got in the con- conversation, he said well--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --he grew up right next door--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --to 'em, to him--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know?  And (unclear).  So is there--and for what you said there's a strong physical relationship between the blacks and Jews being--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --close together?
Speaker 2: --that as a kid grow--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --as a kid growing up in the, in the basic Central Ward [Newark, New Jersey], there was a mixture of African Americans, you had your Jews, you had Germans, across the street from the funeral home [Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey] was a old German lady who used to babysit me.  You had Italians, it was, it was a mixture, what happened is after the riots, is where the segregation began where Newark [New Jersey], the Central Ward became black, then you had up in Livingston [New Jersey] all white, then you had in Millburn [New Jersey], all white, that's when we divi- began to diverse and divide and separate.  But as the beginning coming up, we were all mixed in there together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were all--
Speaker 1: Well that's a different pic- picture than a lot of places.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we wer- when I tell you it was a mixture?  On King Boulevard [Martin Luther King Boulevard]--on High Street, I keep saying King, 'cause that's what it is now--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but on High Street, was a major hospital, St. Barnabas [St. Barnabas Hospital, Newark, New Jersey] was there, down the street was St. Michael's [St. Michael's Hospital; St. Michael's Medical Center, Newark, New Jersey]--you, you had a mixture, even the first, one of the high rises which is now torn down was mixed with Jewish people, Italian people--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --German, Polish--I remember, I remember a Polish friend that I had, it was a mixture of all races, it's only after--
Speaker 1: This is a--
Speaker 2: --the riots that this (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) high rise--
Speaker 2: High rise apartment building.
Speaker 1: --project?
Speaker 2: Yeah, like twenty floors--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --twenty floors, there was a mixture--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --it's after the riots that when we began to diverse ourselves and like, we're over here, and you go over there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so any rate, so the, there's a history of low wage jobs--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Police brutality--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --not much opportunity even in the public sector?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) Not at all, not at all.
Speaker 1: Not even bus drivers--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: --or anything so this is a--yeah, a situation that's ripe for--
Speaker 2: For that to happen.
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was just boiling.
Story_ID: 667211
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now do you, do you remember what the atmosphere was when Malcolm X was assassinated?  'Cause they, they say that the New Jersey mosque [Temple No. 25; Masjid Imam Ali K. Muslim, Newark, New Jersey] is a--is where it pre- precipitated it--it got organized and, you know.
Speaker 2: There's some things I can't say that I know, but I'll go this way.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: When that incident occurred, there're certain people from Newark, New Jersey that are alleged to have been involved with it.  I don't know it to be factual, I'm only going by what I've been told and what I've heard.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: That when it did occur, you had the Nation of Islam pretty upset because however it went, it wasn't supposed to go that way, meaning if it was supposed to happen, but not by the people who did it, it's supposed to be another set of people.  I'm just telling you what I heard, don't know if it's true.  But the people who did it supposedly are from the Newark area.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I know there's a--you and people can look online and there's a name--
Speaker 2: Their name--
Speaker 1: --everybody--their names--
Speaker 2: --I ain't gonna say their names.
Speaker 1: --are on there--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes--
Speaker 1: --are out there now.
Speaker 2: --and I know them.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I know them personally.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah there's some--
Speaker 2: Hasn't been proven--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but it's alleged--
Speaker 1: Yes, right, right.  So, any rate, so did, did you--where you an admirer of Malcolm X or did you have--
Speaker 2: I did admire him, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  I thought, I thought particularly when he came back from his trip to Egypt, I feel that what he went through, and I don't--I'm not--you know, I'm Christian, I believe spiritually God, God had, God had a conversation with him from the standpoint, it's not about whether you're Muslim, whether you're black, whether you're blue, whether you're green, it's about loving each other, it's about respecting your fellow man, if you want a respect you have to give respect.  If you want love, you have to give love.  And I believe when he went on the journey, that's kind of what happened, and he came back with a different mindset of what others thought and they took it as a form of rebellion, they took it as a form of being sarcastic or you, you--you're too big for your shoes, you know?  You, you're getting a little bit too popular, you're getting a little bit too big for your shoes, so we need to just kind of tone you down.  And he wasn't gonna be toned down, and he knew--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --I believe, I believe Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] knew, I believe Malcom knew, not that they knew the day and time, but that the premonition was coming about.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that Malcom actually said it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, Dr. King did too.
Speaker 2: Said the same thing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, said the same thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I think they knew, yeah.
Speaker 1: I think they kind of knew that, that they were living on borrowed time in a lot of ways.
Speaker 2: 'Cause not only, not only did you have the white man against you, you had, you had your own, you had your own, and you, who do you trust?  Well, do you look left, or right?  Do you look behind you or in front of you?  Who do you trust?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And you know, and when your camp is infiltrated and, and, and you can't go to bed and close your eyes without opening one eye to make sure--that's a miserable way to be, that's a miserable way to live and not to know who you can and cannot trust and then to be betrayed within your own circle, it's crazy, that's insane (laughter), what they call it?  Sleeping with the enemy (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 667212
Speaker 1: Back to high school [Vailsburg High School, Newark, New Jersey], when you were like a senior in high school--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --this is 1966.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: This is the year before the riot?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you, what did you see as your, as a career?  Did you yourself as (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Always wanted to be a funeral director.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Never wanted to do anything else.
Speaker 1: So you knew you would succeed your father [Charles Whigham]?
Speaker 2: Always knew.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, 'cause there's so many people, I mean, sons and daughters of prominent black businesspeople--
Speaker 2: That don't--
Speaker 1: --don't--
Speaker 2: --want to do it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, whether it's dry cleaning business, grocery--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --store--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know--
Speaker 2: That was my brother [Lemar Whigham].
Speaker 1: --laundry mat, whatever it is--
Speaker 2: My brother--
Speaker 1: --that--
Speaker 2: --wouldn't do it.
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: My brother did--
Speaker 1: Next generation--
Speaker 2: --it for about ten years, and he's like, "I can't do this,"--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --and he walked.
Speaker 1: --yeah and in fact, some of the offspring are encouraged to be a professional.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: You know?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: A lawyer, a doctor or something like that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and then the parents are upset that they don't come back--but you're the one that sent them to school to be a--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --lawyer--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --you know?  So, here's, you know, that's that, I don't know it's a tension that--
Speaker 2: You know but it's, it's funny that you would say that because my dad honestly didn't, did not want me to become a funeral director, he wanted me to be the office manager, and I'm like, "No.  I'll learn"--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --"you'll teach me," this is what we did, this was my deal.  You teach me how to run the office dad, but once I've accomplished that, I'm gonna get my license.  Well at that time, you have to understand the mindset, you didn't have females as funeral directors.
Speaker 1: Nah, I can't think of any in those days.
Speaker 2: You had females--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --as secretaries, you had seen females as the bookkeeper, females doing their hair, females doing cosmetics, but you did not have a female embalming a body, you did not have a female dressing and casketing a body, you did not have a female working or conducting a funeral.  So my dad's mindset was, you're a girl, you can't do that, and my mindset was, I ain't got nothing to do with gender, it's what I wanna do.  So, this was, this is what I did.  We had a funeral on a Saturday, very, very large funeral.
Speaker 1: Now this was when you were still in high school?
Speaker 2: This is when I'm in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And a gentleman had gotten killed, he had, he was inflating a tire and the tire, he put too much air in it and it blew, decapitated him, that body is at the funeral home [Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey] unembalmed.  Now meanwhile, I've watched my dad as a young kid, been with him all the time, my dad, my father, my uncle, who's a licensed funeral director, are out on this funeral, my mother's upstairs, I say to my ma, "I'll be back, I'm going downstairs."  Now that could mean I'm going downstairs to play or I'm downstairs doing something, I embalmed that body, I put the head back, I detach--put the head back, I embalmed the body.  My dad comes in from the funeral, he says, "Marie [Marie Foster Whigham] I'll be back, I gotta go downstairs and deal with this case, I'll be back in a couple hours," he comes downstairs, pulls the sheet back, the body's embalmed, my father cusses like Popeye, "Da, da, da, da, da--who did da, da, da, da."  I'm standing there with my chest all out, "I did it daddy, I did it," he cussed me out so bad, because it--I did something illegal, I was not licensed--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and his thing was, had I messed up, or done anything wrong, it would be on his license.  So, he chewed me out, two days later he complimented me, he says, "Go to mortuary school, you can do it," that's how I got to mortuary school.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Not because--he said in the beginning, yeah, yeah, yeah, I had to show him that I had the skill and that I had a true love for it and that's how we started; and my dad trained me--everything I know, he taught me.
Story_ID: 667213
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna ask you a popular culture question.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And most people would probably ask, how did you overcome the spookiness of dealing with dead bodies and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I'll deal with them before I deal with the folks walking up and down the street.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) They're the ones that--
Speaker 2: They ain't gonna hurt you. The ones walking up and down the street are the ones that's gonna hurt you.  The day that one laying on the table get up and move, that's a different story.  But I know he's not going to move, but it's the one's out there that will hurt you.  The only thing that I will tell you about this career that sometimes takes the passion out of my heart are babies.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Children, because they've not had an opportunity to live, little boys, little girls, stillborns, kids two years old, SIDS death [sudden infant death syndrome], those bother me.  Other than that, I'm good.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And you have to understand, in this career you deal with death 24/7, it's a, it's (makes sound) next funeral; (makes sound), next day, same funeral.  If you do four or five funerals in a day, you can imagine and then sit down with families and make funeral arrangements--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and then the emotions that they go through--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --they're fighting among themselves, they mad with each other, they mad 'cause mama named the brother the beneficiary and not you, or mama didn't give you nothing and they bring all that stuff into the funeral home [Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey] and you have to take a cake knife and clean it up.  Do you know how many hats we wear as a funeral director?
Speaker 1: I--
Speaker 2: Counseling, lawyer, grief counseling, arrangements, preacher, oh, it's so many hats and it's, and it's a career that pulls so much from you, it pulls so much from you and you have to always remain professional.  You can't get into, "I wouldn't say that," you know?  You, you, you can't say, "Well you're right and you're wrong," you have to keep a level plane and in keeping that level plane, you get the respect of your clients--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --that you're here to help them, not to coerce them, not to convince them, "Do what you want, you want to buy that piece of casket there?  That's $199, get it, it's fine with me, I'm here to service you.  It's what you want?  I'll do it."  And no funeral is the same, no funeral is the same, every family grieves differently, every family wants things different.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about that in--further on in, I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 667214
Speaker 1: So on the verge of graduating from high school [Vailsburg High School, Newark, New Jersey]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you knew you wanted to be a funeral director?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Did you consider going to college or did you--?
Speaker 2: I went, I went to Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for three and a half years--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --and I fooled around, did everything I shouldn't have done--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --you know?  Listen, I, I'm a spoiled kid, you know in essence basically.
Speaker 1: You had the--
Speaker 2: You know your paren- ?
Speaker 1: --Corvette [Chevrolet Corvette Stingray] then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, man my parents [Marie Foster Whigham and Charles Whigham] bought me the car down there, everybody wants to be my friend, I'm out there, party--I went to lily white school now?  But this is culture shock, I went to a lily white school, you know?  And then I bounced down to an all-black college [HBCU]--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --can you imagine?
Speaker 1: Petersburg, Virginia.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: Can you imagine?  I learned how to play cards in college, I never played cards in high school, I learned how to cheat in college, you know, wear your skirt and put your answers up here and just pull your skirt--man, I learned all these things in college.  So, the exposure that I got going from an all-white high school to an all-black college was entirely different, but the camaraderie of friendship that I made, I'll never ever get back.  I mean, people that I rubbed elbows with back in college?  We, we still communicate, I mean, it's, attending a black college is a true experience, it really--and you get to see your own achieve, you get to see the doctors, you get to see the lawyers, you get to see those who have become professionals, football players, basketball players.  So, yeah, I was at Virginia State, three and a half years, I said, "Dad I don't want to do this anymore."  He said, "Okay what do you want to do?"  "I wanna go to mortuary school."
Speaker 1: So you were almost out, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Three and a half years?
Speaker 2: Short twelve credits (laughter).
Speaker 1: Hm. You just decided to just go on and, and do what you--
Speaker 2: Do what I wanna do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Go to mortuary school.
Speaker 1: All right now.
Story_ID: 667215
Speaker 1: I didn't ask you about religion.  You said you're a Christian but--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --like wh- does the family go to church or was there a family church (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother [Marie Foster Whigham] was Catholic, my father [Charles Whigham] was Baptist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm Methodist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So, when you were growing up, did you attend a Methodist church or?
Speaker 2: When I was growing up, I attended Catholic church with my mother which was the Mass at nine [o'clock] and then I'd go to Baptist church with my dad at eleven--
Speaker 1: What was the names of these churches?
Speaker 2: I went, my mother went to St. Bridget's [St. Bridget's Roman Catholic Church], which is in Newark [New Jersey]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and my dad was at Metropolitan Baptist Church [Newark, New Jersey] which he was a chairman of the trustee board for fifty years, and I now attend St. James [St. James A.M.E. Church, Newark, New Jersey] which is directly next door to the funeral home [Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay and that's the Methodist?
Speaker 2: That's the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church.
Speaker 1: A.M.E., okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: St. James, A.M.E.--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --okay, all right.  Okay, so well was that a big part of growing up, I mean going to church?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: If you get out of school on Friday, you did your homework, Saturday I worked at the funeral home, Sunday when my feet hit the floor, I'm going to church, I don't care if I went out partying, didn't get home until two o'clock in the morning, Sunday morning I'm going to church.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay.
Speaker 2: It was just a cardinal rule with my parents.  My grandmother was a staunch A.M.E., that's really how I got to St. James because of my grandmother, staunch A.M.E., and religion and prayer was very, very important in our life, very important.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Family dinner, sitting down, on Sunday, Friday, Monday through Friday we ate dinner every day at five o'clock, regardless of what's going on, Sunday, two o'clock.  We don't have that now, kids don't do that, when people meet, they don't, they don't sit down, everybody--different rooms, TV over here, computer over there, game over there.
Story_ID: 667216
Speaker 1: The riot act occurred the summer, we're back to it again--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but I just wanted to find out like where you were when this happened and what, what, you know, your first impressions of this 'cause this is in your neighborhood [Central Ward, Newark, New Jersey] right?
Speaker 2: That's directly in my--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --very fearful 'cause I've never seen that, I've nev- I've never had that (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can you remember when you first--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Knew there was a riot going?
Speaker 2: Wh- what I remember, what I remember is this, is something flashed on the news and the way the funeral home [Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey] is setup our front windows faced King Boulevard [High Street; Martin Luther King Boulevard] and something flashed on the news and then you--all, all you heard was these big tanks, you know, and they, they make a tremendous amount of noise and they're coming over King Boulevard and you're hearing people blowing their horns because they're taking up the whole doggone street and these, these tanks are coming across the streets.
Speaker 1: So it must have---the riot must have been well, or the rebellion as some say--
Speaker 2: It happened in--
Speaker 1: --was well underway--
Speaker 2: Well, well it, it happened--
Speaker 1: --by the time the tanks showed up?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Because the riot started in the, in the early evening, it was during the morning time-
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --so by the time it got out of hand because what you need to remember, is that once the riot started--they started burning right away, they were starting to vandalize and breaking windows and robbing and burglarizing, that started right away and that's when the government I guess said bring the troops in and then they (unclear).
Speaker 1: So were they, was, was the crowd--
Speaker 2: Very hostile.
Speaker 1: --were they pinpointing the white businesses or--?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what's gone now, all of Springfield Avenue, all of Springfield Avenue, all of Prince Street, all of that is gone, that was totally white, even going all the way down to Broad Street which is the main street where the city hall [Newark City Hall, Newark, New Jersey] is, that was totally white, that's like a mile to a mile and a half of all white owned businesses.  Only, remember I said Mrs. Stewart [Amelia Stewart] was the only one that owned a Afri- was the was the only African American--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --person on Prince Street, so not only did you have Springfield Avenue, they were rioting on Prince Street, anything that was white owned was being destroyed--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and you know they ain't gonna go for that.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: They ain't gone go for that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, they--as you said it is a segregated city--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --if not physically, it's segregated in terms of opportunities?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's correct.  And they you'll, you have to also remember you, you still had the racial profiling going on, you still had the cops pulling people over.  So, it was a co- a community--an abundance of stuff that had occurred, you know, and, and I--they were tired, you know, we were tired of being taken ad- you had, you had women that were being molested and raped, you had killings that were going on that nobody was investigating--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you had, you had a lot of things that were just piling up and enough was enough.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think once that cab driver [John Smith] went down that was--I think that put cherry on top of it (unclear) (Simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  So, it didn't--did any of the burning or looting get close to your funeral home?
Speaker 2: Three doors, (laughter), three doors, they didn't bother us but they were very close, three doors away the building was on fire.
Speaker 1: I didn't ask you before but, was there a black paper in Newark [New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Like I know that--
Speaker 2: --the New Jersey Afro-American, that it was called.
Speaker 1: Okay so--
Speaker 2: Afro-American--
Speaker 1: --it was associated with the Murphys' Afro-American [Baltimore Afro-American; Afro-American Newspapers]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: That was, that was the black paper and then you also at that time, it's, it's now gone, was the Newark Evening News newspaper.  So, you had the North Star--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --Ledger [sic. The Star-Ledger], the Afro-American paper and you had the Newark Evening News.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those were our three forums and most of us read the Afro-American paper, that was the most popular paper among--
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: --us as blacks.

Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna jump back to college [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] again, I'm doing a--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --lot of jumping but--
Speaker 2: That's okay.
Speaker 1: --but did you have a favorite professor or--?
Speaker 2: Mr. Turner [ph.], he taught me my business classes, that's Dr. Turner.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Colonel, he was a colonel, he was a retired colonel, he's deceased now, Colonel Turner was my favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was also my counselor--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --he was a good guy.
Speaker 1: Now did you major in business?
Speaker 2: I majored in business.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yep.
Speaker 1: So you were ready when you left (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I sure hope so, (laughter).
Speaker 1: So what mortuary school did you attend?
Speaker 2: I went to American Academy [American Academy McAllister Institute of Funeral Service] which is right here in New York City [New York, New York] and when I graduated from there I was the most outstanding stud- I was the oldest student in my class, but I was the most outstanding student.  I had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now that's interesting. Now you were one of the older students at just twenty--
Speaker 2: No see, there's a little loop in there--
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Story_ID: 667218
Speaker 1: All right, what happens?
Speaker 2: When I left Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia], I turned around and got married and moved to California for ten years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I lived in California for ten years, had two children [Steveland Whigham and Kara-Lynn Whigham].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I came back and went to mortuary school [American Academy McAllister Institute of Funeral Service, New York, New York] when I divorced him.
Speaker 1: All right now, in terms of--let me ask this question 'cause in, in terms of--you're married to a female [Terry Fields Whigham], now right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, did you growing up, did you have any sense of--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what was your sense of gender identity?
Speaker 2: Gay.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you knew?
Speaker 2: But because of my parents--
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, I--
Speaker 2: --I got married 'cause of--I, I got--I'm, I'm telling you the truth, I, I got married because of my parents--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because at that ti- my father [Charles Whigham] and mother [Marie Foster Whigham] were totally unreceptive and I would tell them, "I, I, I, I, I like girls, I like her," and then the punishment.  You know how many times I've been punished for saying that?  Yeah, I mean, there was an incident that, I went to my mom and dad and I shared with them how I felt, and my father actually literally beat me and he beat me--so--not, not a, you know, not to hurt me but to spank me, beat me--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but he got so overwhelmed in beating me that he had a heart attack, (laughter) and I'm like, "You're gonna kill yourself, trying to convince me what I'm not."  And I, I no longer would discuss it with him, I just--I, I went on a cruise, I met a young man on a cruise and I said, "You know what?  If this is my way to get away from them--," I knew he lived out of state, that's what I'm going to do.  So, I got married, moved to California, had two children, lovely kids, best thing I could have ever done, after ten years I knew he was cheating, I let him go, came back to New Jersey, enrolled in mortuary school.
Speaker 1: That seems like a rough emotional ride?
Speaker 2: It was--
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: --a roller coaster.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was a roller coaster.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Because, you know in your heart, you know what you want, you know what you feel, and you're doing, you're doing something to please others, which is something I would never do again.  If it caused me to lose my relationship with my parents, to me my, my mental state was more important, it would be more important to do it the right way than the way I did it.  But I wanted it.  Like I told, my dad was my idol, and because he said no, I, I accepted what he said, despite how I felt.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I--
Speaker 2: So I punished my own self.
Speaker 1: --I know I've almo- always been amazed at the depth of feeling that people--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --have around--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I punished myself for him.
Speaker 1: --around gender issues--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: --to the point where, you know, churches--
Speaker 2: Shut the door?
Speaker 1: Yeah and, and if you wanna find some game in, you go to church--
Speaker 2: They're singing in the choir--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right (laughter).
Speaker 2: --everyday.
Speaker 1: Everyday.
Speaker 2: Everyday.
Speaker 1: And yet, how can--it, you know?
Speaker 2: But they do--
Speaker 1: The, the level of--
Speaker 2: --they do--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, and you know what?  They be- it becomes that they're mean with it, and, and I'm, I'm the first one to say, "But I didn't ask you, who did you sleep with last night?  It's none of my business."  But what tends to happen, when you talk about people being in an alternative lifesty- lifestyle?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You know what they do?  Their first thing is that they go to the bedroom, get out the bedroom, why can't just two people care about each other, get, come out of my bedroom, and just deal with two individual people that care for each other.  Forget about who is what, but they don't, they jump right into that room and I'm like, y'all need to stop.
Story_ID: 667219
Speaker 1: I guess in, in looking back at all, I mean at the whole thing, do you think that things have gotten better today than they were?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, I would say 90 point--in comparison when I was growing up?  Absolutely, it's, it's--not that everyone accepts it, but at least it's recognized--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --that people will say--you're gonna still have some that are haters, you're gonna have them, but at least I find even in the churches, it's a little better, not all churches, not all churches, but it's a little better.  You--there, there're certain cities that you're more receptive to be more welcome in then you are in other cities.  The islands, don't, don't go to Barbados and, and try to act like you're gay, 'cause they'll kill you, don't go to Jamaica, they'll kill you.  But, but you can turn around and go to Tahiti [French Polynesia] and they won't bother you, (laughter), it's the mindset.  And it, and it generally most of the time comes from, I call it male testosterone, you know?  They just like, "I'm the one, I'm the dude, you can't be that."  "I'm not trying to be a dude, I just wanna be me, accept me as I am, I like a woman, don't, don't like all of 'em, I just like this one, leave me alone," (laughter), "leave me alone."
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the, I don't know if the major--well which--do you--what do you consider the major misunderstanding in, in this?  'Cause I, I've talked to people who think that gay people are made in some kind of clandestine--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --you know, illicit way--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --by some older person and they don't have a sense that they actually have these feelings from--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --birth, so they, they figure it's some kind of anomaly that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --a trap or something that somebody has stumbled into--
Speaker 2: No, mine is from birth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mine is from birth. I've always been a tomboy, you could ask any of my friends, I've always--when, when I talked about playing stick ball?  I'm talking about playing stick ball with the dudes, when we would play cowboys and Indians [Native American], I never wore a skirt, I always had a pair of pants on and you know my, my cowboy suit on and my cowboy hat and my gun and holster, I, I've always done that role.  So, for me to be anything different it, it was a, it was a struggle, you know, for me. I never, I never--I wore skirts to school, but when I got home the first thing I did was put pants on, and, and to me it was so obvious that with my parents [Marie Foster Whigham and Charles Whigham], what I said to you earlier on Saturday morning I would get up and be dressed--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --let me describe my outfit: black slacks, white shirt, tie, black jacket.  This is at the age of six and seven years old. Come on daddy, read between the lines.
Story_ID: 667220
Speaker 1: It must have really--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --been a--
Speaker 2: --it was hard--
Speaker 1: --mental problem for--
Speaker 2: --it was hard--
Speaker 1: --him to figure out--
Speaker 2: --and, and I--
Speaker 1: --with the (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --would go with my grandmother, his mother was, was really my confidante and I would say, I'd say, you know, "Grandma why, you know, grandma why does he--," you know what she'd say to me?  "'Cause you're strong, you'll get through this, you're strong willed, you'll get through it."  And, and that, that--it mean--it may mean nothing to others but just her saying to me, "You're strong willed, you'll get through it," allowed me to endure a marriage relationship, allowed me to endure childbirth and allowed me to come back to where I wanna be.  And I am happy as I am and I would never go back, I have no regrets, I have no regrets about my marriage, I have no regrets about my childbirth, I have no regrets about being married.  But I am the happiest I've ever been and I have a wonderful partner, wonderful partner that is--she's a funeral director, supportive, she--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --she has four children, I have two [Steveland Whigham and Kara-Lynn Whigham], but we have a total of six, ten grandchildren, she has, I have one, we have a total of eleven grandchildren.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: We are one and when, you know, they say behind every great man, there's a great woman?  Well behind this woman, is a greater woman--
Speaker 1: Okay, (laughter).
Speaker 2: --'cause she just, she pushes me.
Speaker 1: N- now did your father [Charles Whigham] ever--
Speaker 2: Meet her?
Speaker 1: --reconcile this with him?
Speaker 2: Before his death?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Let me tell how, let me tell you how good God is.  My father got ill and when my dad got ill, my dad came to live with me and my partner and we're the ones who took care of him.  When my mother [Marie Foster Whigham] got ill, same thing, my mother lived with us and my partner and I took care of my mother.  And at the end of my mother's life, because my mother was harder on me than my dad--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --on her death bed, the night before she died I arranged for all of her grandchildren to fly in from California, all of 'em to come see her.  That ni- the doctor had said to me, "It's only a matter of time, her breathing is shallow," so I arranged for them to come, I didn't go see her that night, that morning at 6:30 in the morning I go to the hospital, I walk in the room, she's awake, I say to her, "Mom you've seen all the grandchildren, if you're ready to go, I'm okay," she says to me, "I'm sorry," and takes her last breath. Let me tell you what I can do with that sorry, I can put it in any category of my life: how you treated me, how you denied me, how you did not accept--I'm good, I'm good.  The fact that she said, "I'm sorry," I don't know what she meant, but I can take it and I can place it on any of my pain, I'm good.
Speaker 1: She knew--
Speaker 2: She knew--
Speaker 1: --she knew, yeah.
Speaker 2: --yeah, she knew.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's something.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, well I'm glad I asked about that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --we so, it must have take- taken a lot of courage to get married under the circumstances?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know?  I mean, and a lot of love I guess--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --for your family to, to do that.
Speaker 2: When I finished mortuary school [American Academy McAllister Institute of Funeral Service, New York, New York] and got my license, churches knew, ministers knew about my lifestyle, everybody knew, not that I flaunted it--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but I wear men's clothes, women suits, I don't wear skirts, and in the beginning, would they shun me?  Absolutely.  But I showed them I know my stuff, I know how to run a funeral, I know how to carry myself, I don't flaunt my lifestyle, my children have never seen anything beyond myself and Terry [Terry Fields Whigham] holding hands, never seen anything else 'cause there's a time and there's a place for everything.  And just like they want respect?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I want respect.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Now, if I stoop down to a different level?  Then what am I displaying to my children?  So, I have earned my respect in my community and there is not a minister or anyone that could ever say I've done anything to disrespect them or for them to say I'm out of line. And I'm good with that.
Story_ID: 667221
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were married and living in California for, you said--
Speaker 2: Ten years.
Speaker 1: --ten years?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, when you came back you're ear- early thirties?
Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Thirty-three.
Speaker 1: And then that's when you go into (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Went to mortuary school [American Academy McAllister Institute of Funeral Service, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: --mortuary school, okay.
Speaker 2: And I was the oldest dog in the class (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Laughter) All right now that's, that makes sense now.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes.
Speaker 1: Because you, you may be the oldest one.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now typically though, how old are people that go to mortuary school?
Speaker 2: Eighteen, nineteen years old, straight outta high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because th- at that time, all you required was a high school degree.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You didn't require college. Now they require college, the requirements have changed.  So basically, what you had is the kids whose parents owned a funeral home and shut their mama and daddy's mouth up, they enrolled in mortuary school, but they had no love for this.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I mean it, it's obvious, I mean they, it was a game to them in school.  These, there were maybe outta my class of sixty-six kids, maybe thirty of us were serious, the others, just to shut mommy's mouth or mommy said you gotta get out, you just can't lay around the house.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I--this, this career it's, it's, it's different than any other career, you're on call twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, you get a day off every now and then.  But if they call and ask for you, you can't say I'm not--it's not like a doctor, a doctor, you know, it's closed on Wednesdays, you think--I don't care, you, you could be deathly ill, you gone call 911 or you're gonna go to the emergency room, but he's not going to come and meet you--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --it's not like that in this career. If they call for you, you gotta show up.  If somebody die in the house at two o'clock in the morning and they say, "Carolyn [HistoryMaker Carolyn Whigham] are you coming?"  What I'm gonna say, no?  "Yes, I'll be there. I'm on the way."  It's what it is and I love it.
Speaker 1: Well giv- give us a sense of the size of the operation, I guess, at Whigham Funeral Home [Newark, New Jersey], you got a--you still have one of the biggest spaces--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --if not the biggest--
Speaker 2: We do.
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: We have the largest, we have the largest space.
Speaker 1: And what does that mean in terms of the--?
Speaker 2: Our seating capacity of our chapel is about two hundred and fifty people which is not typical for an average African American owned funeral home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We have parking that accommodates over seventy-five cars on our lot--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --and we--
Speaker 1: --the, the--
Speaker 2: --have other lots.
Speaker 1: --the chapel, I guess probably everybody knows this already but--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the chapel I guess is for people who--?
Speaker 2: Would come for the day of the funeral, that's what the chapel is, is--that's where the funeral service would be held or--
Speaker 1: Or--
Speaker 2: --or the viewing would be held.
Speaker 1: Okay, right.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's what that is.
Speaker 1: Right.  'Cause usually the, say Daddy Grace [Marcelino Manuel da Graca] I'm sure was in his church [United House of Prayer For All People]--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, I mean his funeral.
Speaker 2: His funeral was at his church.
Speaker 1: Yeah, his church.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right, and--
Speaker 2: Sarah Vaughan's viewing was at the funeral home.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Her funeral was at her church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nippy's funeral--Nip- Nippy's pe- sorry Whitney's [Whitney Houston] private viewing was at the funeral home, Bobbi Kristina's [Bobbi Kristina Brown] private viewing was at the funeral home, who else was at the funeral home?  Congressman Payne [Donald M. Payne]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --was at the funeral home.  So, I mean eventually they went to the churches for their services but the private viewings were held there.  We have the largest facility, we are the only refrig- only funeral home with refrigeration because our building used to be the medical examiners building.
Speaker 1: Oh?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: So now--
Speaker 2: --when the--
Speaker 1: --I would have guessed that most funeral homes would have refrigeration but--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --that's not--
Speaker 2: It is just the opposite, they don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when the medical examiner was building their new structure, they needed a site and we had just built ours, so we became the medical examiner.  So, not only were we the funeral home, we were also the Essex County medical examiners facility, so, all the autopsies and things were done there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I guess there are like what, people that--a code I guess in terms of how you dispose of the remains of a--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --after an embalming--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You have to meet--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --certain standards?
Speaker 2: You have to meet certain requirements.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, requirements for that?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, and then--okay, so you got the one, the two hundred and fifty seat chapel.
Speaker 2: And then we have--
Speaker 1: Are there other--
Speaker 2: --another viewing room on the other side of the building.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And within the building.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But on--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --the other side.
Speaker 1: Big parking lot?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is it--there's a--
Speaker 2: Big parking lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And--now do you have arrangements with all the cemeteries in the area or--?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yes.  There's some that we do more, more funerals at than others--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but we, we, we accommodate all the cemeteries 'cause that's a choice of the family, that's not our choice.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is, is counseling something that is--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --discussed in--?
Speaker 2: That's new now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Grief counseling, I would say within the past ten to twelve years, grief counseling has come about.  We typically as African Americans don't believe in doing that. It was back in the day that we did it.  You know going to a psychologist and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --therapist and whatever, it's only in the past eight to ten years that it has now--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --that they're doing grief counseling and they do it right next door at my church [St. James A.M.E. Church, Newark, New Jersey], so we, we'll refer the family to the church for grief counseling.  We do what is called, prearrangements where a family member can come in and prearrange their funeral and it's like a lay away plan, they come in and they select what they want, they can put $100 down, five hundred dollars down--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --pay on it, but it allows them that they prepare and plan their own funeral versus after they make their transition, what families have to go through to plan a funeral.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Makes it a little easier.
Speaker 1: Now, I guess what is, what's the most I guess, difficult part of your job?
Speaker 2: Difficult part of my job?  I don't think anything (laughter).
Story_ID: 667222
Speaker 1: I will tell you what was not a good experience for me if I, if I respond that way.  When we did Whitney's [Whitney Houston] funeral, they alleged that we had taken the photo?  That was real hard for me, because we did not.
Speaker 2: Okay so they alleged that you took a photo of--
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a picture of Whitney on--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the front of the National Enquirer of her in her casket--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and it was alleged that either myself or my staff members [at Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey] had taken it.  Tom Joyner went on the radio and said that we took it because the family hadn't paid us.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, you know my attorney called him and he cleaned that up right away.  But again, this is on the radio, this is all out.  So, we were getting negative phone calls, we were getting people threatening us, we were getting st- on the Internet, just phone calls, news media and we knew we hadn't done it, we had it on camera who did, because we have cameras in our building.  I went to Cissy [HistoryMaker Cissy Houston] and Cissy said, "I don't want you to say anything," because who was involved was too close to home, the person who did was a little bit too close to home--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and she did not want it revealed.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So I had to bite the--
Speaker 2: But she knew?
Speaker 1: --bullet.
Speaker 2: But she knew?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: She--who did it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, she knew.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I had to bite the bullet and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --like no, we didn't, we didn't, but yet she wasn't gonna say anything because it--
Speaker 2: And so you couldn't--
Speaker 1: --it just--
Speaker 2: --tell, say--
Speaker 1: --became a bit crazy--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --so I would say out of my entire career, that was my worst experience.  But then we redeemed ourselves because when Bobbi Kristina [Bobbi Kristina Brown] passed, she came to us again.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So that shut people down.  But, you know how people are when they hear something how they take it and run?  But the people who know me said, "We didn't do it."
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Somebody said, somebody said I needed it for the money and I responded back and said, "My father [Charles Whigham] owns a bank [City National Bank of New Jersey, Newark, New Jersey]. I don't need it for the money." (Laughter) I'm a major stockholder, I don't need it for the money, (gesture) but, just the experience of life.
Story_ID: 667223
Speaker 1: You were alluding earlier too, to all the different kinds of funerals there are.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And as many different kinds of funerals there are as families that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, because every family has their--you know, you have some families that are--that don't want an open casket, you have some families that only want a direct cremation, meaning upon the death, straight to the crematory, straight burial.  You have some families that want four and five day services, you know, they want yeah.  You have some families that want a Monday viewing, Hispanic, Spanish people, two day viewing, funeral the third day, typical, very, very typical.  Spanish people grieve very hard, they're very loving and very caring and they grieve very hard and very long, so they like that long stuff, two days viewing and then, next day funeral.  You have Pentecostal funerals; Pentecostal funerals can last six or seven hours--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --they get to praise dancing and get to going, you--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --you can't, you can't shut that Holy Spirit down.  So there's many types of--then, then you have, you know, you have people who are Moorish Americans [Moorish Science Temple of America], Moorish Americans are very--Jehovah Witnesses [Jehovah's Witnesses], very quiet, hour, hour and a half it's done. It depends upon the personalities of the families.  Then you have some people who will whoop and holler from the moment they get to the door (laughter). It just depen- you got to go with the flow.
Story_ID: 667224
Speaker 1: Do you have to--well your employees [at Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey] are--now, what I've noticed in, in funeral homes--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --a lot of big guys employed--that, I don't think they're just to carry the coffins--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --I mean, there's some big guys in there. Is it because of there might be trouble or something or--
Speaker 2: I have--
Speaker 1: --or what was it?
Speaker 2: --no big guys.
Speaker 1: You don't?  Okay.
Speaker 2: My entire staff is female.
Speaker 1: Oh?
Speaker 2: My entire staff is female, and they ain't all gay either, okay (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just let me clear that up.  I find that women have a different passion and compassion with families when there's grief.  They're more sensitive to the needs of someone who's lost a loved one.  They're more sensitive to the widower who lost her husband, and, and to the daughter who's lost her dad.  And I find that, you know, working it's less stress, less drama, women, women listen more attentively than men.  And men don't like a woman telling 'em what to do, you know, we still got that syndrome going on too.  Yeah, you got, you got some men, him and I, we don't rub well, we just don't and I, I, I know it from the moment we come through the door, 'cause I will always say, "I will never ask you to do anything that I either have not done or was not willing to do."  So, if I say to you, "Go change the toilet paper," don't look at me like I'm crazy.  Oh yeah, the you--the mindset of some people, unbelievable.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I--, "You're not paying me to change toilet--." "Well what am I paying you to do?"
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It's crazy.
Speaker 1: In terms of job definition, what are the job definitions in the--
Speaker 2: You have an attendant.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: An attendant is someone who's, who is basically like a greeter, who will greet the family as they come in or greet the visitors and direct them to whatever viewing room or answer any questions.  Then you have what is called, your, your drivers, which is different than the attendant. The driver drives your limo or may drive your hearse.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Then you have your apprentice, your apprentice are those who are training to become funeral directors or, or embalmers, then you have your funeral directors.  Now in the State of New Jersey, a funeral director and an embalmer are the same, you don't get a separate license. In North Carolina, you can be a funeral director but not know how to embalm. In New Jersey you have to do both, in New York [New York] you have to do both. In Pennsylvania, you have to do both, so in the localities here, if you do one, you're licensed to do both.  In the role of a funeral director, it's, it's, it's a couple of hats, you can be the embalmer, you can be the one that dress the casket, you can be the one that sits with the family and makes the funeral arrangements, you can be the one that conducts the funeral, you can be the one that goes to the cemetery, you can be the one that orchestrates or arranges with the minister and the church and the organist or whatever.  It's all of that, write up the death notice, do the statistical part, it's, it's a lot.  It's not just ABC, and everyone is different.

Speaker 1: You have any stories about some of the--I, think, I, I--I know you mentioned some of the celebrities, but--
Speaker 2: There was one story I want to share with you and I have it for you.  There was a gentleman [Vincent Gibbs] who was in the [U.S.] military and he had been diagnosed with cancer and he was preparing his will, but he passed before he completed his will.  His family con- engaged another funeral home in the City of Newark [New Jersey], that held the body for a month because the wife could not qualify to become the exec- administrator of the estate because she had filed bankruptcy, the son was a minor, so therefore the funeral home could not get their money.  I read about it in the newspaper, I called the editor who wrote the article and I asked him, "Can you tell me where this body is? Because I'm gonna go get him, I'm gonna bring him to my funeral home [Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey], I'm gonna prepare him, provide a service for him and have him buried at no charge."  I did such, the on--the African American gentleman, the only thing I said to his wife and son were two things, I told his wife to make sure her son goes on to high school, and finish high school and go to college, I told the son, "You owe me nothing. You respect your mother and make your dad proud."  That's one of the most touching things that I could say in my career that is different.  I have families come to me a lot of times and don't have the money and I'll say, "Go ahead," it's not, it's not always about the take, it's about the give, because when you give God's gonna bless you for your giving and it's not about, oh well, you know I need to make ten thousand dollars on this funeral, it's not about that, it's about the fact that I can go into ShopRite grocery store right now and I can walk every aisle and I have no problem with anyone wanting to threaten me or hurt me, because I know I was right to them, I know how I treated them, I know the compassion and the trust that they felt for me and what I gave back.  Those are things that a lot of us in this career can't say.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I have no fear of where I go, not because I, because I didn't rip anybody off, I didn't tell a lie, and got caught in a lie.  One thing I learned from my dad [Charles Whigham]; tell the truth because if you don't, your lie, you'll forget, but if you tell the truth, it's your memory, but if you tell a lie--what did I say?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh well, did I say this, or did I say that?  So, I've learned that being direct--and, and I tell people, I shoot from the hip, I'm (makes sound), just like that, but that's the best way for me.  Then you don't walk outta here saying, "Well, what did she say?  I didn't understand what she said."
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I take time to explain, and, and I feel that's it's important particularly when people are grieving, they're at a time in their life where they can be taken advantage of, they're at a time in their life where they feel, I've gotta buy this most expensive casket.  No honey, you gave him his roses when he could smell 'em, don't pick a funeral service that next month when public service bill comes, you're gonna be angry because you spent so much money here.  Don't do it.  Other funeral directors may not do that; I do.
Story_ID: 667226
Speaker 1: Well some of the funerals you've handled, you've handled you said Whitney Houston's--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --funeral, Bobbi Kristina [Bobbi Kristina Brown]?
Speaker 2: Yes. Sarah Vaughan--
Speaker 1: Sarah Vaughan.
Speaker 2: --um-hm.
Speaker 1: Amiri Baraka.
Speaker 2: Amiri Baraka, Donald oh Con--Congressman Donald Payne [Donald M. Payne].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Shaq's [Shaquille O'Neal] grandmother.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Queen Latifah's brother [Lance Owens] who was killed on a motorcycle.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Her grandparents, Lauryn Hill's grandmother, from 'The Young and the Restless'--Thomas--T.J. Thomas [sic.] from the Kool and the Gang, his daughter.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: We, we, we generally do most of your white collar and prominent people, we've done Senator Lipman [Wynona Lipman], which is a sen- a New Jersey state senator, your police department [Newark Police Department], your fire department [Newark Fire Division].  We, we are known as--we do not talk on funerals, you will never hear any of my, myself or my staff ever udder a word on a funeral, everything is done by signals.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They're not paying to hear us, they're paying to hear the preacher--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --so there's nothing and when the cars pull up, we don't talk, when we unload the cars, we don't talk, the--everything is done by signal and what we have found and, and, and, I just wanna be real honest and candid with you, this funeral industry is really kind of changing, you're having people who are coming into this career from a different aspect of professionalism.  The ethics of some of the things that they do you, you have the juggling the casket on their shoulder and bringing it down and dancing and taking two steps forward, three steps back like they at the club, would never happen at my funeral home [Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey].  Now we do shoulder caskets, but once it's on the shoulder, it stays on the shoulder 'til it's placed in the hearse.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I've seen funeral homes from, from other areas, not New Jersey, but other states where they'll put the casket on their shoulder and they bring it down and then they bring it here and then they put it back up.  Al Sharpton [HistoryMaker Reverend Al Sharpton] lost his mom [Ada Richards Sharpton], I saw this on YouTube, they literally put the casket on their shoulder and danced three steps up, backed up four steps, but they were dancing.
Speaker 1: So th- this is the staff at a funeral home doing it?
Speaker 2: This is the staff of a funeral home--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --doing this kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: 'Cause at first I mean, I thought you were talking about the pallbearers--
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: --or something--
Speaker 2: No, no, this is the staff of funeral homes.  The--
Speaker 1: --these are unsolicited--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well wh- well you see what's happening, you, you're having people who want to come in this career but are not going to school for training.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: They come in maybe as an attendant or a driver, and they observe and they think they know enough that they go get a building and they open up a funeral home and they're not licensed, but families don't know that they're not licensed.  So, they're paying money to someone who is not licensed, to handle their loved one.
Speaker 1: Is this--does this happen very often?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Wait, I mean, then wh- what is the sta- I mean, the state not doing--?
Speaker 2: The state--well see what they do, they have one person whose license is posted, but that person's not there, he's got a full time job somewhere else, and they're running and operating as a funeral home with the auspices that he's there but he's not there.  So, you know, it's--yeah, it's, it's kind of scary because of what I see the transition that's going on in this career and, and it's, it's not fair because people are paying nice money for, for a funeral, but they're not getting the proper, even the proper care of their loved one.  I mean, embalming is embalming and if the body's not embalmed well, you're paying for someone to be embalmed, you're paying for preservation.  But it, if the preservation's not done well, then there's an odor to the body.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I'm quite sure it--some of your readers will tell you they've gone in funeral homes and the stench has been (pronunciation) unbelievable, not believable, (pronunciation) believable --
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: That's horrible, it's because they don't know what they're doing and every embalming is different, it's based on the size, the cause of death, the medication, how much edema, how much emaciation you have, it's, it's all together; and if they don't have that experience, man that's, that's a no, no.
Story_ID: 667227
Speaker 1: Well who are some of the other funeral directors in, in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In my--
Speaker 1: --Newark [New Jersey], yeah.
Speaker 2: --community? You, you have several.  You have Cotton funeral home [Cotton Funeral Service], been in business for a long time. You have Perry Funeral Home [Newark, New Jersey], been in business for a long time, Churchman Funeral Home [James E. Churchman, Jr. Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey], those are the three prominent ones in Newark.  Then out of the out--in the outskirts you have Woody funeral home [Woody Home for Services, Orange, New Jersey], you have Cushnie Funeral Home [Cushnie-Houston Funeral Home, East Orange, New Jersey], so I would say in our locale there's about twenty of us.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: In the, in the general vicinity of the Newark, Essex County [New Jersey], Union [Union County, New Jersey] area.  Nesbitt Funeral Home I think is one, another one, Smith Funeral Home, and we all--I don't want their cases, I, I, this is my truly belief, if they call me, I'm fine, if they don't call me, I'm not upset, you cannot please a family.  This is where I'm going, suppose a minister refers a family to me [Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and suppose they just don't like me for whatever reason, my personality, my lifestyle, what I do, whatever, I rather they go elsewhere--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --'cause you will never please them.  I don't believe in trying to stay 'cause I want the money, if there's a rift and I know it's not gonna smooth out, listen you owe me nothing, I want you to be pleased while you're going through this grieving stage, you wanna go to another funeral home, it's no problem with me, that's better--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) than fighting.
Story_ID: 667228
Speaker 1: There's a black funeral directors association right?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: What is it called?
Speaker 2: It's called the National Funeral Directors and Morticians Association [National Funeral Directors and Morticians Association, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They're out of Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are, are there, there semi-annual conventions or annual conventions?
Speaker 2: We have, we have a House of Representatives convention [House of Representatives Meeting] which is next month in Montego Bay [Jamaica], and then the national convention is in Myrtle Beach [South Carolina] in August, so we meet twice a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's where all of your African American and Nigerian African funeral homes all get together for five days and we have workshops, we have seminars, we have presentations.  I did a presentation last year, how to conduct high profile funerals; and that was, that was quite rewarding, I did a good job on that.
Story_ID: 667229
Speaker 1: What would be the, a difference in conducting a high profile funeral or--
Speaker 2: Oh goodness, goodness, goodness.
Speaker 1: --or contuc- conducting a funeral for somebody like me (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I'm--
Speaker 2: You're still high profile.
Speaker 1: --semi-profile--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --or whatever--
Speaker 2: --there's a lot involved when you have a high profile funeral, you have to start with beginning security, the first thing is security.  When we knew, when we knew Whitney [Whitney Houston] was coming to us, I'll just give a little history, Cissy [HistoryMaker Cissy Houston] called me and she says, "I don't want anybody to touch her but you. Come to L.A. [Los Angeles, California]," so I flew to L.A. and going to L.A, she was at the medical examiner's office and I met with--Cissy was in Jersey [New Jersey], I met with Gary [Gary Houston], Pat [Pat Houston] and Tyler Perry--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --at the hotel, and it was agreed that we needed to get Whitney back home as quickly as possible but she cannot cross state lines without being embalmed, which is illegal.  So, the biggest thing now was, how do we get her out of the medical examiner's office without the media knowing where we are and what we're doing?  I told--I lived in L.A. ten years, so living there I knew many of the funeral homes.  I called a funeral home that's in Compton, California, I don't know if you know anything about Compton, but Compton, there's not many white people that you're gonna find riding around in Compton, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Compton--
Speaker 1: Cali--
Speaker 2: --California.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, I went to the funeral home and I said, "Look, this is what we need to do, we need to figure out how can we get Whitney out of the medical examiner, we know the media is all down there waiting to see what funeral home is coming to pick her up."  Said, "Let's do this, don't know if it's gonna work but let's try it." I called the medical examiner and I said, "Can you bring her to me, I'm going to do, like I have her, but I'm not gonna have her." He said, "Well I guess that's the best way."  Now, you know, medical examiners--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --don't deliver bodies, they'll take them from the scene, but they do not bring them to the funeral home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, the medical examiner brings her to me at a funeral home in Compton. I'm not licensed in California, so I ob- watch, observe the funeral director do the embalming in California.  So the next thing is, how do we get her to Van Nuys Airport [Van Nuys, California] on Tyler's plane, 'cause by now, they've figured out what has happened, maybe somebody in the medical examiners squealed, we got four different hearses going four different ways, one of the hearses has Whitney in it and we go to Van Nuys, we get her on the plane, we're up in the air, Tyler's secretary calls and says, "It's on the news, she's on your plane, maybe somebody when you have--," remember you have to, you have call letters?  Maybe somebody at the airport figured out the call letters so when we're landing in Jersey, the media knows we're coming.  I leave, when I left Jersey, I told my daughter [Kara-Lynn Whigham] and Terry [Terry Fields Whigham], I said, "Look you know she's coming back here, do what you gotta do for security purposes."  So that's when they put the tents up, so that when she arrove- arrived, you couldn't see her coming out of the hearse.  So that it begins there, security, we knew that when she got--when she got here there would be oodles and oodles and oodles of people so we had them setup with the Newark Police Department that they would come and survey our building and have some surveillances going on.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Then you had to deal with the news media, you know, they're, they're nice people but they're not nice people because they have a job to do.  So, it's involving a lot of people, then you're dealing with the family, how do you get the family in and out without the news media getting to them?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It's a little different than doing John Smith's funeral, John Smith's funeral, well you know?  You might need, you might need traffic control as far as he has a lot of cars for his funeral, but for a high profile funeral it's altogether different, you got, you've got a--when you're sleeping, you're thinking.  So, with me, when I, when I do a high profile funeral, the day of the death, I'm planning the funeral, not the day before the funeral, I'm orchestrating in my mind everything that needs to take place because it's so many different roles and steps that have to take place with it.  It's a lot.
Speaker 1: Hm.  Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's a lot.
Story_ID: 667230
Speaker 1: There was a case in Chicago [Illinois], you may have seen it--pi- a picture in Jet magazine of a young man who was engaged they say in criminal activity, he [Willie "The Wimp" Stokes, Jr.]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --passed away, and at his funeral he was buried with st- stacks of money in his hands--
Speaker 2: Um-hm--
Speaker 1: --so it--
Speaker 2: --like this (gesture)?
Speaker 1: --was like this cross with--yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Holding this money.  I would just think that security of the body is a big, you know?
Speaker 2: Remember you--
Speaker 1: That's why, you know--
Speaker 2: --talked about those big guys at the funeral home?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm quite sure they had 'em.
Speaker 1: Yeah because, okay--
Speaker 2: I'm quite sure they had 'em--
Speaker 1: --'cause some people are buried with--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --gold, with--
Speaker 2: --well let, let me say this, now--
Speaker 1: --expensive--
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: --um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah, very, very true.  Cemeteries are different now, cemeteries require--99.9 percent of them require what is called a vault, a vault--if you take in mind a school box that has--which is larger than the casket, that is placed in the ground first, it's made out of concrete and steel, the casket is lowered into that box and then the concrete steel lid is pulled across.  Now, it's nothing on each end, and this is all you got, can't nobody go down in there and wedge the casket out or open the casket--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --without actually pulling the casket out of the vault.  But you're not gonna get that lid off.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So that's how--but, but at the funeral home [Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey]--
Speaker 2: At the funeral home--
Speaker 1: --if you have a, if you have like a guy--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --like the fellow who--
Speaker 2: With the--
Speaker 1: I, I forget his name, he had a nickname.
Speaker 2: --you, you--
Speaker 1: The--
Speaker 2: --you, listen.
Speaker 1: --money--
Speaker 2: At the funeral home--
Speaker 1: --um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you could have somebody with sticky fingers on your staff--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you could have a family member with sticky fingers, you could have a visitor with sticky fingers, there is an absolute risk when you display human remains with jewelry, or money.  So, what you have to do is that you must either provide security if you wanna cover yourself, or you tell the family.  For us, we provide our own security.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I'm not gonna trust somebody else to cover my back, I'd rather hire my people who I know are saying, "Okay I'm working for you Carolyn [HistoryMaker Carolyn Whigham]. I'm also working for the family, but my main thing is to protect you, that you're not accused of taking anything."  There was a funeral home in my city that the wife died, not mine, not my funeral home, another funeral home, the wife died and she had a beautiful pinky ring.  When they removed her from the hospital, the fath- the husband put the pinky ring on--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --when she was brought to the funeral home, according to him, he knew the pinky ring was on, the day of the inspection, the pinky ring was gone.  Now, between the person who removed the body from the hospital, the person who embalmed the body, and the person who dressed and casketed that body, those are the people he needs to be looking at.  He got the ring back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He got it back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --but that goes to tell you, some people, some family members don't pay attention as to what jewelry your loved one has on at the time of the, of their transposition, you know?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Time of the, their disposition so, you, you need, you need to be astute with that.  I know when my mother [Marie Foster Whigham] died she had her wedding band on, you know?  And I mean, even though we did the removal and all of that, I know it should be on when she came upstairs when she was dressed.  It's the same thing with your loved one, always know, if she got, mommy got a necklace on, either take it off or remember that it's there so that when she's dressed you ask 'em, "Could you check and see?  Can you show me my mother's chain?"
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Or have them remove it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those are, those are heirlooms.  Sometimes people cremate bodies with jewelry, I tell 'em don't do that, pass it on to someone in the family, that's an heirloom, don't do that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would think that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that would make more sense--
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: --actually.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And, and I, I would guess that fans in the case of somebody like Whitney Houston or maybe even Sarah Vaughan--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --would want to take some memento--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --off the body--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --you know?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And bizarre as that sounds, seems, seems kind of, you know, ghoulish but people--
Speaker 2: People will do it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's when we, when we buried Whitney there's three, she has three lids on her, three vault lids, so I don't care if you, if you dig for a little while, you're gonna hit a lid, dig some more there's a lid, there's a lid, there's three vault lids because we know how people are--lookie loos, you know, (clears throat) people who have this fantasy about celebrities will do some crazy stuff.
Story_ID: 667231
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The racial aspect of being a funeral--African American funeral director [at Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --is, like well, correct, correct me if I'm wrong, but funerals are, in the United States are, are one of the, are one of the most segregated times of I guess persons, the industry was like, I mean it's, it's--I mean you're, you're--you hardly ever find a white funeral director with a black body or--
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: --vice versa--
Speaker 2: Let--
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: --me correct you--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --bro.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: My brother, let me help you here.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: I would tell you ten years ago exactly what you're saying is true.  But what is happening now, is a bit flip of the coin, white funeral homes are burying, embalming, and conducting black funerals, black funeral homes are not embalming or conducting white funerals.  What is happening--and, and, it's, it's us.  Most of your funeral homes are in the ghetto--
Speaker 1: The black ones, yeah.
Speaker 2: --the black funeral homes.  So, if you live in a predominantly white area, and your fiends are afraid to come to (air quotes) the hood, they go to the white funeral home, the problem is, there's a difference in embalming someone of white complexion, versus us with a darker complexion, it's called the mixture of the fluids, the colorings in the fluids.  White funeral homes do not have the experience of doing our hair, or our makeup, so they're now beginning to invade our area of the funeral industry and now they're hiring African American staff to come on either to do the hair or the makeup or the embalming, but, the white families are not coming to our funeral homes even if you're in the white area, meaning if you've got a funeral home in Livingston [New Jersey], and you're African American, they ain't coming to you.  It just ain't happening, (laughter), but we will go to them.
Speaker 1: All right that's--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --that's interesting, I was gonna ask if you ever did a white funeral?
Speaker 2: I've done Jewish funerals and I've done white funerals--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but only because they wanted to come to me, meaning I've done in the course of, of my career, I've done five Jewish funerals.  I've done one Ch- Chinese funeral, I must tell you about this one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 667232
Speaker 1: A young lady, well--was Chinese, she was here in this country and her mother and father lived in China.  She was in an abusive relationship and the young man that she was dating stabbed her multiple times. Now what I'm getting ready to tell you, you may have to edit--literally gross, the nipple of his, of her breasts he took and cut them, he went to her vaginal area and cut that out, he took a knife and down here along the fem- along the carotid artery, both side, stabbed her all over, multiple--because she wanted to leave him.  The mother calls my funeral home [Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey] and says, "A friend of mine told me about your funeral home. Will you take care of my daughter and bring her back."  "Bring her back?"  "Yes, make her look like before."  Well, I hadn't seen her.  So, I said, "Well it's based on her condition." "I trust you, you go get her."  I go her from the medical examiner--when I tell you stab wounds face, everywhere, the mother and father come and they say, "We want you to bring her back."  Well when you have wounds like that you have to use a very small suture and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --then wax which is hours, hours, the mother said, "I want to see her in four days." I said, "Okay." We get her prepared and dress her, we bring her to the, upstairs for the mother to see, she comes in, she's pleased, she says, "Now I want to take her back home.  Now when you take her back home, you must talk to her." "Talk to who?"  "You must talk to my daughter." They believe in spirits, "When you drive the hearse to the airport, you must tell her your name and what airport you are taking her to and where she is going and what airline."  So, this was my experience, I've never had this before, when I drove her to the airport, I introduced myself, as I'm driving I'm telling her that I'm taking her to JFK [John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York, New York], she's gonna get on Korean Air Lines [Korean Air Lines Company, Ltd.], flight number whatever, she's gonna fly from JFK to wherever, whatever, when you land your mother, John [ph.] and Mary [ph.] will be there to greet you.  The mother calls me back maybe like two or three weeks later and she's just crying, crying, crying, crying, and I'm like, "Well, what's wrong?"  She says, "I just wanna thank you. My daughter's spirit came to me and said she's okay and that you did talk to her." I could've lied and said I did, she wouldn't have known, but the daughter confirmed what she asked me to do.  That's deep, right?  That's deep.  This career is just, it's amazing, some of the stories--hair would grow on the top of your head some of the stories I could tell you.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: I'm serious.
Speaker 2: --those would be some stories (laughter).
Speaker 1: There's, there's some stories.
Story_ID: 667233
Speaker 1: I had a situation--this is sidebar, mother passed, had two daughters, one daughter had a dependency problem, but she was good to her mother, the other daughter was good, didn't have no alcohol, no drug problem.  The mother makes her transition, and when she does, she names the good daughter as the beneficiary, they come into my office [at Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey], they're making arrangements the good daughter says, "You can pick whatever you want, mama always favored you, you can do whatever you want, I ain't doing nothing."  Now I don't know, I don't know the, the, the characters that are going on here, but I'm sitting behind my desk and I'm trying to figure out.  So, the girl who's kind of nodding in my office says, "It doesn't matter, I just want the best for mommy, I just, I, I, I know I disappointed mommy--," whatever, whatever, she just goes through all of this.  Her daughter says, "Well you do whatever you want," so in my conversation we go through the funeral arrangements and I say, "Well how are you all going to pay for this?"  And daughter, the good daughter says, "I don't know 'cause mommy left me the beneficiary, but I'm not spending a nickel of this policy to bury mommy."  The daughter over here, when I tell you leaped--you ever seen somebody leap when they don't touch the floor?  She literally leaped on her sister and began to beat her down, she beat her, sister got up, fixed her clothes, as she goes through my door, she says, "You may have whipped my A double S, but you still not gonna get the money, I'm not gonna spend a nickel on it, on mommy," and leaves.  The daughter's in my office snotting and crying, "Miss Carolyn [HistoryMaker Carolyn Whigham], what do I do?"  "Pick what you want, what do you want for your mother, when do you want it?  No problem, you don't owe me anything."
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That girl there who took the money, her mama will get her, her mama's spirit will haunt her, just, just the dynamics in this career.  You, you have your lawyers who come in who know everything and don't know nothing, because they're a lawyer they think they know about the funeral business but they don't.  You have people who do, who, who don't name a beneficiary and you--or people who've lost their spouse and don't change the beneficiary.  A wife and husband are married, the husband dies, the wife has named the husband on her policy when she dies--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but she didn't change it, so here's the kicker, the husband had kids out of wedlock, he's dead, he's named as the beneficiary, the kids out of wedlock (makes sound).
Speaker 2: Get the--
Speaker 1: You talking about a war.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And she got kids, too?  So, you got the stepkids and her kids, her kids don't get nothing 'cause she named her husband and it goes to his hei- (laughter) babe, I tell you I'll make hair grow on your head.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Some of the--so- some of the things you cannot imagine.
Story_ID: 667234
Speaker 1: Now what about the, I guess the '80s [1980s], when the crack [crack cocaine] epidemic was hitting Newark [New Jersey] hard and, wh- what was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it like? And with all the gun violence.
Speaker 2: Even now, even now.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Let, let me tell you something.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In embalming, it's called protection, regardless of what the person dies from because what is happening or what has happened in this society, doctors are not always truthful, if you go to your doctor and you have been diagnosed with AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] or the virus [human immunodeficiency virus], and you say to your doctor, "I do not want my medical history divulged," he cannot put that on the death certificate.  He can put on that death certificate that you died from a cardiac arrest or you died from hypertension--
Speaker 1: Or pneumonia.
Speaker 2: --or, or pneumonia.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you really got the virus.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, how we were trained is that you protect yourself at all times, you double glove; you double glove, you're okay.  So, it's never been a fear.  Now when you did have--some funeral homes in my--in, in the New York [New York] area, not in New Jersey, that would refuse AIDS patients--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --they got sued, you can't do that, that's discriminating.  So, if, to me it doesn't, it doesn't bother me, whatever your, whatever your cause of death is--
Speaker 1: There's a lot of confusion in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Especially about--
Speaker 2: Well first of all--
Speaker 1: --how you contracted H- H--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's--
Speaker 2: --it's, it's, it's, it's--once, once it's airborne, you can forget it, you're fine, and if, if, and if you disinfect and do what you're supposed to do, you're okay.  The only way you can do if you cut your finger and matched your finger blood with that blood, then you have the possibility, but other than that, you're all right.
Story_ID: 667235
Speaker 1: In terms of the, the gun violence deaths and stuff, were there, I know there was just a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In, in, in--
Speaker 1: --rise and spike of those--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --during a certain period.
Speaker 2: In, in Newark [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's still up--
Speaker 2: In Newark?
Speaker 1: --in Newark--
Speaker 2: It's still bad.
Speaker 1: It's still bad?
Speaker 2: It's still bad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm doing, I am burying more young people than people over seventy and eighty years of age and that's, that's the sad part of what's happening in our community is that we are killing our own selves, it's, it's black on black, it has nothing to do with the white man right now, it's us, black and black.  And what we have not learned is how to love each other, how to respect each other, we, we, we all got issues, there's nobody, there's nobody out here that does not have issues, what, what I have found in, in, in our community and among ourselves is this.  We don't believe in sharing, if, if I know how to make a million dollars, I'm not gonna tell you, the white man?  Come here let me show you, come here let me tell you, we don't do that, we're very selfish, we're very self-centered, it's all about me.  And what happens is, is that you have some of us who are well educated and we'll grab you by the hand and say, "Come on with me," but you have so many that don't.  But you have so many that once they get it, they don't, they don't remember where they came from and you cannot, you cannot live in this world and be so self-centered and all about you 'cause that's not of God, that's not of God that you, you don't care about your fellow man, you have to.  For me, and, and I don't know whether you know this, there's across the street, the original funeral home, there's two buildings--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --across the street from the funeral home [Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey].  I had the opportunity to sell each one of them for a half million dollars and I refused, I turned around and I converted them, they're now apartments, that I house homeless people, I have homeless families living in my apartment buildings because for the grace of God that could be me, could be my son [Steveland Whigham], could be my daughter [Kara-Lynn Whigham].  We, we, we, we tend not to care about our fellow man, we as parents and grandparents have not taught our children--babies having babies, how, how mama gonna be at the club with her daughter, you know?  How you hanging out?  How you and him, how you and her dating the same dude?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: What is this?  Our values have changed, you, you don't have a thing where fathers are being fathers, not a daddy, a father, father daughter dances, you know how many daughters don't have a father to take them to a father daughter dance?  Or to take them for their first, show them how a fa- a guy should treat them?  It's, it's--where our society is just so different.  And so, what is happening, there's so much anger, these young kids have so much anger and hate and I think a lot of it is their own disappointment in themselves, you know half of them can't read, half can't write.  I, I teach in Essex County College [Newark, New Jersey] and it's unbelievable how these kids will come in a classroom, headsets on, hats on, don't you have self-respect?  You know you're supposed to take your hat off when you come in the building, if you see a lady getting on the elevator, and you got a hat on, take it off.  How you gonna sit in my classroom with ear- did you come here to learn?  "No, my mama said I couldn't sleep on the couch," you know, why, why don't these young kids have jobs?  They, there's a lot of programs nowadays that will offer these kids jobs (unclear) they'd rather stand on the corner and risk getting shot or killed selling drugs, why?  Fast money, fast money, they don't--if I wanted to hire some of these young kids to come work for me, they won't do it, what twenty dollars an hour, fifteen dollars an hour?  "Lady I can make a hundred dollars with one transaction," but look at the risk you're taking, man?  You're standing on the street corner, that could be somebody's territory, and that's generally what's happening with our young people, it's territorial, you in the--you on my corner?  Please, blow you away, there's no conversation about it.  Shoot me, shoot or be shot.  It's wild, it's like the wild, wild west.
Story_ID: 667236
Speaker 1: There's also, and you alluded to this a little bit earlier, but the competition now with white chain--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --funeral companies--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that have encroached into the black community to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --into the ghettos--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --into the hood--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --to get the funeral--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --business.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know much of the same way as the Revlon [Revlon, Inc.] and these other co- companies--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --encroached upon the black hair care industry--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --years ago.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, is that a problem in Newark?
Speaker 2: No it has not been, they have approached me but--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --definitely, you know, I told them no.  My father's [Charles Whigham] in a mausoleum and I said if I ever sold my funeral home [Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey] to a conglomerate, he would ooze outta his mausoleum (laughter) down to King Boulevard [Martin Luther King Boulevard] and kill me.  They have not come in the basic area of Newark, Newark, New Jersey, but they have hit New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They have done--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --they have hit some funeral homes in New York. Some have been, some have been successful so far, but the latest ones that I know about that--out west, it didn't last.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Just, just their, their mentality is totally about the dollar--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --it's not about the quality, it's not about the professionalism, it's about making the, the dollars have to meet and that's the difference.  In this career, it can't always be about the dollars. Sometimes there ain't no dollars, sometime--sometimes there are no dollars and sometimes you have to do, you have to do what is called pro bono.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You have to because if, if you don't do pro bono you're hurting yourselves. Give you, give you an idea, we do welfare funerals but you'll never know it's a welfare funeral--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and I'll tell you why.  My brand new hearse that I used for Whitney [Whitney Houston] is the same brand new hearse that I use for a welfare funeral, my brand new limousine that I used for Bobbi Kristina [Bobbi Kristina Brown], is the same brand new limo that I use for a welfare family, and I'm gonna tell you why.  Mr. Smith might be welfare this week, but Mrs. Smith might die six months from now and she may not be welfare but if I've done that discrimination, and said, "Well I gave him the old equipment but for you I'm gonna give you my new equipment," I burnt my own bridge.  My competitors don't think that way.  They'll give them what is called a cloth casket. Cloth casket is made out of cardboard. I will not let that piece of equipment come in my funeral home.  Number one, when the body is placed in it and that casket is placed in the ground, and a drop of water hits it, it flops open.  I provide what is called a metal casket, which means water, rain, snow, the body is okay.  I sleep well at night, I don't have nothing to haunt me that I've done wrong by giving something that's less expensive, that cloth casket may cost like three hundred dollars, four hundred dollars.  I'd rather give you that I would use for my loved one than to give you that. That's discrimination.
Story_ID: 667237
Speaker 1: In terms of headstones--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --now, I know in Chicago [Illinois], there's one funeral, I mean one cemetery that's almost famous for having almost hardly any headstones.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, it's called Memorial, is it called a Memorial Park [sic. Homewood Memorial Gardens, Homewood, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: I, I don't know it's out in the suburbs but--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --people that didn't make arrangements--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Or died in--
Speaker 2: Now, okay I know what you're--
Speaker 1: Your, yeah--
Speaker 2: --talking about.
Speaker 1: --they, they ended up out there--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I know--
Speaker 2: Non-title graves--
Speaker 1: --there, there's a couple of kids I know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I used to work for a in- independent black school--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and one of the people that worked that at the institution, their son was hit by a car--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --she had no idea--
Speaker 2: No money.
Speaker 1: --that she would have to--and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, the baby was buried out there--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I mean, it was a boy, he was about nine--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and I don't know if he ever got a stone--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know what I mean?
Speaker 2: They're called--
Speaker 1: I--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) those are referred to as indigent burials.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or, non-titled graves.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And that's basically where the, the grave is open, the body is placed inside.  She can probably go back and do what is called a marker--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but not a stone, a marker is like a three by five plaque card.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: She can probably do that, but not a stone.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's the difference.
Speaker 1: So what role does a funeral home play in provid- I mean recommending, you know, monuments and that (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Basically--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --we generally recommend two or three, I don't try to become just biased on one. I generally try to do, if I do recommend someone, I know that they do quality work and that they're a person of their word.  I'm just not gonna give you anybody 'cause they're cheap.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because once you--generally when you order a headstone you have to put a deposit down and you know within that timeframe, three weeks four weeks a month, you're looking for your stone to be down.  So, I don't wanna refer you to Joe Schmo and he take your money and you can't find him six months later.  I generally refer to the same companies that we use on a consistent basis 'cause normally the vault company and monument company are the same.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Same owners.
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: So the same vault company that I use generally does all the stones.
Speaker 1: Okay so you have to have a relationship with a--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --one of those companies.
Speaker 2: Monument company.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: In the cemetery as well I guess, and--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So a lot of different en- entities that you have to--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --interact with--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to--and a ca- case of the celebrity funerals, the police department and the--
Speaker 2: Well, like--
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: --when we did Whitney [Whitney Houston] we had to travel through five different cities to get to her cemetery.  So, each particular municipality we had to, we had to setup--when Bobbi Kristina [Bobbi Kristina Brown] came in, we could not put her, we could not take her to cargo, 'cause see Bobbi Kristina came on a regular plane, Tyler [Tyler Perry] came on--Whitney came on Tyler's plane.  So, when we got ready to get Bobbi Kristina, I had to wrangle with the TSA [Transportation Security Administration] that the funeral home in Atlanta [Georgia] could take her out on the tarmac and get her on the plane.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Because if she had gone through cargo, everybody in cargo would have seen her.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Okay.
Speaker 2: So it's knowing--it's, it's, you know, it's knowing the right calls to make and knowing the right people of who to call.  It's not just pick up the phone and say, "Oh we're just gonna take her through cargo." No she should not go through cargo.
Story_ID: 667238
Speaker 1: When you look back--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --over the years, is there any major move that, that, that you wish you hadn't made or would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You wanna hear the one back here--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --or the real one (laughter)? I, I think if I go back in, in total re- total honesty, I'm sixty-eight years old now, love what I do, but if I could reverse it?  I'd become a medical doctor because of the hours and the demand that it puts on you.
Speaker 1: You know, I never think about being a funeral director as being that demanding in terms of hours.  But what you're describing, I mean--right--
Speaker 2: It's--
Speaker 1: --it's hard to deny that.
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Honestly, I'm telling you, honey, it is not unusual for my phone to ring at four o'clock in the morning, not that I don't have a staff that can't go, but when they say, "Carolyn [HistoryMaker Carolyn Whigham], my husband died, you remember John [ph.], you remember John?"  "Yeah I remem- ." "Well yeah can you come?"  How do you say no?  I've been on vacation and we've had deaths where the family says, "Oh we'll wait for Carolyn to come back."  Well I'm gonna be gone two weeks. "Well no, we don't wanna wait." So I have to fly back.  It's a lot.  If, if, if I had to do it over, I would go into the medical field only because with the medical field I don't, I get a day off, I'm still gonna be, (laughter) I'm still gonna be, you know in it but not as deep as in the--or, or maybe I'd go into education.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Something where at least I have a Saturday and Sunday off.  Do you know in the African American families, Saturday is the biggest day for funerals, everybody want a Saturday funeral, they wanna start at nine and end at three [o'clock], so what do I have left?  I don't have time to go to the cleaners, I don't have time to go to the beauty parlor, I don't have time to get my nails done, there's no life, there's no life in this career and that's why I said to you, everybody can't do 'cause at some point if it does--if you don't have the passion for it, you'll leave.  It's like a preacher, everybody can't be a preacher 'cause you know when you--the preacher, you know, he has people all in his ear, you--, "My husband did this," or, "Preacher I need you to pray for me for this and--," ask your brother, everybody can't be a preacher--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a lot to carry around.
Speaker 2: It's a lot.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And everybody brings their burdens to you--who do you take your burdens to?  Who does he take his burdens to?  It's a--it ain't every day baby, it's not.  So, I think if, if, in hindsight, if I could go back, oh I love what I do, if I could back maybe I would become both, that I could choose, medical field, funeral director, educator.
Speaker 1: Is it just the time factor that makes you think about being a doctor?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or is this, is it because that if--you know, 'cause most people, it's hard for them to get past the squeamish factor and dealing with--
Speaker 2: Squeamish factor don't bother me.
Speaker 1: --and dealing with--
Speaker 2: Don't bother me.
Speaker 1: --a sick person or a dead person?  And I think you have to have the same kind of gumption to deal with either one, right?
Speaker 2: But you know Larry [Larry Crowe]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --it's this, it's the grief 24/7.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I never get away from grief.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, here's an example, yesterday we had four funerals [at Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey], we had--so, that's the first funeral, that's the second funeral, that's the third funeral, that's the fourth funeral, then you come back, you have to make funeral arrangements, you're starting the circle aga- the circle, the cycle, doesn't end.  Nobody is happy when there's death--
Speaker 1: No it's just as--
Speaker 2: --so everything is always an emotional grief thing, then you have to say, how do I remove my emotions from that?  Best friend, classmate, I embalmed and dressed both my parents [Marie Foster Whigham and Charles Whigham], why?  'Cause they taught me and I know nobody could do it better than me.  So, during that whole process, I'm good, you know when I lost it?  At the cemetery, 'cause I knew that was the end, I knew.  So, even, even in dealing with people who we know, or people we don't--you know, when you've got somebody that's really grieving, you can't help but feel it.
Story_ID: 667239
Speaker 1: Now have you ever been a part of a funeral that is like, like a New Orleans style funeral where there's a celebration at the end?
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's different.  But that ain't up here, that's down in New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay so it never happened?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, no, no--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you ain't got--
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: --nobody with a--
Speaker 1: --why I was asking--
Speaker 2: --you ain't got nobody--
Speaker 1: --if anybody here--
Speaker 2: --with no marching band--
Speaker 1: --wanted to--
Speaker 2: --and all that.
Speaker 1: --do that.
Speaker 2: Now we do the horse drawn carriage [at Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey], you know, all of that.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But as far as celebrating that way?
Speaker 1: With the second line and all that?
Speaker 2: Nah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There ain't no second line or third line honey, they ain't doing that up here.  I've seen it, I've participated once but that's not, that's not up here yet.
Speaker 1: Have you ever done a--Afr- African centered funeral where the drummers and, and--
Speaker 2: It--Baraka [Amiri Baraka].
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, they--
Speaker 1: I was thinking--
Speaker 2: --did that--
Speaker 1: --he might--
Speaker 2: --they did that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now I'll tell you something else, depending about what part of Africa they come from, they bang--they damage the casket before it's placed in the ground.
Speaker 1: With the--
Speaker 2: They will take their fist and bang, all into the casket thinking that we're gonna come back and use it.  Gypsies, we've had gypsies' funeral, no baby, baby, gypsies literally take liquor and poor it all over the casket, then they go in their pocket, throw money all in the casket, not inside the casket, the casket is closed, this is down into the grave for when they travel, for when the deceased person travels, they have their money, $100 bills.  Now you can imagine the cemetery people that are standing there and see that, but let me tell you what they do, they stand there while they close it and then they stay there for two days cooking and eating, they bring out little hibachis--yeah put that food out there and they camp out at the cemetery (laughter).  The first time I saw that, I was like, "Oh no don't pour the liquor--," and then I realized, that's their tradition, that's their tradition, they pour that liquor in there--your drug dealers, our drug dealers let--I, I have had bodies in church where the drug dealers have come and put a big weed in the breast pocket or put it in their hand and I'm--and the minister's looking at me like, get that outta here. I'm like--so I have to go and remove it outta respect, because I'm in the church.  They put liquor bottle in caskets.  Our, our young people--I don't know what you say when they come with the bandanas on their head or they have the shirts with the back, with the deceased person's picture on their back?
Speaker 1: Yeah, t-shirts?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the t-shirts--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and all of that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know the, the--a brother I knew in Chicago [Illinois] he said most of his t-shirt business now--
Speaker 2: That's what it is.
Speaker 1: --are funeral T-shirts.
Speaker 2: That's all for funerals, that's what they do, rest in peace, and all of that.
Speaker 1: Yeah and then that--
Speaker 2: Very popular.
Speaker 1: --the whole group that they're in--
Speaker 2: That's correct (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) come wearing the shirts.
Speaker 2: That's correct, and then you have your gangs, you know?  You have your Bloods, and you have your Crips and then cer- certain colors you can't wear, you know?  It's, it's, it's weird--

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Have you ever had violence at a funeral like that?
Speaker 2: Not mine but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where somebody--
Speaker 2: --my competitors--
Speaker 1: --tries to--
Speaker 2: --have.
Speaker 1: --kick over the casket and all that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: My competitors have.  There's a--we're known, "You don't bring that to m--you ain't gone bring that to Whigham [Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey], you can go to other funeral homes."  Just last week at Cotton [Cotton Funeral Service] there was a shootout.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: There, there was a body that he had and they were coming out of the funeral home, it wasn't in the funeral home--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and they had a shootout on the street.  There are some things with me that I don't allow, I do not let the kids come in with their hoods, with the hoodies on, can't come in my building with your hat on.  If you come in I wa- I need to see your face for my protection, my family's here, my kids  [Steveland Whigham and Kara-Lynn Whigham] are here, my spouse [Terry Fields Whigham] is here, "No, you're not coming--you come in I'll need to see your face."  So, if we do get those type of elements of people, they know they're certain things they cannot do.  Share this with you, first gang member I had, it was about ten years ago.  The woman lost her son and she was to pay the money the day of, the day before the viewing, she comes to me and she says, "I only have half." I said, "Okay well, you know, you give me the other half tomorrow prior to the viewing." She comes to the viewing that starts at three o'clock, I say to her--she said, "Well I'll have it before six o'clock," 'cause the viewing is three to five, and then seven to nine.  So, at five o'clock when we're ready to close down, she doesn't have my money, so I say to her, "Well there won't be a seven o'clock viewing 'cause you haven't paid my money." She says, "Oh there'll be a seven o'clock viewing."  "No ma'am, there will not be a seven o'clock viewing, you owe me the balance of the money. Now if you bring it between now and seven, there's no problem."  She goes home, about 6:45, she calls the funeral home, she said, "Miss Whigham [HistoryMaker Carolyn Whigham]?" I said, "Yes?"  She says, "I don't have your money, I will have it by nine o'clock, but if you don't open your doors, go to your window." "Go to my window?"  "If you don't open your doors my son's friends will burn your building down."  I walked out to the window, not inside--I'm inside the building looking out, they had already started around the trenches of the funeral home fires--did I open my doors?  Yes sir, I did and she paid me at nine o'clock that night.  That was my first experience with a drug dealer (laughter), I thought I was tough?  She was tough, she said, "If you don't open your doors for this seven o'clock viewing, they will burn your building down."  I'm like, "They ain't gone do nothing." Well honey, they had started little, little fires along the edge of--(laughter).  Some of the things I have experienced in my career it's, it's, it's, it's mind boggling.

Speaker 1: Tell us about the bank, now you, your father [Charles Whigham] started the bank, did the ban- in '72 [1972]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Right. This is called the--?
Speaker 2: City National Bank of New Jersey [Newark, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: City National Bank of New Jersey.
Speaker 2: It's the first bank, African American owned bank. And the reason why he started it is, is quite funny.  I told you my dad was in the funeral industry, he could not get limousines or hearses, the white people would not rent them to him and he did not have enough money to buy them.   So, he would have a white friend of his who he'd gone to mortuary school to.  (Unclear) engaged the limo and the hearse and then the white guy would bring the hearse to him because he had to be the buffer to get it.  And he was finding out banks were not really being too cooperative in lending African Americans money, so he started a campaign going door to door selling shares of stock at twenty-five dollars a share and within two years, they had the money and they--he opened the bank.  My father has a high school education, there are now six branches, Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], two in New York, Philadelphia, two in New York, three in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Now are, are you involved in the bank--
Speaker 2: My brother [Lemar Whigham]--
Speaker 1: --business?
Speaker 2: --my brother's the secretary on the board, I'm the major stockholder.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: My brother does the bank, I do the funeral home [Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So that solves the question about what--
Speaker 2: That solves it.
Speaker 1: --what he does.
Speaker 2: That--
Speaker 1: He lives out on the farm [Hackettstown, New Jersey]--
Speaker 2: Lives on the farm--
Speaker 1: That--
Speaker 2: --and he goes--
Speaker 1: --but that what he--
Speaker 2: --to the bank as a bank, as--on the board of directors as secretary.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's, it's been, it's been something that's made us very, very proud.  Again, like I said, my dad always had to envision, always had dreams, he, he was anything but a lazy man, anything, to me he was ahead of his time, truly ahead of his time.  And Freedom National, Freedom National Bank came to New Jersey and tried to make it, but they failed.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: That's another black bank but they didn't make it.
Speaker 1: Well, black banks have failed all over the country.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Many were started in the late '60s [1960s]--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --at one time and--
Speaker 2: And they're gone.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They're gone.
Speaker 1: Many were started and--
Speaker 2: So we're not--
Speaker 1: --all over the country--
Speaker 2: --gonna worry--
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Chicago [Illinois] had what, five?  I arrived in 1977, and there are zero now.
Speaker 2: Wow, wow.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a Savings and Loan [Illinois Service Federal Savings and Loan Association, Chicago, Illinois] still--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --open since it's federal, but that's it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's so, it's not easy like Seaway [Seaway Bank and Trust Company, Chicago, Illinois], Independence [Independence Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: That's correct, that's correct.
Speaker 1: --Drexel [Drexel National Bank, Chicago, Illinois], you know?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I could name 'em--
Speaker 2: Gone.
Speaker 1: Gone.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Yeah so, so that's no mean feat?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, does, does that--how much time does that take to deal with?  I mean he's doing mo- mostly--your brother's doing most of it?
Speaker 2: My brother, yeah, he sits on the board.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So basically, and he sits on the L and D, loan and discount committee.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And a couple of others so--I would say he's there four days a week.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Perhaps.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then he has a vending, he does vending machines.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: That's lucrative.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's got 'em in the beauty salons and barbershops so, he's a--he don't, like the funeral industry, my brother will not do this career, he will not do it.  He did it--my brother's five years older now, he did maybe for seven or eight years and then one day he said, "Dad, I can't do this," 'cause my brother wants to come in to work at ten [o'clock] and leave at two; you can't do that in this career (laughter).
Speaker 1: Those are banker's hours?
Speaker 2: Yeah, banker's hours, that's why I say, that's why you do it.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 667242
Speaker 1: We always ask this question--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --when you look back again at your--everything you've done--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in your career to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy as a worker, you know?  As a, as a, as a pro- professional?
Speaker 2: I think my legacy would be that, number one, I've always given, I give back to the community [Newark, New Jersey], I would, I would love to say as a memory of me is that, I was not a selfish person, person.  My children [Steveland Whigham and Kara-Lynn Whigham] and my partner [Terry Fields Whigham] are, are the most important thing to me in my life, I, I believe as far as a legacy is concerned, that I always maintain professionalism, always maintained concern for my, my, my fellow man and, and, and wanted to help my community as much as I can.  Homeless people are very, very important to me--I'll share this with you.  My partner, you won't believe this, my partner prays with the street walkers, she gets out--God has placed on her heart to get up two and three o'clock in the morning to go out and pray with women of the night, telling them that God still loves them despite what they're doing, God still loves them, she gives them care packages that consist of Kleenex, gums, sanitary products, deodorant.  You know, grace of God that could be one of--that could be, that could be one of our kids, that could be one of my grandkids.  I've learned from my parents [Marie Foster Whigham and Charles Whigham] that don't look down on anybody, 'cause the person you're looking down on one day might look down on you and we just never know.  So, I think my greatest, my greatest legacy in my opinion is giving the best that God has allowed me to give of myself to help my fellow man. That's what I would say.
Story_ID: 667243
Speaker 1: Well tell us about your children, 'cause we, we mentioned them before but I don't think we got into too much detail.
Speaker 2: Well we begin with the oldest down, you have the oldest is, Terry's son Aazim [Aazim Sharp]. He lives in Suwanee, Georgia, then it's my son Steve [Steveland Whigham] who lives here in Harlem [New York, New York], then it's my daughter Kara [Kara-Lynn Whigham], who's a licensed funeral director with me [at Whigham Funeral Home, Newark, New Jersey], then it's Chasity [ph.] who lives in Upstate New York, then it's Chad [ph.] who, hit by a train in 2007, lost his leg, a moving train going sixty miles an hour and all he did was lose his left leg at the knee, no damage to his face, no damage to his body, that's God.  And then the youngest is Nyle [ph.], Nyle is working on his Ph.D. at Princeton University [Princeton, New Jersey] right now. He's twenty-two years old. (Laughter) That's our kids.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 667244
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I know what I said a little bit earlier, learn to respect each other, we, we've got to, we've got to get better--we cannot, we, we can't to me, we can't get any worse, we are tragically taking lives, we're having situations where we're not respecting or loving each other.  I, I, I, I hope even, even with the situation that we have going on in the White House, we know that's not--we know he's [President Donald John Trump] not our friend.  So, we need as, as African American people, we need to come together and become united, we need to learn to vote, not just for presidential stuff, the little stuff that's going on in our community, we need to go to these school meetings, we need to speak up about the education that we want for our kids, we need to talk about having the libraries open.  The average kid, when I, when I teach at Essex County [Essex County College, Newark, New Jersey], the average kid does not know how to go to the library and look up a book. What they do, they go to the computer and go to Google, they don't even know how to spell, they go to Google.  We--these, these electronic things have enhanced us in one way but then they've limited us in so many other ways.  We, we, we don't know how to do a paper, we can, we can, we can go on Google and call an agency to pair, prepare a paper for us and we'll turn it in as a thesis or a term paper.  So, the modernization has it helped us?  To a point, but then we've lost, we've lost sight of so much of what we as kids--we know about the three Rs--we know how to read, write, we know the purpose of knowing why we need to know how to count, so then when we go to the bank, and we put that money on the counter, we don't have go twenty, forty, we, we know, five twenties is what? A hundred dollars.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: These kids now a days, they don't.  So, what, what I would love to see and it would have to be and it would have to be a, a, a, a total turn around, but it could happen is my generation extending that hand to the younger generation and saying, "Okay, I may not agree with how you dress 'cause your pants are down and you, you're letting 'em sag and, you know, you, you, you got some weed [marijuana], got some weed on you and you're, you're smoking some wine, but come on baby, come on here with me, let, let me show you something, you know?  Let, let me show you how to really be a father, let me show you how to be a good leader, a good man, let me show you how to read, let me--." To the ladies, to these girl--how some of these young ladies dress, you don't, you don't have to wonder what they look like, they showing it to you already?  Just our values, I, I, I want, I want us to have more pride than what we have.  Maybe that's all I need, just saying--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I just want, I want us to regain our pride because we don't have pride, we don't have--we're not proud anymore, they say we do what we wanna do, they don't give a crap.  You get on the bus they cuss like they're Popeye and--man I'm old enough to be your grandmother.  First of all, you need to have some self-respect, but they don't have it.  So, a lot of it begins with us and, and not being fearful, they know when you're afraid. I'm not saying go there and grab 'em in their chest, but come across with--you, you, you, you know, you can get honey from a bee by not swatting at it, you swat at it it's gonna, it's gonna sting you.  But there's a way that I feel we, as an older generation, we as African American parents and grandparents can do a little bit more than what we're doing and not just be so self-centered on us: "It's not my problem, it's not my kid." No it's not your kid but it's your neighbor's kid, we get stuck there, it's not my problem--, "Well you, oh that's not my son." My son [Steveland Whigham], a prime example of me, none of my kids do drugs, none of my kids smoke. Oh yeah they drink, but I mean not to excess.  But because mine are perfect, do I just walk away?  No, that's when we've got to go out and extend that hand and help them; and there's room for it, there's room for growth, that would be my scenario.
Story_ID: 667245
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I have, haven't asked you from neglect or ignorance that--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --you can, (laughter) you can, that you think that, that you wanna say that I, I just haven't thought of before?
Speaker 2: Not really--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I think we kind of hit everything.
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: I bounced around but I think we kind of hit it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And it was a good interview.  And the last question you already answered it--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but, I'm gonna ask it again--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --just so anybody trying to pull a clip out of here will be--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --will be able to do it.  It's this, it's similar to the legacy question but you said it yourself, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: You know, I've already planned my funeral, just so you know, my flan- my plan, my funeral's already written, documented and orchestrated.  It's not so much about remembering me, but I think legacy and whatever is to remember me as a person that was, number one genuine, honest, compassionate, love what I do, giving honestly and a love for my career, a true love for my career and that I believe in doing and helping others, it's not just about me, it's being there for those who are less fortunate, or fortunate, knowledgeable or unknowledgeable, I believe in loving and sharing and I think if we--if I go that route, that's the best route I could go.
Speaker 1: All right well thank you very much.
Speaker 2: You're welcome, thank you, God bless you.
