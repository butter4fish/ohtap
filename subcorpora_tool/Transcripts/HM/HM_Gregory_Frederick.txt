Before that I ran the space flight program for NASA.  Before that, the space flight--the safety program for NASA.  Before that an astronaut.  Before that, a test pilot.  And many, and during this time, I was still an [U.S.] Air Force officer.
Speaker 1: What's today's date?

Speaker 1: A few People magazine style questions, just to get you relaxed a little bit.  What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Oh, jeez, I suspect blue.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I like spring and summer.
Speaker 1: What about a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: At this moment, cruises.  I don't care where they go (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite saying or quote?
Speaker 2: I would guess that it would be: you are significant and you will contribute.
Story_ID: 629103
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your family.  Tell me your parents' names?
Speaker 2: My parents are Francis [Francis Gregory] and Nora Gregory [Nora Drew Gregory].
Speaker 1: So tell me about mother, Nora.  What is her full name, including her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Her maiden name is Nora Drew.  Her full name is Nora Gregory with no middle initial.
Speaker 1: Tell me about her.  Where was she born and when and?
Speaker 2: She was born in Washington, D.C. in 1913.
Speaker 1: Did she share any early childhood memories with you about her family and life in D.C.?
Speaker 2: Oh, she shares them all the time (laughter).  She talks about growing up in Foggy Bottom in Washington, D.C. until she was about seven, and then she, she and the family moved to Arlington, Virginia where she lived until she married my dad.
Speaker 1: And what year was that?
Speaker 2: The late 1930s (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she come from a big family?
Speaker 2: She had two brothers and a sister.  She had another sister who died very young.
Speaker 1: And tell me about her parents a little bit, any memories there, their names?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was grandma and grandpa [Richard Drew], and I never knew grandpa (laughter) because he died, I think in 1938.  But my grandmother lived until early '60s [1960s], 1960s.  And she was just an absolutely amazing person.  She was the most charismatic person I've ever met.  And as such, she attracted lots of folks, just to come and sit on the porch to talk with her.
Speaker 1: What did she talk about?
Speaker 2: Anything you wanted to talk about.  She was educated at Howard University [sic. Miner Normal School; University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.].  I believe that she graduated about 1900 or 1901, in that time frame.  But she never used that education except to raise her family.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Nora, she was Nora Gregory also, I'm sorry, Nora Drew [Nora Burrell Drew] also.
Speaker 1: And do you know around what time she was born, what year?
Speaker 2: About 1880.
Speaker 1: And she was also born in D.C.?
Speaker 2: She was born, I think she was born in D.C. also.
Speaker 1: Do you know what she studied at Howard?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  I have no idea.  I suspect that it would have been a liberal arts program, but I don't know that for sure.
Speaker 1: And her husband's name?
Speaker 2: Grandpa (laughter).
Speaker 1: Got you.  That's what I call my grandfather as well.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And tell me about your mom's siblings?
Speaker 2: Well, she had two brothers and a sister.  The older would have been Charlie Drew [Charles R. Drew], next down would be Joe Drew [Joseph Drew], and then Eva Drew [Eva Drew Pennington].  And let's see, Charlie Drew was a doctor, chief of surgery at, when he died, he was chief of surgery at Howard, Howard University.  Joe Drew was an educator, teaching in the high schools in Washington, but also a swimming coach, football coach and football referee.  And Eva was a teacher, and was a teacher in the Washington school system.
Story_ID: 629104
Speaker 1: Your [maternal] uncle, Charles Drew [Charles R. Drew], was a pretty significant figure in American history.  Tell me what you remember about him?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, he was Uncle Charlie.  And he died when I was nine.  He died in 1950, I know that.  He had four kids and to be honest with you, I did not realize who or what he was when he died.  And it was only after that, that I began to understand his history.  I knew that he was a doctor at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and that, Easter of that year, I had spilled hot water on my arm, and I was immediately taken to him.  And he was going to fix it when he returned from the trip that he died in the auto accident.
Speaker 1: Do you remember getting the news about his death?
Speaker 2: I'm certain I remember, I remembered more of the funeral.  I can remember the reaction that my mom [Nora Drew Gregory] and dad [Francis Gregory] had and the rest of the family because the family was very close.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the reaction?
Speaker 2: I, it was obviously disbelief and sorrow.  And it was a, it was a vital part, he was a vital part of the family.  And so it was as though we had lost a pillar in the, you know, the support system that all of us had.
Speaker 1: What's the story family members tell about that trip to North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Well, I know that he had had a full day in Washington [D.C.] and left very late.  And as I understand it, he was driving--actually, I don't know that.  But there was an accident, and he was severely injured, taken to a local hospital where the best medical care that could be provided was provided, but unfortunately, he died.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the stories about your Uncle Charlie, about his work at Howard University?
Speaker 2: Well, I know about his work at Howard University, but I also know about his work when he was at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], during which time he had learned about the preservation of plasma.  I think the other most significant thing was that there was a reluctance in America to use it because of the possibility of mixing racial blood.  And so the only place that he could do that would have been in Europe.  And he did that in England.  And he has been given credit for developing something like the blood blank.  I don't know whether he called it that, but I suspect he did because his first child he called Bebe [Bebe Drew Price], and I am told that Bebe reflects blood bank.  It was after the war [World War II, WWII], however, that he was able to come back and transfer that knowledge and that capability back to the United States.  Now, this is hearsay, family talk on my side and there may be (laughter) other interpretations of it.
Speaker 1: Was the family, well, I mean he died a very young man.
Speaker 2: He died a very young man, yes.  When I look at how old he actually was when he died, and then I look at the accomplishments that he had up to that point, I wonder what great things he would have done after that.  He went from Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School] which was a very, very good high school in Washington [D.C.] in teachers who were brilliant but had been unable to get jobs in industry or government or anything because of their race.  He had that kind of training and then went from there to Amherst College in Amherst, Massachusetts where he was an outstanding football player, captain of the team, and captain of the football team.  And it's interesting because he came back to Howard to try to get a graduate degree and they wouldn't admit him because he was lacking an English course of sorts.  And so he went to McGill University in Canada [Montreal, Canada] for his medical degree.  I think that's ironic (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And eventually he came back and became chief of surgery at Howard.
Story_ID: 629105
Speaker 1: Are there any sort of family outing narratives you can recall?  We hear of the Charles Drew [Charles R. Drew] who is the founder of the blood bank, but you knew him as a young child, as your [maternal] uncle.
Speaker 2: Well, he was just Uncle Charlie to me.  And I suspect when I first heard about Dr. Charles Drew, I wondered who that person was.  Again, it was, it was late in, it was later that I realized what he had done and his accomplishments.  But I was an only child and his kids were like my siblings, and we spent an awful lot of time together.  After Uncle Charlie died, they, my cousins came and stayed at our home in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] for a period of time until the arrangements could be made, until my Aunt Lenore [Lenore Robbins Drew], who was Charlie's wife, had settled the affairs and the, and all of the activities that occurred after death.
Speaker 1: And who are his children?
Speaker 2: Bebe [Bebe Drew Price], Charlene [HistoryMaker Charlene Drew Jarvis], Sylvia [Sylvia Drew Ivie] and Charlie [Charles R. Drew, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Do you remember holidays around the house with Uncle Drew and your cousins and, I mean Uncle Charlie and your cousins and your other aunts and uncles?
Speaker 2: The family, our dining room table would seat about six or eight people.  And so the dinners that we would have would be generally with one of the families.  I remember things like Thanksgiving dinners and Christmas dinners.  And what I do remember though I can't tell you exactly when, my cousin Bebe and I would generally get hysterical at the table, and we would get under the table and laugh.  And we remained very, very close.  But other than that, that's about my recollection.
Speaker 1: Was it a tight knit family?
Speaker 2: Very tight, yes.  And that, of course, was a bond that was established with my grandmother [Nora Burrell Drew] and the family as they lived in Arlington [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Can you tell us more about your mother's [Nora Drew Gregory] side of the family?
Speaker 2: Oh, her father [Richard Drew] was a carpet layer and was a member of the union, which was extremely rare for a Negro to be a part of it.  In fact, my mom tells me that he was told many times that when he left, when he stopped being a carpet layer, there would not be another Negro in the union.  But apparently, he was very successful and obviously recognized as a leader in that particular carpet layers' union.
Speaker 1: Have they told you stories about your great-grandparents on your mom's side?
Speaker 2: I, my mother, I'm sorry, my wife [Barbara Archer Gregory] has done extensive genealogy work, and she would be much more capable of telling those stories.
Speaker 1: Sure, you, have they passed on stories about slavery at all or?
Speaker 2: No, it would be difficult in that family to define when slavery occurred or actually, if it occurred. In many cases, they were, what the, what my wife has found is that in that family of the--most of the people were free people of color.
Speaker 1: Has she told you any of the details about the free people of color in your family?
Speaker 2: You'd have to talk to her.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: But she has been able to trace generations back.  And the Drew family is difficult to trace because it suddenly appears.  And there's not a lot of history though she has, and she's a very thorough researcher.  We can give you that.  We can pass on those, you know, some of the research that she's done.
Speaker 1: Were there members of the Drew family who passed at all?  Could people pass for white?
Speaker 2: I would, I'd, you know, I don't know what that means because they were listed as free people of color or mulattos and obviously, I don't know what color a mulatto is (laughter).
Story_ID: 629106
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father's family.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Your father, when was he born and where?
Speaker 2: My father was born, I believe in 1907, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania which he was very, very proud of.  He was an educator.  He went to Case Institute [Case Institute of Technology] in Cleveland [Ohio], which is now Case Western Reserve [Case Western Reserve University].  He was an electrical engineer student, undergraduate.  Taught for one year each in Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and at North Carolina A&T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] and then went to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] for his master's degree.  He also was unable to receive any, he could not work in the government or industry and so he became a teacher in Washington [D.C.], taught electricity in two technical high schools, Phelps [Phelps High School; Phelps Architecture, Construction and Engineering High School, Washington, D.C.] and Armstrong [Samuel Chapman Armstrong Technical High School; Armstrong Manual Training School, Washington, D.C.] high schools.  Phelps is still here.  Armstrong closed many years ago.  And he was, eventually became principal and then assistant superintendent of school in Washington.  But he was also educated in Washington at Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School].
Speaker 1: And your father's full name again?
Speaker 2: Francis Anderson Gregory [Francis Gregory].
Speaker 1: Did he come from a big family?
Speaker 2: He had a brother and a sister and another sister who died young.
Speaker 1: Do you know their names?
Speaker 2: Monroe Gregory, LaVerne Gregory--I'm sorry.  Yes, it would be LaVerne Gregory [LaVerne Gregory West], and Elsie--I'm sorry.  It would be Amherst, Amherst Gregory.  Amherst is the daughter who died young.  And we don't know the origin of that name.  They lived in Lynchburg, Virginia, or, they didn't live there, but there was a part of the family that came from Lynchburg.  And there's either a city or a county named Amherst [Amherst County, Virginia].  And then he went to Amherst College [Amherst, Massachusetts] and so it may have been based on that.  I just don't know.
Speaker 1: Did he talk about his parents?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Did you know his parents?
Speaker 2: I knew, they were Bop [James Francis Gregory] and Nanan.  And Bop was, I'll have to think of his first name, but he was an educator.  He went to, he was in the first graduating class of Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  And he transferred in from Oberlin College [Oberlin, Ohio] to be one the several to graduate from Howard.  His father was also an educator and I believe his father's father was an educator.  So there're quite a line of educators in the Gregory family.  They lived generally in the Northeast, as far west as Ohio though we can trace back to Indiana and then a possible connection down in Charleston.
Speaker 1: And your grandmother, maternal grandmother?
Speaker 2: That would be Nanan, and she was Edna [Edna Gregory].  She was also from Cleveland, which apparently is where my grandfather and grandmother met.  She was a schoolteacher and he was a minister.  Bop went to Amherst College and graduated in 1898 and then went to Yale Divinity [Yale Divinity School, New Haven, Connecticut].  I believe graduated in 1900.  He grew up in Cleveland, well, he didn't grow up in Cleveland, but he lived in Cleveland.  And that's probably when he met Edna.
Speaker 1: Have they told you stories about other ancestors?
Speaker 2: I know what, who they were and what they did.  I can't tell you much more about it.
Speaker 1: Sure, tell me that.
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, my great-grandfather was also an educator.  I believe that he went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Harvard was a school of choice for many of my father's relatives, but I'm not that clear exactly who and where.  But again, my wife [Barbara Archer Gregory] can fill you in on that (laughter).
Story_ID: 629107
Speaker 1: Tell me about your own childhood.  Where were you born and where did you grow up?
Speaker 2: I was born at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  I grew up in Washington, D.C. and went to public high schools in Washington.  The school system was segregated at the time through most of my high school, through most of my education.  But again, the teachers were unbelievable.  And again, it was one of these things that after the fact I learned how well educated they were and how, what great passion, dedication they had for the teaching of the next generation.  Teaching apparently was a highly--to become a teacher in those days was highly competitive.  And teaching was considered one of the most acknowledged and recognized and envied positions.  It's, it seems not to be that way now.  But that's the way it was.  Now, there was a very close linkage between the school, the community, the home life and the church.  And many of us believe that those were the pillars that kind of established us and gave us that inspiration to do much, much more than what an ordinary kid would be expected to do.  I gave you the quote of "You are significant and you will con- and that you will contribute," that I can identify as a saying that our sixth grade teacher, Ms. Smith [ph.], said.  I didn't realize how important it was at the time, but in a segregated school, when you look back at what it means and what it says, it says, you are significant, which means that though you might read and understand and hear the Negroes were not of the same ilk as the whites, that the contributions that we made were at least equal to that.  And the contribution was, it was kind of subtle because what it meant was that each generation was expected to contribute more than the previous generation.  And so I think the training and instruction and motivation established a set of expectations that said that we would do something, we would not waste our life, that we would make a significant contribution.  And as you look at those kids who grew up in that school system, you'll see many, many successful--many who became very successful in their development and in their life's contribution.
Story_ID: 629108
Speaker 1: So the educational system was vital, it sounds like, to your life.  What were your earliest memories of education, either in the home or outside the home?
Speaker 2: I can remember, well, the education was not limited to school.  Education was, education surrounded you.  You would get your formal, identified as formal education in the school, but the community, the home and the church also provided a different element.  But somehow they were very linked and very integrated.  I can remember kindergarten, and I can remember kindergarten because I think at that first time, I can remember my kindergarten teacher talking about engineering.  And so as we played in a sandbox, and I can remember that clearly, she would talk about things such as moving soil, establishing a base for building a bridge.  And I can remember doing that in kindergarten.  In the first grade, we learned about birds and nests.  We also had--we, school was not just limited to school.  We had plays in school because I think the teachers, the instructors, the principal thought that that was part of the education process.  We did field trips.  We went to the symphony.  And those are the piece and parts that I can remember.  There was a significant involvement of parents with, with the schools.  Both my mom [Nora Drew Gregory] and dad [Francis Gregory] were teachers and their friends were the teachers in elementary school and junior high school.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the elementary school?
Speaker 2: Mott School [Lucretia Mott Elementary School, Washington, D.C.], and it was right across the street, it was just to the east of Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  So there was a street, 4th Street, in between Mott School and Howard.  Banneker [Benjamin Banneker Junior High School; Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, Washington, D.C.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you know [HistoryMaker] Sharon Pratt?
Speaker 2: Sharon Pratt was younger than I was.  She may be my wife's [Barbara Archer Gregory], younger meaning, perhaps a year or two.  But Arrington Dixon, who was at one time her husband, was part of the kind of the social group that we grew up with.
Story_ID: 629109
Speaker 1: What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I think that it would be when, I must have been very young, but I can remember in our yard a wagon and a sled, Christmas and things of that nature.  Now, there're more (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was Christmas like?
Speaker 2: Well, these are more like snapshots as opposed to action.  And Christmas was always a wonderful time because it was a time when all of the families visited each other, great exchange of gifts at that time.
Speaker 1: Do you remember one of those occasions and the types of gifts exchanged and--?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  I don't remember.  In early childhood, I don't remember.
Story_ID: 629110
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of the smells?
Speaker 2: Oh, of course.  I remember the Christmas trees, the fires in the fireplace.  I remember the smell of the turkeys as they were being cooked and the sweet potatoes and the greens.  Every, all of those memories are delightful and I suspect that I was very, very young on my first, my first recognition.
Speaker 1: Which neighborhood did you grow up in?  Take me around the block.
Speaker 2: I lived in, I grew up in Southeast, D.C. [Washington, D.C.], next to Anacostia [Washington, D.C.], but not in Anacostia.  It was right across from Fort DuPont Park [Washington, D.C.], and the front of the house actually faced Massachusetts Avenue.  But this was Massachusetts Avenue Southeast and it was not connected to the other side.  When I grew up, Massachusetts Avenue was just a dirt road.  And it was used primarily for sledding in the winter with snow.  I, although I lived in Southeast, I went into Northwest [Washington, D.C.] for the, for schooling at both Mott [Lucretia Mott Elementary School, Washington, D.C.] and Banneker Junior High School [Benjamin Banneker Junior High School; Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, Washington, D.C.].  And when Brown v. the Board of Education occurred in 1954 [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], I was then, I transferred from Banneker to Sousa Junior High [John Philip Sousa Junior High School; John Philip Sousa Middle School] in Southeast, D.C. and finished junior high, my ninth grade there and then went to Anacostia High School which is in Anacostia, D.C.
Speaker 1: Was your neighborhood in Southeast--?
Speaker 2: My neighborhood was not integrated.  Our family and our next door neighbors were the only Negro, colored, in that particular area.
Speaker 1: And were there racial tensions?
Speaker 2: Not among the kids.  But the parents and some of the, in some cases, the parents were.  And I can remember that there was one family that would not let the son play with me, but he did.  And every time his dad went by, he hid.  I had, there was a neighborhood of about five or six boys.  We were all about the same age, and we grew up together and we still are in contact.
Speaker 1: The white kids and (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) White kids, yes.  The, the--
Speaker 1: And they didn't express a difference?
Speaker 2: We didn't know that there was a difference.
Speaker 1: You played baseball?
Speaker 2: Played baseball and football and basketball and hide and seek.  We shot archery and they were in a house, and my mom [Nora Drew Gregory] tells me that they would be in the house very early and my dad [Francis Gregory] would say something like, those ants are back in the house again.  Obviously, it must have been very early, and they must have still been in bed when these, when the kids would come in.  But we grew up together and we went through early part of junior high and then in some cases, when the schools integrated, many of them moved out of Washington [D.C.] into Prince George's County [Maryland].
Speaker 1: Did your parents bring up conversations about race?  Were you conscious of race?
Speaker 2: I think that I was very conscious of it, but my parents, along with all of their contemporaries kind of formed a boundary around us.  And so we did not, we didn't, we didn't suffer because of it.  If they would create an equivalent, for example, there was a white Boy Scout [Boy Scouts of America] camp.  There was no Negro Boy Scout camp.  So the fathers built a camp very close to the other camp.  And they would never allow, they insulated us from any outside pressures.  And so as a result, our social circle was created with the kids within this group.  And that's kind of the way that we grew up.  We're all members of something called the Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.].  And most of our social work, most of our social activities just involved these kids.  And it was an outstanding way to grow up.  We were not really the receivers of racial prejudice though I can remember motels that were white only and colored only.  I can remember bathrooms that were, and water fountains that were segregated.
Speaker 1: In D.C.?
Speaker 2: Well, in--no, I don't, I don't remember them so much in D.C.
Story_ID: 629111
Speaker 1: I know that the theaters were integrat- were segregated.  And the theaters that we generally went to were on U Street (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So these were black theaters on U Street?
Speaker 1: Yeah, on, it would have been the Booker T. [Booker T. Theatre, Washington, D.C.], the Langston [Langston Theatre, Washington, D.C.], I'm sorry, the Lincoln [Lincoln Theatre, Washington, D.C.] and the Republic [Republic Theatre, Washington, D.C.] were on U Street, and then there was the Langston Theatre in Northeast, D.C. [Washington, D.C.] off of Benning Road.  I don't remember any other movie theaters.  Of course, there was the Howard Theatre [Washington, D.C.] that was just between 6th [Street] and 7th [Street], just off Florida Avenue.  I never went to the Howard Theatre, generally stage shows.  But my parents [Nora Drew Gregory and Francis Gregory] and everybody in their generation went there.
Speaker 2: Do you remember thinking it was unfair when you saw those signs, colored and white or when you saw the segregation in the movie theaters?
Speaker 1: It was just not a, it was just not a big deal.  It's, our parents would never take us there.  We would observe it.  In fact, I remember a gas station in Annapolis [Maryland] that had segregated bathrooms and water fountains.  But I think that's the only recollection that I have of actually seeing something, something like that.
Speaker 2: So the area around U Street, around Howard University [Washington, D.C.], LeDroit Park [Washington, D.C.] and Shaw [Washington, D.C.], this was a mecca of sorts?
Speaker 1: It was certainly.  And all my friends went to school in that LeDroit Park, Howard vicinity.  And those were the kids who I grew up with and have stayed with all my life.
Story_ID: 629112
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the leaders of the community in that area?
Speaker 2: Well, it's interesting.  I suspect that I remember the teachers as being the leaders.  We used to have Negro History Week [Black History Month].  And I can remember this cork board in the corner of the room, of the high school--of the class.  And I can remember that they would put six or eight pictures up, and that would, and they represented the only significant things that Negroes had ever done.  And so we saw 'em.  There were six or eight and they always were the same, people like Marian Anderson, some few baseball players, Booker T. Washington, George Washington Carver and folks like that.  I don't remember anything there that indicated a leader of a community or actually a leader of some kind of a national activity.  It just wasn't on the board.  And so what we saw was what they identified as our heritage, and obviously, there was nothing in the books about it.  And so our understanding of what role earlier leaders or activists had had, just was not part of the education that we had.  And it wasn't until much later that I, that we became aware of people like the Tuskegee Airmen.  I learned about those in 1977.  But I grew up with those guys in my house as friends, but I never knew what they had ever done.
Speaker 1: When you say they were in your house as friends, former Tuskegee Airmen?
Speaker 2: Yes, many, many Tuskegee Airmen.  There was always a conversation about flying in the house.  I look back and there are books that were on the shelf of my, in my home.  But I never identified or associated those folks with a significant contribution in the Second World War [World War II, WWII].  Again, it was 1977 when General Ben Davis [Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.] called me and encouraged me to apply for the astronaut program and I remember his words.  He said I would like you to apply to this program for me and the Tuskegee Airmen.  And I said, who are the Tuskegee Airmen?  And for the next half hour or forty-five minutes, he told me who they were.  And that was, I grew up in Negro schools, and I, it was just unbelievable for me to realize that this was a part of the contribution and the history and the sacrifices.  And I never knew about it until late.  And I've talked to many of my friends and it was the same kind of thing.  It was well after these things occurred that we learned about it.
Speaker 1: And you said there were lots of books about flying and conversations about flying?
Speaker 2: There were books in my house about flying.  I don't know how they got there.  I do remember that Armstrong, Armstrong High School [Samuel Chapman Armstrong Technical High School; Armstrong Manual Training School, Washington, D.C.], had a link trainer.  It could have been part of a course or several courses there.  It could have been part of Junior ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  I don't know.  I just remember that there was a link trainer in the school.  Books in the house, conversations about flying.  In fact, I went, when I was about five--I remember this very clearly, one of the gentlemen took me to go flying.  And I was strapped into the seat, and it was light airplane, high wing airplane.  And I remember my mother [Nora Drew Gregory] coming to the window demanding that this pilot not take off with me in the airplane.
Speaker 1: How old were you around that time?
Speaker 2: I think I was about five or six.
Speaker 1: This is (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And what we did, we just taxied around the runway and we didn't take off.  But I, as I can remember, this would have been my first association with an airplane.
Speaker 1: Were you fascinated?
Speaker 2: I was absolutely fascinated.  And I think that that may have been one of the factors that eventually led me to fly.
Story_ID: 629113
Speaker 1: So you went to Mott Elementary School [Lucretia Mott Elementary School, Washington, D.C.].  Where did you go after that?
Speaker 2: Mott to Banneker Junior High [Benjamin Banneker Junior High School; Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, Washington, D.C.] which was just on the west side of Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], just across Georgia Avenue.  And I was there in the seventh and eighth grades.  And that's when schools integrated in Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: Do you remember these conversations and flying imagery continuing from elementary through junior high to high school?
Speaker 2: I think I was, I was always fascinated with the [U.S.] military.  And I think that my interests in flying probably started as an early teenager or probably eleven or twelve, but in that timeframe.
Speaker 1: In that junior high period?
Speaker 2: It would have been junior high and maybe even elementary school.  We would go to, my dad [Francis Gregory] would take me to the air show at Andrews Air Force Base [Joint Base Andrews] in Maryland.  And I was just fascinated by it.  There was no particular reason for him to take me there, which then begins, you know, I'm beginning to ident- link these things, conversations in the house about flying, his interest in taking me to air shows.  Maybe it was, you know, just a coincidence.  I just never know.  But I did grow up lying on grassy hills, watching airplanes fly, and I did that at a very young age.  In fact, an air show at Andrews was the first place I took my future wife [Barbara Archer Gregory] on a date.  And I remember that she was in a dress and high heels.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, around what year was this?
Speaker 2: Probably when I was sixteen, so I was driving.  So I must have just gotten my driver's license.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Nice first date.  At Banneker, even before you get to Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] and you start dating your wife, at Banneker you mentioned that integration was--
Speaker 2: Well, some of their eighth grades were still in segregated schools.  I don't think that we were aware of what would happen in the next year.  I do remember that in the D.C. schools, during integration, or in that first year, you were not--one of the going-in positions was that the senior class of a particular school would not be integrated.  And so the ninth grade would have been the senior.  But I think because my dad was in the school system, he was able to move me from Banneker to Sousa Junior High [John Philip Sousa Junior High School; John Philip Sousa Middle School], which was a neighborhood junior high, to be in Southeast [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: What was the makeup of that school?
Speaker 2: I think I was the only Negro in the class.
Speaker 1: How did that feel?
Speaker 2: I had grown up in a kind of an integrated society.  I was in the first integrated Boy Scout [Boy Scouts of America] troop.  The Boy Scout troops in D.C. were not integrated, but in 1953, I went to a Boy Scout jamboree in California, and we went by train.  That troop was integrated.  And so it was the first, and there were a couple of us in that.  We were in integrated troops when we went to Philmont Scout Ranch [Cimarron, New Mexico] in northern New Mexico.  And so being one of several or one as alone was not unusual for me.  When I went into the Air Force Academy [United States Air Force Academy, Colorado], I was the only one in a class of 780 or 90 [790].
Speaker 1: Now, was this a situation, did people know what your racial background was?
Speaker 2: Certainly, yes.
Speaker 1: How did that come about?
Speaker 2: How did they know?
Speaker 1: Was it just a known fact, everyone's racial background or--?
Speaker 2: I, I assume so (laughter).  I don't know.  I wasn't in the minds of other people (laughter).  I don't know if the kids, you know, by the time of junior high or by the time that we got into junior high, there was an awareness of the students.  In elementary school, probably not.  But I think that all of us demonstrated that we were, you know, capable of playing sports and being a success in classes, and many of us had the, I thought that all of us had the same goal.  And once you had that kind of the same goal, the same passion, a lot of those, you know, issues that we talk just didn't exist or had no effect on any of us.
Story_ID: 629114
Speaker 1: Tell me about Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't go to Dunbar, but Dunbar was the mecca for very smart kids in Washington [D.C.].  And Dunbar, when I say the school, well, the school was in Washington, but many of the students came from Virginia.  Many came from many other parts of the country and would stay with relatives in Washington.
Speaker 1: Did you want to go to Dunbar (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I wanted very much to go to--I wanted to go actually, I actually wanted to go to Armstrong High School [Samuel Chapman Armstrong Technical High School; Armstrong Manual Training School, Washington, D.C.] because my dad [Francis Gregory] was, taught there, and also was a principal.  And I learned to roller skate in Armstrong's halls and Armstrong and Dunbar were right across the street.  And they were great rivals, so I think I really wanted to go to Armstrong Technical High School.  Obviously, I probably would have gone to Dunbar, but I--because I was college bound.  But it's funny because years, many years later, my mother [Nora Drew Gregory] became associated with one of the graduating classes at Armstrong.  And I think it was the class of 1945.  And I think it must have been about the time that my dad became the principal there.  She was a reunion, and I guess that may have been in 1985 or so, but one of those five year kind of reunions.  And during a discussion, she was talking to a gentleman--this is the story she tells me, and she asked quite innocently, well, what did you do with your career, thinking that he would have become a carpenter or a bricklayer or an electrician or auto repair.  And he said that he had received his Ph.D.  And she was shocked.  And then the comment apparently went, "And I wasn't the only one; several others are here, and they all came."  And my mom said well, why, in her very subtle way, "Why did you get your Ph.D.?"  And they responded, because they told us we couldn't.  So this is a story that she relates, but it kind of tells you, you know, the kind of motivation these kids had, and that just because you went to a technical high school, did not limit you to a career field for the rest of your life.
Speaker 1: So where did you ultimately end up in high school?  Which one?
Speaker 2: I went to Anacostia High School in Southeast [Washington, D.C.], which was the only, it was the only high school in Southeast.  And it was within about twenty blocks of my house.
Speaker 1: Integrated?
Speaker 2: It was when I got there.
Speaker 1: And that experience was fine.  What were some of the highlights?  Teachers, you mentioned, were the leaders?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, the leaders in the--
Speaker 1: Colored leaders.
Speaker 2: --in the colored, Negro schools.  I think that the teachers in those schools were good, but if you talk to my mom, she will tell you that they were not at all at the level of the teachers at Dunbar.  They were good.  I had very good relations with the students there.  We had a few more Negroes in than class that I did at Sousa [John Philip Sousa Junior High School; John Philip Sousa Middle School, Washington, D.C.].  But we all participated in football and baseball.  And I remember those as good, very good days.
Speaker 1: Where did you excel?  Which discipline?
Speaker 2: I think I was just kind of average (laughter).  I just, you know, I played, I played baseball, varsity baseball.  I was in the college bound track in the school and probably graduated in the top 10 percent or so.
Story_ID: 629115
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What year did you graduate?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-eight [1958].
Speaker 1: And what were your thoughts at that time?  What did you wanna do next?  And who influenced you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I wanted to, oh, my dad [Francis Gregory] was my major influence, or my mentor.  We'll talk about that, but he was my guide.  I, in high school [Anacostia High School, Washington, D.C.], I definitely wanted to go to the Air Force Academy [United States Air Force Academy, Colorado].  The school had not really opened at that point, but during one of the air shows, while I observed the demonstration, Air Force demonstration team, the Thunderbirds, I was fascinated by them.  And I talked to one of the pilots when he landed, after they landed.  And I said, "How can I become a Thunderbird?"  And he said, "You should go to this school they're building in Colorado called the Air Force Academy."  And so I think at that point, I decided that I wanted to go there.  And that would have been, let's see, the first class graduated in '59 [1959].  This was probably somewhere between '55 [1955] and '56 [1956] or '57 [1957], sometime in that time frame when the school was being built.  But the class, but the school had not been occupied yet or had not been used.  So I think at that point, I decided that that's where I wanted to go.  And, however, there was parental influence to follow in my ancestors' foot- schools, school systems.  My grandfather [James Francis Gregory] on my father's side had gone to Amherst [Amherst College, Amherst, Massachusetts], graduated in 1908, I'm sorry, 1898, and my uncle, Charlie Drew [Charles R. Drew]--so this is on the Drew side, had graduated from Amherst in 1926.  And so I think I was the stucky [ph.], I was the (laughter) chosen person.  And so I was admitted to Amherst, but it was very clear to me that that is not, that was not the place I wanted to go.  And so I told my dad that, and I think he knew that.  And so he, the Air Force Academy required a congressional nomination.  And so he went into the halls of [U.S.] Congress, as I understand it, and approached every black congressman and asked if he would, I don't think there were any shes, but all hes, would take a chance and nominate me for the Air Force Academy.  The first year, I was identified in one of the congressmen's list.  We took tests--at that time, they would designate a principal nominee and alt- and then alternates.  So there would be one principal and ten alternates.  And this particular congressman identified a guy named Chuck Bush [Charles V. Bush], Charlie Bush, to be the principal.  There were ten alternates, and I was number ten.  Chuck passed and was accepted.  None of the other alternates passed except for me.
Story_ID: 629116
Speaker 1: And so the following year, I was given a nomination by--principal nomination, by Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.].  And so I entered in the class of '64 [1964].  I had a, I had two years of college, one at Amherst [Amherst College, Amherst, Massachusetts], and then one, I just kind of went to American University [Washington, D.C.].  I really wasn't interested and waiting to get into this class.  So I could have been in the class of '62 [1962] for college but, in fact, I was class of '64 [1964].  While I was at the academy, since Adam Clayton Powell had nominated me, my home of record was the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Great, what was the role of the church?
Speaker 1: Well, because I, Adam Clayton Powell's congressional district was in New York [New York], when he nominated me, he had to nominate me as a resident of New York.  And so my official address became Abyssinian Baptist Church, his church in Harlem.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's pretty clever.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And that was a pretty big deal, of getting the nomination from Adam Clayton Powell?
Speaker 1: Well, it was for me, but it just--again, Reverend Powell was just a name to me.  In fact, I never met him.  But there was an obligation that each congressional member, each congressman and senator was, had the obligation to submit a series of names to the Air Force Academy [United States Air Force Academy, Colorado] so that each would have representation in the class.  I just happened to be the only one in the class of 1964.
Speaker 2: And before you even got to the Air Force Academy, you did a year at Amherst, a year at American University at a very turbulent time in our nation's history.
Speaker 1: I wasn't aware of it.  In fact, even at the academy I wasn't.  In fact, the first time my wife [Barbara Archer Gregory] and I experienced segregation was after our honey- after our honeymoon in, we spent time in a home in Cleveland [Ohio] that my grandmother [Edna Gregory] had built.  And then when we're leaving there to go to Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio [sic. Universal City, Texas] which is where my pilot training began, we went into a motel in Tennessee.  And we were not allowed, I remember the conversation.  He, he asked me if I had a reservation.  And I said, no, I didn't.  Well, there was another gentleman who kind of walked up behind me.  He was a white, white guy.  And, and without asking that guy's name, he said, "I'm glad you're here.  We have your reservation."  And I can remember the startled look on the person's face.  I called my father [Francis Gregory] and was just scared to death.
Story_ID: 629117
Speaker 1: You were describing a moment at a Tennessee hotel, which (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In a Tennessee motel.  And after that occurrence, I was, I was afraid.  I didn't, I'd never seen this before, did not understand what it was, and immediately went to a phone and called my dad [Francis Gregory].  And he understood.  Obviously, he was very informed about those situations.  He called a friend at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].  We went to, he, and then called me back and said, "I want you to go to Fisk and you will meet Professor Such and Such.  And you'll spend the night with him."  And so that's what my wife [Barbara Archer Gregory] and I did.  We went there, and they advised that we go to Holiday Inns because Holiday Inns apparently were integrated.  And from that, on that trip to San Antonio [Texas] we stayed in Holiday Inns.  And for twenty years after that, I only stayed at Holiday Inns until the middle '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: So they really did welcome you at Holiday Inn?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  There was just, it was like normal.  There was never a question, never a raised eyebrow, never an issue, as I can remember.  Obviously, it had such an impact on me that for twenty years I exclusively stayed at Holiday Inns.
Speaker 1: And did you notice other incidents of racism during that Tennessee trip?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  The only place we would have seen it would have been staying, and I don't remember where we ate.  We must have eaten someplace, but I never remember being turned out because of a racial issue.
Story_ID: 629118
Speaker 1: And you said, your wife, now what year did you get married?
Speaker 2: We got married the day I graduated from the Air Force Academy [United States Air Force Academy, Colorado], the 3rd of June 1964.  We had been dating, let's see.  I was twenty-three then.  We'd been dating since she was fifteen and I was sixteen.
Speaker 1: And you met in high school [Anacostia High School, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: We met in junior high school [Benjamin Banneker Junior High School; Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, Washington, D.C.].  I met her when she was thirteen, I was fourteen, and I told my cousin I was gonna marry her.  But we did not date until my senior year in high school, so second semester of senior year and her senior--and her eleventh grade year, well, in the eleventh grade, second semester.
Speaker 1: And what's your wife's name?
Speaker 2: Barbara.  And her former name was, former name (laughter), her unmarried name was Barbara Archer [Barbara Archer Gregory].
Story_ID: 629119
Speaker 1: So even before you got married, you got married upon graduation, but you spent how many years at the Air Force Academy [United States Air Force Academy, Colorado]?
Speaker 2: Four years.
Speaker 1: And this was really the beginning.  This was the start of the Air Force Academy in many ways?
Speaker 2: No, I was there, I was the sixth class to graduate, and I was there when the--it must, one, two, three--the third class graduated.  My grandson is there now.  He just entered.  And he is in the class of 2011.  And so that's five, that'll be forty-five years, forty-five years later.  My grandson is kind of following in my footsteps out there.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: Scott Francis Gregory, named for his grandfather, named for his great-grandfather.  I'm sorry, no, named for his grandfather [sic. great-grandfather], Francis Gregory, my dad.
Speaker 1: What was your first memory at the Air Force Academy?
Speaker 2: I had finally arrived at a place that I really wanted to be, my choice.  I'd thought it through thoroughly.  I don't think I knew what to expect when I got there.  It was tough, but there was absolutely nothing there that would have dissuaded me to change my mind.  In fact, as a--we called them doolies, or fourth classmen, that's freshman year.  They called me Bubbles because I was always laughing or smiling, no matter what the upperclassmen would do or say to me.
Speaker 1: Was there something called the Cadet Chapel [Colorado]?
Speaker 2: Well, when I got there, there was mandatory chapel, but we didn't have a chapel.  And so it was done in the auditorium of the, something called Arnold Hall which was kind of like a student center.  The chapel, beautiful chapel out there, was completed in late 1963 after the class of '63 [1963] graduated and began operation probably in January of '64 [1964], in that timeframe.
Speaker 1: Tell me about chapel inside Arnold Hall?
Speaker 2: Well, it was just an auditorium.  And so we would have chapel and so I mean we would conduct services and so I was a Protestant, and there would be a Protestant service.  There would be a Catholic service.  I'm not certain that there was a Jewish service there.
Speaker 1: You're a Protestant?
Speaker 2: I'm a Protestant.
Speaker 1: So growing up, you attended which church in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Nineteenth Street Baptist Church [Washington, D.C.], which is now on 16th Street (laughter) and Reverend Jerry Moore [HistoryMaker Reverend Jerry A. Moore, Jr.] was the minister.
Speaker 1: Was there basic training, that kind of thing when you first got to the Air Force Academy?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they called it basic cadet training, and that actually started on the 26th of June, 1964 and ran, I'm sorry, 1960, and ran until mid-August, I think, about six weeks.  And it, basically, what it did, there were a lot of class leaders, football captains, high SAT scorers there, and what, a lot of individuals.  And during that summer, they obviously got us in physical condition, but from the mental point of view, they kind of broke down this individuality and created a class.  And so, our loyalty became not only to the Air Force Academy but to the class of 1964.  And that class, that loyalty and friendship has existed through these many, many years.
Speaker 1: Who are some of your friends?
Speaker 2: You mean names?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, Bevelhymer [Herb Bevelhymer] (laughter), McArtor [Trusten McArtor], Frazee [Donald Frazee], I mean I guess, run through them.  I know, of my classmates now, there are 420, 25 [425] that are still living, and I probably know each one of them and their life.  In many cases, I know who their kids are.  But we've stayed very, very close.  I think any of us would give their right hand for any other classmate.  It's just a very, very tight community.  It's the, it's probably like a fraternity, but it is much stronger than a fraternity--
Speaker 1: How many (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous) much stronger than a fraternity.
Story_ID: 629120
Speaker 1: How many people were in your class, and were there other people of color (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, no, absolutely not.  We entered with seven hundred, and, it's high seven hundreds.  We graduated with high four hundreds, so a little less than five hundred when we graduated.
Speaker 1: So race, was it a factor at all?
Speaker 2: It seemed not to be there.  When we first got there, we went through this basic cadet training during the summer.  Then we became part of the academic year, and we were assigned to a squadron.  There would have been, there were probably 1,600 kids there, give or take.  And so there were sixteen squadrons, or maybe there were twenty.  I forget how many there were, but each squadron had about a hundred people in it.  And they would have been freshmen through seniors, fourth classmen through first classmen.  And I can remember that there would be a senior [U.S.] Air Force officer, and when we met in this kind of a squadron room, a day room, there were a hundred of us in there, all classes.  And I remember the AOC, air officer commanding, who was an Air Force officer, told a racial joke.  And I don't remember what the content of it was, but I'd heard those before, and it was no big deal to me.  Later, within several hours, when we were back in the dorm, he called me in, and he said, I was not aware of your background.  And he said, I apologize for telling a story such as that, and it will never, ever happen again at the academy [United States Air Force Academy, Colorado].
Speaker 1: Do you remember what that story was?
Speaker 2: No, I don't, I don't remember because, you know, we had heard racial stories like that.  In fact, we had told, in our communities, racial stories.  And so it goes back, "Sticks and stones will hurt my bones, but names will never hurt me."  So it was just kind of a, "Oh, okay."  And his name was Carter.  And we called him Captain Air Power because he was a fighter pilot, and we had a little day room, another small one.  And he had airplanes hanging.  It was not a big deal to me, but I did not, was not exposed to any other racial comments or any indication, any hint of segregation.  Many, many, many years ago when he died, I went to his funeral at Arlington [Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Virginia].  And I had never met his wife, but his wife was there, and I went to her.  And I said, "My name is Fred Gregory [HistoryMaker Colonel Frederick Drew Gregory].  Your husband had a significant," and she said, "I know exactly who you are."  She said that, his name was Robert Carter, she said Bobby came home that evening and told her of this activity.  This would have been in August 1960, and this funeral was probably in '98 [1998].  And she said that he had had a profound influence.  He was from, I think it was Bluefield, West Virginia, southern West Virginia.  And obviously, you know, as he grew up, he grew up in a very segregated world.  But that was probably the first and only incident that occurred at the academy that I can remember.  And it was significant because of the response.  About that time, maybe in 2000, I met another friend who was an upperclassmen, and he would have been perhaps a second classmen or a junior.  And he said that he and one other cadet had gone to Captain Carter and told him and that, about me.  He didn't know it, Captain Carter didn't realize it, but these two cadets went and told him.  And that was what then resulted in him calling me.  So, you know, all these kind of things came together, and I was just, you know, I had remembered it, but I didn't realize that, you know, all of the, all of the dynamics that had occurred and what the impact of it had been on Bob Carter.
Speaker 1: And it sounds like a tremendous impact on you as well over the years?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember it as, you know, there are a lot of things you kind of forget.  And there are some things that have occurred that have great influence on you.
Speaker 1: What was another experience that served in that capacity--
Speaker 2: I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) to shift your perspective?
Speaker 2: I think that--I think that that was probably, that was a very isolated case.
Story_ID: 629121
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were there other experiences that were extremely positive at the Air Force Academy [United States Air Force Academy, Colorado]?  Stories you can tell?
Speaker 2: I think the friendship, the camaraderie that existed there was, had a profound influence on me.  I'm, I am a loyal alumni of the--alumnus of the school.  And I go back five, six times a year.  I was just there over the weekend, or at the beginning of this week.  I'll be back there on the 9th of August.  And I'll be back every quarter because I'm on the board of the association of graduates, which is the alumni.  I was voted in by the thirty-eight thousand graduates of the school.  And so the school itself has had a profound influence on me, and I, every, everything that I have been able to do, I owe to that, to that school.
Speaker 1: Do you remember learning how to fly?
Speaker 2: Actually, we didn't (laughter), I would have thought the Air Force Academy would have airplanes, but the Air Force Academy didn't have airplanes.  It's a very high level university.
Speaker 1: So what was a memorable classroom experience for you there?
Speaker 2: Passing (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Really, it's, there're, I talked about the earlier pillars that we had in the community.  There it was military, athletic, academic, and we used to call it religious, but they've come up with some PC [politically correct] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you continue your sports?  You mentioned athletics?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Well, we learned a lot of contact, well, we played a lot of contact sports, team sports.  And one of them, I played rugby and continued playing rugby, but most of them were, we had these transition sports too, like handball and racquetball.  And I continued playing that for many, many year, many years after that.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the sights, smells and sounds of the Air Force Academy?
Speaker 2: Seventy-two hundred feet, so a significant lack of oxygen (laughter), high pines, high plains.  So there was a lot of pine, a lot of grasses, and I recall that.  As a matter of fact, earlier this week when I was out there, many of us went out on a kind of a field trip as we observed the basic cadet training going on.  And many commented on a smell that they remembered from many, many years before, very dry, winds coming over the ramparts, the mountains over there.  You would, there was always a breeze of some sort, pretty hot, but like they say in Phoenix [Arizona], it's not the temperature, it's the humidity.  But it is extremely dry there.
Story_ID: 629122
Speaker 1: Were you conscious at all of the Civil Rights Movement and Martin Luther King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] movements (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no.  It was after, after the academy that I became aware of Dr. King.  But my parents [Nora Drew Gregory and Francis Gregory] attended the speech at the Lincoln Memorial [Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 1: March on Washington.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, but since then I have, I continually listen to his speech.  I've found, you know, I've seen the Promised Land (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The I Have a Dream speech [sic.].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think of it as, I've seen the Promised Land, I've been to the mountain, and seen the Promised Land.
Speaker 1: What does that mean to you, that speech?
Speaker 2: Well, it means, you know, there're very, a lot of levels of that, but it was, you know, I could associate it back to: "You are significant and you will contribute."  And from my, from my impression of what Dr. King was talking about, he was talking about, you know, we have been bound in our life, but we are, we are now free.  And we are able now to do all of those things that would allow us to make a contribution.  So that's just the interpretation I had.  And, you know, this is the philosophy of Booker T. Washington and Garvey [Marcus Garvey] and Douglass [Frederick Douglass] and folks like that, Randolph [A. Philip Randolph] and Bethune [Mary McLeod Bethune] and, you know, they had different approaches to it.  One is that you can demonstrate, that you can contribute.  Another was that you become a very significant member of the community where the community then depends on you.  You have a clothing store, you'll have a, you know, this or that and, or you own homes and people, the white folks have to now rent from you.  It was, you know, if you are a reader of folks like that and study like that, you begin to understand how far back this effort began and, you know, how important it was for our people, you know, rise above what had been our history and our traditions with a determination that that's not what would be, that would not be something that we would hand to our next generation.
Speaker 1: So it sounds like while you're at the Air Force Academy [United States Air Force Academy, Colorado], you were getting inspiration from the officers there and the professors and your colleagues--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --there, and then as you graduated, you became aware of Martin Luther King?
Speaker 2: It was, yes, I did--it would have been, it would have been after '64 [1964] when I became aware of those things and the sacrifices that he had made and obviously, when he died in 1968, it was a dramatic event.  Soon after, well, five years after John Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was assassinated, but they were very significant events in my life.
Story_ID: 629123
Speaker 1: So you were still at the academy [United States Air Force Academy, Colorado] when JFK [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was assassinated (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, absolutely.  It was--
Speaker 1: And where were you when that happened, and what was your reaction?
Speaker 2: Well, I was on, we call it the Terrazzo.  It's just, was just a paved area that you walked on.  I mean the academy is kind of built around an open section.  Part of that section is paved.  And we call that the Terrazzo.  And I remember that I was walking toward the dining hall when the announcement occurred.  And I mean, it was just startling to us.  I think, I think I remember people just collapsing.  But it, I was, either that evening or the next evening, we went on a flight.  It was a navigation flight and so we were students of navigation.  And we flew to Las Vegas [Nevada].  And we went to a casino and, this is what I remember.  We were, some of the dealers, you know, some of the tables were full.  And there was one table that had a guy, a dealer standing behind the table, and he, there was nobody at the table.  And so we walked, I walked up and looked at his name tag and it said Dallas.  And his name was, whatever his name was, and he was from Dallas [Texas].  And nobody would even go to his table.  So I think it had, you know, even though obviously, he had absolutely nothing to do with the assassination (laughter), that he was from Dallas had a significance to folks even in Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada].
Story_ID: 629124
Speaker 1: So you graduated from the academy [United States Air Force Academy, Colorado].  Now, you mentioned that experience, navigation kind of studies.  Were there other experiences like that where you learned while on an aircraft?
Speaker 2: No, no, we didn't, we didn't have any flying.  That, it was very rare for us to even be on an airplane.  But the course at the school were excellent.  At that time, the school actually didn't even have any majors.  And so it was after the fact that they decided that we received a degree called military engineering or something like that.  If you look at my diploma, there is no major indicated on it.
Speaker 1: What were your dreams at this time?
Speaker 2: To fly.  Oh, the first one was to graduate (laughter).  And the second one was to fly.
Speaker 1: And when you say to fly, in what capacity, in the [U.S.] military?
Speaker 2: In the military, yes.  It's an [U.S.] Air Force university.  It's a military academy.
Speaker 1: Right, but there's some people I imagine who go there and they hope to move beyond, to move outside the military and become a commercial pilot?
Speaker 2: No, at that time, no, absolutely not.  All of us were pilot qualified when we were admitted and probably 90 percent of us or 95 percent of us went to flying after graduation.  Those who didn't were, the great percentage of them would have been military or would have been medically disqualified for flying.
Speaker 1: So what did you do upon graduation, got married?
Speaker 2: I got married the day of graduation.  I was commissioned the day of graduation and graduated on the day of graduation.  So I only have to remember one date, the 3rd of June 1964.  I, once, I wanted to fly, but I was greatly influenced as to what I was gonna fly by where I would take my new wife [Barbara Archer Gregory].  And I wanted to go to a nice place.  And so Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio [sic. Universal City, Texas] seemed like a nice place.  It was a nice city.  They taught helicopters there.  I went into helicopters because I chose the location and not the kind of airplane.  We had six months in San Antonio [Texas], and then we went to Reno [Nevada].  And I completed my pilot training in Reno.  And I flew helicopters from that point for three years, I think, and then transitioned out of helicopters into fighters and started F-4s [McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II] in 1969.  So I graduated from pilot training in '65 [1965] and then '69 [1969] I transitioned to fighters.
Speaker 1: And at this time, you were becoming more aware of the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: The assassination of MLK [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.  Though in the military, the, you know, the military had--the Air Force had integrated in 1947 [sic.].  And so it was way ahead of the rest of the country.  And so when I, when I became active duty, integration was, well, I became active duty in '64 [1964].  I mean we almost twenty years of integration in the Air Force.  And so there was no apparent segregation on the bases, and there were established policies that any offsite housing group that practiced discrimination would be barred from rentals by Air Force officers.  So there was a very, very proactive, not effort, because it was, in fact, a fact, that there will be no, there will be no segregation on the base or in the communities around the base.
Story_ID: 629125
Speaker 1: So what was your first turning point experience or memorable experience after (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the [U.S.] Air Force?
Speaker 1: --in the Air Force.
Speaker 2: Obviously, finishing pilot training successfully.
Speaker 1: Was that pretty tough?  I imagine it was.
Speaker 2: As I look back, no, it was fun because I, that's what I wanted to do.  I don't think it was tough.
Speaker 1: So tell me about what is pilot training?  What did you do?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Quick answer is we learned how to fly (laughter).  You learn the theory of flying, why airplanes fly.  You learn about avionics, those things that give you indications of what the airplane is doing as far as direction and speed altitude.  You learn about propulsion, whether they're reciprocating engines or jet engines.
Speaker 1: Do you remember when you received your pilot license so that the period leading up to that and the exhilaration of flying a plane?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  It was very exciting to us.  And it's not like we get a pilot's license.  In the Air Force, you get pilot's wings.  You're there for a, to designate a military pilot.  So you don't go through the civilian agency, the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] to get it.  This is all within the [U.S.] military.  I was very excited about it and immediately volunteered to go to Vietnam and actually got my wish (laughter), and spent a, actually a wonderful year at Da Nang [Da Nang Air Base, Da Nang, Vietnam] as a rescue helicopter pilot.
Story_ID: 629126
Speaker 1: So tell me about your experiences in Da Nang [Da Nang Air Base, Da Nang, Vietnam], you mentioned (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In Da Nang, well, I was a, I was not a fighter pilot.  I was a rescue pilot there.  So I wasn't there to provide injury.  I was there to rescue and recover those who needed it.  And so that's why, from my point of view, it was excellent that I had at Da Nang because I, in the year I was there, I rescued many, many downed flyers and exhausted [U.S.] Marines.  So I was, you know, every evening I went to bed feeling very fulfilled.
Speaker 1: So, tell me about one of those experiences.  I know you were awarded for--?
Speaker 2: Well, we had a, some of them were funny.  Some of them were horrific.
Speaker 1: Share one of the funny ones first.
Speaker 2: Well, one of the funny ones was one day were sent out to rescue a, recover a Marine [U.S. Marine Corps] squad that had suffered heat stroke and did not have the capability of, you know, treating the symptoms.  And my helicopter that I flew was a pretty small helicopter.  Typically, it could hold a pilot and co-pilot and two others who were either firemen or rescue specialists like Seals [U.S. Navy Seals].  We call them PJs [U.S. Air Force Pararescue].  And then you might be able to put two or three people, maybe two more people in the helicopter.  Well, the squad had maybe seven or eight folks.  And with all of their battle equipment.  And so I hovered.  They began to climb in.  And it was so packed in there that they had to hang some of their equipment outside.  I flew them from that location to a medical facility.  And when we landed, a corpsman came out, a [U.S.] Navy corpsman came out to receive the injured person.  Well, these Marines started coming out, one right after the other.  The corpsman ran in and brought the doctor and the nurses out to watch because these people kept coming out, and it reminded me, I was laughing.  It reminded me of clowns in a circus, where you have this very small car and lots of people come out of there, clowns come out of the car.  And so that was pretty funny from my point of view, I mean (laughter).  There was another one.  I was in on a rescue and we used a hoist to pull up the person on the ground.  On the bottom of the hoist was something we called a forest penetrator.  And it was very thin so that it would penetrate the canopy, the tree canopy.  But it required, it had directions written on the side, and it required that you unzip and actually fold out some leaves so that you could sit on it.  Well, the person on the ground was, did not speak English and didn't understand what was to be done with this thing.  And so instead of unzipping and pulling out the leaves to sit on, this person tried to hold onto the cable, just the cable to be pulled up.  Well, that didn't work.  So we pulled the device up.  One of the PJs, pararescue specialist, got on it, went down on the ground and then unzipped this thing and opened it up.  While, I was sitting flying the airplane, there were aircraft flying all over me shooting and dropping napalm and things like that to suppress the bad guys.  And I looked down and my knees were just shaking like this.  And I was not aware of it, and I hit my co-pilot and I pointed at my knees, and we just sat there and laughed about it because here we were in the middle of the, middle of the jungle, you know, with bad guys all over, and airplanes flying all over the place.  We can't get this guy on this penetrator, and my knees are shaking and I had no idea they were.  And we just laughed about it.  And so all of the incidents that we had were, always had this kind of comical side, but at the end, you know, we recovered all these folks and brought 'em back and just really felt great about the experience.
Story_ID: 629127
Speaker 1: Tell me about some of those moments of heroism when someone was really maybe on the brink of death or life and death situation?
Speaker 2: You know, there were, there were lots of those.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me about one?
Speaker 2: Well, most of them are very private and I wouldn't, really wouldn't talk about them because--
Speaker 1: Just the one you can--?
Speaker 2: --they were horrific.  And when you recovered bodies, in all states, there were many that could have been near death, but when we came in, we were able to pull them out of that situation.  And so I guess I really never looked at I saved a guy, well, I did, I brought one, saved one guy out, who had bailed out in the South China Sea, and I rescued him and brought him back.  And he went on to shoot down a North Vietnamese airplane and so--
Speaker 1: When was this?
Speaker 2: This would have been, this would have been in the fall of 1966, the fall of 1966.
Speaker 1: So, tell me about that experience.  You get a call and then you have to--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you'd get a call.  You'd get an indication of the heading that you would have to fly from the air base to get there.  They generally have, the pilots generally had some kind of radio and you might be able to talk to them.  And if not, you would take the direction from the traffic controller who would say, okay, this is the last place that we are aware or this is the place where we think he bailed out.
Speaker 1: And where was this guy?
Speaker 2: South China Sea.  He was off the coast of Da Nang [Vietnam], not far, twenty miles or so.
Speaker 1: By himself?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.  He was just floating, floating there with his floaters (laughter).
Speaker 1: And what did you do to rescue him?
Speaker 2: Just lowered the hoist, and he got in the horse collar and we pulled him up and brought him back.
Speaker 1: Well, I know in nineteen sixty--you were awarded for a rescue mission in 1967.  You rescued four [U.S.] Marines who were downed.  There were some small fires.  Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, that would have been '66 [1966].  I think that was a helicopter that had crashed in a field.  And the helicopter and the grass was all on fire.  And again, it was right in the DMZ, the demilitarized zone, and again, there were bad guys all over the case.  And I just went in and picked those guys up and brought 'em home.  It was no big deal.
Speaker 1: No big deal?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And there was fire?
Speaker 2: Fire, in--the helicopter was on fire as was the grass around there.
Speaker 1: Sounds like a big deal?
Speaker 2: No, it was not a big deal (laughter).
Speaker 1: And you said a couple of times that there are bad guys all around?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Describe me that scene?
Speaker 2: Well, you never saw 'em, but you knew they were there cause you could see the tracers from their rifles, and then you could, that went, when we called it air support, would come in and would shoot or bomb or whatever.  So you knew they were close.  But you generally didn't see them.  The grass was pretty high.
Speaker 1: How did you deal with fear?
Speaker 2: Didn't.  I mean it wasn't, I was not afraid, but my knees were sometimes.  You know, it was just that was what I was trained to do.  And I knew that my role was very significant.  And there was nothing that would have dissuaded me from not doing what I was challenged to do.
Speaker 1: Any other memorable sights, smells and sounds from Vietnam?
Speaker 2: Oh, you smelled, you smelled napalm a lot.  I remember the howitzers, the 105 millimeter cannons, you could hear those.  I, what I mostly remember was the, you know, the friendship of the folks there.  We were in a compound, we were not allowed to leave Da Nang [Da Nang Air Base, Da Nang, Vietnam], the air base, Da Nang.  And so, principally, all of our activities evolved around our barracks, the theater.  I saw 260 or so movies that year.
Speaker 1: Do you remember which movies you saw while you--?
Speaker 2: Any of them that were in 1966, I saw 'em.  Sixty-six [1966], '67 [1967].  They would have all the top running movies over there.  The theater was a place of choice because it was the only air conditioned building we had on the base, in the compound.
Speaker 1: So you don't, so you said there was a closeness, and race wasn't really a factor?
Speaker 2: Was no factor whatsoever.  These were integrated units, but they were very few African Americans there.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the African Americans who were there?
Speaker 2: I don't remember names, no.
Speaker 1: Were you friends?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Yeah, I mean the African Americans would be mechanics or PJs [U.S. Air Force Pararescue] or firemen, administrative, just like everybody else was there.  And all the pictures that I have of Vietnam are indications of integration.  I didn't choose people to put in the pictures.  That's just the way it was over there.
Story_ID: 629128
Speaker 1: How long did you remain in Vietnam (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A year, June to June, '66 [1966], '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: Do you remember the scene when you arrived home?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  You know, I can remember the trip from Da Nang [Vietnam].  I remember that it was just loaded with, it was all economy (laughter).  These were hired airplanes, that's not the word, but the [U.S.] military contracted for aircraft with their crews to fly the GIs home and R and R [rest and relaxation] and things like that.  And I remember that I was moving to Whiteman Air Force Base [Missouri], which is just east of Kansas City [Missouri], about sixty or seventy miles.  And I was gonna fly Hueys [Bell UH-1 Iroquois] there in support of minutemen missiles.  So I, the job was to carry the crews to these sites, the cooks, the security police and people like that.  I remember flying into Kansas City, renting a car because my wife [Barbara Archer Gregory] was gonna meet me there in a hotel.  And the funny thing here was that when you left the airport, you had to cross a toll bridge.  And I had a seatbelt on, I put it on.  I hadn't seen a seatbelt before.  So I got to the toll booth, and my wallet was in my pants, and I couldn't get the wallet out because the seatbelt was on, and I didn't know how to take the seatbelt off.  And so it was funny from my point of view.  He's standing there, you know, just kind of come on, there're people behind you, and I'm saying, how do you take your seatbelt off (laughter)?  And so I remember that as an experience.  And then I finally got it off or was able to get the wallet out and I could pay the toll and then got to the hotel.  And when I got there, apparently, the hotel knew I was coming, but my wife didn't know when I was arriving.  And so she was out, and I just kind of waited in the lobby, and she came running in.  And so it was just a, it was just, I remember it.  It was just a fantastic time.  When I went on R and R, I went to, there's, I forgot what R and R stands for.  But relaxation and something.  I went to Hawaii.  And my wife flew over from D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and we met at the receiving station at Fort DeRussy [Honolulu, Hawaii] which is, was the R and R center, there on Waikiki Beach [Honolulu, Hawaii].  And she came running down from off the bus, and she had this little baby.  And we hugged, and this was the first time I'd seen my daughter.  And I didn't even realize, you know, it was like, wow, this is my daughter.  But I, you know, it just did not sink in immediately that I, that she was holding our daughter who I had not seen.  And this was in December and the daughter was born in September.
Speaker 1: Of which year?
Speaker 2: Sixty-six [1966].
Speaker 1: And what's your daughter's name?
Speaker 2: Heather [Heather Gregory Skeens].
Speaker 1: So that was just an out of body experience for you?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was.  And, in fact, my daughter and I argue over what day she was born and because in Vietnam, it was a different day when I found out.  And I got the word by telegram that she was born.  And so we have argued about that for forty years.  And so I just arbitrarily decided her birthday was December as opposed to either the 15th or 16th of September.  And I don't know what her birthday (laughter).
Speaker 1: Were there any war protests, Vietnam War protests when you got home?
Speaker 2: I did not see any at the airport.  I was aware that it was occurring, but this was '67 [1967], so this was kind of early, though we had had the riots and they were more racial than war because that was about the time that D.C. was burned and a lot of places (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, upon Martin Luther King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassination, you mean those riots?
Speaker 2: No, it would have been his assassination.  But I remember when we checked in at Whiteman which was in Knob Noster, Missouri, this was about sixty-five miles, seventy miles from Kansas City, folks were telling me about the activities in Kansas City and how some streets were destroyed and armed helicopters were flying to try to keep the peace.  I hadn't been to D.C. so I hadn't seen, you know, the Northwest area [Washington, D.C.] around in the Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] area, U Street, Florida Avenue, Georgia Avenue and things like that.  I hadn't seen that yet.  But I think at that point, we began looking at television, and then I could see it.  But that's, that's principally it.  In Vietnam, it may have been written up in the Stars and Stripes, which was the military newspaper over there.  But I just didn't pay any attention to it.
Story_ID: 629129
Speaker 1: So for civilians out here who are listening to your story and who did not serve in Vietnam, I know you said there were some experiences that were private and you can't share, but are there some experiences that would help us understand what you witnessed while you were there?
Speaker 2: When, Vietnam [Vietnam War] at that time was a, a period of time in my life when I believed that we were protecting not only Vietnam but Southeast Asia from communism, and communism was bad for us.  We did not know it was gonna be a protracted war that would last that many years.  I was aware that the field commander was not given the authority to make decisions.  And, you know, we discussed that length, that there were limitations on what people could do, where they could go as far as, you know, North Vietnam was concerned.  And I think that many of us were frustrated because we believed that we could solve this issue if it was an issue of territory, if, but I don't think we realized at that time that it was a philosophy as opposed to territory.  The Second World War [World War II, WWII] was territory.  But this one wasn't territory.  This was trying to keep an influence from spreading.  I think while I was there, that may have been a conversation, but was not, in any way affected our ability or our beliefs or our--it didn't influence our roles and what the expectations were.  It wasn't until I got home that I realized that, that there was a, you know, an underlying current that was anti-war.  And then, of course, it went on and on and on, and these negotiations.
Speaker 1: On some of those rescue missions, you saw things that we'll never see as civilians.  Are there some of those images you can share?
Speaker 2: It was, it was a country of conflicts.  You would see old Vietnam.  I remember looking at Hue [Vietnam], Phu Bai [Phu Bai Combat Base, Vietnam], a city that had been a capital and had a big university there.  And I can remember the red tile roof there.  And you would see what it was like, you could see history there.  And then you would, then either the North Vietnamese were there or not there, depending on what day you went.  And so, you know, you would see something that wasn't, provided one image, but then you get fired on.  And so, you know, you never really knew who was good or bad.  I felt very comfortable at Da Nang [Da Nang Air Base, Da Nang, Vietnam] because we were in this compound.  I was afraid to go to Saigon [Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam] because Saigon didn't have this compound, and people lived all over the place.  In fact, when I was leaving they did not have room in the officers' area for me to stay, and so they put me in an apartment, a room in a building in downtown Saigon where there was a Vietnamese guard that walked up and down.  I was afraid.  I didn't sleep that night at all because I didn't know who good guys were or bad guys.  So the next day I checked back into Tan Son Nhat [Tan Son Nhat Air Base; Tan Son Nhat International Airport, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam], which was the name of the airport, the base, and went into the enlisted barracks and stayed there because I just could not, I wasn't able to discern what was good or what was bad.  At Da Nang, I didn't have the problem because there were just Americans or allies within the fence.  In Saigon, I didn't have that, I didn't have the confidence to figure out what was good and what was bad there.
Story_ID: 629130
Speaker 1: And so, as you mentioned, you left, you came home in 1967?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you mentioned the birth of one daughter.  Do you have additional kids?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had a son who was born before I left.
Speaker 1: And what year was he born?  What's his name?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-four [1964].  His name is Fred, Jr., Frederick, Jr. [Frederick Drew Gregory, Jr.].  And he was born in October of 1964.  And Heather [Heather Gregory Skeens] was born two years later.
Speaker 1: And what did you do after Vietnam?
Speaker 2: I flew rescue helicopters at, I'm sorry.  I flew missile support at Whiteman [Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri].  And then while there, the [U.S.] Air Force allowed me to choose an airplane and a base, and I chose a fixed wing, so I chose F-4s [McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II], fighter airplanes and Davis-Monthan [Davis-Monthan Air Force Base], which is in Tucson [Arizona].  So I went from Whiteman to, back to Randolph [Randolph Air Force Base, Universal City, Texas] to transition from helicopters to jet aircraft.  And that was a six month period.  And then from there, I went to Tucson and did my transition into F-4s.  About a week before graduation which would have been in February of 1970, I was notified I was selected for test pilot school.  I already had my port call to go back to Vietnam, actually to Thailand to fly F-4s, but when the test pilot school slot came, then all of those orders were cancelled.  And so I then went to Patuxent Naval Air Station [Naval Air Station Patuxent River], down in Lexington Park, Maryland, for test pilot school.  And that was my transition from active Air Force into a, kind of an engineering role as a test pilot.  That was a major shift in career.  Test pilot school, and then I went to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio as a test pilot, and because I was current in both, as, because I had completed both the rotary, which is helicopter and fixed wing training, which were fighters at test pilot school, in 1974, I was loaned to NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] as an engineering test pilot because they were looking for a dual qualified pilot.  And I was probably, if not the only one, maybe one of the only ones in the Air Force.  So the list wasn't long, and I may have been either number one or last (laughter).  But somehow I was loaned to NASA in 1974 for two years, and thirty-one years later, I left NASA.
Story_ID: 629131
Speaker 1: Describe for me the environment at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration].  That must have been pretty exciting.
Speaker 2: Oh, wow.  You know, I was a pilot.  I, you know, any airplane that I had got my hands on, I would fly.  When I got to NASA, I went down to visit for the first time, I remember that hanger.  It was like, when they opened the door, it was like a kid in a candy store.  They must have had twenty airplanes in there.  And it was, I was down there to determine whether I wanted to go there.  And I just walked in and said, there's no doubt in my mind.  I'm coming here (laughter).  And so, I, we moved from Wright-Patterson [Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio] down to Hampton [Virginia].  And I flew as a research test pilot, engineering test pilot for them for, well, it went from two years to three years to four years.  And during that time, that's when the announcement for the astronaut program, and I thought well, I've flown, was an experimental test pilot, research test pilot for--by this time, it was like six years, and I said, well, I'm tired of this.  And then the advertisement was, you know, looked exciting for me because I was beginning to get bored doing what I was doing.  And I thought, well, this might be a nice thing to do.  And so that's a time that General Davis [Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.] called me and encouraged me to apply for the program.  So I did only because I was really bored being a test pilot.  And, oh, the other thing was, [HistoryMaker] Nichelle Nichols, who was Lieutenant Uhura, the communications officer at that time on 'Star Trek,' I remember a TV commercial, NASA commercial, where she was standing there in this tight blue flying suit, and there was a big airplane, maybe a 747 [Boeing 747], NASA 747 behind her.  And she pointed at me, and she said, I want you to join the astronaut program.  She was, she was talking to me.  I knew that.  And so between Nichelle and General Davis, that's the reason I applied for the program.  And I was lucky enough to be selected in that first group.
Speaker 1: And so this was a history making moment?
Speaker 2: It was because this was the beginning of the shuttle, space shuttle program.  And there were thirty-five people selected, and twenty of those were pilots.  And of the pilots, it was about half and half, [U.S.] Air Force and [U.S.] Navy, well, there were some, yeah, it was about half, Air Force and Navy and obviously, the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] were included as part of that selection.  And I was one of the Air Force, so there were nine or ten Air Force, and I was privileged to be one of those.  And there were fifteen, eighteen thousand applicants, military screened and then submitted some number to NASA, and then NASA did the selection, selection process.
Speaker 1: Were you the only person of color?
Speaker 2: No, there was a guy Bluford [HistoryMaker Guion Bluford], and Ron McNair [Ronald McNair], and those are the three on that picture up there.  Well, there're actually four there.  Ron McNair is the--over in the dark area.  A couple of years later, Charlie Bolden [HistoryMaker General Charles Bolden, Jr.] came in, and so we are the first, we were the first four that came into the program.
Speaker 1: And so what year were you selected as an astronaut?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 1: And what were some of the--
Speaker 2: January the 16th (laughter).
Speaker 1: Big day for you?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember the date.  When I--I was at the Armed Forces Staff College [Joint Forces Staff College, Norfolk, Virginia] at the time.  It was an intermediate military school for majors, lieutenant colonels.  And I remembered when I went in, we all had a little mail cubby hole, and I pulled this buck slip, and it said, "Call George Abbey."  And George Abbey ran the astronaut office.  So I called him, and I remember his conversation.  It was, "You still interested in this job down here?"  And I said, "Yes."  And he says, "Well, you're in."  And he says, "You've got to keep this a secret until noon."  And this was about a quarter of eight.  I kept it about five minutes (laughter).  So, it was an exciting time, and then obviously a lot of publicity and things of that nature.

Speaker 1: Did you have a dream of becoming an astronaut in the '60s [1960s] as you moved through the [U.S.] Air Force?  What was your understanding of NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]?
Speaker 2: I think we were all observers.  And we were quite proud that these things were being done by the United States, but I don't think any of us, I know I did not at that moment have an aspiration to do it.  But if you look at my career, and my career was interesting because when I became bored with something, I would immediately attempt to move out of it.  For example, helicopters, when I realized that helicopters really did not have a future, I immediately applied for something.  And that happened to be test pilot school.  Well, it was just a coincidence that the Air Force then offered this transition to fixed wing, which I took.  And it was at the end of that training that I was accepted as a test pilot.  I had to make a hard decision there, whether to continue the fighter pilot role or get into the engineering, into the systems command.  I made that decision, and then became a test pilot.  But when I became very bored with that, then I thought, what the heck, I'll apply for the astronaut program.  But that was not a dream that I had.  And, in fact, once I was selected and I talked to the others, none of them actually had that as an aspiration.  In fact, all of us sat and said, you know, there are other people who are much more qualified than we are to be here.  And, you know, that conversation would last about ten seconds, and then we'd go off to something else.  It was just, you know, all of us were looking not at what this would do for our career, but this seems, you know, something to do and we just kind of applied for it.  I applied because the shuttle looked like an airplane, you know, the thing had wings (laughter).
Story_ID: 629133
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You had mentioned 1969, that pivotal moment with Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Neil and Mike Collins [Michael Collins] and Buzz.  I mean it was.  Everybody was glued to the TV, and we saw this kind of transparent imagery of Neil coming out of the lander.  And we were fascinated, but we were also fascinated with Borman [Frank Borman] when they, when he read Genesis.  You know, these were significant times for us because one, no one had ever done this before, two, it was American, and three, we were just fascinated because if you looked at the time, it was a very tumultuous time.  And we needed something to say, wow, this is a great American achievement.  So, you know, it gave us a very nationalistic feeling, and one of joy and excitement because now the world was looking at the achievement of what America had accomplished.
Speaker 1: Did you know these guys?  Did you--?
Speaker 2: No, no, not at that time.
Speaker 1: Well, no, of course not.  But later, did you--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I know 'em all very well.  I know 'em all very well now.
Speaker 1: Tell me about Buzz Aldrin and--?
Speaker 2: Well, Buzz (laughter), if there's an activity, Buzz will be there (laughter).  Buzz is, Buzz is the extrovert.  Neil is the introvert, and Mike Collins, both Neil and Mike Collins are very seldom in the public eye.  Neil is, Buzz is always in the public eye.
Speaker 1: I actually interviewed him once too (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Is he, so where did you--tell me about your first meeting with Buzz Aldrin and when was that and--?
Speaker 2: Well, it probably was, if it wasn't in Houston [Texas] in the space center [Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center], it probably would have been in my, with my association with the Young Astronauts, which was a program begun in, it was a Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] program begun maybe in 1982 or so.  And a guy named Butler [T. Wendell Butler], last name Butler, was designated the leader of this group.  And it was a very, very large U.S. activity at that time.
Speaker 1: And what was he like?  You said he was a, he's a public person?
Speaker 2: Which one, Buzz?
Speaker 1: Buzz.
Speaker 2: Well, he would have been associated with the Young Astronauts or anything.  And I probably met him in that, in that timeframe.  So it would have been some time in the middle '80s [1980s].  And we are friends, and I listen to Buzz.  Buzz visits, and, yeah, we're just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What do you do together?
Speaker 2: Talk about strange things (laughter).
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: How you increase the support of the space program by launching a lot of people into space and then bringing 'em back, and wouldn't necessarily have windows.  So (laughter) he'd just go up and come back.
Speaker 1: Do you go out in a boat, you and Buzz?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no.  He's never been here.  (Laughter) But he would, he would do that.
Speaker 1: What about Neil Armstrong, where did you meet him?
Speaker 2: I only met him at a funeral.  And that's the only time.  He was a, he's a very quiet person.  It's, does not in any way attract or want any attention.  And so--
Speaker 1: Pretty amazing 'cause he gets a lot of attention.
Speaker 2: Well, he does, but very, you will very seldom ever see him.  Everybody knows Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon, but very rarely is he in public.
Speaker 1: And what year did you meet him?
Speaker 2: Two thousand and three [2003], maybe.
Speaker 1: Did you talk space?
Speaker 2: Other than hello, no, we didn't, we didn't converse.
Speaker 1: And what about Collins?
Speaker 2: Mike, I met at the National Cathedral [Washington National Cathedral, Washington, D.C.], and that might have been '89 [1989], and we were, we both gave talks there.  I had met him earlier, just a casual meeting, and he was the director of the Air and Space Museum [National Air and Space Museum, Washington, D.C.], well, first director.  And I met him casually while he was the director.
Speaker 1: Did any of those guys, and possibly Buzz, did they talk about the trip to the moon?
Speaker 2: Buzz did.
Speaker 1: What'd he say?
Speaker 2: You know, he just talked about it.  I don't recall the conversations.  I never had that conversation with Neil or Mike Collins.
Speaker 1: But Buzz, he had to be very much aware that this was an extraordinary moment.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh, he was (laughter).
Story_ID: 629134
Speaker 1: So what is the most powerful memory of your early days with NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] as an astronaut?
Speaker 2: I think it was the, you were overwhelmed with the acknowledgement and recognition by the public of the selection, of you being selected.  And so I would typically get five, six, eight, ten letters a day, requests to speak everywhere.  We had, we were in Hampton [Virginia] at the time and they would have, they had TV crews outside the house, interviewed by magazines and things like that.
Speaker 1: And instant celebrity.
Speaker 2: Instant celebrity, yeah, and you were wondering, why?  What is this all about?  You'd get on an airplane and look at the airplane magazine and you'd be in there, or Parade magazine, or probably People and Life and just about everywhere you would run into newspaper articles.  You know, you were obviously excited about it at the time, but you kind of look back now and thought, well, my private life has been blown (laughter).  So I think that's what happened.  And additionally, I remember that when I, the first speeches that I gave were in the Norfolk [Virginia] area, Norfolk, well, they were probably in Norfolk.  And I remember the first couple I read.  And I thought, this is stupid.  So from that point on, I went to extemporaneous, and all of the 3,500, 4,000 speeches that I've given are pretty much all extemporaneous.  And so I feel very comfortable.  All I need is somebody to give me a quit time.  And so it doesn't matter when I start, if they need, you know, one to end at twenty-five after, I can end it within seconds of that.
Speaker 1: And I imagine in those speeches you give today, you talk about your experience with the Challenger?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  No, no, I don't do that.
Story_ID: 629135
Speaker 1: Well, tell--can you tell me now about your experiences with the Challenger?
Speaker 2: I, well, I flew it.  Yeah, eight or nine months before the accident.  I flew the Challenger on its seventh mission [STS 51-B].  The accident occurred on the tenth [STS 51-L].  We lost the Challenger, and it was a nice, it was a nice girl.  But I lost family.  I mean Dick Scobee was my next door neighbor and he was commander.  Mike Smith [Michael J. Smith] and I had identical ski boats.  El Onizuka [Ellison Onizuka] and I had spent years down at the cape [Cape Canaveral, Florida] in preparation, the Kennedy Space Center [John F. Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island, Florida], in preparation for the first couple of flights.  Judy Resnik [Judith Resnik] was a wonderful, but wild young lady, brilliant, you know, an excellent friend.  McAuliffe [Christa McAuliffe], the teacher, and I had spent many, many hours talking about--I've got the wrong name.  Well, the teacher in space and I spent an awful lot of time talking about the importance of what she was doing, she and Barbara Morgan, who is just gonna fly right now, talking about how important a teacher was, flying, to fly into space, and what the impact would have on kids, and how important and significant it was because we as engineers could come back and talk about, wow, gee whiz, you know, awesome.  But they could come back and actually translate that into something that would have some impact with students.
Speaker 1: Do you remember where you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I was--
Speaker 1: --at the Challenger--
Speaker 2: --I was the CAPCOM.  I was talking to the orbiter when it occurred.  You'll see many pictures of me sitting at the console, and I watched it.  It was a, you know, it looked like a flawless liftoff.  But I was also watching a monitor, and I, and I saw it, I saw the explosion, but I--it's Christa McAuliffe, forgive me.  I saw the explosion, but intellectualized it and believed that what I was looking at was a routine solid rocket booster, separation and there were, you know, ballistic charges in there that actually separated.  And I was commenting to myself, wow, they certainly have improved the optics because I've never seen it so, so vivid before.  And then I realized instantaneously that this wasn't normal.  And to this day, I regret, I was going to punch a transmit button and, "Godspeed, Challenger," and did not.  And to this day, I regret not doing that.  But I was, you know, front roll in it.  We were in Houston [Texas] in Mission Control.  And that's what happened.
Speaker 1: And what happened around you?  How were people--?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was just stunned.  It was interesting because the public affairs gentleman was working from a script, and by the second, he knew what would happen.  And he was reading this stuff.  And I watched the explosion.  All of the data on our screens froze, but he was still talking.  And he must have talked for five or six seconds.  I mean it seemed like an hour.  And then suddenly he paused because by this time we were all confused about, everybody at Mission Control was very confused, and everyone was looking back at him.  And he was in the upper, right hand corner of Mission Control.  And what we were looking at and observing and what he was saying caused a lot of confusion in Mission Control.  And then we realized that something dreadful had happened.  And then it got very quiet.  It was extremely quiet in there for a few moments.  And then the flight director, it was a guy named Jay Greene, and he says, "Okay, folks, let's try to back up and see if there was something that we could have seen to prevent this."  And so for the next six or seven hours, we sat at Mission Control reviewing everything up to that point.  And there was nothing, at least during that session, that gave us any indication that there was a problem and that there was nothing, there was nothing, there was no indication that would have allowed us to make a call or decision or something that could have saved the crew.
Speaker 1: And your title at this point?
Speaker 2: CAPCOM.  I was the lead CAPCOM, capsule communicator.  They call it capsule communicator because that's what it had been called during the Mercury [Project Mercury], Gemini [Project Gemini] and Apollo program [Project Apollo].
Story_ID: 629136
Speaker 1: Do you remember the families?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, yeah.  I remember one of the things I had to do was to get home because June Scobee [June Scobee Rodgers] and her kids [Kathie Scobee Fulgham and Richard W. Scobee] lived, by this time, they lived like a hundred yards from us.  I knew that this place was gonna be a, you know, circus, so I got home, and sure enough, in front of their house there were television vans with these tall antennas or something.  And so I drove over, and they were all over the front yard.  And I just, I was wondering, what in the world are these people trying to do?  So I drove into the driveway and got June in the car, and then drove her over to our house.  Our house was not, you couldn't see their house from our house.  But we were within a hundred yards of each other.  And so June and the kids moved into our house, you know, to protect, protect them from the media.  And then when Dick Scobee's family came, father and mother, they stayed at our house too for, I don't know, a week, two weeks or so.  And so I would kind of become the spokesman over on the field, over on their lawn and, you know, really to divert this, I don't know, zoo-like activity that was going on.
Speaker 1: How was the family holding up and digesting this?
Speaker 2: Oh, I mean, what would you think (laughter)?  A tragic public incident, you know.  I mean essentially, little acknowledgment of the shuttle program by that time, and then all these people coming out of the woodwork, you know, creating stories, and well, how did you feel about this?  What was your first--?  That was very inappropriate and I don't know why the media would even do something like that.  It was very cruel.  I don't think I've ever forgiven them for doing this.
Speaker 1: And your colleagues, the recovery process?
Speaker 2: Well, it was family.  I mean this lady crashed, I mean Challenger was an amazing airplane, but these were, you know, the astronauts were--a majority of them were in our class in '78 [1978], Mike Collins--Mike Smith [Michael J. Smith] was '80 [1980], and Christa [Christa McAuliffe] and Greg Jarvis [Gregory Jarvis].  Christa and Greg Jarvis were actually outside of the program that came in to fly.  But we had all, you know, been together for eight years and it was a very tight and closed society, group of people.  And so we had, it was like losing family.  So we didn't look at it as the loss of the Challenger and the loss of Christa McAuliffe.  We looked at it as, we've lost a significant part of the family.  So that's the way we, that's kind of the reaction that we had down there.  And then while, while June was at the house, and she swears that while she was in our house that she came up with the idea of the Challenger Centers [Challenger Center for Space Science Education].  And she says that, jokingly, that Fred [HistoryMaker Colonel Frederick Drew Gregory] and I developed this in the bedroom and so (laughter), and she tells that story (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, as you mentioned, you piloted the Challenger prior to--?
Speaker 2: I piloted it, which is like a first officer, and the co-pilot on it, on a mission, but really it was not an issue with the orbiter Challenger.  This was an issue with the solid rocket booster, and with this kind of a blowtorch.  That blowtorch with a, you know, with an imperfect seal.  It actually burnt the, into the big, main tank.  And it's hydrogen and oxygen in that.  The oxygen, well, basically, the tank collapsed.  And there was hydrogen, there was hydrogen, I mean oxygen and hydrogen burned, but then the orbiter was actually blown away from it or separated from this, and with the loads on the orbiter, the orbiter kind of broke and then fell into the ocean.  So it wasn't the Challenger.  It was, you know, the other pieces of it that resulted in the loss of the Challenger.
Story_ID: 629137
Speaker 1: You had done some research, experiments while piloting or co-piloting the Challenger?
Speaker 2: We had, the pilot commander had some limited role in the experimentation that was going on.  I mean our principal job was to maintain the orbiter and provide the environment that the, you know, the smart guys could work in.  I was one of the youngest on that flight.  I was in my forties at the time, and so myself and Norm Thagard [Norman E. Thagard], who was one of the mission specialists, were the two trained to do an EVA [extravehicular activity] if there was a contingency that required it.  That did not exist so I suspect I was the only pilot ever trained as a walk in space, EVA.  We had shifts and so Bob Overmyer [Robert F. Overmyer] was a commander, and he kind of oversaw one shift, twelve hour shift, and I was the overseer of the other shift, as that first shift would sleep.  You know, we just essentially switched back and forth.
Speaker 1: What was it like?  I mean describe the experience, weightlessness?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was that like?  What's space like?
Speaker 2: Space is fantastic.  When you fly, you will know that you're either a earth person or a deep space, and I think I was more of a deep space.  Deep space, space to me, it's, it looks two dimensional, but it's very deep.  To me, it's like black velvet with diamonds on it and somebody shining a light on, fascinating.  And then you realize that the stars you see are separated by significant differences.  It just takes that amount of time for the light to get to you.  So some things, some light that you see may have been emitted by this star 10 million years before and it just got to you.  You watch the earth and you're traveling at about seven miles a second.  It takes an hour and a half to circle the earth.  So your sense of distances is, is greatly changed and challenged.  Your sense of neighbors changes because, you know, what do you define as a neighborhood?  Probably something that's easily accessible.  Well, when you fly across the Atlantic Ocean in about fifteen minutes, folks in Europe are just kind of neighbors.  And well, you can't discern boundaries on the ground.  So you, you know, you fly across the country, the United States, and you can't tell Iowa from Texas.  I mean there's nothing there that would allow you to say, ah, that's definitely Oklahoma.  But you can't tell that.  The same with Africa and Europe.  As you moved into Eastern Europe, you can't tell the difference.  And you wonder why these folks hate each other, but you can't tell any difference.  So it's my belief that all of the politicos ought to go fly before they start making arbitrary decisions about this and that, ethnicity, religion and culture and things like that.  It's just not apparent from space.  It was, it had such an impact on me that when I came home, what I wanted to do was go meet my neighbors.
Story_ID: 629138
Speaker 1: And so I had the opportunity to travel to Madagascar and Africa and Russia and just about all the countries in Europe, and Far East.  And I found that there was excitement there about what we had done, and I also learned that, that this was not just an America activity.  This was a, it was an international activity that was conducted by primarily by Americans, but they were all, all these folks were on the team.  And I found out that there was great talent capability outside of America, and that they wanted very much to participate in the program.  It was a thrilling experience for me.  The Madagascar trip actually happened in 1990, and I was asked by President Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] to represent him in Madagascar as they celebrated their thirtieth anniversary of their independence from France.  And at that point, this was just as the Soviet Union was breaking up, and Madagascar had been an outpost for the Russians.  And so the other participants who went to Madagascar were principally--and I was the only Western person there.  My wife [Barbara Archer Gregory] and I were the only westerners.  All of the rest of the people on there were the bad guys, you know, the folks who we were not allowed to go visit.  But we were right there.  There was a U.S. ambassador there, and we stayed with him.  And the president of the country was a guy named Ratsiraka [Didier Ratsiraka].  And when I was there, I was always with him.  I was always to his right.  So whenever we ate, I was to his right.  Whenever we went anywhere, I always sat with him, and I didn't realize until after the fact that, that was the designated place for the highest, highest ranked person there.  I was just an astronaut.  I mean the rest of them were kings and princes and this and that, premiers and whatever.  My wife was always with the prime minister.  Now, it just so happens that there was a rumor that my ancestor on my father's [Francis Gregory] side came from Madagascar.  And we had a, you know, there was an oral history in America--in my family that says that the, that our ancestor was a prince who escaped from Madagascar, came into the Baltimore area and settled in middle Maryland.  When I went to Madagascar, we, one evening we had a reception.  And the descendants of the royal, at one time there was a king and a queen, and things like there, the descendants of that were at this reception.  And a gentleman said, you know, our connection with America is about this prince who escaped because the queen was killing the to be threats to the throne and that that person had left and gone to America.  And I just (laughter), and here was an oral history here talking about something, and then the oral history from Madagascar.  There was no connection, but the timing was 1820s.  And, you know, it was just too much of a coincidence (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did you get the name of the prince?
Speaker 1: Well, the name that he gave me was a different name than the one that we had heard.  And the one we heard over here was Ali Muhammad [ph.].  And there are Muhammads that live just outside of Frederick, Maryland, just to the west of Frederick, Maryland.
Story_ID: 629139
Speaker 1: My wife has actually been up there to--found what was allegedly the son of this gentleman, but we have no record whatsoever of that person arriving in the country.  We do know, because there are records, that he had significant money in that, no, he had significant assets in that there are records of movement of land, transmittal of land and things like that.  But we don't have any connection.  We can't identify this person as actually arriving from any place.  He just shows up.
Speaker 2: And what was the name they gave?
Speaker 1: I can't remember.  (Laughter) I guess the names are strange names.
Speaker 2: He clearly could have changed the name as he moved which was a common practice.
Speaker 1: Could have been.  I mean if you look at Malagasy names, they are like, the capital of Madagascar is called Antananarivo.  But if you look at the name, it's like, they double everything in there.  And the name that was given to me was, oh, it was just something I did not recall.  I just, it was just a, the story that here was a prince.  And, in fact, in the queen's palace, there was a picture of a guy who looked just like my uncle, my grand uncle.  It would have been my grandfather's brother, looked exact--
Speaker 2: On which side of the family, your mother's [Nora Drew Gregory] or your father's [Francis Gregory]?
Speaker 1: On my father's side.  And I mean it just looked exactly like him.  And I remember staring at him, and Barbara [Barbara Archer Gregory], my wife, just looked at him and says, "That's Uncle Gum.  This would have been Uncle Montgomery [Thomas Montgomery Gregory]."  And I mean it was just, it was amazing, the similarity, but we're talking about, let's see 1820s and that would have been significantly, let's see, Uncle Gum, well, it would have been about sixty or eighty years.  So it was actually, the story was not something that was being made up about something happened centuries before.  We're talking about something that may have occurred sixty or seventy years or so before that.
Story_ID: 629140
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-nine [1989] was a significant time in your life.  You got a new title?
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: Space commander?
Speaker 2: Oh, I see what you mean, yeah.  I was designated the commander of a mission [STS-33].  And so that would have been obviously my first command.  I guess it's significant because I would then have become the first commander, the first African American commander of anything.  As a pilot, I was probably the U.S. pilot.  So it was exciting, but it was not a big deal for me.  But I have been noted for that in some bios, but it was no big deal.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the Discovery?
Speaker 2: Discovery was just a space shuttle and that particular mission, which was, by the way, my favorite mission, fantastic people on board.  I mean it was like a ballet when we were up there.  We had a highly classified, it was a highly classified mission.  So other than it was successful, and we all walked away on the landing, that's about all I can say about it (laughter).
Speaker 1: And I notice as well that because it was highly classified, people, the general public was unaware of your ethnic background for a number of years so that--
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I mean this was clearly written up, and at first, my, you know, all of the missions.  But again, it was, you know, some people thought it was important.  They would include it in the articles.  Some didn't consider it important so it wouldn't be.  But, you know, Jet magazine and Ebony and things like that would identify it.
Speaker 1: What was the objective of the mission?  You did some, astronauts were doing some experimentation as well?
Speaker 2: It was a classified mission.  That's about all.  I wouldn't, you know, if I told you, I'd have to shoot you.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter), well, I notice some of the reports they're talking about the medical, evaluating medical counter measures?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did some of that.  We did that, some of that on all of the missions.  And so I don't know what specifically we might talk about.  But we did an awful lot of that on the next mission in '91 [1991].  We were, and it was an attempt to--well, the body changes significantly when we go to space.  And so what they were looking at was a way to prepare the body for reentry.  We lose a lot of muscle tone, muscle atrophies a lot.  We lose a lot of bone density.  We lose a gallon or so of liquid in our bodies.  We actually become space people after a couple of days, and, you know, all, a lot of concepts change, assumptions change, like ceilings and floors and walls have no con, have no value whatsoever.  After a couple of days, you're heads up, feet are down.  It didn't matter what the orientation is.  And, but one of the things is an attempt to prepare the body for reentry.  And so we did those kinds of experiments.  We were interested in how the body changed when it went to space, but we were also interested in how to prepare the body for reentry and gravity again.  And that would have been significant.  It's significant when we come back and land on earth because if the orbiter had a problem when it landed, you know, you would expect the crew would be able to evacuate it themselves and get away from it.  If they can't walk, then it would require that they be rescued.  And if they were nearby, you could do that, but if it were in some remote area, the crew would have to depend on themselves.  But in preparation for trips such as to Mars, long, long duration missions, and once they got there, if you use these low energy transfers, it would take perhaps a week for a crew to be able to actually go out and explore.  If they're only gonna be on the ground for two weeks, two and a half weeks or three weeks, whatever the duration is, then you've wasted a half or a third of the time that you should be discovering, just trying to get to a point where you can actually go do that.  So the series of evaluations and tests that we were doing was generally in that frame, preparation for reentry or the discovery of the changes that occurred on orbit.
Story_ID: 629141
Speaker 1: Do you remember your own experience, the experience of your own body as you came back to earth?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you don't much feel it when you're reentering, except your sensation tends to amplify what really exists.  For every quarter of a g [g-force], one g, you experience one g when you're here, and that, you know, it's sense, what your weight is.  That's, you know, that's the deal.  You don't have weight in, you don't have weight in orbit because that's a gravity issue.  You're mass, but not, but not weight.  When you reenter, you feel like you are four times more than what you really are.  So at a quarter g, it feels like you have one g.  When you get to one g, it feels like you're four gs.  So it feels like you're four times heavier than you are.  And that is a sensation until your body readjusts to earth.  Other issues, our sense of balance.  You know, in space, you don't have these, the sense, these sensors.  And they don't tell you anything because there's no gravity.  All the receptors in your body that tells you that you're leaning or turning or things like that, you don't have that space.  The only thing you have are your eyes, and that establishes a reference point.  When you get back to earth, it takes a while for these other sensors to adapt again to earth.  The only thing you have are your eyes, and you can look out and see a horizon and understand now, that, now, you are level.  If you close your eyes, you've lost it.  So you will tend to stagger.  If you tried to walk down a hall and make a turn, you'd run into the other wall.  It just, why it happens, it's just you are reestablishing yourself.  You can't run immediately because you're, you've not had to use those kind of muscles.  You've used other muscles in space.  So there are things that you have to relearn and the body quickly readapts.  And that's amazing, the way the body adapts to a new environment as though it was planned or someone or something way before us said, "These folks are finally gonna go do something like this."  We'd better do what's necessary to make it happen.
Speaker 1: It's interesting that in some ways you're involved in these medical studies given the history of your Uncle Charlie [Charles R. Drew]?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, I guess there is a connection there (laughter).
Speaker 1: Loose, but a connection nonetheless.  How many missions did you go on?
Speaker 2: I flew three, and then I got bored.
Speaker 1: The only person I know who gets bored after flying in space.
Speaker 2: Well, what do you do?  I mean you do it, and you do it again, and you do it again, and you do it again, I mean (laughter) how many times do you do that?  Yeah, you know, you've got to have a life, and you got to--I was down there for fifteen years, '87 [1987].  And then I had a, you know, I was clearly bored doing that.

Speaker 1: And then I had an opportunity, it was just coincidence, to come to Washington [D.C.] and become a bureaucrat.  So I enjoyed that.
Speaker 2: What did you do?  What was your role?
Speaker 1: First role was the creation of a safety program.  I kind of looked at things a little bit different than, you know, the regimented way of doing things, but I had nine years, no incidents, no accidents, no.  So and the agency itself became significantly better than any other government agency as far as lost time and accidents.  And we were compared more to the Alcoas [Alcoa Corporation] and DuPonts [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company] who have the best safety records in the country, probably in the world.
Speaker 2: Were you ever afraid going into space (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Never--
Speaker 2: --that something could happen?
Speaker 1: --ever, never.  Unh-uh, it's like Vietnam.  It's like, I was always on the edge.  My decision in '92 [1992] to leave the program was a conscious decision that I made.  And I, you know, like one day I woke up and I said, you know, I've been really selfish in my life.  I've done all of those things I like and I really have not paid the attention that I should have to my family.  So it was a very, very conscious decision that I made to leave the program.  Coming to Washington, I was still consumed by work, and though I said family was number one, work seemed to be.  And so my typical days were, an easy day might be twelve hours, ten to twelve hours, twelve hours.  And that would be a good day.  And then, then I would, I called that a half a day, 6:00 to 6:00 would be half the day.  And then I just made, then I made a conscious decision after I'd done the safety, and then I ran space flight, and then as a deputy I said, you know, bam, I've got to leave this whole thing.  And it's interesting.  I attempted to retire from the government, but I was held by the White House and held and held and held.  And finally in December of '05 [2005], I got out of the government, and what's interesting, we had been married for forty-two years, and I finally discovered my wife [Barbara Archer Gregory] (laughter).  And I had made a good choice (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Did you start dating again?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did.  We went on a road trip.  You know, and people said, first of all, you'll never be able to retire because you just won't be able to do it.  Well, a day after I retired, I'd retired.  I didn't have any problems at all.  And they always said, you know, "Sure you'll retire, but your wife doesn't want you home until after five [o'clock]."  So it was one of those things.  And that has never happened.  Now, I always used to complain about her sleeping until 9:30 or 10:00.  And then I was, you know, after I retired, I figured, well, did you get up so early?  So we have, we have adequate time now to, we've gone on two cruises.  We went on one in February.  We went on one in June.  We're gonna take another one in January.  I have plenty of time for grandkids now.  I do some consulting at about maybe seventy hours a month or so.  I only work with people that I'm interested in working with.  I don't work before ten or after two.  So, you know, I am now in charge of my life, and it's fantastic, you know.  I am counseling more folks who are interested in retirement and they like my model.  In fact, I had the deputy center director of the Glenn Research Center [John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field] in Cleveland [Ohio] here yesterday morning for breakfast.  Last week, I had a two star [U.S.] Air Force general here, just asking me--and everybody's taking my recommendation.  And that is, if you're gonna retire, retire.  Don't stop a job on Friday and start another one on Monday.  It's just not gonna work.  I tell them, make sure you have enough savings, fluid money, fluid resources so that you can take three, four, five months off without a concern about money coming in.  And I said, during that time, at a minimum, take a road trip.  And that is no schedule, no destination, no time, no nothing, like going to visit a friend in Denver [Colorado] is not a road trip because you have a destination and you've told the one to come.  A road trip is you just go out and flip a coin, and when you get to a--we did it.  We came back a month and a day later.
Speaker 2: And you traveled the country?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we just, we ended up in Tucson [Arizona], and we had grand intensions of going someplace else, but we liked it so much, it was in late January or February, we just stayed ten days.  And then, you know, I mean it was the kind of thing when you're driving along, and people don't, people fly.  This country is absolutely spectacular.  We'd go by these signs that says, live dinosaurs.  We'd go in to see these guys (laughter).  So it was a fascinating experience for us.

Speaker 1: You've also mentioned that throughout your career, you've known presidents.  You mentioned Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: How many presidents did you know personally?
Speaker 2: Oh, personally, probably Ronald Reagan and George Bush, number one [President George Herbert Walker Bush].
Speaker 1: How were they?
Speaker 2: Oh, fantastic.  George Bush, well, my mother [Nora Drew Gregory]--and we grew up as Democrats.  And so I've been kind of agnostic since then.  And I've really voted for a person as opposed to a party.  I'm not a party, my mother, on the other hand was a hard Democrat.  Mrs. Bush, Barbara Bush, was somebody like, she was the perfect first lady, almost like the first grandma of the country, who was the most sincere, sweetest, nicest person you could ever meet.  My mom, when George Bush initially became president, would refer to him as, oh, referred to the couple as Mrs. Bush and that man.  And I had the privilege of spending time with Mrs. Bush, and I would tell her that.  And she would talk about, you know, "George just doesn't know how to do anything," I mean, and she was just so open.  She was a wonderful person.  George Bush, if you saw, if you were in the Old Executive Office Building [Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Washington, D.C.] and he walked by, and he saw you, he'd say, "Come on over, let's play some horseshoes," or something like that.  He was just so, he was just so open.  In the evolution, when mom changed from Mrs. Bush and that man to Mrs. Bush and the president, and I told her that, and she would just, she almost cried when she, when she heard that.  So I brought some special things that I had brought from space, but delightful company, delightful couple.  You know, this is not a political comment.  This is a statement of the family of George and Barbara Bush.  Reagan was, he was (laughter) an amazing person considering his age.  He gave a talk once while I was over for lunch.  And he had everything on a three by five card.  And I looked at the card and I asked him if I could see the, the print was so small that I could barely read it, but he was using this as his prompt.  He was an exciting guy.  You know, you just felt like a proud American when you were with him.  He was a true patriot.  You know, he was to me like John Wayne.  So John Wayne and Robert--Ronald Reagan were, you know, a kind of breed, a breed in themselves.  You know, you just felt great to be an American when you were with them.  And so those are the only two.  I've met George W. Bush [President George Walker Bush], but he's not, he's not like his parents at all.  And I had no association with Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton].  Clinton had nothing at all to say or support of the shuttle program because we were always looking for sound bites that we could use, and we always had to go back to either Reagan or George the first.

Speaker 1: At this stage in your life, as you look back, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Someone who made a contribution.  It was my role, and that was passed on from my parents [Nora Drew Gregory and Francis Gregory] though they never said it.  You always give the next generation more than your parents gave you.  And I think I've done that.  I have a legacy now with the grandson [Scott Francis Gregory] going to the Air Force Academy [United States Air Force Academy, Colorado].  That will now be three generations of [U.S.] Air Force.  And I think that I have done, I sat back.  I can't think of anything bad that I've done, and I think I've done good things.  And, of course, we'll never know, but I think I've done that.  I think I have followed Ms. Smith's [ph.] guidance.  I've established, you know, you can work within this area.  When you cross the boundary outside of this, that you're gonna get slapped back, but given the freedom to maneuver but assure that, you know, it's always a very positive thing.  And whatever they do, it's got to make a contribution.  It was a significant--that was very significant to me, the impact of it.
Speaker 1: In the world of NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], what would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That I made con- (laughter) I made a contribution (laughter).
Speaker 1: Is there any specific part of that contribution you'd like people to really remember?
Speaker 2: No, because there were so many phases of it.  I made improvements.  I made modifications and all of those have been accepted.  I don't know how it will be written in the future, but as far as I'm concerned, what I did was all positive.
Story_ID: 629145
Speaker 1: Any advice for the kids of today (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Kids, in your career, in your academic development, never decide early what you wanna do.  Learn as much as you can, as broadly, you know, broad, but become a jack of all trades.  If you decide you wanna be something like an astronaut and you don't make it, then you consider yourself a failure, can consider yourself a failure.  You've got to be agile and flexible enough to hit obstacles and take sidesteps, even back steps sometimes, and you might end up doing something entirely different than what you realized or thought initially you were gonna do.  So I always encourage kids to, if you're engineering, sure, take it, but also take economics and law and English, political science, like that because you will not always be talking to engineers in your life.  You've got to be able to understand the political consequences of it or the cost of it or the legal aspects of it and things like that.  And I said, that'll make you a much broader person.  And you may end up being as, you know, something, as I said, that you never anticipated being.  At the same time, I have very strong feelings about what you do and how it establishes the possibility of you giving to the next generation.  So I'm, if I have biases and prejudices, I believe that those things you do have to contribute.  So there are academic fields, there are fields that I don't recommend folks to go into because it doesn't provide anything.  But I am interested in research and technology and actually, am pretty disappointed that our country is becoming more of a service provider than a country that is not afraid to take risks, invest in early technology and things like that.  And there're many examples of how we are evolving.  And I don't think that's healthy.  So there it is.
