Speaker 1: This HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] interview is being conducted by [HistoryMaker] Robert C. Hayden.  The videographer is Mr. Scott Stearns.  The date is October 17, 2006.  The location of this interview is at the home of our HistoryMaker, 1610 Timmons Road--wrong address?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: On Timmons Road in Quincy, Florida.  Madam HistoryMaker, would you give me your full name and would you spell your name for me?
Speaker 2: Good morning, my name is [HistoryMaker] Patricia Stephens Due, Patricia, P-A-T-R-I-C-I-A, Stephens, S-T-E-P-H-E-N-S and my last name is Due, D-U-E.
Speaker 1: Would you give us your date of birth and where you were born?
Speaker 2: I was born December 9, 1939 right here in Gadsden County [Florida] where we are today to do this interview.
Speaker 1: How would you label or describe your career?  What, what do you presently do, or what has been your career since you finished college--your occupation?
Speaker 2: Actually, most of my career as an adult has been volunteer work.  I actually have had few gainful employment. I did work at the University of Miami [Coral Gables, Florida] on several occasions.  I worked for a place called New Horizons [New Horizons Community Mental Health Center, Inc., Miami, Florida] which dealt with the mental illness of people in the community in Miami-Dade County [Florida], and I did a few other jobs, but my real work was as a volunteer in the community in Miami-Dade County.
Speaker 1: And of course this morning we're gonna talk about your total involvement in the Civil Rights Movement for well over forty years I would say?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Almost fifty (laughter).
Speaker 1: Fifty, okay.

Speaker 1: Before we move into your life, your family background, we have three or four kind of People magazine type questions that we'd like to ask you just to warm up, but also it will give the viewers of your interview another slant on your personality.  And so, these are kind of fun questions.  Mrs. Due [HistoryMaker Patricia Stephens Due] what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food?  I guess my husband [John Due] would say a Subway sandwich because that's what I eat most of the time now, but over the years I think my favorite food was macaroni and cheese.
Speaker 1: Sure. Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of year is this time of year, when it's really not too hot and it's not too cold, but my favorite month though is December (laughter).
Speaker 1: Why, why Dec- (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Cause I was born in December and I celebrate the whole month (laughter).
Speaker 1: Good (laughter), do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes I have several favorite colors.  Now, I don't know if people would consider black a color, but black is my favorite.  I wear a lot of black, I like red and I like purple.
Speaker 1: Good, very good.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination, where--places like you escape to and--?
Speaker 2: I wish I did.  Over the years, and my husband and I will celebrate our forty-third anniversary on January 5th.  I don't believe we've ever had a vacation.  We were too busy going to NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] conventions and once we did that, we couldn't afford a regular vacation.
Speaker 1: Okay, last question, do you have a favorite phrase or saying or some philosophical plot that you like to use from time-to-time with friends, family, neighbors?  Something that kind of guides you from day-to-day, or words of wisdom that you have for others?
Speaker 2: Well, I think about the words of wisdom I would like to call it over the years with my children [Tananarive Due, Johnita Due, and Lydia Due Greisz] as they, as they struggled to make the A's or the Bs.  I said you know, "Just do your best, and that's all you can do."  And I still--I believe that.  You just do your best and your best may be different at different times, but as long as you do your best whether it's a B or a C or whatever grade letter or whatever you are accomplishing, that's all you can do.
Story_ID: 482798
Speaker 1: We're going to explore first your family background so that the people who will use your interview and listen to you talk will have some sense of how you became socialized and how you came to be the person that you were.  And so, we're gonna start with your family, and we're gonna start with your mother and I'd like you to give me your mother's name if you would and when and where she was born?
Speaker 2: My mother was born right here in Gadsden County [Florida].  Her name was Lottie Mae Powell [Lottie Powell Stephens Hamilton], Powell being her maiden name and she was Lottie Mae Powell Stephens and Hamilton, the person she married who really was my father [Marion M. Hamilton].  And she was also Sears and Houston, so my mother had any number of names.
Speaker 1: What do you know about her growing up years here in the county, this--in Quincy [Florida], right?   Was it Quincy?
Speaker 2: Yes, right here in Gadsden County [Florida].  My grandmother [Alma Peterson], my mother's mother lived in Mount Pleasant [Florida] which is also here in Gadsden County.  She was a very mild-mannered person, actually she reminds me a lot of husband [John Due] you know who always smiles and, and has something good to say to you.  Then on the other hand my grandfather, Richard Allen Powell, I guess is more, I guess I'm more like him and maybe mother was more like him, but granddaddy lived on a farm.  He had about a hundred acres.  He had a duck pond.  Oh, I love these ponds and he had a couple of ponds where you can actually fish and he grew cotton.  Later on, as I got older and we came to visit--this was vacation--he would get us up at four o'clock to pick the cotton.  Granddaddy was very stern and, I think a lot of people might have been afraid of him.  My mother told me about some incidents that had to do with her family.  During the late '30s [1930s] and early '40s [1940s] when everything was rationed, including food and shoes you would have to go to a special place here in Gadsden County to receive your rations and mother would stand in line and then some people, white people would come up to her and say, "Oh, aren't you Richard's daughter?"  She would say, "Yes."  She said and she said, "Well you don't have to stand in line, you just come on in."  And what this amounted to was that granddaddy had a white parent.  Mother was very fair skinned, but she said, "Oh, no, no I'm just going to wait my turn."  Because she knew if she went ahead that she would have more trouble that she was having in the so-called colored community as we were called then, because as you recall there, there was this friction between us in terms of our color, but no matter how light skinned or how dark you were, you were all colored, but in Gadsden County sometimes whites who had so-called colored families wanted to do little favors as they call 'em for them.  So, my mother had a stepmother early on and she did not get along with her because this stepmother had so many relatives who had children, she wanted everything done for them and nothing for mother.  Now, although mother grew up with material things--oh, horses.  Oh, I love the horses.  Horses are still a favorite of mine.  She felt that she was not a part of her own home because she was being raised by her father and a stepmother, because my grandfather had sought to take her from her biological mother saying she was too poor to actually take care of her.  So, he did, he did take her.  He took care of her but it is not always in the material things that you might have.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Her emotional well-being was really damaged.
Story_ID: 482799
Speaker 1: What was your mother's [Lottie Powell Stephens Hamilton] personality like, what was she like as a person?  How do you remember her?
Speaker 2: My mother was a person who liked to fish, my mother was a person who liked to travel, to dance and my mother was a person who wanted the best for her children and I believe that is the reason she actually remarried, so that we would have a father.  She and my biological father, Horace Walter Stephens [Horace Stephens, Sr.] were divorced by the time I was four years old and then we traveled on the train to Miami, Florida where mother got a job and I think it was as a decorator in a store window initially, and, and she could have only on Miami Beach [Florida], and the only reason she got that job was because she was so fair skinned.  She knew others would be discriminated against and she felt uneasy about there.  So she decided she would bring us back to Quincy, Gadsden County [Florida], let her mother [Alma Peterson] take care of us so that is what happened for several years.
Story_ID: 482800
Speaker 1: How did your mother's [Lottie Powell Stephens Hamilton] family and your father's [Horace Stephens, Sr.] family first come to Gadsden County, Quincy [Florida]?  What--do you know how they settled here (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually, I really don't.  All I've ever heard was that we've always been here in Gadsden County, my father and my mother, both.
Speaker 1: Was this a majority black county or white county or was it mixed, during their, during their time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This, this really was a majority white, I mean black county until the '60s [1960s], mid-'60s [1960s], even probably the late '60s [1960s] and, and now it has really changed quite a bit and although it was a majority black county, there were very few blacks--and, and if I regress and go back to color, Negro because that is what it was then.  There were very few Negroes registered to vote here in Gadsden County in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll come back to the voting struggles.
Story_ID: 482801
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit more about your father, his name, you mentioned his name but--when he was born and where and what you know about your father, your biological father?
Speaker 2: I actually know very little about my biological father.  His name is Horace Walter Stephens [Horace Stephens, Sr.].  He was born here in Gadsden County [Florida].  Now, the stories that I did hear, the main story, was that he was a businessman.  He was not even out of high school yet.  He had his own restaurant, a few years later after, after graduating from high school, and this is in Gadsden County, he had a nightclub, and I read at a point and my mother [Lottie Powell Stephens Hamilton] told me he was run out town on a--one occasion because the people were mixing.  There were blacks and whites going to his club.  Now, it's ironic though that you ask me about him because I was reading a letter that he wrote to his sister.  My father died quite a few years ago, and I was a reading a letter that he wrote to his sister, very concerned about her health.  She was scheduled to leave Gadsden County and go I think to California to be married and take the children with her, but he was letting her know that if she ever needed help, she should call him.  That he would take care of her.  And I was happy and sad at the same time because I don't, although we did visit my father as we got older for a couple of weeks during the summer, I don't ever remember his having that kind of affection for us, but then I was happy to know that he felt that strongly about a sibling.
Speaker 1: What year was your father born, do you recall when he was?
Speaker 2: Now I've heard different years.  My mother was born in 1920 so I believe my father was born in 1917.
Story_ID: 482802
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your early years now.  How far back can you remember in your life?  What is your earliest memory as a child?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was asking Tananarive [Tananarive Due] that she said, "Oh, mom I remember when I was three years old."  But I didn't, I think my earliest memories were five and six, and I was told at four years old I started taking piano lessons right here in Gadsden County [Florida] and my teacher was Mrs. Dorothy Chandler Jones and the thing I remember about that piano was my hand being spanked by Mrs. Jones because evidently I had not practiced enough.  I also remember in Quincy [Florida] when mother [Lottie Powell Stephens Hamilton] brought us back from Miami [Florida] to live with our [maternal] grandmother [Alma Peterson], going fishing every day on Mr. Jerry's--in Mr. Jerry Brown's creek which is out there in Gadsden County near where we lived.  I would walk down the hill and, and then go up and then go to Mr. Brown's creek to fish.  I would see snakes hanging in the trees overhead.  Do you know now I wouldn't even think of going to this little fishing hole we have here you know at the farms.  This is what we call this area, but I love fishing.
Speaker 1: How far was this area where you fished from where we are now, are we talking in--even in the same neighborhood, or are we talking about?
Speaker 2: No, this place I'm staying now is called The Farms at Quincy [Quincy, Florida], these were all tobacco plantations.  The--some of these places are places where later on they were trying to hurt us because we were trying to get people register to vote, but I guess we're about ten miles or eleven miles.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wanted a sense of the geography, okay.
Story_ID: 482803
Speaker 1: And the next thing I remember, and this was exciting.  Now, my [maternal] grandmother [Alma Peterson] lost her hearing when she was a young adult and in spite of that she was able to keep us but there were some things she couldn't do.  She couldn't keep us from climbing out of the windows at night when she had gone to bed and allegedly, we had gone to bed, to play with some of the neighbors right in our yard and that's where I learned to play whist, and I was very young and to this day even on my computer I have whist.  Those were some of the times that I remember that seemed rather carefree.  As I think about it I didn't have many, and when you're talking about distance, we lived about seven miles or eight miles from town and we actually walked to town.  I mean, I am amazed.  I have clocked it since I've been back and I am amazed that we could walk to town and not only did we walk to town just to look around in stores, we had to walk to town after a few grades to go to school, and this is what had happened with my mother [Lottie Powell Stephens Hamilton] too.  You pass schools, but no colored allowed.  So, you just keep on walking and the other--the white children would be riding buses.  So, I remember that, but by the time I was nine years old it was time to go.  It was time for more supervision (laughter), and my mother came.
Speaker 2: What street did you live on during this time?  Where?  Can you describe the neighborhood?
Speaker 1: In, in Quincy [Florida]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Oh, please, in the country, we didn't really have streets but now, if I were living in the same place with my mother, that would be called Powell Street or Stephens Street or whatever her name is.  This is how the post persons can find you today.  You may notice as you drive along in Gadsden County [Florida] a lot of the street names--Timmons Road was named after a person who lived on Timmons Road.  That's how you can get your mail, they know where you live because that's your street, and, and that still happens.  That happens today, but during the time I was growing up I don't remember a street.  We just said, "Oh, you go there, you go about a block and, and then you turn this way or you turn that way and you're there" (laughter).
Story_ID: 482804
Speaker 1: Did you have siblings?  We, we don't wanna, did you have (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I have two siblings.  I have a sister Priscilla [Priscilla Stephens Kruize] who's older by about fourteen months and a brother, Walter, Horace Walter Stephens [Horace Stephens, Jr.], named after our father [Horace Stephens, Sr.] who was almost two years younger.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where is your sister today, Priscilla?
Speaker 2: Priscilla just came back, just went back to Miami, Florida.  She had spent three and a half months in Africa, mostly in Ghana in Accra where she is trying to--evidently the government is going to give her the building for a Black Heritage Museum.  Not stocking it with items from Africa but with items from America to tell our story since we've been here.  So, Priscilla has run the Black Heritage Museum now for a couple of decades, but unfortunately after Andrew in 1992, Hurricane Andrew, she received so much damage that she hasn't really been able to have a physical home for that museum in Miami-Dade County [Florida], but she does go out and she has exhibits and she, she's talented.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She's gifted.
Speaker 1: Give--let's--give me her full name, 'cause she married--give, what's her name?
Speaker 2: Priscilla Stephens, she keeps our maiden name, S-T-E-P-H-E-N-S and her last name is Kruize, K-R-U-I-Z-E, and her husband [Muncko Kruize] died on December 25, 2000, one hour after my mother [Lottie Powell Stephens Hamilton] died.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your brother was Walter you said?
Speaker 2: Horace Walter.
Speaker 1: Horace Walter.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is he still living and where is he?
Speaker 2: Yes, he lives in Atlanta [Georgia].  He left home, Belle Glade [Florida] then to go to Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] and he has never returned to live.  He married a young woman who was a Willis [Rita Willis Stephens] and she was from Atlanta and so he's living there now, of course, we had relatives in Atlanta too.
Speaker 1: And what's his career, what's his profession?  What does he do?
Speaker 2: Well, he's retired.  He actually worked with Mead [Mead Corporation], and he--an international import and export company, but now traveling, he travels all the time and I don't think he ever misses a vacation.  He knows how he needs to keep going so, he, he does a lot of traveling.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which we actually did as children.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 482805
Speaker 1: Well, that leads me to my next question.  Tell me about you and your brother and sister growing up here.  What did you three do together?  I know you liked to fish and--so what did you--what was family life like for you with your brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Well, we were young and, and we did things together although we tried to keep Walter [Horace Stephens, Jr.] home, because, he then he was much younger.  Priscilla [Priscilla Stephens Kruize] would go fishing with me.  Of course, there would be days that she did not.  Priscilla would get out of that window and play cards with me, and Priscilla was the instigator when we would walk to town [Quincy, Florida] just to go look in the stores.  So, we did a lot of things together.  Priscilla has this saying that wherever you find her, she would find me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That--we were always together.  Now, when we moved from Gadsden County [Florida] down to Belle Glade [Florida] where my mother [Lottie Powell Stephens Hamilton] and my stepfather lived.  He was Marion M. Hamilton and he had gotten a job teaching social studies and as band director on the Muck as they called in Belle Glade as they called it in Belle Glade.  That's really when our lives really changed, we still.
Speaker 1: How old were you when she married?
Speaker 2: I was nine years old.
Speaker 1: When he married--when your mother married?
Speaker 2: When my mother remarried.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was nine years old.
Speaker 1: And you were living in Belle Grade then?
Speaker 2: Belle Glade.
Speaker 1: Belle Glade?
Speaker 2: Yes, B-E-L-L-E, then G-L-A-D-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you.
Speaker 2: We were living in Belle Glade, actually until I finished high school [Lake Shore Junior Senior High School, Belle Glade, Florida], but it was a whole new world.  Although people call it the Muck, the place where immigrants lived.  People lived in tin shelters there, but they had different housing for teachers, but we were taught that you're no different than the people living in those tin houses.  You just happen to be living somewhere else and not only did our parents, and I'm talking about Daddy Marion now because I actually consider him my father--teach us these kinds of things by telling us.  They did so by being involved.  One of the few places in the county, in the South anyway, they have a biracial committee was in Belle Glade.  This was the committee and I learned this later that was designed to work.  They brought in--I had a black dentist.  I had black doctors.  The black people, the Negroes in that community got together and said, "This is what we need in order to be at our best in this community."  So, a lot of things happened, we raised money to buy band uniforms.  We raised money for hospital wings, but the fishing park, Lake Okeechobee.  We were always there and my father didn't like to fish, but he was willing to go.  He would sit in the car and read and my mother, sister, brother and I would be out there fishing.
Speaker 1: What kind of fish did he catch?
Speaker 2: Mostly mullet, that's what I remember most of all?
Speaker 1: Mullet?
Speaker 2: The long, the big mullet fish.  It was freshwater.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, like, were?
Speaker 2: A freshwater lake.
Speaker 1: Were they like eels or?
Speaker 2: Oh, well it was a long--oh no, no they were much larger.  Oh, an eel I would be, I would be a little concerned.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And catfish, just, just all kind of fish.
Speaker 1: Who did the cooking?
Speaker 2: My [maternal] grandmother [Alma Peterson] (laughter), my grandmother, I don't remember her going fishing with us though come to think of it, but she did the cooking.
Story_ID: 482806
Speaker 1: To continue discussing your childhood years: what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up here in Gadsden County [Florida] and in Belle Glade [Florida]?
Speaker 2: Boy, you sound like my daughter Tananarive [Tananarive Due].  As tear gas is being thrown at me and I'm marching, she, "Mom, what flowers were blooming?"  "Now, I don't know darling."  Well, I, guess the sights would be the beautiful trees.  I mean there are trees everywhere in Gadsden County.  Unfortunately, I found out that I'm allergic to most of them.  In fact, where we are now we have sixty trees, pine trees and oak trees.  I love to climb trees. I love to look at them.  Now, in terms of the water I don't remember any particular smell and although I fished there I was A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] as my family was.  I do remember thinking I can't see down in that water, it was--the water was kind of murky and muddy and I said, "I'll never be able to get religion here because I might drown."  However, Priscilla [Priscilla Stephens Kruize] did, but I still said, "No, not me.  I'm not going in that water."  Now, in Belle Glade, I miss the trees but the sight and it was a negative and positive for different people.  I guess in a way for me it was both.  It was the soil, it was black, it was beautiful.  It was called black gold and it was very fertile except that when it got on me it made me itch (laughter), but I love, I loved it.  I couldn't play in it, but I loved that black soil.
Speaker 1: That's neat.
Speaker 2: And I don't think I'd ever seen any black soil, black gold.
Story_ID: 482807
Speaker 1: Any other memories of growing up that are kind of still in front of you that you'd like to share?  Anything else?
Speaker 2: Well, yes and I didn't even realize that it was odd until I talked with my husband [John Due] and other people who grew up other places and in different kinds of families, we traveled all the time, and although everything was segregated you couldn't stop at hotels, you couldn't eat in restaurants.  I had no idea that I couldn't do it.  I actually thought my father [Stephens Due's stepfather, Marion M. Hamilton] liked driving and, and I thought my mother [Lottie Powell Stephens Hamilton] enjoyed preparing a lunch for us, which we were always so excited about.  My father was from Atlanta [Georgia], so we went to Atlanta quite a bit.  He had relatives in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and he had relatives in New York.  So, we got to travel quite a bit and as I talked with friends, "Oh," they said "You, you mean you've been--that, you went that far when you were that young?"  Well, yes we, we did a lot of traveling.  My parents--and I know this doesn't sound like fun but it was a lesson for us to learn.  My parents were involved in voter registration.  My mother was a Democratic committee woman in Palm Beach County [Florida], so I learned early on, all three of us by going with her how the voting process was supposed to work and, and I guess the thing that I'm most proud of now looking back--I don't know as a child, my mother was always at my school.  She's even in my yearbooks, you know (laughter) (unclear) in the--I was in the band, she was a band parent, she's there at the PTA [Parent Teacher Association], she's there, but you know what I'm beginning to realize from my own children, especially my youngest daughter, Lydia [Lydia Due Greisz] who has the oldest children, she refers back to everything I did as a mother.  'Cause I said, "Well Lydia, you need to take it easy a little bit, just relax."  "Well, mom you were always at our school.  I'm just, I'm just gonna volunteer for four or five days."  I said, "Lydia, a little bit at a time--don't just," and then she did it and then she got so tired.  They had her running things off, she was in the classroom having lunch with her son every week and, and we really do have to be careful of the examples we set, because I've heard from all three of them for one thing or the other, about well, "Oh, you did that mom."  They really do look at what you do, not necessarily listen to what you say, so I just thought that was kind of ironic and I still have my high school yearbook so from time-to-time I'll look in it and look at my mother just sitting there.  One thing that didn't help was my sewing class.  She would come to the little meetings about sewing.  I never did learn how to sew.  When we had our little, when we, when we all had to get out and model what we had sewn I had to pin my little shorts up, 'cause I couldn't figure how to get the zipper to work, and I remember my sewing teacher was Mrs. Ernestine B. Moore, and I remember so vividly because years later in the '70s [1970s] when I was participating in a poor people's march from Miami [Florida] to Tallahassee [Florida], as we marched a little bit then rode the rest of the way we stopped at a church in West Palm Beach, and guess who was there preparing the food?  My home ec [home economics] teacher, I was so proud of her, so proud of her.
Story_ID: 482808
Speaker 1: You mentioned school so let's move to your formal education.  When did you start school and where, and how do you remember the beginning of your formal education?
Speaker 2: Okay, well actually I started kindergarten in Miami [Florida], Mr. Anderson's kindergarten [Anderson's Kindergarten, Miami, Florida] in Overtown and then of course mother moved us back to Quincy [Florida] to Gadsden County [Florida].  So, I went to--actually, initially a one-room, had several classes in it, a school, near where we lived and then I went to Stevens High School [William S. Stevens High School, Quincy, Florida].  Stevens spelled S-T-E-V-E-N-S, everyone mixes us up, we're not the same Stephens, but I went to elementary school there in Quincy and, and then I moved to Belle Glade [Florida] and initially we went to a school called Everglades Vocational High School [Belle Glade, Florida].  Took in all the grades and, and then they built another school and this was sort of in a, in a project where they wanted to--where all the migrant children lived.  That's where they had the school with this segregated special housing for teachers and then they built Lake Shore High School in Belle Glade itself.  The other school was on the outskirts and that's where I graduated from, Lake Shore High School [Lake Shore Junior Senior High School, Belle Glade, Florida] and Mr. Charles McCurdy who was really a special person, was the principal.
Speaker 1: Going back to your elementary schooling here in Quincy, how many years were you here in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Probably no more than two, no more than two.
Speaker 1: How do you remember those years?  Was that grades one and two, or two and three or was it--?
Speaker 2: No, actually it was five, probably five and four because we were back, back and forth.  I was in fifth grade when I left and I really don't remember much except the maypole and doing little steps when they would take us out for recess, and but I imagine after leaving Quincy and going to Belle Glade that they had done a good job, because I was in fifth grade and I was being called to seventh grade classes to help them with math, and that was not even my strong area.
Speaker 1: What was your strong area?
Speaker 2: Language arts, music.
Speaker 1: Were you still playing the piano at that point?
Speaker 2: I wish I could.
Speaker 1: No, at that point were you playing?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, oh not much.  I had started on the trumpet; I had started on the trumpet.  My father [Stephens Due's stepfather, Marion M. Hamilton] as I say was band director so, and of course there was a little boy, Joseph Perry [ph.], that I sort of liked.  So, I said when he said "Well what instrument?"  I said "Oh, I wanna play the trumpet," 'cause Joe played the trumpet.  I found out though it wasn't that easy to get, to sit next to him because I had to be good.  So, I practiced all the time and I was good and then I got--I was going to be able to sit next to Joe, then my father said I need Joe on trombone.  So, it just, he changed any--I played the bassoon and for a place like Belle Glade, but my father brought so much to Belle Glade.  He had played with Lionel Hampton himself.  He grew up in Atlanta [Georgia] with a music room so he knew how important music was, and, and that brought a whole dimension to my life.
Speaker 1: Did you play in the band?  Were you a band member?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh yes.  I played the lead part, part in trumpet especially after Joe left and then after a few years of playing solo trumpet, or first trumpet my father said I needed, I--we needed a bassoon in the band.  So, he said I, "You will have to play the bassoon."  Because nobody had ever heard of a bassoon double reed instrument, most beautiful instrument.  I had what is called a perfect armature for the trumpet.  My jaws didn't inflate or anything and I had a very high range.  In fact, my trumpets are out there now, at least one, and one I bought for Tananarive [Tananarive Due], but I played and actually I went on to college [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] as a music major.

Speaker 1: What was Belle Glade [Florida] like, tell me about the community during this time when you--?
Speaker 2: In a way it was segregation within segregation.  Blacks and whites--other than this biracial committee that would meet--segregated from each other and then blacks segregated from other blacks.  It wasn't always, you know you had a so-called black bourgeoisie and you had a so-called black middle class, it wasn't always these people or my family that didn't want me to play with someone else.  I found it just to be the reverse.  The young woman I really wanted for my friend was Gertha Jurneger [ph.] and we got along so well.  In fact, I invited her to go with me on my sixtieth birthday celebration.  You know the years went by, but I still had those feelings, and she never accepted an invitation to come home with me for dinner.  And I said, "Well why Gertha, what's the problem?"  She said, "Oh because you all are too formal."  When I was growing up, yes, the table had to be set every day and we sat there and I said, "Oh, that's no problem, I'll show you."  She was afraid she wouldn't know what silverware to use and my mother [Lottie Powell Stephens Hamilton] was fanatical, not that she would've, would have said anything to him, but in teaching us what should be done.  She wanted to make certain that we did know but I think it frightened a lot of kids off.  So basically, Priscilla [Priscilla Stephens Kruize], Walter [Horace Stephens, Jr.] and I had each other, and then there was Joe Perry [Joseph Perry (ph.)].  He was my son--he was my homeroom teacher's son and they had a dance called the pall bearer's dance.  You had your own little group, your own culture, everything and Joe, Joe's father would call and ask what kind of dress I was wearing and gown and so he could get me the right color corsage.  So, we did that within these two segregated areas, I mean us, them, and us again.  I played basketball, I'm short but I was good, I really--I could, I could really--now, I'm not just bragging now, I could shoot from the center of the court.  I had great strength and I won a few little prizes and ribbons for being a good basketball player and the marching band, I was in the marching and concert band.  We could dance.  My father [Stephens Due's stepfather, Marion M. Hamilton] taught us a lot of the old songs, but he also knew the newer songs, and I remember 'What a Shame' [sic.], 'Ain't That a Shame' know and just dancing and marching and we were even written about because we were really so good.  So, in my mind I had a good life, I didn't mind that across from us our home, there was a two-story boarding house where migrants lived, mostly men.  I didn't mind that, of course, as you recall we always lived in segregated areas, we--blacks lived one place and whites lived another place and, and it wasn't based on what home you could afford, it was mixed, mixed.

Speaker 1: But there were problems in Belle Glade [Florida].  A postman, a white postman who was coming to the school [Lake Shore Junior Senior High School Belle Glade, Florida] and I was on the student council.  In fact, I as president of the student council.  I started as a bailiff, by the time I was senior I was president, but one ritual we had between classes, someone would be sitting outside in the breezeway to greet guests, and this day it was my turn, and this white postman came in and, and just looked at me and said, "How about a little?"  And, and you know I was trying to register what he meant, then I said "What did you?"  He said, "Well how about a little, you never heard that before?"  And then he just laughed and went on inside the school, and I was very upset because I knew that was something very negative.  My father [Stephens Due's stepfather, Marion M. Hamilton] worked at the school, but as a dean of students by this time I rushed to him to tell him, but he didn't act quickly enough for me.  It was really just more difficult for black men.  It always has been.  Maybe he was afraid he would lose his job, maybe couldn't stand the idea of going up against a white person, so I just left school and went home and told my mother [Lottie Powell Stephens Hamilton].  Now, she on the other hand rushed back to the school, wanted to know who that po- that, that postman was.  We finally got information, we sat down, I wrote a letter to Washington, D.C. complaining and saying what had happened.  I was fifteen years old and evidently he had done the same thing in some white schools, 'cause a year later they came and talked to me in Belle Glade and then the first thing they said, "Well you are sixteen, I thought you said you were fifteen?"  My mother said, "Listen that was a whole year ago."  You know as if they were gonna blame me for their coming, taking so long to get there, but this postman was either changed or he was fired.  Well, I didn't have any illusions that it had anything to do with me.  We were all certain that some white children had been involved and this is why this had happened, but anyway it was a good lesson because I knew as much as my mother had told me.  She was willing to do something about the wrongs, and to him I was probably just a nigger, not important.  You know, "How dare you report me," but thanks to my parents, I knew I had rights too.
Story_ID: 482811
Speaker 1: Fact, when I was in high school [Lake Shore Junior Senior High School, Belle Glade, Florida] with--everybody was talking about the Brown decision [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  Everybody was talking about the Brown decision.  Then I decided, "Oh, my goodness our principal [Charles McCurdy] is such a nice man, but he doesn't do the best job for us."  So I don't know if I went through the proper procedure in trying to talk to him.  I don't think so.  I just got up a petition, 'cause he wasn't making certain that the teachers did their jobs.  A lot of them lived in West Palm Beach [Florida], forty miles away, came to the so-called Muck [Belle Glade, Florida] to teach and then they were gone, sometime early.  So, I got hundreds of names on that petition and then a math teacher, Mr. Walker [ph.] told the students that they could be arrested for signing that petition, and all of a sudden I see these thirty or forty students chasing me wanting their names off and, and I just ran.  I ran home, 'cause I was not going to let them take their names off and the list was taken to the board, to the school board in Palm Beach, West Palm Beach, which was forty miles away and, again this man was not sent back.  Now, it wasn't just me, I know that.  Some adults were concerned too, but what I didn't realize as a child and later on probably realized that Mr. Walker probably thought they could be arrested or hurt for signing it, because that was not part of his mentality, but as my social studies teacher, my father [Stephens Due's stepfather, Marion M. Hamilton] had taught me, "Oh, you have the right to do this, you have the right to do that," although sometimes my actions may have been scary to him.  I believed him, but it was just important to try.
Story_ID: 482812
Speaker 1: I wanna get to something that you and your sister Priscilla [Priscilla Stephens Kruize] did, I guess you were in high school [Lake Shore Junior Senior High School, Belle Glade, Florida] and it was in front of Dairy Queen?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me what you and your sister did?
Speaker 2: And they still have Dairy Queen.  As everywhere you had the white and the colored signs.  So, if you wanted ice cream you had to go in the back.  Well, Priscilla and I would say, "Well why should we go in the back?  They seem to be getting faster service in the front."  Not even thinking about everything that was involved.  You--they're getting faster service.  So, we would go and ask for service there.
Speaker 1: So you stood in the white line?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, nothing except they got a hold of our parents [Lottie Powell Stephens Hamilton and Stephens Due's stepfather, Marion M. Hamilton] and complained but it didn't do any good, we kept doing it.  We were never arrested for doing there, but we.
Speaker 1: But they did serve you?  You got served?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Now, my brother [Horace Stephens, Jr.] said he did it years later and they sent a police officer to the house when he tried-- when he tried to do it.
Story_ID: 482813
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you in high school [Lake Shore Junior Senior High School, Belle Glade, Florida]?  Did you enjoy high school?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed school, now I have to think about what kind of student I was.  I have to back up and let you know.  My father, Marion Hamilton's [Stephens Due's stepfather, Marion M. Hamilton] brother was Henry Cooke Hamilton, who was the registrar at Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] and because of this connection during that time Morehouse--traveled--mostly Uncle Cookie, traveled around recruiting the best boys in the classes and because of his relationship to Daddy Marion, a lot of bright boys from Belle Glade [Florida] got to go to college at, in tenth grade, and eleventh grade, so most of my competition was gone.  Most of my competition was gone and my friend Gertha [Gertha Jurneger (ph.)], who was really smart, unfortunately had become pregnant and had dropped out in the eleventh grade.  So, I really didn't work as hard as I would have, had I had all the competition that had already left.  Joe Pratt-Whitley [ph.], I think Joe eventually worked with and there was a paramour and they--Joe owned his owned plane and was flying around.  I mean Robert Morris [ph.], who was also one of my competitors in class had also gone to Morehouse.  So, it just stripped us of the brightest and the best and as I said there was Gertha who was really, really smart.
Speaker 1: Can I (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, I graduated at the top of the class but, but understand that the top had just mellowed down.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 482814
Speaker 1: How did the 1954 Brown decision [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] affect Belle Glade [Florida] and your life in your school district with?
Speaker 2: Probably not at all.  I was very naive, I graduated from high school [Lake Shore Junior Senior High School, Belle Glade, Florida] in '57 [1957] and very excited about the Brown decision, but naive because I thought, "Oh, my goodness May 17, 1954 we're all gonna have good science equipment.  We're gonna have up-to-date books, and we're gonna have all of these things we missed in September 1954."  I'm thinking, the next school term it'll be over.  I graduated.
Speaker 1: And nothing had changed?
Speaker 2: And nothing had changed.  I never went to school with others, nothing--no, why--it wasn't the idea of sitting by a white, that was never my concern, but I knew the material would follow the white students.  I graduated from college.  That was segregated, although I went to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] for a summer.  They may, they may have had several, but largely from all black colleges [HBCUs].  So, and, and even now because my husband, John Due, was the attorney of record for the Brown case in, in Miami-Dade County [Florida] and we had so many schools just a couple of years ago there was still predominately one race or one group.  I don't know, I just, I don't think it affected Belle Glade at all because nothing happened.
Speaker 1: Were there (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not when I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any other civil rights involvements while you were in high school, you and sister [Priscilla Stephens Kruize] stood in the white only line [at Dairy Queen].  Were there any other actions that you and your sister and classmates took around the civil rights indignities and so on?
Speaker 2: No, no because we were still protected, we were known as the Hamilton children.  So, perhaps as a family we, we were able to do more things than some others might have been able to do, but no, we--I wasn't involved.  I was very involved in the community in terms of raising funds for band uniforms, or building hospital--segregated hospital wings and, and stuff like that, but nothing in terms of civil rights, nothing in terms--I knew there needed to be some changes.  I don't know if you've ever felt this way.  You see things around you and you know there should be changes, but I didn't know how to make the changes, but that came later when I was introduced to CORE [Congress of Racial Equality].
Story_ID: 482815
Speaker 1: When you finished high school [Lake Shore Junior Senior High School, Belle Glade, Florida] and you went on directly to Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right after high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What were your hopes as a young high school graduate and college (unclear), what were your hopes as you entered college?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I guess I wanted to be just like my father [Stephens Due's stepfather, Marion M. Hamilton].  I wanted to go into social studies or into music, and he was in both, and I actually chose music.  So, I mean I guess I went to Florida A&M University with a lot of experiences based on what they had taught us, and based on their own involvement, but I must be truthful.  I went there in 1957, '58 [1958] and for a couple of years in music, I was in my own world.  Music is another world.  I mean, I associated mostly with music majors.  I went to so-called gigs with music majors and then I started to realize--you know when you come from a place and you're the best, but then you go to college then you may find out, "Well, he's good," you know but I, I basically was the first, probably the first female trumpet player up there, but that didn't give me any edge, but most of all it was these gigs in these clubs that concerned me.  I didn't have the ear, everybody else--I just saw the light blinking, everybody else was able to say, "Oh, take it in G, take it in this, take it in that."  I needed music.  I needed music.
Story_ID: 482816
Speaker 1: Let's talk about an important turning point in your life while you were a college student [at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  What happened in 1959?  You made a decision to do something that summer of 1959.  What was it, the decision that you made?
Speaker 2: Well, actually my mother [Lottie Powell Stephens Hamilton] made the decision that we would go and stay with our biological father [Horace Stephens, Sr.] for a couple of weeks, and he lived in Miami [Florida].  So, we were a little excited about it because he worked at night and again, we would slip out and go to the beach and dance and just having a good time.  Then a friend, my mother's friend approached us about a conference that going on, said a CORE conference, Congress of Racial Equality and he wanted us to go with him, and we called him Baby Combs [Clifford "Baby" Combs].  Well, we couldn't imagine wasting our time going to a conference.  Then he said "Oh, if you go I'll, I'll take you out to dinner, to Wolfie's [Wolfie's Restaurant, Miami Beach, Florida]," which was the only restaurant at that point that would serve both Negroes and whites, and by the way they went out of business about a year and a half ago.  So, he talked us into it and we went and we listened and for me it was, "This is it.  Now I can figure out what to do to make some changes."  CORE was the Congress of Racial Equality, an interracial nonviolent, direct action group.  Initially, even after being told this, it didn't mean anything but to hear the people talk.  It was Gordon Carey, Jim McCain [James T. McCain]--now, in '59 [1959], Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] wasn't there, but he was there a year later.  He, he was on the board in any case and he was a participant.  In 1960, Marvin Rich, James Robinson [James R. Robinson]--that too few people know about.  He was a white who was really over CORE and Marvin Rich actually ran the whole place.
Story_ID: 482817
Speaker 1: --Experience, where, what city, what?
Speaker 2: The Sir John Hotel in Miami, Florida.
Speaker 1: It was in Miami?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  You're rolling.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Sir John, it was--it wasn't black owned to my knowledge, but it was a hotel where blacks could go, and I still have little pictures of them telling you what they offer, course I never did get a chance to do anything because I was so wrapped up in the sessions.
Speaker 1: How long did these sessions last and what did you do in the sessions?
Speaker 2: A couple of days, I listened mostly, but before we actually got there, mother [Lottie Powell Stephens Hamilton] had to be convinced that we could go somewhere where all these white people were--let's see I was eighteen or nineteen and then you had to be twenty-one to be considered an adult.  So, Baby Combs [Clifford "Baby" Combs] talked to her and Shirley Zoloth, a member of Miami CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] and some other people talked to them and told them what they were about and asked them to let us participate and reluctantly she--they did.
Speaker 1: Well, what did you learn there?  What did you do?  What was the content of the sessions?  What--?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all we learned that we don't assume that you can't be served.  You go and you try to be served and you have white observers who could stay after you leave and then they'd tell us what was said.  We would do role playing, initially, and then we actually went out to different lunch counters--at that point I was not served.  Let's see this was '59 [1959], okay, yeah, there was Royal Castle.  I was served and I sound--I was sounding just like this, my--well, my voice was lighter.  My voice actually changed when I was pregnant with Tananarive [Tananarive Due], but I didn't sound Hispanic or anything.  The observer said once I left the customers wondered, "Well, why do you serve that nigger?"  He said, "Well, she was, she was Hispanic."  Well what made her think that?  I mean I was wearing my hair long.  I had on these hoop, real but listen to me oh, no I didn't sound anything other than this.  So, we, we've assumed that she just didn't wanna cause any more problems, but there was a big uproar after we left because she served me, but that was just one of those accidents.  I didn't get served any more, except with jail time.
Speaker 1: And who were the people leading the, these CORE sessions again, their names?  Was Jim Lawson [James Lawson] involved in this?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was there.  Well I was gonna ask John [Stephens Due's husband, John Due] about--Dr. Foster [T.W. Foster] was there, wasn't he John?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: In '59 [1959] and the staff.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Jim McCain [James T. McCain].
Speaker 2: Jim McCain; Jim must be almost ninety-six now, Gordon Carey, Marvin Rich and some of the other board members.  See, I didn't really know who anybody was.
Story_ID: 482818
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was your husband, John Due, at Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] at that time or not (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I had not even met my husband.
Speaker 1: At--not at--not at that point, okay.
Speaker 2: That came later.
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll get to that then, okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: All right so you had these sessions and you became committed and you were ready to be, be more active and get involved, so what (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, we were so excited, Priscilla [Stephens Due's sister, Priscilla Stephens Kruize] and I and we were living in Wheatley Hall, we were living in the dormitory on campus.  We were just so excited because, "This is it," we said, "This is what, this is the way we could make a difference."  So, we asked for all kind of literature and we was just so happy to get back to school.  We were just so excited and the first thing we did was go around on our dormitory and ask people to come to a meeting and then we tried to talk to some of the people in the community who had been involved in the bus boycott, Reverend C.K. Steele, Ms. Daisy Young, who was--both of 'em wore so many hats. I figured another one wouldn't hurt but Ms. Young was advisor to the college chapter of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] there at A&M.
Speaker 1: Were you and your sister the only Florida A&M students in the CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] workshops or were there other A&M students?
Speaker 2: At, at that time we were the only ones.
Speaker 1: From your school?
Speaker 2: Nobody had ever heard of CORE.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Nobody really knew what CORE was, and that was part of, we had to sell the organization.
Speaker 1: How long had they been around?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-two [1942], but Chicago, the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], they organized.  I think James Farmer might have been there and Jim Robinson [James R. Robinson] but that was 1942.  See, that was you all.  We were down here and we--I had not heard of CORE and the students, the students had not heard of CORE.
Speaker 1: Well how did the students and the community folk take to your beginning to organize people and getting people together?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well did you face any obstacles in that and?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh plenty, but.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: The first meeting we had was just with students in the dorm.  Well they couldn't go out so some of them decided to come to hear us talk about CORE, and a few of them got excited and then we went from there to the community because there had been a bus boycott in Tallahassee [Florida] in 1956 and we wanted to be able to get in touch with some of those people that were involved, even some of the white ones.  Well, we did that and Reverend Dan Speed [Daniel Speed], who owned a grocery store on Floral Street in Tallahassee allowed the NAACP to use the office next door as their office, so they in turn allowed us to be a part of that too, so that we wouldn't have to try to meet in the dorm because nobody else was allowed in.
Story_ID: 482819
Speaker 1: We started our testing as we called it--the bus stations.
Speaker 2: What'd you do there?
Speaker 1: We just went in to be served, and we were told that we couldn't be served so, basically in '59 [1959] we just left.  Later on, however, we did sue, I think it was Trailways [Trailways National Bus System; Trailways Transportation System, Inc.], for a million dollars for refusing to serve us.  Now, this was happening and in the meantime in Greensboro, North Carolina a few months later because we really organized in October. Ezell Blair [Ezell Blair, Jr.; Jibreel Khazan] and some others went to the, the lunch counter there to be served and of course were not and, and I guess it was the grapevine, because almost I guess probably by the time they got home we knew about it, course CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] was there sending out information and everything.  So, that's why we choose Woolworth [F.W. Woolworth Company] because of their sit-in, students from A&T College [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University] there in Greensboro.
Speaker 2: Did the A&T College students, did they go through the CORE sessions or some other training?  Do you recall?
Speaker 1: Well, they, they had--I think they had a combination, they, but once it started, CORE people were called in.  Everybody was called in.
Story_ID: 482820
Speaker 1: So, the Greensboro [North Carolina] sit-in then kind of spread out and mushroomed and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --motivated and provoked you to?
Speaker 2: Yes, Woolworth [F.W. Woolworth Company] became symbolic because of Greensboro.  All, all we had to do was look around, we had a Woolworth [in Tallahassee, Florida].  They would not serve us, and we didn't just go without testing.  We actually did go in and test.  Now, Greensboro started February 1, 1960, we actually didn't have our first sit-in at Woolworth until February 13, 1960 and most of us were students.  So, we tried to do it on Saturday.  We, we tried to keep going to classes.
Speaker 1: How did you feel when you walked into Woolworths the first time to sit-in?  How--do you remember how you felt at that moment?  I mean you'd done your testing, you had your sessions, but now you--this is the real thing?
Speaker 2: You're right that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did you feel?
Speaker 2: That was the real thing.  I was just waiting to be served, I--I don't remember feeling fearful, I was apprehensive.  I wanted us to be served so that we could change, you know, you know in my mind I was always thinking that whatever you do can make a change.  Course it did, but it was years later, but when we went in there were whites as observers and we sat and my sister, Priscilla [Priscilla Stephens Kruize], was the, one of the, was the spokesperson I believe for the first one, and they came in, hecklers came in.  They said how we smelled, they called us niggers, they threatened to do us bodily harm, and we stayed for a while and then we left.
Speaker 1: Was there any physical contact?  Was there any violence that first sit-in?
Speaker 2: Not, not on our part.
Speaker 1: What about them, were you?
Speaker 2: They didn't hit, they didn't hit us, they just threatened.  Somebody had a gun and--
Speaker 1: How many, how many were there of you?  How many in this first sit-in, how large was the group?
Speaker 2: Probably no more than eleven or twelve.  Now, counting the, counting the observers, it was a few more but they really never got actually involved at this point.  Okay, it didn't work.  We weren't served.  The waitress was very nervous and she would say you know, "You are served in the back."  She would point to the back.  We just said, "We just want to be served right here."  We were very polite and like I said, no service.
Story_ID: 482821
Speaker 1: So, the next Saturday, February 20th was different.  They were waiting for us, and the waitress she was almost, "Here they come again."  And, and that 13th was a surprise for Woolworth [F.W. Woolworth Company], for the community [in Tallahassee, Florida] because this was the first time this kind of action was taken there, but the next Saturday they were sort of waiting of us but afraid that we would come but wanted us to come too, because there were hecklers everywhere.  There was a young man from Chicago [Illinois] and I'd been trying to reach him, William Carpenter, who was involved with us, who really didn't want to be arrested for his own reasons you know, but he was so supportive.  Now, sitting-in were two sons, both in high school of the Reverend C.K. Steele. Henry Marion Steele--and you should really talk to him and Charles Kenzie Steele, who is now deceased.
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: They sat with us.  There was Mary Ola Gaines, she was the only person from the community there, only adult.  Everybody else was just waiting around to see what would happen to us, and a lot of the older people were afraid.  They were afraid.  There was someone from New Jersey, Clem Carney [Clement Carney] and of course there was my sister, Priscilla [Priscilla Stephens Kruize].  There was a brother, there was a brother and sister team, John [John Broxton] and Barbara Broxton, and as I said Barbara's a name--I'm really saddened because whatever happened to her the forty-nine days in jail, it was so traumatic that she won't talk about it.  She wouldn't allow us to interview her, and we were told she never discussed it with her children.  Sometimes it is painful, but at in any case we were arrested.  We were--
Speaker 2: This is the second Saturday now?
Speaker 1: The 20th.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Instead of arresting the hecklers, they arrested us.  They took us to jail, they walked us to jail, wasn't that far, and it had been a bank vault, that's where they put us.  They fingerprinted us and we asked to make a phone call.  "You can't call that nigger Steele."  They knew who we wanted to call, Reverend Steele, to see what he could do in terms of getting us out and finally we were all out on bail and then we had--I.
Speaker 2: Who provided the bail? Who provided the bail?  CORE [Congress of Racial Equality]?
Speaker 1: I don't think so, they may have provided some of it.  As the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] always accused us, "You all are always going getting arrested, and we have to bail you out."
Story_ID: 482822
Speaker 1: How did the university, the Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] administration and the school people look upon what you were doing?  Were you supported by the school or--?
Speaker 2: No, with great disdain, knowing--going to a black university [HBCU] where parents send their children to a segreg- surrogate parents in a sense.  You know we had stricter rules than white students at FSU [Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida].  We had to be in as freshman at eight o'clock.  Later on, we had to be in at nine o'clock, and, and the parents held the university responsible for our behavior.  So, they reacted.  No, they were--individually there was some.
Speaker 1: Support?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  In fact the man who gave me my first F, in music when I learned really, I just don't have the theory, music theory.  Mr. Richard Haley and eventually they got rid of him, but he and he was from Chicago [Illinois].  He gave, he became involved and, and we couldn't get a lawyer in town.  We had to go five hundred miles.  Everybody was afraid to touch it, to get a lawyer and Tobias Simon and Howard Dixon, who really were connected with the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union], but CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] had gotten in touch with them.
Speaker 1: Were they white or black, these two lawyers?
Speaker 2: They were both white.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, over a period of time we had Attorney Graves [Grattan E. Graves, Jr.] who later joined the team who, who was black and we later on, not for this arrest, but others, we had Attorney Charles Wilson from Pensacola [Florida] who represented the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] time and time again. But when Attorney Graves came up, finally, but the trial date was for set for March 1st.  At that time FAMU had three thousand students.  They decided that they were going to take the day off from class and go down to the segregated blacks, white--you know white, colored side in, in a court room that wasn't as large as, as this room--it was not a very large courtroom--to give us support.  So, when they heard about this they postponed the trial.
Story_ID: 482823
Speaker 1: In the meantime, we continued to demonstrate.  Some A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] students went to McCrory's and got arrested and I actually didn't get arrested that time.  I went back to campus.
Speaker 2: How long did you stay in the vault, in the bank vault?
Speaker 1: Well, probably just an hour or two, fingerprinting us and someone coming down to get us out, but I rushed back to the campus to tell students that more of our students had been arrested.  So, a march was organized.  About a thousand strong to--we, we hastily made signs.  It's probably what that photo with Larkins [William Larkins], "Give us back our students, we are Americans too."  We marched down, I believe it was Adams Street.  We crossed the railroad tracks which was the dividing line then, between the white and colored towns.  Now, as CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] members what we had learned when things happen, you try to negotiate.  Before going down, we tried to call the city police, the county police, the state police and the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation].  Nobody would talk to us, but when we approached those railroad tracks they were all there, and they had tear gas.  Now, they claimed they gave us time to react.  One police officer saw me and he said, "I want you," because I had been involved before, and he threw the tear gas canister right in my eyes.  I could not see and I--but I could hear and I heard the students screaming, because they were being attacked.  You know when we talk about other countries and all of this, war was declared on us.  A young man, and to this day, I don't know his name, took me by the hand.  He said, "Come with me, I've been in the [U.S.] Army.  Take this cloth, don't rub your eyes just put it over your eyes," 'cause I still could not see, and he took me to a church not too far from campus and left me there and although I was sitting there blind, I could still hear the screaming of the other students, and they were the ones arrested.  They were arrested.
Story_ID: 482824
Speaker 1: So then, the fathers downtown, as I guess they like to look at themselves decided, "Okay, we're gonna have this trial," and ironically it was on March 17, 1960, and Attorney Graves [Grattan E. Graves, Jr.] who was a black attorney came up and they called him nigger, couldn't sit by the whites, and we were all found guilty.  Originally, there were three charges against us and then there when we got to court there were eight, disturbing the peace, resisting arrest, tre- .  All kinds of things, so we were sentenced to sixty days in jail or a three hundred dollar fine.  Now, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Or, or you said or?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, we had a choice.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We had a choice.  Well, to me it was no choice.  For my sister, it was no choice, and for some of the others it was no choice because we felt if we paid the fine we would be supporting segregation, and we did not want to do that.  Initially, three got out to begin the appeals process, and Henry Steele [Henry Marion Steele] was the youngest, and a high school student stayed in for a while then he got out, and also he developed his own appeal, but five of us including my sister Priscilla [Priscilla Stephens Kruize], the brother and sister team, John [John Broxton] and Barbara Broxton from South Florida also, and William Larkins spent forty-nine days in the Leon County Jail in Tallahassee, Florida in 1960 for sitting a Woolworth [F.W. Woolworth Company] lunch counter, forty-nine days.  Well, we had been sentenced to sixty.  We got five days off for good behavior and one day to avoid publicity, and during the time we were in there, Barbara and I were made trustees, which meant they just wanted you to work, do some work and--
Speaker 2: I was gonna ask you what you did during the forty-nine days (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well first of all, they took us back to campus [of Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] to get some clothes, and then students almost rocked the car over.  First they thought they were releasing us, but when they found out that they weren't releasing us they were very upset, and we finally got back to the jail.  They wanted us to clean the office, clean the toilets.  Well, okay, but if I'm cleaning this toilet that was labeled white I'm going to use it.  Why should I have to run somewhere else to use a toilet?  That, plus the fact that when I was vacuuming the, the chief of police's office, somehow you know, and really he tripped.  Now, you know I was a CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] person.  I would not have tripped him intentionally, but I guess he thought I had so that was the end that, the day or so of being a trustee.  Barbara and I were put back in jail where we stayed, where we wrote, the five of us a song to the tune of 'Old Black Joe,' and where we received hundreds of letters, and one of our biggest supporters right away was Jackie Robinson.  Jackie Robinson sent us diaries, he actually wrote about it.  He was working for the New York Post that during--he had a column then for the New York Post so then he printed one of the letters I had sent to Jim Robinson [James R. Robinson], which told about our being in jail and people could not believe, people who were writing us.  A few were negative, but most of them were very positive, but they could not believe we were sitting in jail because we sat at a Woolworths lunch counter.  Well, we said, "Okay, we could've paid the fine, but we didn't."
Story_ID: 482825
Speaker 1: My father's [Stephens Due's stepfather, Marion M. Hamilton] brother had died around this time.  Of course, Bertram Hamilton, I guess he was another one of those people who thought he was white.  I think he was in the attorney general's office somewhere in the northeast, but I think my father, I know was reluctant.  My mother [Lottie Powell Stephens Hamilton] came up, they both and talked to us.  She said, "Are you sure you don't wanna get out?"  'Cause she was afraid, she was born twenty-one miles from where we were in jail [Leon County Jail, Tallahassee, Florida].  She had seen a person lynched, she had heard about other people being lynched right here in this county [Gadsden County, Florida].  She knew how whites treated Negroes, colored, black, whatever, so she was really afraid, and in addition to that Priscilla [Stephens Due's sister, Priscilla Stephens Kruize] was on a special diet.  So, mother was concerned that she would not be able to eat properly and of course that was the truth but we told mother we wanted to stay in jail.  I said, "This is what you've always taught us."  Course, you know it's always easy for a nineteen-year old to say that I guess, and but she had lived and my father was concerned because he worked--by now he was a principal.  The county, Palm Beach County [Florida] had been putting pressure on him, for him to get us out of jail, it was too much publicity, but he knew it was nothing he could do because we would not leave and out of all the letters that we received, even from Japan, people who Yokohama, Japan, I remember that--just couldn't believe this was happening.  But what's so ironic though, that happened in 1960 and in 2060 [sic. 2006], I still can't understand why we call ourselves the moral country when we have all these vestiges of everything that has ever happened to us as African Americans clothed in three-piece suits, no more hoods, no more white and colored signs, but as you look at the disproportionate number of blacks, males especially in the criminal justice system, if you look at the people who don't have healthcare, or who are unemployed or underemployed, and people believe they have arrived.  To what?  "Oh, we've done it."  We've left everybody back.  Look at our educational system, Brown [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] didn't help us.  It was never meant to help us. It, it--what was it, was it Truman [President Harry S. Truman] or something?  They were interested in people seeing (TAPE INTERRUPTION)--
Story_ID: 482826
Speaker 1: This interview, continuation interview with Mrs. Patricia Stephens Due [HistoryMaker Patricia Stephens Due] is being held on October 18th [2006], again at her home on Timmons Road in Quincy, Florida.  I'm glad we're able to continue.  I'm looking forward to the rest of our discussion together.
Speaker 2: Oh, I am too.
Story_ID: 482827
Speaker 1: Summer of 1959, you attended a nonviolent workshop, training workshop sponsored by the Congress of Racial Equality [CORE] and that was really a turning point as we said yesterday because you were fired up and you were ready to bring about change, and begin to strategize and organize people, and you decided to have a sit-in in Tallahassee [Florida] and I wanted to ask you how did you mentally prepare for the sit-in?  What went through your mind as you got to that day?  How did you prepare yourself for it and did you expect to be arrested?
Speaker 2: Well, by the time we participated--and when I say we, members of Tallahassee CORE--my sister [Priscilla Stephens Kruize] and I had already begun to organize a chapter there and we have gone through the role playing.  We had taught people that CORE was nonviolent, direct action, and most of all we did role playing, where you would actually get into position and there would hecklers and, and people trying to hurt you and we would tell them, "Now it is our responsibility to stay nonviolent.  We don't know what the others will do, but we need to stay nonviolent," and of course all people weren't able to do this.  And as far as jail was concerned, we realized that anything could happen and I certainly my sister and I realized that.  I must admit there were many students who wanted to participate and who did participate who were really surprised when they were arrested, and I believe even more surprised when they were fingerprinted and then told eventually after the trial.
Speaker 1: But had you expected that?  Had you expected--were you prepared to be arrested?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew I could be arrested.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Now, in terms of really expecting it, I think then I expected the police to follow the law.  I expected the hecklers to be arrested, the ones who were actually doing--breaking the law, but in their eyesight, of course, we were breaking the law too, because it was against the law at that time for blacks and whites to sit together at a lunch counter, at a restaurant--anywhere, in schools, so we were the ones arrested, but I was prepared for it, and of course it was the first time I had been fingerprinted and I was surprised to see that, the jail [Leon County Jail, Tallahassee, Florida].
Story_ID: 482828
Speaker 1: How did you endure the days that you spent in jail or what did you do, what were you thinking?  What--how did you feel as you flash back on that?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, we could do a lot of thinking in jail, a segregated jail by race and by gender.  We were put in--it's (unclear) where you had a number of cells.  Our cell, four of us did not have running water, we didn't have blankets, but what we did have was the determination to survive the situation we were in.  Now, that doesn't mean it was easy.  For instance, I had to have a doctor at one point and it was really Dr. Charles Stevens, with a S-T-E-V-E-N-S and he was really, really afraid for fear I guess that they would think he was involved with us--course, he was my doctor.  My sister Priscilla [Priscilla Stephens Kruize] was on a special diet.  Well, that was unheard of in the Leon County Jail [Tallahassee, Florida], you just eat fatback and those grits over there where you have there, but what kept us going was the fact that we had visitors.  The community rallied around us, we had ministers who visited us every day, and we were able to smuggle letters out of jail, and, and beyond that the people all over the country were writing us, telling us that they supported us and I spent a lot of time, a lot of hours answering those letters.
Speaker 1: So they did allow you to have pencil and papers then?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Did administrators and faculty from Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] come to visit you?
Speaker 2: As a group?  No.
Speaker 1: Well, individually or even in pairs?
Speaker 2: And some individually.
Speaker 1: But not?
Speaker 2: But not as a group.
Speaker 1: But some did come?
Speaker 2: Some did come.  There was Ms. Stewart [Anita P. Stewart] who was in PE [physical education] and I didn't even know she really knew that I existed in her classroom (laughter), but I have a sweet letter from her that I still have today, saying how she and other supported us and asking us to stay the course and, and of course, there was Mr. Richard Haley and--who was one of my music instructors.  There was Ms. Daisy Young who was with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], SC--with all kind of organizations, but for the most part and in the beginning the first couple of weeks when we went into jail, blacks and whites did visit us, but after a couple of weeks, the whites were forbidden to come to see us, and that's when some of the whites, I think began to realize that they too were not free.  They were not free to choose their friends.  They were told, "You can't see them," and that was that.  But to answer that question, I spent most of my time writing.  In fact, James Peck wrote a book on 'Freedom Ride' and the letter I wrote from jail is included in his book.
Story_ID: 482829
Speaker 1: When you were released at the end of the forty-nine days [in the Leon County Jail, Tallahassee, Florida], did you go back to classes and back to the campus, or did you lose the whole semester.  What--how did it affect your academic situation at the?
Speaker 2: Well, when we were released, we were told that we were suspended.  Now, initially when we actually went to jail in, in the beginning, we were told that the instructors would bring our classwork, we would be able to do our classwork and we could keep up with what was going on in school.  Now, this did not happen, but I believe I know what did happen.  Pressure was put on Dr. Gore, George Gore [George W. Gore, Jr.] who was president of Florida A&M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] at that time and he in turn put pressure on our instructors.  We then had a board of control, and they were in control, an all-white board of control in charge of the Florida universities.  So, we had received so many letters people wanted us to come to them to tell them about our experience in jail so, and including Jackie Robinson who had been so supportive in terms of sending all of us diaries, in terms of helping to raise money for Tallahassee [Florida] CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] so they could continue to be involved in the community and we asked CORE to be in charge of this speaking tour.  Now, people were calling us Communists and this--and I didn't know what a Communist was, you know, unless it was somebody who wanted freedom and so we, we decided we would let CORE coordinate the speaking tour.  So, once we got out of jail, we went to Belle Glade [Florida], my sister [Priscilla Stephens Kruize] and I did for a day or two, then we were off to New York and we spent the summer of 1960 in New York talking about the racism and discrimination in the South.
Speaker 1: Summer of '60 [1960] or '61 [1961]?
Speaker 2: Sixty [1960].
Speaker 1: Sixty [1960] okay, all right, that's right, the jailing was in '59 [1959]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were, we really were the first jail-in in the nation during the student sit-in movement.  Now, later in 1961 other people were going to jail, and maybe even the latter part of 1960, but we got out of jail in May and went on our speaking tour.  And, and it's kind of ironic because not a lot of people seemed to know about it, but there were a lot of people involved.  [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte during the time hosted a reception at his house and there you had James Baldwin, A. Philip Randolph--you had all of these people who were so involved in making changes.  Now, it's ironic the place where Harry Belafonte had us at that time, had once declined to let him rent an apartment there and I read many years later that he bought the place.
Speaker 1: Where was this in New York?
Speaker 2: In New York, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, did you lose a whole year of school at this point?
Speaker 2: We, we lost a semester.
Speaker 1: A semester?
Speaker 2: We were suspended, we were told that they would let us know when we could return to school.
Speaker 1: So when did you return then?
Speaker 2: I actually returned in '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961]--no, actually '60 [1960], '61 [1961] school term I had gone back very briefly and it really wasn't because of A&M, it was actually because of my health.  During that speaking tour we, we were in three and four states a day.  We were all over the place.  Chicago [Illinois], I think it was Chicago where they had the publishers convention and, and we had a lot of people there.  Mr. Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] from Ebony magazine, and all of that.  Actually, I think he was the one who interviewed me, but then I went back in the fall and by the beginning of '61 [1961] I had a bald spot in my head, I--just really huge and it had started to develop when I was on the speaking tour and I had gone to a dermatologist.  It was about the size of a half dollar if anyone remembers a half dollar now.  And the dermatologist said she thought it was from stress, but no, I'm not--to me, stress means shaking and being nervous, and I didn't remember that, but then later I thought back to the luncheon Eleanor Roosevelt had given for us to tell our story and during the--I spoke.  We did role playing and, and right after that I had to rush to the bathroom and I thought that was odd but I think that was how my stress manifested itself.
Story_ID: 482830
Speaker 1: So you went back to Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And did you continue your studies uninterrupted at that point or--?
Speaker 2: No, no not inter- uninterrupted and I had made a big change, I had changed from music to sociology.  My life changed after being in jail [Leon County Jail, Tallahassee, Florida].  Music was--meant everything to me until I discovered there was so much more that I needed to do.  No, we continued to demonstrate and then I decided because of my health that I would leave, and I went to Fort Myers [Florida] where my mother [Lottie Powell Stephens Hamilton] was then living and my sister [Priscilla Stephens Kruize] was still in school and she was trying to keep CORE [Congress of Racial Eqaulity] going, and then she called me and she said, "Oh, Pat [HistoryMaker Patricia Stephens Due], you have to come back.  We, we don't have enough people to be involved, and we need to go and we need to go to Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.].  We need to go to Neisner's [Neisner Brothers, Inc.], we need to do something."
Speaker 1: So what was your next big major protest?
Speaker 2: It was right after my call from my sister.
Speaker 1: And what was that, what did you call?
Speaker 2: I don't know how--what in the way we called it my big one, but I went back and even my sister didn't go to participate.  Well, I said, "What is this?  You get me back here--."  And it's about 350 miles from where I was.  We went to a shopping center where you had Sears and some of us went in there and they turned the heat on us so high, we could hardly breathe in that place when we sat to try to be served.  When they finally let us out, they locked us in.  When they finally let us out, a few of us went to Neisner's.  Now Ben Cowins was one of the main ones that stayed the course with me, and, and Ben Cowins sat, we both sat and all of a sudden, one of the hecklers pulled him off the stool and, and he fell on the floor and, and I turned around to look--but he was charged, I was charged. I was charged with fighting, although I was only looking and they said I was in a position to have thrown a glass.  We appealed, they dismissed the case against me, but Ben stayed in jail for thirty days.
Speaker 1: So, you weren't arrested this time or fined.
Speaker 2: I was arrested.
Speaker 1: This time too?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were you in jail?  You were in jail though?
Speaker 2: Yes, we went to jail, we went through that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Again, again?
Speaker 2: Then when we got out on bail then the trial and, and but my case, my arrest was thrown out by the courts.
Story_ID: 482831
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-three [1963], you protested and marched at a theater.  Wasn't that, was that another major protest?
Speaker 2: We actually started in January.  January 5th and this was important--an important date to me I guess, I can't forget.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Right.
Speaker 2: And John [John Due] and I got married, January 5th.
Speaker 1: I was just getting ready to come to that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen sixty-three [1963], and two weeks later I was arrested for demonstrating at the Florida Theatre [Tallahassee, Florida].
Speaker 1: Tell me about that protest.
Speaker 2: Well, we started in January because they too segregated, there wasn't even any upstairs.  You just didn't go to the white theater, so after we were arrested and there were several demonstrations there were hundreds of students there.  Then they decided to get an injunction against us and named the number and say what number of students could participate in, in the demonstrations, and we went back and many were arrested, hundreds were arrested because they said we violated the injunction.  There were so many they had to take them to the fairgrounds.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this was two weeks after you were married, is that what you're saying roughly?
Speaker 2: It started with the first arrest two weeks and then this happened up through May.
Speaker 1: Give me the name of the person that you married?  Full name, who did you marry
Speaker 2: John Dorsey Due, Jr., from Terre Haute, Indiana.
Speaker 1: And what was he doing at that time when you married or even before?
Speaker 2: At that he was in law school, actually in his last year in law school at Florida A&M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University College of Law, Tallahassee, Florida].  We did have a law school there.
Speaker 1: Right, right, it's in Orlando [Florida] now I guess, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's in Orlando now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Cough) Tell me about your early weeks and months of marriage.  At the same time, you were still fully involved in the movement, still protesting, how did you and your new husband work all of that out?
Speaker 2: Well, we were both very busy.  He was busy with his last quarter in, in law school.
Speaker 1: (Cough) Excuse me.
Speaker 2: I continued to demonstrate and my husband had gone out of town to his home to visit his mother, and when he got back I had his gift for him, a German Shepherd named Scout.  And Scout became very popular in the movement, but Scout was really a vicious--and I was able to handle him after walking about five miles with him on a leash to control him.  So, when John came home, Scout tried to bite him and Scout was also on the line.  It was after Birmingham [Alabama] and all the dogs--this is all during the period of time when we hadn't been married that long, and we had Scout on the line because he had been wormed and you know if a dog is wormed, they don't need to be left in the house unattended.  So, we had him on the line, all the reporters were trying and photographers were trying to get his picture to say Birmingham in reverse.  Here we are being violent bringing a dog on the line, and there was a young man who noticed what was going on.  His name was Arthur Teele.  Arthur Teele, Jr., he drove his car around quickly and put Scout in the car.  Now, I mention Arthur because Arthur was very involved later with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  He really became a Republican and worked I believe for the Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] administration and then left Tallahassee [Florida] where he had located, his family had located him, them when he was a young person and then eventually went down to Miami to Miami-Dade County [Florida], very involved in politics there and unfortunately, I guess many people who will hear this know how dangerous it is when blacks get involved in politics.  You have to dot all of your I's and cross all of your Ts and I guess it was about a year ago from pressure through the press and a lot of other things, Arthur Teele committed suicide, and I don't think people realize even today, what a great loss that was.  It, it seemed to some people that he wasn't always on our side, but he used his talent to try to teach others what they need to do to make changes.  So, I really miss Arthur.
Story_ID: 482832
Speaker 1: How did your husband, John [John Due] get involved with you at that point in terms of your activism?  He was finishing law school [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University College of Law, Tallahassee, Florida].  Had he been involved in some of these struggles or did he then join you?  I wanna know how you two came together and started working together (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, John had actually been involved before he came to Florida, but at, when he started law school in 1960 everybody warned him against getting involved, and his goal was to get his law degree so he could do his fighting in the courts, but there were times, for instance if he had to pick me up, or he was with Scout and at the theater.  Now this was one time when he was at the theater.  He hadn't planned a demonstration, but he was served papers and of course every time they served a paper, if you were a member, if you were attending a university, they notified the university and, and the Florida bar threatened not to let him become a member of the bar because of his association with me and then later because of his own involvement.  So, it was difficult, but you have choices to make you know.  How bad is it?  Can you continue to live under these circumstances?  Because when people ask me, "Why did you go to jail?  Why weren't you afraid?"  My answer was, "I'm not treated as a first-class citizen, so in every sense of having any kind of quality of life, I'm already dead."  And that's how I felt on the demonstration.  What could they do to me?  They're gonna shoot me?  They're gonna hit me with a bat?  I'm already dead.  I want my freedom and I'm willing to give my all to get it.
Story_ID: 482833
Speaker 1: Many of the black students at the other historically black colleges [HBCUs] had increasingly become critical of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and its legal approaches in using the courts over the years.  I think some of them weren't sure about CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] and so we had the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee known as SNCC, okay?  What was your reaction to SNCC?  Were you involved with the SNCC people?  Did you consider being a part of SNCC?  Where were you in the--'cause I know you were a CORE person?
Speaker 2: Well, well I don't think I was--I wasn't a CORE person.  I first found out how I could really make a difference through CORE.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But when SNCC had their organizing committee meeting I didn't go, but Priscilla [Stephens Due's sister, Priscilla Stephens Kruize] went.  I had certain responsibilities that I needed to do in Tallahassee [Florida].  I visited often, the SNCC headquarters in Atlanta [Georgia], that's where I first met [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond and Diane Nash and, and I, I was happy that there were other organizations.  It's not that we were on it to push aside the adults, but I felt that we needed them in addition too.  Now, as far as CORE and the NAACP, yes, there was competition.  I even had members from SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] tell me that CORE was using me, that you need to come with us.
Speaker 1: Well, that's what I'm trying to get to, see (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know, I know.
Speaker 1: I don't know whether you got caught up in that, did you?
Speaker 2: Well, it--I, I got caught up in it, not in the sense that I did what they wanted.  My answer was that, "You will be using me too, and as long as I know I'm being used and how and why, it's okay."  But--and the NAACP, even in Tallahassee, where we were getting arrested by the hundreds complained, and, and I can see it.  The parents didn't know about CORE.  So, they put pressure on the NAACP to get their children out of jail.  They were at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and, and they entrusted them to FAMU, but they knew about the NAACP.  So, the NAACP's attitude was at times was that we're getting the students in jail, expecting them to get them out.  Maybe, we didn't expect but the parents pressured them to do it.  So, CORE did what they could, the NAACP did what they could and the community helped in ways that they could.  And the NAACP had an attorney in the state in north Florida, Escambia County, Pensacola, attorney Charles Wilson.  He would represent some of the students and the CORE lawyers would represent us.  Yes, there was a very heated competition.  I was a youth counselor advisor at one point and I guess I wasn't good at following rules, but Roy Wilkins didn't seem to mind my being the youth counselor advisor until there was a big demonstration, and I said I was there on behalf of CORE.  So, Roy Wilkins wanted to know why didn't I say I was there with the NAACP, since I represented the Youth Council there?  And I said, "Well you have rules that you have to get permission before you go into all of these demonstrations, and I had not been able to get that permission."  So, it was a lot of wrangling back and forth, but my whole idea was that we need all of us.  The NAACP had its own philosophy, and CORE had a different kind and SNCC had a different one, and SCLC.  But we all needed to do what we were--what we could do to change things.  I think our ultimate goal was the same: freedom, dignity, for all of us.

Speaker 1: You became one of the first African American female CORE [Congress of Racial Equality]--secretaries for CORE?  Field secretary, is that correct?
Speaker 2: One of the first.
Speaker 1: When was that?  What time, when did you assume that position?  Were you still at the, the university [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] or had you graduated?
Speaker 2: Well, I had been suspended again.
Speaker 1: Oh, well tell me about that first then (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, and you know I was I and out, I was arrested any number of times in 1962 and before that I was just, I was a volunteer and then I became a CORE field secretary to begin work in voter, voter education, and voter registration.  Mostly, initially Leon County [Florida] and Gadsden County [Florida] and that's when that started, officially.
Speaker 1: But this was still during your so-called college years so wasn't that--was it?
Speaker 2: Oh, please it took me eight years to graduate.
Speaker 1: All right so this was all basic--I see, okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, oh of course I was--I remember when I came to Gadsden County in the fall of 1962, and I have many relatives here and I was born here, but everyone was afraid of me, because I had spent those forty-nine days in jail.  Relatives would not allow me to stay with them.  There was one lady, Ms. Dorothy Chandler Jones who had been my first-grade teacher and my piano teacher, who said, "You can stay in my home," and, and everybody was nervous telling her, "Oh, you can't do that."  And she brings this white girl with her and all--, "How are you gonna?"  She said, "This is my house, and they can stay here because I said they could."  She got all kinds of threats on losing her job.  She was a teacher.  She had a cross burned in front of her home and she had a young daughter who really, I think suffered the most from what was going on.
Story_ID: 482835
Speaker 1: As the field secretary with CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] concentrating on, on voting rights and voting registration, did you make any breakthroughs in the voting issues at all, was that--?
Speaker 2: Well, well we certainly did.  We made quite a few breakthroughs.  Gadsden County [Florida] at that time was predominately black, but only a couple of hundred blacks were registered to vote.  They were afraid, they had heard what had happened to people who lived here in the county.  They felt intimidated.  One thing that registration office was in the Gadsden County Times office [Quincy, Florida] where the supervisor of election owned the paper, and allowed you to come in to vote if he wanted to.  So, there were a lot of problems here.  There were a lot of people who lived on plantations, tobacco plantations and even before we came in remembering the history, like our mother [Lottie Powell Stephens Hamilton] had recalled seeing someone lynched.  There were a lot of those memories going around, and people are afraid to get out and, and even register, let alone vote, but when Judy Benninger and I came to Gadsden County, that was one of the things that we were well aware of.  Now, Judy was a white student from the University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida] who had participated in the theater demonstrations so she had been thrown out.  She had lost her scholarship at the University of Florida so she joined me as my assistant, when we came to try to see what we could do to change the landscaping in terms of voter registration.  When we finally came over--we also had a project over in Tallahassee [Florida] and initially we came to Gadsden.  I sat down with Mrs. Dorothy Jones, and I told her what we wanted to do and then she said, "You know the person you need you need to talk with is Reverend Jameson [ph.]."
Speaker 1: Who is Dorothy Jones?
Speaker 2: Mr. Dorothy Chandler Jones was a woman who allowed us to stay in her house in spite of all the threats.  In fact, Mrs. Jones died a few months ago.  She was a real foot soldier, she'd do whatever was necessary, and as she always said, "This is my home, this is my land, and this is my community, and this is my country," but Mrs. Jones said, "You want to go into some of these counties.  I know the man."  We didn't have the contacts, Reverend Jameson.  So, Reverend Jameson sat with us one Sunday in her home in St. Hebron [Florida], where I was born.  The area is called St. Hebron in Gadsden County.  He gave us contacts, and about thirteen or fourteen counties in north Florida, and that is how we really started our voter registration drive, and eventually we ended up in ten.
Story_ID: 482836
Speaker 1: We did go to Escambia County in Pensacola [Florida], but there was a lot of in-fighting with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and some others, so we decided to drop that county and concentrated on others, including Jackson [Jackson County, Florida] where Marianna is, and Madison [Madison County, Florida].  Madison was predominately black.  Jefferson County [Florida] which was predominately black, now Suwannee County [Florida] where you have the infamous trial and Ruby McCollum, where allegedly she killed a white doctor who was her lover and was sent to Chattahoochee [Florida] and then the whole story was killed.  They locked her away.  Now, ironically one of her daughters participated with us in the demonstrations.  I was really, really shocked, but this is how we started the voter registration.  We had guns shot at us.  I had what was called a freedom house here in Quincy [Florida].  Eventually, we were given a place for our voter registration project and Mr. Witt Campbell who had been a principal was the one, the Good Shepherds, was the name of the organization and he proposed that they let us use the house behind their building for our headquarters, and we did this and Ms. Vivian Kelly, who was another foot soldier who died a couple of years ago, and the first black Democratic chairwoman in Gadsden County [Florida], but when we went there we were shot at, and we had a close neighbor who happened to be a relative, and he said he wasn't nonviolent.  But when we were shot at, time and time again we called the city, the county, the state and the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation].  No one would come to our aid, and they had to know because every time I went anywhere in Gadsden County, a police officer followed me.  If I stayed ten, two hours, three hours, he stayed two or three hours.  Everywhere I went I was followed by a policeman and, and twofold.  First of all, he wanted the people I was talking to, to know that he knew that they knew, that they were talking to CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], and secondly, he wanted to intimidate me, and a lot of people were nervous.  It, it took, a lot to get people to just decide that, "I am going to register.  I am going to vote," and to do it.  When we would have workers go in some of the plantations, they would try to hurt them.  They would put dogs on them--Mrs. Kelly, and, and Stu Wechsler [Stuart Wechsler] who was one our workers from the North.  We had an integrated, interracial staff who came down.  We had lawyers who came down and there was violence all the time, all the time but we tried to warn them.  Every staff person going to their particular areas had to call us within thirty minutes of their scheduled time to get there, because we knew something could happen.  The cars we rented were turned over, were burned.  It got so the rental cars didn't want to rent cars to us because they were always destroyed, and we knew if we had people who were an hour late that we had cause to worry.  So, it was a time when our communities, our state and our country have really declared war on us, and it was like a war, except it was a war where only the officials, the government and, and the criminals were using weapons against us and we were labeled as the troublemakers.  This is what Gadsden County, right where I'm sitting today, was a plantation.  This is where Leon County, Suwannee County, Alachua [Alachua County, Florida], which was Gainesville, Madison County, Jefferson County, all of these counties where there were people who just wanted to register and to vote.  I mean they were not asking for money, you know they weren't asking for those forty acres and a mule, which we should get and translate it to what it would be now.  They just wanted to go and register to vote without fear of losing their lives or their jobs (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Story_ID: 482837
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you make progress in this area?  Do you feel that over time you made progress or not?
Speaker 2: We did, in fact it was written up quite a few times that we had more people to register in this area than they had anywhere else in the South, but of course we couldn't be satisfied with that.
Speaker 1: Now were there legal steps that were taken to help that process or not?  How--was your husband John [John Due] involved legally in any of this, or who were the lawyers that helped 'cause if you had to change the legal structure too (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well, we, well--
Speaker 1: Get rid of the, the--
Speaker 2: Well, John had so many roles to play.
Speaker 1: But during the '60s [1960s] now the period you're talking about (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I'm talking about after '63 [1963] because he became a member of the Florida bar in 1963, so until then, he could not officially do anything, but actually John was the legal counsel for CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] in the state.  Of course, you would think this just meant going to court, but sometimes he had to just get out there and rescue some of the people, which became sort of a physical thing, but I think the most important things he did that was so helpful to us was transferring cases from the state to the federal courts.  You know that--their--just removing them.  Nobody was really prepared for there, because the courts were going to break the organizations, the civil rights organizations by dragging things on and on and we had so many people arrested.  So, petition or removal, I believe is what it was called, and, and that was, that was no small thing, and, and John also worked in Mississippi.  He, he worked in other areas, so he really got to see what was going on in other states and Florida was very close to what was going on in those other states.  I--we don't understand why people virtually left Florida out of the Civil Rights Movement, because Florida surely was related to Alabama and Georgia in terms of the way it treated people.  So if you look at the records, we registered a lot of voters.  In 1963, '64 [1964], you know preparing for the 1964 presidential election that there was a lot money put into these areas.  CORE, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], everybody was working to try to get more people registered, and then to get them to actually vote.  You know Barry Goldwater was running.
Speaker 1: And John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] really hadn't moved on any kind of voting rights legislation.  It was Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] who, who ultimately signed that legislation.
Speaker 2: Well, it was 1965 so yeah, '64 [1964], the Public Accommodations Act [Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title II], in 1965, the Voting Rights Act [Voting Rights Act of 1965].  Initially, they didn't do much good, but they were there.  At least it was a law.
Story_ID: 482838
Speaker 1: Making another turn at this point, looking at another dimension of your life, a very important dimension, when did you and your husband start your family?  Let's talk about your children?  When did you start your family amidst all this?  Your first child?
Speaker 2: Well, it was 1966 actually I had, had an ectopic pregnancy and we lost the first child and, but so actually Tananarive [Tananarive Due] was the second child, and during this time John [John Due] was running (laughter) now I think about it, running for the second senator from the 2nd Congressional District in north Florida, and that was twenty-four counties.  I don't know if anybody can imagine twenty-four mostly rural counties that you had to really go out and try to tell people about you, and during that time whenever we went to a so-called Democratic function, everybody would move when he would go to take his place as a Democrat. These fellow Democrats would just move away because they didn't want to sit by him or anything, but we ran a race.  I think we ran a good race and of all things we rented a convertible.  We went out shaking hands and you know with the people, with the children and, and everything and that was a lot for me to do because actually I was allergic to the sun, and everything.  So, in that sense it was one of the worst things that happened, but it was good that people realized that they could go beyond the registration and the voting.  They could run, and I believe he won in Leon County [Florida], and probably Gadsden County [Florida], and it surprised everybody, but these are some of the things.  Tananarive was six months old, and from there, John got involved with the union and he was sent around to organize unions, in, in the northern part of Florida, and he--and, and also to, to Tampa [Florida] he did a lot of work.  Eventually, they based him in Tampa and, and as we moved and had our second child, Johnita [Johnita Due], by the time she was eight or nine months old, John was living in Tampa, and we were in St. Petersburg [Florida].  Now, the people, there were people who didn't trust the union, and they asked me to side, to come and help them and then John was with the union, so we were living in different places, but of course meeting, but at four o'clock in the morning I would be headed for where the sanitation workers left to go pick up the trash for and they would try to run over us.  Now, the people I admire the most during this time were the people who came to my hotel room in St. Petersburg and babysat.  At this time, we had two children.  I never knew if I was coming back alive and I guess it was a little funny with us on different sides, but, but it worked out.
Story_ID: 482839
Speaker 1: This was after Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated in Memphis [Tennessee] and the thing he had been working on was equality for the sanitation workers.
Speaker 2: Well, the union that John [Due's husband, John Due] was working for and defending, what union was that?  What was the union?
Speaker 1: Let me see, now he had worked for several, the ones who dealt with state and municipal workers were the ones that he actually worked with, and at the same time he still had his office initially, and the problem that arose, the problem that came out of that was Tallahassee [Florida] and its memory.  There was a conspiracy to get rid of John because of some of the things he had done in the movement, American Federation, State of Municipal Workers [sic. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees].  He still had open cases, and I remember once we were going to travel to St. Pete [St. Petersburg, Florida] to take care of some of those problems.  We went by the police department because he wanted to be certain that he didn't have any cases coming up soon.  Oh, I think Sergeant Mage [ph.], the clerk, "Oh no you don't have anything coming up."  We left our address and that we were told that they would let him know.  The next day he had a case to come up with--it had to do with the Ford family and, and this was a black family, and I say it was a conspiracy because other townspeople got involved where they filed a complaint against him, in spite of knowing that he had checked and was told that nothing was coming up.  And this complaint and really I guess conviction, and the complaint not only in the courts but to the Florida bar, let to his suspension from the Florida bar, and we were actually that later a resident, this particular person involved, later became mayor of Tallahassee, but this is where a lot of the people got involved, but it was difficult.
Story_ID: 482840
Speaker 1: We had by this time three children.  In 1968, in the fall we moved to Miami-Dade County [Florida] because Tananarive [Tananarive Due] was almost three and we thought she needed a school to go to, and they had no school for children her age other than one that was opened up for whites.  Of course, some of the people said in Gadsden County [Florida], "Oh, just send her there and see what happens."  Well, things change when you're a parent.  I didn't want to send my daughter to someplace that may turn out to be very hostile.  My mother [Lottie Powell Stephens Hamilton] was then in Miami so we moved to Miami, but by the time Lydia [Lydia Due Greisz] was born, this is when he [Stephens Due's husband, John Due] was actually suspended, it took all this time suspended from the Florida bar, unable to continue his work with Legal Services of Miami [Legal Services of Greater Miami, Inc., Miami, Florida], so a lot had happened and one of the mistakes we made, I made was thinking that education was better in Miami-Dade County, at that age.  My mother was working so we had to take the children with us.  Tananarive then, and Johnita [Johnita Due] as we went to get a school and Tananarive, all Tananarive heard was, "White children only. No, no, no white only."  So, here she was three years old saying, "White only."  Well in her mind as a child, her grandmother was white because she looked at the complexion, that's all she saw, she didn't see races.  She even thought I probably was white, as dark as I am.  So, she went home and she got in her bed and she took some Johnson's [Johnson and Johnson Products; Johnson and Johnson Services, Inc.] baby powder and put it all over her hair, oh boy--everywhere, she said, "Mommy, I'm white now."
Story_ID: 482841
Speaker 1: Hold this up now 'Freedom in the Family: A Mother-Daughter Memoir of the Fight for Civil Rights' [Tananarive Due and Patricia Stephens Due] authored by you and your daughter Tananarive [Tananarive Due].  Tell us why you did this book?  What's in the book?  What does this mean to you?  Why did you do this book?
Speaker 2: Well, this meant documenting what had happened to all of us, because as I sat on a textbook committee and it really gets to be very painful, especially about the part when Tananarive said, "Will I be able to go to school now?"  Over the years we've told them who we were, but that was not enough.  Each of my daughters, Tananarive, Johnita [Johnita Due] and Lydia [Lydia Due Greisz] wrote about our activities, but I knew that was not enough and when I sat on this textbook committee telling them a lot of what I'm telling you now, they said it never happened.  "We don't know anything about any jail for forty-nine days.  We don't know anything about violence, trying to get people to register and to vote in Florida."  I said, "I'm telling you, I was there."  They said, "It has to be written."  So, from then on and even before then I had been trying to get records from people, going out interviewing them, because our history must not be erased and when Ms. Kelly [Vivian Kelly] died, Mr. Campbell [Witt Campbell], Mrs. Jones [Dorothy Chandler Jones], a lot of that history has been erased.  I could not get everything I needed from them, but I decided that it has to be put in a book.  It has to be written.  So, for years and as most people know, when you have a family they become first.  So when I could, I would travel over the state interviewing people, learning by trial and error.  Sometimes not getting it right, not getting the tape right, having to do it over and over again and graduating to a video camera, and not knowing how to use it exactly, but I was getting their stories, and I could not do it fast enough.  People were dying--you know I was then probably in my forties or fifties and those people were in their seventies, some in their eighties.  We were losing them, and I had a vision calling the book 'Ordinary People Doing Extraordinary Things,' and I--we went through a couple of titles, I did and I was determined that it would only be about those foot soldiers that people didn't know about.  About the things that they did that made a difference, the unsung ones.  I knew Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] would be well documented.  I knew Roy Wilkins would be well documented, and I knew a lot of other people whose names are recognized nationally, would get the attention, but I thought it was important for us to know, first of all our history.  Secondly, that ordinary people that you've never heard of did so much and sometimes gave their lives; Calvin Bess [George Calvin Bess], to make a difference, Rubin Keenan [ph.] to make a difference--Ms. Daisy Young.
Story_ID: 482842
Speaker 1: So, Tananarive [Tananarive Due], out of the three of my girls was the one who was the writer.  Although, they both--they all three write quite well, she majored in journalism.  From tenth grade, she worked at the Miami Herald.  Had a first, a story on page one at sixteen years of age, and I wanted her to be in a position to join me, but for years she was afraid.  She didn't know that she could handle it.  As it is with me, it was stressful, and as a young person, although we had told them time and time again what the conditions were, it was hard for her to understand that it really happened, that our government really declared war on us.  So, finally after she sold her first book and I had become her manager, she decided to take some time off for us to start working together.
Speaker 2: What year was that, approximately?
Speaker 1: About 1995, the between and with her--some of her advance she got an advance, she sold her first book to HarperCollins [HarperCollins Publishers LLC] and she used that money to live on, and we traveled up and down the state trying to--racing against time, time not only to the physical death, but maybe the mental death of some of the people who had been involved and they were so happy and people over the years would say, "Oh, Patricia [HistoryMaker Patricia Stephens Due] when, when is that book coming out?"  'Cause it took a long time.  "When is your book coming out?  When is our book coming out?"  And I kept saying, "I hope it'll be soon."  But I knew for some it would be too late, including my own mother [Lottie Powell Stephens Hamilton] who died in 2000, but that was what happened, and everybody made a contribution, all of the girls.  Lydia [Lydia Due Greisz] set me up with a, a TV and a VCR so we, I could look at our interviews so I wouldn't have to go home and say, "Oh, gosh I must've pushed the wrong button again."  And Johnita [Johnita Due] did all kind of research, some of the legal work and helping us in terms of getting people lined up and, and trying to get our story out by--trying to get us--she applied for us to have the Thurgood Marshall Award.  She just said, "Mom, we gotta just keep going and going.  Everybody has to know."  And they all knew it was difficult, but this is how this book happened.  Now, the name 'Freedom in the Family: A Mother-Daughter Memoir of the Fight for Civil Rights' [Tananarive Due and Patricia Stephens Due] was not actually a title that I came up with.
Story_ID: 482843
Speaker 1: The name of our book 'Freedom in the Family: A Mother-Daughter Memoir of the Fight for Civil Rights' [Tananarive Due and Patricia Stephens Due] was not actually my idea.  I had gone through all of my ideas about ordinary people and also, 'Nobody Knows the Trouble I--,' all kind of things that I felt emotionally attached to, but then when Tananarive [Tananarive Due] actually took some time off, and we tried to get a publisher--she had an agent for her other book.  She had never done nonfiction and I knew it would be a job for me keeping it nonfiction, but her agent actually suggested the name because he thought it would be very interesting, not only to hear about the foot soldiers but to hear how some of the young people we had worked so hard for fared, how their lives have been.  So, he thought having Tananarive tell what happened to her would give the viewers a good idea of what we were able to accomplish.  So, that's how it started and, and the book the agent worked to, to get the book out there and he had major companies interested and we actually went with Ballantine [Ballantine Books].  At first I thought we were gonna be doing Doubleday [Doubleday and Company Inc.; Knopf Doubleday Publishing Company], because when I was called and told about it he was saying what each house was offering.  So, I got excited but then they said, "Oh, but wait."  Then it was Ballantine who--and Ballantine is owned by Random House [Random House Inc.; Penguin Random House] and so, we, we went with Ballantine.  Initially, Anita Hills [sic. Anita Diggs] was our editor and we were just so excited.  This was a black who went to the bat for this book, because she thought it needed to be written, that we had to write the book.  But unfortunately after a few months and (unclear), she was no longer with Ballantine, but she was the one who, who helped us--well, actually, who actually probably wanted it and went to bat for it, and later on we were assigned another editor who is a very nice lady, Ms. Betsy Mitchell, and I think, you know she was supportive, but I think maybe even a little intimidated by the story.  You know how it is sometimes people are intimidated by you, because basically we just went on and wrote and, and wrote and wrote.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: And you know meeting the deadlines.  We--I guess we had that to be grateful for but I'm just glad the book is done.
Speaker 2: Well, I am too, I'm looking forward to reading more of it.
Story_ID: 482844
Speaker 1: You mentioned earlier, and your husband John [John Due] also alluded to workshops and enactments that you have done over the years, giving the history that you recited today.  Is that in recent years or can you tell us about that kind of work?  Was that before the book ['Freedom in the Family: A Mother-Daughter Memoir of the Fight for Civil Rights,' Tananarive Due and Patricia Stephens Due] or after the book?
Speaker 2: It was before the book, after the book, and in recent years.  I had decided, and I had to decide what I could do.  You know you--sometimes you have to prioritize things, and I said I'm always talking about people knowing our history and I should be out there telling it as far as I know.  So, I started speaking in high schools, in colleges, churches, just all kinds of groups.  And I found that it was difficult especially for the high school and the college young people to believe that I'm still alive and all of that happened.  "Well how can that be and you're still here?"  They didn't realize that it wasn't that long ago.  So I, what I would do would go in and usually in the high schools I would speak to a hundred students an hour, in the course of a day, maybe five hundred students a day which was really gruesome.  It was really, really difficult and then I would tell the story and then I would set up a lunch counter and I would have students come up and volunteer.  A lot of them didn't want to volunteer, especially the white students.  I would get any number of black students and I would need a waitress.  I would need a police offer, these people have to, need to be white and then I would walk 'em through it initially, and then they would do it on their own.  The name calling, you know the nigger word.  "You smell, you need to go back to the back."  But you know what I found, we were not so distant from nigger.  The black students would get upset still, although they realized that this was role playing.  So, that tells you something.  Something is wrong.  Many things are wrong, but this is what I've done.  Usually when I spoke in universities, it would be maybe five or six hundred in a really large class and I would still do the role playing because they were able to envision things better and most of their parents had never told them about anything that ever happened, even those who knew.  So this was a way of telling them what happened and also always saying to them what they could do, because things needed to be monitored.  You didn't have to go jail, you don't have to march, but if you have a peer who's having trouble or you're good in math, you can begin there.  You do what you can do when you can do it, and that's a big thing, and that was my attitude even during the movement.  I'm, I'm not just disappointed because you know some people say, "Oh, I'm sorry I couldn't demonstrate."  Well, you did what you could do.  So, I've, I've been doing this; I've had at some engagements, I spoke in March.  I didn't do the role playing but I spoke in March at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] to the Honors--at the Honors Convocation.
Speaker 1: I met a young lady this morning at FAMU who heard you recently, and she said she was totally gripped and just by what you said.  I, mean you, you just--you, you've made a big impact on us, you told me she admitted that she said she had never heard all this before.  And I heard that this morning (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's the problem.
Speaker 1: I heard that this morning from a young lady over at the center. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, that's the problem, they, they've never heard it.
Story_ID: 482845
Speaker 1: I wanna read this question to you, because I wrote it out after reading some other things that you had written in some other places, but this I think is also a challenge that I've been confronting and trying to work out over the years and that's one reason I'm working with The HistoryMakers, but the question is this--it's probably your question, it's almost verbatim.  How do we get out young people to know the history of our civil rights historical struggles, and our failures and our achievements? Now certainly your book ['Freedom in the Family: A Mother-Daughter Memoir of the Fight for Civil Rights,' Tananarive Due and Patricia Stephens Due] is part of the answer, but we're not where we should be with it.  How are we gonna do this, what are we gonna do to get our kids to know and understand, and, and get this history?  I worry about my grandchildren, I worry about my grandchildren, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I do too.
Speaker 1: One's eight, one is three and I have two more grandchildren on the way, right.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: They're going to have to know all this, right?  I'm worried about a few years from now as they get older.  How are they going to understand?  They've got to go so much further back and have--you know, we and I didn't have to learn as much as they're gonna have to learn.  So, how are we gonna do this?
Speaker 2: It's a big job, but let me just say, I was really, really pleasantly surprised when my grandson who is now eight, our oldest, when he was seven, he said, "Grandma, why did you go to jail?  What happened?  Tell me what happened."  The fact that he's interested and not only that, there was this interest in his class, but we have a big job to do.  Now, you mentioned my book, there's so many other books--The HistoryMakers.  It is so critical that these interviews that you are doing can somehow get to people all across the country and we, we had the 'Voices of the Civil Rights Movement' ['Voices of the Civil Rights Movement: A Primary Source Exploration of the Struggle for Racial Equality,' Lori Mortensen], but I think where it really begins and has to begin is at home with the parents.  Now, maybe we're gonna have to go back and teach the parents.  For years and years, we had babies having babies and some of they--the grandparents was so young they didn't know about it either, but we--in our churches.  I mean we were, we have to take everything that we have learned and make it work for us.  Maybe we're going to have to have less TV, and maybe we're gonna have to stop the kids from using all, all of these computer games, and if they're using them, let them learn something about their history.  I don't know what we can do totally.  All I know is we need to call 'em, we still support the churches.  We finance the churches, we can have them make certain that in their curriculum--now, I did speak at a lot of churches, but all of us, and you see it's not even those of us who are actually involved in the, quote, Civil Rights Movement that have stories to tell.  I say even in Gadsden County [Florida] and Leon County [Florida] and all over this state and this country, "If you're black, you have a story to tell."  And the thing I tell young people--most of all a few months ago I spoke before a class.  I said, "Just make it easy on yourselves, talk with your parents.  Talk with your grandparents.  They may not be able to tell you about going to jail, but they have important stories to tell."
Speaker 1: Everybody's got history.
Speaker 2: Everybody has history, and we need to know our history.  I fell badly as much as I talk to my mother [Lottie Powell Stephens Hamilton], there are things I still don't know and she's no longer here.  So, no one can answer these questions I still have.  So, it should begin at home.  I just can't say how important that is, and I think sometimes when we have these think tanks we they're talking about how we could do away with some of the racism now.  We need to have projects of just teaching our children what has happened in the past, because you know what happens when they don't know?  It cripples them, they can't cope.  They have no idea sometimes why police officers may be dangerous or what they need to do, why driving black can be dangerous.  If they had some good idea of the history, they would have a better understanding of why there's a disproportionate number of black males especially in the criminal justice system.  Why fewer blacks, especially the males although have been increasing, or in the colleges, why you don't get a job.  Why a black woman is hired to satisfy the blackness and being a woman, and we get bitter but we have to go beyond that bitterness and look at the situation and if we don't, it'll paralyze us.
Story_ID: 482846
Speaker 1: Okay, I think we've come down to some wrap-up questions as we call them in The HistoryMakers schedule here and my first question is: is there anything else you'd like to add to this interview that I've not asked you about yet?
Speaker 2: Well, you probably asked me, there is something I would like to add.  It has to do with children and it has do with my sister.  I was lucky, we were lucky we had the home life that we did.  My stepfather [Marion M. Hamilton] was so important to me and I think he believed and my mother [Lottie Powell Stephens Hamilton] believed that we could do anything so we were lucky.  Now, my sister, when I got arrested in New York in 1964 during the World's Fair [1964 New York World's Fair, New York, New York], had already fled to New York thinking New York was so different, and my sister had said after she was kicked at a swimming pool at Tallahassee [Florida] and no one would say what happened, a police officer kicked her in the stomach.  "I have to get away."  So, she fled Tallahassee and went to New York.  Then we were arrested and I begged her to demonstrate up in New York because they were portraying Florida as paradise and I said it--our thing was it's not paradise.  It may be for whites but it's hell for blacks.  So, she was arrested, I was arrested.  Other people from all over the country from Florida went there and were arrested. I had to fly from Florida to New York six, seven or eight times just for the arraignment.  On one of those times she was living in New York but she was ill and I took a note from a doctor.  When we went back they had misplaced it and they re-arrested her and she called me.  She said, "Pat [HistoryMaker Patricia Stephens Due], I have to go; I have to leave.  I have to leave this country."  And she fled this country and went to Africa, went to Ghana.  That changed our relationship.  She was afraid to come back.  So, when she got pregnant in 1966, I begged her to come back--1964 the public accommodations act [Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title II], 1965 the Voting Rights Act [Voting Rights Act of 1965].  I said, "Priscilla [Priscilla Stephens Kruize], you can come back now, it's okay.  We've got these laws," and finally I persuaded her.  My mother was in Miami [Florida].  I was living in Miami and we went to Belle Glade [Florida] where we grew up to visit.  She's nine months pregnant, I have nine month old Tananarive [Tananarive Due].  On our way back--South Bay [Florida] between Belle Glade and Miami she felt sick.  She needed something to eat.  We went--past 1964 to 1966, we went in to get a sandwich.  The waitress refused to serve her and picked up a steel chair and was going to hit my sister and maybe my nine month old child, and I said then, "If you move that chair, I'll wipe up the floor with you."  You know maybe this wasn't coy, and it wasn't a demonstration.  These were emotions.  When my sister had the baby in September, she left, and every time she came, she wanted to come to this country or tried to come and did come, she would break out in hives.  Racism is a disease that destroys families that makes you sick.  Who could believe a person would try to hit a pregnant woman, a woman with a baby?  But we were not human beings.  So, we had better remember what has happened in the past and what's happening now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But (shrugs).
Story_ID: 482847
Speaker 1: You've probably answered this question, but I wanna ask it.  It's on the schedule as a way of wrapping up, but how do you feel about the way that you've lived your life?
Speaker 2: Well, I haven't always done what I considered my best, but at the time it was my best and sometimes I feel that if I could relive my life in addition to the activities that I have, it's important to be in a position to also contribute financially to causes that you believe in.  But all in all, I figured I've lived my life and I have to continue living my life, making certain that we know what has happened and making certain that our young people feel that they have a responsibility to reach down and pull up all of our people that we have left there.  We moved from the cities, and the educational system, they're just so many things course I say I would like to do.  When I heard about the King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] papers--this was recently--I was very distraught that they were gonna be auctioned off, because that's our history.  It belongs to us and it should be kept with us.  Otherwise, it could be erased.  I mean there have been times when I was willing to do what we couldn't do financially to try to make a difference, and I must say one thing I haven't mentioned.  I complain about my husband, but when we were writing this book, I had an office.  I took over the living room.  I paid for everything virtually 'cause Tananarive's [Stephens Due's daughter, Tananarive Due] money had to pay for her condo and things, her own bills.  My husband, John Dorsey Due, Jr. [John Due] actually financed the writing of 'Freedom in the Family' ['Freedom in the Family: A Mother-Daughter Memoir of the Fight for Civil Rights,' Tananarive Due and Patricia Stephens Due], without ever a complaint.  He always said, "This is my job.  The job I had to do."  So, you know I probably never really thanked him publicly but I didn't have a grant to write this book over all the years and the decades.  Everything came from the income he made, for me to go out to travel, to be able to write, to interview, to do everything, came from him.
Story_ID: 482848
Speaker 1: What are your, your current thoughts about the so-called Civil Rights Movement today, 2006?  Where are we?  Where do you see us at this point?  What should we be doing, what?  I mean certainly we have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sometimes.
Speaker 1: --things, a lot of things have not changed as we've said.  You know a lot of things have changed, but what--?
Speaker 2: Well, sometimes I don't see us, but then I have to remember that just because a person's opinions are different from mine doesn't mean they aren't contributing something to the whole.  I guess I wish that more organizations and more people get together and plan some kind of strategy to help our people as a whole.  Now, I say our people and that doesn't mean I don't recognize the fact that there're people of all races and groups, but we still are not on a level playing field, and until we get to that place we are not going to have the ability to have a good quality of life.  So, I just, I just wish all these people who represent us, I say us--as a school board member I heard here in Gadsden County [Florida] that some whites came to the school board and wanted them to give them permission to have the Confederate flags in a school system that's now 99 percent black probably, not 98 percent because the whites fled when they were integrated, and a school board member, black school board member said, "I don't see what, I don't see the problem is. Why not?"  I bet he has no idea of what has happened in this county or anyone else, or anywhere else, otherwise he would have not said that.  We need to learn our history and we need to correct history when we see it is in error, and we know it is in error.  We need to make those corrections, otherwise the writers themselves determine what the history is.  If you see a mistake, notify that person so that it can be corrected.  There are a lot of errors, and I always look.  When I go and see new books to see what's included and what's left out.
Story_ID: 482849
Speaker 1: Last question: how do you want to be remembered?  What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I want my legacy to be that I--that we taught our children well.  To--not that Tananarive [Tananarive Due] went to Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] or worked for the Miami Herald or worked for The Wall Street Journal or that Johnita [Johnita Due] went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and worked at the UN [United Nations] and worked at a Wall Street law firm, McGraw-Hill, and now CNN and Turner [Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.] and that Lydia [Lydia Due Greisz] went to Wesleyan [Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut] and worked for the government prosecuting those who worked for nursing homes.  I want our legacy to be that we taught our children that they have a responsibility to share what they know and what they do with everybody.  They have a responsibility.  They cannot sit and say, "I'm doing fine."   Everyone is not doing fine, and I'd just like to officially say I am proud of our three daughters because they do know who they are.  They do know, they have to get out there and let our young people know what's available.  Tananarive does it in her writing.  She, she tries to, she writes supernatural mostly but she tries to use our black history so that those who don't have an idea and although it's fiction, you could see how it might parallel with something that really happened, and Johnita goes to--she's legal counsel for CNN but she knows that there is so much discrimination against blacks when they come up for interviews, not necessarily at CNN, but there too probably.  That she makes it a point to go to colleges and tell them what's expected.  She's had a co-worker to go with her when she was working at New York to interview young people at colleges in Georgia and one wanted to dismiss a brilliant young woman because of the way she talked.  She had to be there to say, "Oh, no, no it's not gonna happen this way."  And Lydia who was exposed to senior citizens who wanted to do her part and even working for the federal government, found a way to do it, to prosecute those who would defraud the most fragile, the storytellers of our times, and now teaching her boys, quitting her job to be with her boys, two boys, Justin [Justin Greisz] and Jordan [Jordan Greisz] so that she can monitor what they do they in school, that's--in a way we, I have my legacy.

Speaker 1: This is a photo of my mother when she was living in Belle Glade, Florida in the '50s [1950s].  Her name is Mrs. Lottie Powell Stephens Hamilton.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next.  All right tell us about this photo.
Speaker 1: This is Tananarive Priscilla Due [Tananarive Due], my oldest daughter when she was graduating from high school at Miami Southridge [Miami Southridge High School; Miami Southridge Senior High School, Miami, Florida] in 1983.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is a photo of my husband John Dorsey Due, Jr. [John Due] in 1963 a few weeks before we got married.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Hold it, okay, next.
Speaker 1: This is one of my early photos.  I'm [HistoryMaker] Patricia Stephens Due.  This was also taken a few weeks before we got married, both taken by Stephen Beasley [Stephen K. Beasley] in Tallahassee, Florida.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is my full family standing in front of our home in Belle Glade, Florida around 1956.  To the right, my right we have Daddy Marion [Stephens Due's stepfather, Marion M. Hamilton].  Then I'm standing next to him.  My brother Walter, Horace Walter Stephens [Horace Stephens, Jr.] and up top is my mother, and then to her left I have my sister, Priscilla Stephens Kruize, and seated in front is my [maternal] grandmother, Mrs. Alma Ellen Peterson [Alma Peterson].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Good, next?

Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is a photo taken on an Easter Sunday with me on the left, my sister Priscilla in the center and my little brother Horace Walter Stephens.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, got it.  Go, ahead.
Speaker 1: This is a photo taken in Tallahassee, Florida in 1960.  FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] students were marching downtown from the campus after thirty-five or forty had been arrested and actually during this time I had been tear gassed and they, they had signs saying "We will not fight" and "Give us back our students."  On my far right is William Larkins who is the incoming of the student government association and who also spent forty-nine days in jail for sitting in at a Woolworths [F.W. Woolworth Company] lunch counter.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next?  Discussion.
Speaker 1: This is a photo and my sister is in front, Priscilla Stephens.  It was taken December 1960 as she and others are picketing in front of McCrory's five and ten store in Tallahassee, Florida.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is a photo of students demonstrating at the Florida Theatre in Tallahassee, Florida.  Some had been arrested.  I'm there in the black dress with the back sunglasses on and John is just a little bit to the right, directly down from the sign that says "The Day Mars Invaded Earth."
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This photo was taken in Tallahassee, Florida in December 1960.  Priscilla, and you can see me with the dark glasses on to her left and I went to ask the police officers in Tallahassee to protect us and to stop the hecklers from tearing up our signs, but as you can see from the photo they weren't really interested in that.  One even had his hand on his gun.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, what year was that?
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty [1960], December 1960.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, great next.
Speaker 1: This is at the Tallahassee airport [Tallahassee Municipal Airport; Tallahassee International Airport, Tallahassee, Florida] in 1961 as ministers from all over the country came to Tallahassee to participate in the Freedom Rides.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Good, next.
Speaker 1: This is really a special photo here as we had a reunion of some of the people involved in the movement in August 1997 at our home which then was in Miami, Florida.  Beginning on my left, my daughter Johnita [Johnita Due], next to her attorney [HistoryMaker] Jeff Greenup, then Clarence Edwards, Ulysses Baety, and there's John and there's Dan Harmeling, who was one of the whites who participated, and in front of him is Tananarive, our daughter, and then Mrs. Vivian Kelly who flew in from Tallahassee who lived in Quincy [Florida], Dr. Robert Hayling [sic. Robert Hayling] who was so involved in St. Augustine [Florida] and who had been beaten by the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] there and still has a steel plate in his head and down from him we have Mr. McCray [Miles McCray], and then Mrs. Hayling [Athea Hayling] and she and Dr. Hayling were then living then--are now living in Fort Lauderdale [Florida], and next to them Mrs. Doris Rutledge Hart.  Doris was involved in activities as a FAMU student, she was one of the CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] workers.  Her main county was Suwannee County [Florida].  She was shot at then but she continues to be involved today in the NAACP ACT-SO Program [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics], and there I am sitting next to Doris with the dark glasses on.  I guess I'm just so tired, I guess I sort of looked like it from trying to prepare for this reunion.  And next to me is my is my mother, Mrs. Lottie Mae Powell Stephens Hamilton and, who is now deceased.  She died on December 25, 2000, and next to my mother is my sister Priscilla.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Now, in April 1996 after Tananarive had actually sold one book she was at the microphone to let FAMU and Dr. Humphries [HistoryMaker Frederick Humphries] who's right next to her know that she was starting a scholarship in our names, the John D. Due and Patricia Stephens Due Freedom Scholarship [John and Patricia Stephens Due Endowed Freedom Scholarship Fund] and this was the photo that was taken on this day on April 25, 1996, as Tananarive started a scholarship in the name of her parents.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  What was that again?
Speaker 1: A scholarship to FAMU students, for FAMU students.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, go ahead, next.
Speaker 1: This is my mother's father, my grandfather, Richard Allen Powell.  He was born in Quincy and he died in Quincy around 1959.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: And this is a picture of me at Florida International University in Miami, Florida where Dr. John Hope Franklin [HistoryMaker John Hope Franklin] came with his book and of course I was there with several 'From Freedom'--'From Slavery to Freedom' ['From Slavery to Freedom: A History of African Americans,' John Hope Franklin] and I had several for him to sign.  I've met him on several occasions and at this point I was part of Tananarive's staff, her manager.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DICUSSION)
Speaker 1: Now, this picture was taken in Des Plaines, Illinois in 1999 I believe and the four of us there are former student leaders.  I'm on the left, then we have Dave Dennis, Thomas Gaither and Rudy Lombard, all who became CORE field secretaries.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is a photo of my stepfather who actually raised me with my mother, Marion M. Hamilton who brought so much to my life.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Now, this is my baby, Lydia [Lydia Due Greisz], named after her [paternal] great-grandmother, Charlotte [Lydia Graham], named after my mother.  Lydia Charlotte Due, and she posed for one of the family photos that we always insisted on.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: This is my second daughter, Johnita Patricia Due, a part of that same family pose, the family picture that we did.  I believe this was in the year of 2000, January 2000 and actually Mr. Lee [Columbus Lee] was the photographer who took all of these family photos.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  This one?
Speaker 1: This a photo at the Sir John Hotel in Miami, Florida during a CORE meeting and I don't know all of the people, but to my left standing is Jim Dewar, who came somewhere, from somewhere in the Northwest, Zev Aelony, and I had interviewed Zev for the book ['Freedom in the Family: A Mother-Daughter Memoir of the Fight for Civil Rights,' Tananarive Due and Patricia Stephens Due] and Jim McCain [James T. McCain], Gordon Carey on the right side and then sitting, Vera Williams who was a member of St. Louis [Missouri] CORE, one of the most active CORE groups in the nation at that time in 1960.
Speaker 2: All right, that's it.
Speaker 1: Could've been '59 [1959] maybe I'd better do that one over.
