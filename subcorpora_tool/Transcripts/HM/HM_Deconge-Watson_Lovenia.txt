Speaker 2: Well, I must say that my most relaxing vacation was when I went to Alaska.  I came back rested.  All of the times you go places you come back, you know, exhausted.  But there's not much to see there and except the beautiful scenery.  And so I enjoyed that very much.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?

Story_ID: 29793
Speaker 1: Now, let's begin by talking about your family.  And I'd like to begin with your mother.  Tell me her name, where she was born and when, if you know?
Speaker 2: My mother's name Adina Rodney Deconge, and she was born on August 16, 1897 in New Roads, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Did she talk to you about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother was one of five children in the beginning.  Her mother [Regina Dubeau Rodney] died when she was only five years old.  So she didn't know her mother.  And she had, she was the only girl in that group of brothers and sisters.  She was the middle person, and she said she grieved a lot not knowing her mother.  And then her father [Joseph Rodney] remarried and she had the stepmother for years, and there were six more children by the second mother.  So there were eleven all together, six boys and five girls.  And my mother was a very kind, generous person.  She was not educated, you know, at that time.  They weren't allowed to go to school very far, so I think she went to fourth grade.  But she taught us, and yeah, I guess at that time fourth grade was like an eighth grade or a ninth grade (laughter).  But she, you know, she was able to read and raise her family and do whatever was necessary to keep us together.
Speaker 1: And, we'll come back to her in a little bit, but her father--well, tell me, first tell me her mother's name?
Speaker 2: Her mother's name was Regina Dubeau Rodney.
Speaker 1: Can you spell Dubeau?
Speaker 2: D-U-B-E-A-U.
Speaker 1: And her father's name?
Speaker 2: Joseph Rodney.
Speaker 1: Now, did she, did they live on a farm or in the city?
Speaker 2: No, they lived on a farm.  In fact, I lived on a farm until I was about ten (laughter).  But they lived on the farm, and very hard work, and as I said, you know, they were not able to go to school because that's what they were doing, working on the farm.
Speaker 1: Do you know whether they owned the land that they--
Speaker 2: No, they did not own the land.  They were sharecroppers until they moved here to Baton Rouge [Louisiana] when they owned their first home, when they came to Baton Rouge.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have any information about your grandfather [Joseph Rodney]?  Did you know him?
Speaker 2: Yes, I knew my grandfather, Joseph Rodney.  In fact, he lived with us in Wickliffe [Louisiana], and he took care of me and my younger brother [Alvin Deconge] while we were growing up because the rest of the people were working during the day.  And he died when I was only seven.  So I, he was the only grandparent I knew, and he died when I was seven.
Speaker 1: Did you have a relationship with his second wife?
Speaker 2: No, she died before, she died when my mother [Adina Rodney Deconge] was a young woman, maybe twenty, twenty-two.
Story_ID: 29794
Speaker 1: What else do you know about your heritage as far as your ancestors past your grandfather [Joseph Rodney]?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandmother [Regina Dubeau Rodney] was the daughter of a Lamnonroe (unclear) who her father was Podres (ph.) and he was white.  And he had two daughters.  And one of those two daughters was my great grandmother.  And--
Speaker 1: What was your great grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: What was her name?  I have it written, but I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, but her last name was?
Speaker 2: She came from Dubeau family, first Podres.  She's a descendant of the Podres family, and they're very well known here in Louisiana.  They were rich landowners.
Speaker 1: And any more information on your grandfather's side?
Speaker 2: Yes, my grandfather's father was a Cherokee Indian.  And he had, my grandfather had--cause I told you about--he had two, four brothers, full brothers, and he had, what?  Three or two half brothers.  No, that's my mother's people.  Oh, my grandfather had one brother.  His name was Sterling Rodney.  And his father was also Sterling Rodney.  Yes, so there were only two brothers from the--Joseph and Sterling on that side.
Speaker 1: Were both of your parents Creole or grandparents?
Speaker 2: They were what?
Speaker 1: Were they considered Creole?
Speaker 2: Yes, they all spoke French, you know, and they--I grew up hearing French, even though I did not speak French (laughter), cause my mother didn't want us to grow up speaking French.  But we grew up understanding it.  So my father [Alphonse Frank Deconge] spoke very, very little English, and he couldn't write English.  And he only, he even said his prayers and everything in French.  So we grew up, you know, knowing French.
Speaker 1: So was your grandfather also a farmer?  Did he do anything else?
Speaker 2: No, he was a farmer.
Speaker 1: A farmer, okay.
Story_ID: 29795
Speaker 1: Now, my dad did other things--
Speaker 2: Now, let's talk about your dad's side.  Tell me your father's name?
Speaker 1: My father's name is Alphonse Frank Deconge.
Speaker 2: And where was he born and when?
Speaker 1: He was born in Amite [Louisiana] or Independence [Louisiana], a place near Amite.  And his mother [Augustine Martin] was black and his father [Eugene Garon] was white.
Speaker 2: And did he share any stories about his growing up?
Speaker 1: No.  He never, I didn't find out that his father was white until the day he died and his brothers and sisters came to the funeral.
Speaker 2: So you had never met any of his--
Speaker 1: I knew them, but I didn't know that they were his relatives (laughter).  I knew them, yeah, because we lived right across the street from his sister.  And you know, we went there and we--but I did not know that she was my aunt until after--when he died, they all came to the funeral.  And that's when I found out that, though my older brother [Alphonse Deconge] knew his father [Deconge-Watson's paternal grandfather, Eugene Garon] cause his father died before, but his father raised him.  And even though he was white, he raised my father, and he died, I guess when my father was in his thirties.
Speaker 2: Now, tell me your grandmother's, your father's mother's name, your grandmother on your father's side.  What was her name?
Speaker 1: Her name Augustine Martin.
Speaker 2: Did you have a relationship with her?
Speaker 1: She died when my father was thirteen (chuckle).  So.
Speaker 2: And your grandfather, you didn't--
Speaker 1: No, I never met him, though the older members of my family, like my oldest brother [Alphonse Deconge] and my two oldest sisters [Elnora and Alberta Deconge] knew him.
Speaker 2: So, is there a story about how your mother [Adina Rodney Deconge] and father met?
Speaker 1: Well, my mother was engaged to be married before she met my father.  But seemingly, that fiance was killed in World War I [1914-1918].  And so she met my father after that, and they had a courtship and they got married in, I think it was 1918 or 1919.
Speaker 2: What did your father do for a living?
Speaker 1: My father was a jack-of-all-trades.  He was a barber.  He repaired shoes.  He could do some electrical work.  He could do some carpentry work.  He couldn't do too much of the farming because he got hurt in World War I, and he--so, and he also, having a lot of white relatives, he also worked in, they owned a produce company and grocery stores and he worked with them sometimes when we were still in New Roads.  He worked with them when he, especially after he couldn't do any real hard labor.  So between the barbering and the repairing shoes and working with them, that's what he did.
Story_ID: 29796
Speaker 1: So your family moved to Baton Rouge [Louisiana] in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-six [1946].
Speaker 1: So tell me about your growing up years.  Where--I know where you were born and how long did you stay in that town?
Speaker 2: I lived in New Roads [Louisiana] until I was in the fifth grade.  I was about ten or eleven years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, so tell me about New Roads.  Tell me what was your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I had a very, very happy childhood.  Particularly, you know with my grandfather [Joseph Rodney].  I remember his taking care of us, and, you know, I don't know if you know what a slide is, do you?
Speaker 1: Un-un.
Speaker 2: It's, it's not a wagon.  It has no wheels.  It's like a sled.  And you, it's drawn by horses or mules, whatever.  And it slides along the road instead of rolls.  And he used to take us riding a lot of times on the slide, my brother and I.  And he took very good care of us, and I remember way long ago, I remember things from when I was like three and four years old.
Speaker 1: What do you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, one thing I remember, one Christmas when I received this tricycle, little read tricycle (laughter).  I remember that, and my father [Alphonse Frank Deconge] also had a car on horse--you know, the carpenter horses. And we spent so much time driving that car (laughter).  We'd get in the car and we'd drive all over the place, and my grandfather was there.  And he would ask us every once and a while where we were at the time.  And we also had a, my father built us a dollhouse.  It was big enough for us to go in and put furniture in, and we spent a lot of time there, pretending to cook.  We'd make hot dogs and hamburgers out of mud and sycamore leaves (laughter).  And I, it was a very good time, very, very good time I thought.  We did a lot of fishing and craw fishing cause then there was a--in the back of where we lived, there was like a, I don't know if you'd call it a bayou, but it was a stream of water that was a residue of the (unclear), it used to run all the way down.  And we fished there.  We went along the railroad track and fished.  I remember one day when we were fishing, a train was coming, and it was shooting steam on both sides.  And we were in a place with water on both sides of the tracks, so we were down in the slope.  And we thought that we were gonna get burned when that train came.   And so what we did, we poured all our crawfish back in the water.  And we got inside those croaker sacks, face down.  I guess I was about ten or eleven at that time.  And when the train came, it wasn't hot water.  It was cold water (laughter).  So that was a pleasant surprise.  I don't know up to today whether trains shoot cold water or whether, you know, it was some miracle saw that we didn't get burned.  But we used to do a lot of things like that.  Or we'd go out in strange places to pick berries and I remember one time we went up--oh, it must have been a good three or four miles, we walked and went through a pasture and went over a little swamp.  And on the other side of the swamp, they had millions of blackberries.  So we picked blackberries and picked, and then when we were coming back across the swamp, we saw snakes in the water (laughter).  So we were trying to run in all of that mud to get out.  We lost all of the berries, and we were just a mess by the time we got home.  And my mother [Adina Rodney Deconge] was very, very upset cause she hadn't know we was going.  She said that, that was the place where my uncles hunted alligators.  And she was terrified.  She said, if the alligators had come, you know, and caught us on the other side of the swamp.  So it was things like that, that--but we lived a very full childhood.
Story_ID: 29797
Speaker 1: Tell me about your siblings?
Speaker 2: I have, I had six sisters, five sisters.  I'm the sixth one, and three brothers.
Speaker 1: Can you run them down and tell me you where you fit in?
Speaker 2: Yes, all right.  My oldest sister's name was Elnora.  The second one was Alberta.  My brother, Alphonse II, and I had a sister named Regina, after my grandmother.  And I had a brother named Nolan, after her sister Laura, and I'm the seventh child.  I have two after me, my brother Alvin and my sister, Estelle.
Speaker 1: And do you wanna tell me something about each one of them, just a little short something about them.
Speaker 2: Well, my oldest two sisters, at the time, left home when I was quite young cause my oldest sister is twenty-one years older than I am.  And so they had left home by the time I was four or five, I think.  They left New Roads [Louisiana] cause there was no opportunity there for them.  They went to live in New Orleans [Louisiana] with my aunt.  And so I didn't get to know them very well except on holidays when they came home.  My older brother was there, and then, and I guess he was in World War II [1939-1945] so he was away like three years, you know, at the time that I was growing up.  And so the ones that I really up with was my sister, Regina, and those after that.  And Regina also left home when she was, after she--in New Roads, in the school that was there, the school did not go any further than ninth grade.  And everybody who wanted an education more than ninth grade had to leave New Roads, either come here to Baton Rouge [Louisiana] or go to New Orleans.  And so that's what happened.  My sister, Regina, left when, after she finished the ninth grade and she went to New Orleans to finish her education.  And so we really grew up as a mini-family with my brother, Nolan and Laura, me, Alvin and my youngest sister was born seven years after I was born.  So she almost grew up like an only child (laughter) because by the time she came along, just she and my brother, Alvin, were there.  Everybody else had left by that time.
Speaker 1: Were there any family, unusual family traditions that your family had, like maybe during the holidays or something like that?
Speaker 2: My mother [Adina Rodney Deconge] was very close knit with her sisters and brothers.  They were, I would say cliquish (laughter).  So when we were growing up, our playmates were mostly our cousins.  I had sixty first cousins.  And whenever we went anywhere or we did anything, it was mostly with cousins.  We were protected in that way, and we went to private schools all our lives.  We never went to a public school, and the tradition was getting together.  Every Sunday we'd go to one uncle's house and everybody would go there.  So it wasn't mostly a holiday thing.  It was like every Sunday she went to one of them, and we spent the day there.  And so the family was extremely close knit.  My cousins are like sisters and brothers to me.  They were, we just grew up together.
Story_ID: 29798
Speaker 1: Now, in the area in which you lived, and these are your primary years, you said that you went to private school.  What school did you attend for your primary years?
Speaker 2: We went to Saint Augustine Catholic School in New Roads [Louisiana].  And that's where I went from first grade to fifth grade.  And all my sisters and brothers went to the same school.  We all went to the same school while we were in New Roads.  And when we moved to Baton Rouge [Louisiana], I didn't come here with my family.  I went to New Orleans [Louisiana] cause my oldest sister [Elnora Deconge] had children by that time, and she needed someone to take her first son to school.  He was five.  And he was gonna go to Corpus Christi School in New Orleans.  So she asked me to come and stay with her to take him to school.  So when they--when my family moved from New Roads, I went to New Orleans to spend a year with her.
Speaker 1: But that's a little bit later on, is that right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're still in your elementary school days.  Your mother didn't work outside of the home?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: St. Augustine, this was a Catholic school, and did your family have to pay for you to attend the school?
Speaker 2: Amazingly, they paid one dollar a month (laughter).
Speaker 1: For each child?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And we also had to, they had to pay for us to ride the bus to go to school.  The bus would pick us up and bring us home.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your house.  Describe your house with these (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, while I was in New Roads, we lived in three different houses.  The first house we lived in, it was just an ordinary--I don't know if you've seen these houses.  They looked like a very steep roof, a big attic.  The front porch was all the way across the front of the house.  Usually, there was two doors to go into the house, one--and amazingly, they had one big room that I remember.  And then next to it was a small room.  And there was a kitchen.  And next to the kitchen was another small room.  And I just, when I go there now and look at it, I wondered how we all fit in it (laughter).  It was, you know, a very small house.  But I think, you know, I don't even know.  I don't remember the attic.  I think some, there was a bedroom in the attic cause it was a very, very high ceiling.  And I was in that house until I was seven years old.
Speaker 1: Does your family still own the house?
Speaker 2: No, we did not own the house.  When I was seven, my oldest sister got married.  And we all went to New Orleans for the wedding because she didn't, she couldn't come home to get married.  And that was a kind of bad thing for the landlord because my father [Alphonse Frank Deconge] I think was late for the first time with the rent.  And he put us out after the wedding.  And so we had to, my dad [Alphonse Frank Deconge] had to find a house for us to stay in.  And the house he found the awful house.  You know, you go in and you could see the ground from the inside of the house.  There were big cracks in the walls and it, you know, and we almost froze to death in that house.  But, and my mother [Adina Rodney Deconge] was trying to get us away from the house.  So she sent my sister, Laura and I to a place called Buras,[Louisiana] to live with my sister.  And we were supposed to stay there that year because after one year, they were gonna get another house.  But the day that we went there, and tried to go to the school that was there, it was a pitiful school (laughter).  And we had to cross a bridge with no railings, water to get to the school.  And the first day we went there, it was raining.  And my sister [Laura Deconge] fell into the canal and was drowning.  And she finally was saved and I've never seen a school like it before because I was in the third grade when I went there.  And the lady was teaching us how to make a five (laughter), you know.  And by that time, you know, I was reading and everything in school.  And I was sitting there looking at her, and she was saying, and I remember distinctly, she said, "you draw a half a apple, and then you put the stem on, and then you put the leaf that go on the five (laughter).  And so after that first day, we did not want to go back to that school (laughter).
Story_ID: 29799
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were going to St. Augustine's [Catholic School] before you went to Buras [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yes, but we stayed only day in Buras, and then we went back home to go back to the third grade in New Roads because, oh, we didn't, you know, we just cried and cried until my dad [Alphonse Frank Deconge] came and picked us up.
Speaker 1: Now, this was in the height of the--well, the Depression was going on during this time.  Is that why your father [Alphonse Frank Deconge] was having trouble with work?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I told you he was, he got hurt in the War, World War [World War I], and I guess it was, you know how, when you farm, some years you have good years, and some years you have bad years.  And it's probably one of the things, he had a bad year.  And then the expense of, you know, taking us all to New Orleans [Louisiana].  And I think it was a little jealousy with the people that she [Elnora Deconge] didn't come to get married, and you know how people stir up trouble.
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about St. Augustine's.  Who were your teachers?  Who were some of your friends?
Speaker 2: I remember my--I have to tell you about St. Augustine's.  You know, my birthday, you know, this is in October.  And they didn't take children in kindergarten until they were five.  And my birthday, you see, was like in--so they wouldn't let me start school at four when I was almost five.  So I went to pre--they had what they called a pre-kindergarten.  I started pre-kindergarten at five, you know, that I'm almost, take the month off.  And they had, I know it was primer and high primer in first grade.  So by the time I got to primer, I was six.  And then seven, by the time I got to the first grade, I was eight years old (laughter).  You know, that's, you know, they had very strict-- but it was good for me.  So by the time I got to second grade, I was reading on the seventh grade level because, you know, I had so many older sisters and brothers, and, you know, their books were around.  And I just, I guess learned.  Even though I was not in that grade, I knew the material cause I used to help my brother with his homework, with his math homework.  And I learned to read even before I went to school.  So that was really, really a waste of time for me when I was going through those three grades.  But I think it helped me in the long run.
Speaker 1: Why is that?
Speaker 2: Because I was mature, and I was able to learn things other kids in the class didn't learn.  So by, say, by the time I finished the eighth grade, you know, I was on the eleventh grade level because I read a lot, and so when I took the national test when I was in eighth grade and I graded--I scored eleventh grade.  And say, by the time I was, I went to the ninth grade, I as scoring a junior in college.  So you see, I think I became, I was much more mature than the children that were in the class, and I guess I learned more than they did.
Story_ID: 29800
Speaker 1: Tell me about the teachers.
Speaker 2: Okay, I had very good teachers.  I had all lay teachers.  There were no religious teachers in the Catholic school there.  And my first teacher's name was Cora Lee Avair (ph.).  And the principal of the school was her sister, Mildred Avair.  And I had Cora Lee for those first three years, you know.  And so when I went to the second grade, I had a teacher named, her name was Hearst (ph..  And she was, oh, she was very strict.  I remember I was in the second grade, and I couldn't spell the word "health".  And she was very upset.  So I remember my sister came into the classroom, and I was a little girl, and I ran up to her and asked "how do you spell "health"?" (laughter) because I was afraid I was gonna get a spanking because I couldn't spell "health."  So you see I remember that, and I also know how to spell "health" (laughter) from that time on.  She was, she was a very, very good teacher, excellent teacher.  And I had her in the second and third grade.  And then I had another lady in the fourth and the fifth grade was a bum teacher.  Her name was, I don't even remember her name, but she really didn't do [some chiming in background]--you need to turn it off.  I forgot to turn that phone off.  That's my cell phone.
Speaker 1: It's okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't learn anything from her because all she did was just talk about her family and talk about herself.  And so that was the end of my studies at St. Augustine.
Speaker 1: Were you involved in any extra curricula activities?
Speaker 2: (Sigh) we didn't have any (chuckle), you know, just recess.  We'd play games like baseball, hop scotch or whip--you know, everybody get in a line and you run and whiplash, what was it called?  Everybody would hold hands and they'd run and you would whip--the person at the end of the line would get thrown up in the air because of the force of everybody else running.  We'd play that a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So after the fifth grade--and well, let me ask you this.  Were there any teachers that did realize that you were learning at a more rapid rate, speed than some of the other children?
Speaker 2: I think they did.
Speaker 1: But there was nothing that they could do about that as far as putting you up in a grade?
Speaker 2: No, you know, they didn't have that many teachers.  You see, cause the woman teaching first primer, high primer and first grade and then the next one was teaching--every teacher taught two grades.  There were two grades in each class.  So that, you know, though they did do things like have plays and had plays.  I remember when I was six, and I was chosen to be in the Christmas play.  And I was supposed to sing something, and when I went to sing, they took me out because I couldn't sing (laughter).  And so they took my sister and put my sister in that place because I've always known from the time I was six that I couldn't sing (laughter).  So I was really torn up about that, but when I went home and told my dad [Alphonse Frank Deconge] about it, he said, you know, everybody has a gift.  You have a lot of gifts.  He said, you're very smart and you can do things that your sister can't do.  So we're gonna forget about singing (laughter) and just go ahead and do what you can do.  And so that was the end of that.  But I've never been able to sing.  I can't hold a tune at all.
Story_ID: 29801
Speaker 1: So, now, what school did you go to after St. Augustine?
Speaker 2: I went to Corpus Christi School in New Orleans [Louisiana].  It's in downtown New Orleans.  And that was a very good year for me because, for number one, it was the first year I ever saw a religious sister.  I had never seen them before, and so I had one.  And she was an excellent teacher.  And I was prepared for her because, you know, I was way ahead of--and she recognized how far ahead I was for the grade I was in.  So she pushed me.  She introduced me to reading which was a big gift to me.  You know, I had never--you know, I used to read comic books and read--I don't know if you remember, they had little books, the little fat books--
Speaker 1: Pocket books, little small--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I don't see them anymore.  They were real thick and short.  And I'd read those, but I had never read what's, the children call now, chapter books.  And the first book that she gave me to read, what was the name of that book, but I forget the name of it.  But I fell in love with reading.  And I think that was a big, big gift.  She also taught me how to diagram sentences.  No matter how long they were, I was able to take the sentence and dissect it and put it in a diagram.  And that has helped me tremendously.  So she gave me things to do that was way above what the rest of the kids were doing in the school.  And I only spent one year at Corpus Christi under her.  But I can say, it was a very, very good year for me.
Speaker 1: You said that this was the first time that you actually saw a sister or a nun.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, um-hum.
Story_ID: 29802
Speaker 1: What was religion like in your home before that time?
Speaker 2: We were a very religious family, very religious, say prayers every night, and everything was based on religion in our family and grew up like that.
Speaker 1: And you grew up Catholic?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm cable crown (unclear) (laughter).  I was baptized two weeks after I was born, and everybody baptized two weeks after they were born in the family.  And at that time, we went to mass every Friday at school, and we went to confession once a month.  So it was a ritual cause we went to church every Sunday.  You know, we never missed church.  We always went to church.  And my mother [Adina Rodney Deconge] was a very prayerful person.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your communion and confirmation?
Speaker 2: Yes, I remember my communion very well.  I made my communion, of course, when I was seven.  And I remember the day, you know, dressed in white and all the things that go with first communion.  I remember it quite well.  And I do remember also on Holy Thursday, we always had a procession in church where the priest would take the sacred host and he would put it in the monstrance (ph.), and they'd walk around the church.  And I remember being a flower girl in that, throwing flowers for the priest to walk on when he was--I remember all of that.
Speaker 1: And what do you remember about confirmation?
Speaker 2: I made my confirmation while I was at Corpus Christi, and I was away from home.  My sister, Alberta [Deconge], was the one who made my dress and took care of me when I made my confirmation.  So that's when I made it in New Orleans at Corpus Christi.
Speaker 1: Do you remember--was there a bishop that came for your confirmation?
Speaker 2: Yes, Archbishop Rumble was the Archbishop of New Orleans when I made my confirmation.  He was there.  He was, he was archbishop in New Orleans for, I'm sure a good twenty, twenty-five years, yeah.
Story_ID: 29803
Speaker 1: So after Corpus Christi--you only stayed there for one year--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and then where do you go next?
Speaker 2: I came back to Baton Rouge [Louisiana], and I went to St. Francis Xavier Catholic School.
Speaker 1: That's right, and tell me about St. Francis.
Speaker 2: Well, it was a very good school.  It was a two-story school with big, long steps going up, very poor.  When I went there in the seventh grade, we were like fifty-six kids in a little bitty room.  And my seventh grade teacher was not very good.  She couldn't control the children.  I don't know who could control the children with fifty-six children in that small room (laughter).  But anyhow she--and that's when my reading paid off because that's what I did.  I read all day.  There was a store called Dalton in Baton Rouge.  And they would lend books for twenty-five cents.  So I'd go there and get me a stack of books and all day long, while she was trying to control the classroom, that's what I did.  I read the whole day long, and didn't know what was going on in the classroom.  And that was the only year that I have gone to school that I didn't make good grades cause I wasn't doing the work.
Speaker 1: And you were a little older in the seventh grade too so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was--
Speaker 1: --you were about fourteen?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  I must have been thirteen or fourteen, yeah.  And so, yeah.  I think it did me a lot of good to do all of that reading because I guess I gained knowledge that I would not have gotten otherwise.
Speaker 1: And what about the library system?  Was there a library that you could use?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't ever remember going to a library.  We couldn't go to the library in New Roads [Louisiana] because it was white.  And I don't remember--the school that I was in, it didn't have a library.  And when I came to St. Francis Xavier, I don't remember a library, and I'm sure there was one.  But we weren't introduced to it.  So the, most of the books that I read were books that I bought or that I borrowed from this--they had a library, the store had a library, but I don't know whether we didn't go to the library because it was segregated.  I don't have any remembers of the library until I got to high school.
Story_ID: 29804
Speaker 1: What about music?  Was music in your life at that time or were you listening to music or the radio?  What was going on (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had a lot of, we had phonographs.  You know, it was the time when all the big jazz--we bought a lot of records, and we did a lot of dancing at home (laughter).  And, you know, at the school, and particularly, at St. Francis Xavier, they used to have dances for us to go to.  When we were in New Roads [Louisiana], it was mostly Zydeco.  People used to play those little, it's not a guitar.  I guess it's a fiddle.  You know what Zydeco music is?
Speaker 1: No audible response.
Speaker 2: It's, it's a--it's not jazz and it's not country.  It's between the two of them.  And they had a special dance, you know, the Zydeco dance.  It's like a two step, it's between a two-step and a Polka.  And, you know, we did a lot of that, and of course, when we got older, we also had, you know, the music of the time.  You know, we played it at home, but as I said, we did not frequent any public place.  Whatever thing we had was at home or, you know, like cousins and stuff.  We didn't go out a lot when we were in New Roads for sure.  And then when we got to Baton Rouge [Louisiana], we didn't go out a lot.  We was restricted on movies.  We could to the movie only on Sundays.  And we couldn't go to movies on weekdays.  The only thing we had was a radio and a phonograph.
Speaker 1: What did you listen to on the radio?
Speaker 2: We used to listen to those, they had series, you know, like the--what was one of them.  Music would go (unclear).  It was like a TV show, but it was on the radio.  You had to just listen to them.  I forget the names of them.  It's been so long ago.
Story_ID: 29805
Speaker 1: So, tell me about the next grade.  You go to seventh.  There your teacher is not very good.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Eighth and ninth grades?
Speaker 2: Then I went to the, eighth grade I had an excellent teacher in eighth grade.  So I picked up again and started to do work, but because I was, I guess head of the people, I, you know, I didn't really lose anything, not paying attention in the seventh grade.  But in the eighth grade, I did extremely well.  And that's when I told you, when I took the national examination and everybody was surprised because, you know, I didn't do very much talking in school and probably just answered questions when I was asked.  So they were surprised that, you know, I had, that I knew so much.  But the eighth grade was good.  Again, we had, oh, it was fifty, of children in that one classroom.  But teacher was extremely good.  So.  And when I went to St. Francis was this time that we only had one grade per class.  You know, before we always had two grades in the classroom.
Speaker 1: And your teachers at St. Francis, were--
Speaker 2: Most of them were--
Speaker 1: --they were religious, all of them?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, they had lay teachers there, but I never had a lay teacher in the classes that I was in cause when I went there, I went there in the seventh grade and there was a nun in the seventh grade and one in the eighth grade.  (Unclear) Sister Everett Vincent, very nice person, but as I said, she couldn't control the kids.  They used to play the drum, you know, and play drum under the desk, and when she'd go to that one, then it would move over there (laughter).  She had a chaotic classroom, but the teacher in the eighth grade was Sister Rosalina, and she was a very, very good teacher.
Speaker 1: So once you, they looked at your test scores and saw how well you were doing, did anything change (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) At that time, they didn't separate kids.  Everybody was just in the classroom together.  They didn't worry about whether they--
Story_ID: 29806
Speaker 1: So tell me what happens in the ninth grade?
Speaker 2: Well, in the ninth grade I went to St. Mary's Academy, and that was the time that I, you know, right after the eighth grade, I entered the convent.
Speaker 1: Tell me how you made that decision or how the decision was made for that to happen?
Speaker 2: Well, even before I even knew any religion, when I was still in New Roads [Louisiana], I used to tell my mother [Adina Rodney Deconge] all the time that I was going to be Sister.  I had never seen one.  And I guess, it was a seed that was planted.  So when I went to the eighth grade, the teacher there kept talking about, you know, it was genuine religious life.  And she was talking, she'd give pamphlets, and I guess I decided then that I would like to go.  But you have to remember when I was in the eighth grade, I was fifteen.  So, you know, I was--and my parents fought it.  Oh, they didn't want me to go especially my father [Alphonse Frank Deconge].  He was very angry that she even suggested to me that I go (laughter).  He was, you know, and when I went he didn't talk to me for a whole year.  He was just so angry at me for--
Speaker 1: Why didn't, what was his reasoning for not wanting you to go?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess he didn't understand what it was all about cause we didn't grow up around religious people, you know, I mean not religious people, but religious orders.  So he didn't, you know, it was like a mystery to him, why anybody would want to go.  And he just thought it was a dead end for me, so he--and I regret that because he died the next--you know, he did reconcile with me before he died.  But he died very, about a year after that he died with a heart attack.  So I was just seventeen when he died.
Story_ID: 29807
Speaker 1: So tell me more about the process.  What is the process?  What did you have to go through to become a part of the order?
Speaker 2: Well, the very first year I went there, it was a, they called a postulancy.
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-nine [1949].  And during that year, it was, like an orientation.  You know, you took classes, studying what the religious life is all about.  But at the same time I went to high school.  I was in high school while I was, you know, they continued my education.  So I went to St. Mary's Academy where I finished, you know, eventually, I finished.  The second year that I was there, we could not take any secular studies at all.  It had to be all religious studies.  We had to study the bible, the Canon law, all the things that you need to know to be a religious--you couldn't read any secular books.  It was all religious for a year.  And then after that year, then I went back to school for the rest of the time.  You know, I was a regular student at St. Mary's.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the religious classes were being held where?
Speaker 2: In what we called the Navishia (ph.).  It was a part of the county where just those training to be religious, lived, and in that area they had classrooms and all of that where they, you know, they held the classes.
Speaker 1: So the first year you were living there--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --and going to St. Mary's?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: So you would commute back and forth?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was in the same--
Speaker 1: Area.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, it's the same complex.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: It was, the Order had a-- it was more than a block where the school was and the convent was and the Navishia.  It was a big complex with a courtyard.  I don't know if you've ever been in the French Quarters where the buildings are all the way around and the yard is in the center, that's the kind of place it was.  It was right on Orleans Street, one block from the Cathedral in New Orleans, right in the middle of French Quarters.
Story_ID: 29808
Speaker 1: Now, you talked about the Order.  Tell me what the Order is and--
Speaker 2: Well, that--
Speaker 1: --give us some history too about the Sisters?
Speaker 2: The Order was founded in 1842.
Speaker 1: Tell me the whole name of the Order.
Speaker 2: It's the Sisters of the Holy Family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it was founded in 1842 by Henriette DeLille, and she's been up for canonization now.  She was beatified, she will be beatified in October.  But it was during slavery time.  And she was a quadroon--I don't know if you know what a quadroon is.  You know what a quadroon is.  And at that time, you know, quadroons were expected to be mistresses for rich, gentry of New Orleans (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yes, (laughter), and she rejected that life.  And she decided that she was not gonna do that.  So she gathered herself a group of people likeminded of herself, and they started teaching the slaves and taking care of the old people that were on the streets and that kind of thing.  And then they decided that they would try to become a religious Order because at that time, no white religious Order would take a black person.  It was just, and so what she did, she--there was a priest in New Orleans, Father Dablaunch (ph.) who helped her.  And the other Order that helped her was the Daughters of the Sacred Heart in New Orleans.  They helped train them and they took their first vows with them, and, then, of course, they had to get the certification from the church, and write their own rules and regulations.  So that's the way they, you know, they started out in New Orleans as a small group.  And they started right there in that French Quarters where the--and so, at first they had a school where they were teaching the young girls to cook and sew.  It wasn't an academic.  And then they took care of the elderly and they were teaching slaves, mostly religious things.  But then they grew, and they opened a home called the "Farm Home for the Elderly", which is still in existence in New Orleans and St. Mary's Academy, they opened.  And they started not just to teach the girls domestic stuff, but they started to teach them academic subjects.  And so that's how they grew.  And then, you know, because there were two religious Orders that were black.  One was in New York, the Oblate Sisters of the Providence.  They started even before the [Sisters of the] Holy Family.  But those were the only two Orders that black girls could go to.  And so then, you know, people started coming and that's the way it grew.  When I entered in '49 [1949] there were four hundred persons in the Order.  So it was growing very fast by that time.
Story_ID: 29809
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In the third year, I took my vows.  And all that time before, you know, I was just a candidate (laughter).  But in 1950, yeah--no, '52 [1952], I took my vows.  And at that time, even though I was not yet finished high school, they sent me out to teach.
Speaker 1: And in, I went to a place Breaux Bridge [Louisiana] (laughter), and in Breaux Bridge, would you believe that I had seventy-eight kids in the third and the fourth grade (laughter).  And I was nineteen, eighteen going on nineteen when I took that class.  But, you know, I enjoyed it.  It's the kind of place that I grew up with, you know, the kids having to leave school to go work in the fields.  And they spoke French.  Very few of the kids who came to school knew English.  And so we had to kind of just teach 'em, and they didn't even know their names in English.  So I was like an interpreter (laughter) because with my French background, I went there, and I could understand the kids so I was able to help the other people who were working there to know what the people were saying and the problems they were having.  And I was young, full of energy, and I taught those kids, don't--I never had seventy-eight at one time because they missed a lot of school because of the kind of work that they did, and it was like, you know, I had an average of maybe forty, forty-five kids in the classroom in the third and fourth grade.  And with the energy that I had, I taught, and we played ball.  We, we--I taught 'em folk dancing and everything.  So I really enjoyed being there with those kids, and that was in the years '52 [1952] and '53 [1953], to '52 [1952], '53 [1953].  But I was there just one year.
Speaker 2: And Breaux Bridge, where is that located?
Speaker 1: You know where Lafayette [Louisiana] is?
Speaker 2: No audible response.
Speaker 1: Um-hum, it's maybe thirty miles from Lafayette.  It's a French place.  It's--I don't know how much French they speak now, but at that time, everybody spoke French in Breaux Bridge.  The children, as I said, they came to school, and they didn't know English.
Speaker 2: These were Creole children?
Speaker 1: Well, no, when you say Creole, they're not Creole the way I was.  They were not mixed in the sense of black and white.  But they grew up in Cajun territory, and, you know, some of the kids had no white blood in them, but they still spoke French (laughter).  You know, they just grew up speaking French because that was the custom.  And I remember my dad [Alphonse Frank Deconge] used to call people who didn't speak French, American [said with accent] (laughter).  And everybody else, you know, was different cause he would always said, you know, he'd tell us all the time, when you, if you're gonna go out with somebody, make sure they're French-based.  Don't go out with Americans (laughter) because he said they were brought up different.  And they had different values, and so that was the whole thing.  It wasn't a thing of prejudice, but it was a thing to go with people who were like you.
Story_ID: 29810
Speaker 1: So, okay, so you're there one year, and this is after you take your vows, but I wanted to talk more about preparation for taking the vows.  Did you have to do a temporary--I mean was there a period of time that you were a candidate, was that time given to make sure that this was something that you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So tell me a little bit about that, and then the vows, and what was that like, taking the vows?
Speaker 2: Well, we took what was called temporary, you know--well, those three years that I told you that I was preparing, we had to do a lot of studying.  We studied church law.  We studied all about the Catholic religion.  We studied Canon law.  It was very strenuous studies, you know.  We, even though I was in, going to school except for that one year, we had to, you know, had assignments, and we actually spent maybe two or three hours a day going to class also for that.  And it gave you the opportunity to live there and see what it was like, and they--of course, we had regiments of assignments.  They worked us half to death.  You know, we had to learn how to cook and clean and serve and tables and, it was a lot manual work too at the same time.  Then we took what was called temporary vows.  And you, they gave you three years with temporary vows.  And during that time, again, you had time to decide whether you wanted to stay there because you didn't take permanent vows until three years later.  So, you know, you get, it was a period of time where you really had to learn if you really wanted to be there or not.  And nobody forced you to stay there.  You could have left anytime you felt like leaving, you know.  It was not something that was compulsory.  You did it because you wanted to do it.
Speaker 1: And you decided that you wanted to do this because of the service or--
Speaker 2: And I was happy there, I was happy there.  I really was.  I got to know a whole lot of people.  I enjoyed the work that I was doing, and it was a way--I guess I grew up there, you know.  And the kids were asking me about my teenage years.  I told 'em I didn't have any teenage years.  I didn't have any crisis because I was too busy, you know.  I was grown when, by the time I made the decision, even though I was just fifteen, I was not, you know, I was not a fifteen year old.  You know, I had made that decision, and it was--I didn't know anything about teenage crisis.
Story_ID: 29811
Speaker 1: So, after you come back from teaching those children for a year, what happens next?
Speaker 2: I was sent to another place, a place called Donaldsonville [Louisiana].  And I stayed there two years.  I was teaching the sixth grade, and I only had twenty-two, which was a big difference from when I had the seventy-eight.  And I really, really enjoyed that.  I was in, the school was, dilapidated, but it was in a separate part.  I was in the part of the school that had a stage, you know, in my classroom, and that just suited us fine because we were separate from most of--we did, one of the things, you know, I taught public speaking with the kids, and we did Shakespeare on the stage.  So we had a wonderful time.  The kids really, you know, I enjoyed doing that with them.  And so I was right, actually teaching reading, but we weren't doing the reading.  We were actually performing and teaching them how to stand up and express themselves.  So the, I had a very good year with them there.
Speaker 1: Were these children different from the ones at Breaux Bridge as far as them being able to come to school on a full-time basis?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were full time, yeah, cause they, most of those kids were not from farming families.  You know, their families worked in different types of--
Story_ID: 29812
Speaker 1: So what happens next?  You're there [Donaldsonville, Louisiana] for two years.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  Then after I finished there, and I was--it was '55 [1955], that's a year.  Then I went to Seton Hill [University, Greensburg, Pennsylvania],  to study for my Bachelors degree.
Speaker 1: So what year did you actually graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: I think it was '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: Had anybody in your family gone to college before you?
Speaker 2: Yes, my sister [Laura Deconge], right before me went to college.  She graduated, and then I was the next one and the two younger ones and me all, we all finished college.
Speaker 1: So what made you decide to go to college?  You're already teaching, so you have a career.  You're in the system.  You have, you've taken your vows, and--
Speaker 2: I would have never been satisfied had I not gone to college (laughter).  I loved learning.  I loved learning.  Even now, I love learning.  I just, it's always something that you can learn.  And when I went to Seton Hill, it was like a child with a room full of candy.  I just couldn't take enough courses.  I just wanted to learn everything that I could learn.  I always took twenty-two to twenty-four hours, even though it was in my subject.  You know, I just loved to--you know, I took, I had a double major in--
Speaker 1: Which was?
Speaker 2: --Mathematics and French.  And I had three minors.  I had English, History and Psychology.  I was just a person who just loved to know, what was, you know, I just loved to know.  I'm still like that.  I'm always curious about knowing.  So I would have never been satisfied not to have gone to college.
Speaker 1: And Seton Hill was chosen because?
Speaker 2: Well, at the time, I don't think I would have ever gone to Seton Hill if I had not been a religious because Seton Hill had an arrangement with the Sisters of the Holy Family that, you know, they would educate them from scholarships.  So that was the only reason I got a chance to go.  Had I not been in the Order, I don't think I would have never, because it's a very excellent school.  And they only took valedict--the first three people out of every class, you know.  They were very choicy.  It's a prep school.  They were preparing people either to be professional writers or some type of professional in music or those who were going on to do further study.  It was a very strenuous and very difficult thing for me.  It was the first time I really struggled with learning because of the--so many of the girls were so far ahead of me, you know.  Some of them came there as writers.  They had already published.  They were professional musicians.  And so it was very difficult for me, but I was able to stick it out.
Speaker 1: So they were lay people that attended this school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Story_ID: 29813
Speaker 1: Tell me who some of your classmates were?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: At that Seton Hill [University, Greensburg, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, goodness.  I just saw them about last year this time.  I don't remember cause it's fifty, it was fifty years before I even went back.  After I graduated from there, I never went back.
Speaker 1: So you never kept in touch with anybody, okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't, I left there angry.
Speaker 1: Tell me why?
Speaker 2: Because, as I told you, it was a very difficult school.  And I really worked hard and took courses, and I made the honor roll and I should have graduated with honor because of the, my record.  But I never did.  They kept finding excuses why I shouldn't graduate with honor.  You know, one time it was because I took too many courses.  I was so far ahead of the other kids.  And that was not my fault if I took the courses.  Then the next thing they told me that I wouldn't graduate with honor because--unless I made an "A" on my comprehensive examinations, which I did.  And then the next thing they told me was it was because only so many kids could graduate with honor from there.  They had a specified number that could graduate, and then all the rest, you know--it was a lot of different excuses.  But the end result was I did not graduate with honor.  So I was, I was really very upset because that's a permanent record.  You know, even though they gave me awards and, you know, on the side.  But that's not something that goes on your record.  I wanted it on my record and I never did get it there.  And so I was upset when I left--I left there the day I graduated.  And I said I was not going back there because the school, some of the people at the school were very, very prejudiced.  And they didn't think that anybody black could do anything, and they told me that in so many words.  And several of the teachers I had there, one was a psychology teacher.  And she came in the classroom one day and said that there were three classes of people in the world.  And every, she was calling it at that time, every Negro belonged to the lowest class.  And so when she said that, I raised my hand, and I said, well, where did you get the information that every Negro is in the lower class?  And she said, Magmanus wrote it.  I said, well, I turned to the girl next to me, I said, who is Magmanus?  And she said, that's her, that's Magmanus (laughter).  And so I challenged her in the classroom, and then she kept telling me, "we'll talk about it later".  I said, no, I said, I'm the only black in this class, it was Negro, I said, in this class, and there are other, fifty girls in here.  And I want them to hear what I have to say.  But she would never let me say it.  And that was, oh, she, from that day on, she made sure that I didn't get the grades that I was supposed to get, you know.  But I met that kind of thing there at Seton Hill.
Speaker 1: Was that the first time that you had to deal with prejudice?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because I'd never been in a white school before.  This was my first--I've gone, I'd been to black schools all my life.  And I didn't have that kind of, I had challenges with kids being smarter than me and that kind of thing.  But I never had anyone to tell me that I couldn't do what I knew that I could do.
Speaker 1: So actually that experience pushed you to be--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --even better.
Speaker 2: That's right.  The more they told me that--when I first, I think I was in my freshman year, they called me in and told me that I couldn't major in mathematics.  I needed to do something like home economics or that kind of thing.  I said, I came here to do this and I'm going to do it.  You see, but you see, I was more mature than most of the girls that were there because by the time I got there, you see, I was in my twenties, you know, about twenty-one, twenty-two.  So I was able to stand up for myself.  If I had been an eighteen or nineteen-year old girl, I don't think I would have been able to.
Story_ID: 29814
Speaker 1: So was there anything else about the school [Seton Hill University, Greensburg, Pennsylvania] that you remember that you want to (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, I loved the school because as I said, I could not have gotten a better education if, anywhere else.  And I did have friends there, you know.  I made friends, though I don't remember who they were (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was there a particular nun that was influential in your life?
Speaker 2: Yes, the one who taught me mathematics.  She's still living.
Speaker 1: What is her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Sister Deborah.  I don't know her last name, but I saw her, I went to see her, but she didn't recognize, you know, edges on Alzheimer's, so she didn't remember me.  But she was exceptionally good and understanding, and I could always go to her, and learned a lot from her.
Speaker 1: What made you so interested in mathematics?
Speaker 2: I was always good in it.  When I went to high school [St. Mary's Academy, New Orleans, Louisiana], there was a teacher there, and her name was Esperance, and she recognized that I had the ability.  So she would make me go to class at 7:00 o'clock in the morning so I could take two courses of algebra in one year.  So in, not one year, but one semester.  So I did two courses of algebra in that one year, with doing that extra hour every morning.  So I was able, before I finished high school, you know, I maybe had five courses of math.
Speaker 1: So that would be amazing that they would tell you that you couldn't major in mathematics.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What was Mother Claudia?
Speaker 2: Mother Claudia was the superior general of the Sisters of Charity at Seton Hill.  And she was the one responsible for giving us the scholarships.  And she was a grand lady.  She was a wonderful woman.  I would say she was a saint.  She was so kind and motherly and whenever you had any problems, you went to her.  She was exceptionally wonderful to us.

Speaker 1: Well, during this time and, of course, you know, we're talking about a time during segregation, the fact that you were in school and kind of in the confines of the convent, besides the incidents with the teachers, were there any other incidents that you might have experienced because of segregation?
Speaker 2: Things people would say, stupid things, you know.  I remember when I was doing my student teaching.  I had to do, I did my student teaching in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  And I guess you'd call it the master teacher's personnel, working under.  She came, we were standing on a balcony way up on the third floor.  And she was, she said, you know, I went to a school where, that was segregated, she--I mean integrated.  And she said I saw this girl in the bathroom, and she was washing her face, a black girl.  And I said to her, "if I had black skin like you, I wouldn't wash my face" (laughter).  You know, that was a really stupid thing to say.  But it just vexed me so much and she was standing, you know, with her back to railing, and a thought came to me to push her over that balcony (laughter).  And she must have realized I was thinking something cause she hurried up and moved away from the balcony (laughter).  But I mean people would, you know, they just said stupid things sometimes.  And, you know, why, it was ignorance because they had never come in contact with black people before.  In my, when I was at Seton Hill [University, Greensburg, Pennsylvania], I was the second black person that went there.  The first girl was a very rich black girl from Palestrina, Texas.  And, you know, she was there, but she was like two years ahead of me.  And, but I never saw anybody else there until maybe when I was senior, another black girl came in as a freshman, but she didn't stay.  So, you know, it wasn't--I don't think it was malice.  I think it was ignorance, you know, not knowing anything about black people, you know.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: But the girls were nice.  On the floors, you know I lived on a floor.  We had floor captains and, you know, we'd get out in the halls and play, and I'd work with them.  And I did a lot of tutoring while I was at Seton Hill.  The kids, you know, who were having trouble, and so--
Speaker 1: What was your name when you took your vows?
Speaker 2: Mary Sylvester Deconge.
Speaker 1: And how do you choose a name?
Speaker 2: I didn't chose it.  They gave it to me. I hated it (laughter) because the day I got it, all I could think about was Sylvester the cat, you know, (laughter), that black cat.  So I really, I didn't, (laughter) I didn't like that name at all, but I kept it.  I could have changed it.
Speaker 1: How do they come up with names?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  That's something I have never known.
Story_ID: 29816
Speaker 1: So you graduate from Seton Hill [University, Greensburg, Pennsylvania] in 1959?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you're about twenty-six years old, is that right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: So tell me what happens after graduation?  Well, I, of course, I went back to New Orleans [Louisiana].  And I had a very, very hard time adjusting because I had been at Seton Hill with the food bland and the temperature never got any higher than eighty.  You know, that was hot when it was eighty.  And then I went back to New Orleans, and I almost died, you know, with trying to get used to the heat again and trying to get used to the food again.  The food was making me sick because it was so spicy.  And so it took me that whole summer just to get adjusted, you know, back to being in Louisiana.  And then that fall, that's when I went to Holy Ghost School in Opelousas [Louisiana].  And I was in there for two years, and then I went to LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] to get my master's in 1961.  And then I went back to Opelousas for a third year.
Speaker 2: Tell me about Opelousas?
Speaker 1: It's a very, it's very--I loved it.  I loved the people there.  It's a--
Speaker 2: Was it a (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --it's a French, black background.  A lot of, not the young people, but the older people all spoke French.  You know, I don't know what it was that people who spoke French didn't want their children to learn it because they thought it was a disadvantage for them to know French.  It would keep them back.  So they lost a lot of their culture by not having their children follow in their footsteps.  But it's French background and a lot of Creole people.  They were a mixture though.  There were people there who were not Creole, but they had the same background as I said, you know.  And I loved teaching there.
Speaker 2: And you taught French and mathematics or just mathematics?
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah, I taught mathematics and French, three courses of math and two courses of French.
Speaker 2: And so after the second time being there, you were there for how long?
Speaker 1: Just one year.
Speaker 2: One year.  And then?
Speaker 1: I went back to New Orleans [Louisiana] and I went to Tulane [University, New Orleans, Louisiana] to start my doctorate and I went--
Speaker 2: Had you gotten your master's yet?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got my Master's and I went to LSU in '61 [1961], '62 [1962].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In between the time that I was at Opelousas.
Story_ID: 29817
Speaker 1: And your experience at LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Terrible, terrible, terrible, racists.
Speaker 1: Now, this is the time heating up with civil rights.  So tell me about what were some of the experiences there?
Speaker 2: I can't tell you of any good experience I had there.  But the teachers were insulting.  I remember one little guy.  He was very short.  He'd come in and he'd sit on the desk and throw insults at everybody.  He wasn't just insulting the blacks.  He was insulting everybody that was in the classroom I think.  And he would ask you--he asked me one day what I was here, why, he said, "Why are you here?"  And I looked at him, I said, well, I'm here to learn, but I'd like to know why you're here cause I said, you sure are not teaching.  And, you know, and he, oh--but I did report him.  You know, I went to the chair, not that it did any much good because the chair was just as bad as the rest of them.  He was a, he'd come to class, the chair of the department, and I'd say there was maybe thirty-three people in the classroom.  And each day, he would come, and he would take his chair and he would pull it up like to you.  And he would talk to just that one person in a voice that the rest of us could not hear what he was saying.  And then he was--he'd smoke a pipe, and he was blowing that smoke (laughter) in this person's face for the whole hour.  And he didn't have a textbook.  He didn't write on the board.  And we were completely lost.  And if I had not had the background that I had had from Seton Hill [University, Greensburg, Pennsylvania], I would not--I had to go and learn this thing on my own, get the books and read and do.  He gave us one exam and that was the final exam.
Speaker 1: What class was this?
Speaker 2: It was a class in N dimensional vector space (laughter).
Story_ID: 29818
Speaker 1: Your background at Seton Hill [Greensburg, Pennsylvania] prepared you to be able to take this because how did you learn this material?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  I had a course similar to that at Seton Hill.
Speaker 1: Tell me what this course is about?
Speaker 2: A vector is a--I have to explain.  I'm gonna try to explain it so you understand.  It's related to physics and mathematics.  It's a line segment starting at one point and pointing in a particular direction.  And those vectors are in space or in two dimension or three dimensional space or N dimensional space.  And they tell you something about an object, what direction it's going, how fast it's going, that type of thing.  And so it has properties.  And what you're studying is the properties in two space, three space and N space, depending what N is.  And that's the kind of thing it is.
Speaker 1: So you had to learn that on your own.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).  I can't say I learned it all together on my own because I had somebody to, but those persons who had never had a course like that, they didn't know what to do, you know.  You can't just pick up a book like that and start reading it if you don't already know something about it.  So.
Story_ID: 29819
Speaker 1: And, and these classes were preparing you for what?  What did you think you would do once you got your master's?  Did you wanna continue to teach or was it something else?
Speaker 2: Well, I wanted to continue to study.  It was always my aim to get my Ph.D. because the reason I went to LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], I wrote a letter to National Science Foundation, you know, telling them what I wanted to do and why I wanted to do it.  And they gave me a grant to go to LSU.  So that was the reason why I went to LSU, to study, and I don't know.  It was always something that, you know, I wanted to go on.  So in order to--I know going from Seton Hill [University, Greensburg, Pennsylvania] to a Ph.D. program would have been a little steep because there's so much.  And you get--when you go to study for a Ph.D., you have to know how to study on your own because you don't get that much from the professors.  You know, they'll give the introduction, but the studying and the understanding and all of that, you either get by studying alone or studying with other groups of people.  And so you have to learn how to do that because I don't care what you get a Ph.D. in, you're not going to be able to do it unless you're an independent studier.  And so, you know, that was my aim to be able to do--and I got introduced to that at Seton Hill because in some of my math classes, that's what we did.  They gave us a book, gave us assignments, and then you have to get it on your own and present it.  So that was a good thing for me, you know, not having to depend on a teacher all the time.
Speaker 1: Anything else about LSU?
Speaker 2: Well, all together, you know, I was glad to get away (laughter) because I actually went there to study for a Ph.D., and this was, this was the beginning.  But it wasn't just the fact that I was black.  It was the fact that I was a woman too.  Mathematics has always been a man's subject, and when you, a woman gets into it, you know, they don't expect you to be able to do it.  And so there was, there was a white woman there who was studying for it.  It took her seven years to get her Ph.D. from LSU.  And when I saw her, I said, there's no way that I'm gonna study seven years to get a Ph.D..  So I left there.  After I got my master's, I left.
Speaker 1: And so you got your master's in?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-two [1962].
Speaker 1: Sixty-two [1962].
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And your master's was in both--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Mathematics and French.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 29820
Speaker 1: So in, did you go straight into the Ph.D. program or you--
Speaker 2: No, I took off a year, and I taught at a junior college in New Orleans [Louisiana].  It was called, it belonged to the Sisters of Holy Family.  I taught math and French at the junior college from 1963 to sixty--the academic year, '63 [1963], '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: And the name of the school was?
Speaker 2: DeLille.  It was named after--
Speaker 1: After (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Mother DeLille, yeah, who was the founder of the Order.
Speaker 1: So it started as a junior college?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Is it still a junior college?
Speaker 2: No, they have closed it.
Speaker 1: Oh, they've closed it.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Do you know how long it was open?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  It was open the whole time I was at Seton--I mean I was at St. Louis [University, St. Louis, Missouri].  I was there four years.  I came back and taught there two--maybe about eight years it was open.
Story_ID: 29821
Speaker 1: And so in 1964 is when you go to St. Louis University [St. Louis Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went to Tulane [University, New Orleans, Louisiana] first.
Speaker 1: You went to Tulane?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In '64 [1964]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went there, starting the summer of '64 [1964] and took classes there all summer.  And I didn't stay there because when you study at Tulane, you have to major in a particular subject in mathematics you know.  You either have to do algebra, topology or real analysis, and that's not the kind of degree that I wanted because I was not gonna be teaching graduate school exclusively.  I wanted a degree that would give me a cross of all the subjects that I, where, you know, got a job, I could teach in any of those areas.  And so I did not stay at Tulane.  And that was, it was the Fall of '64 [1964] that I went to St. Louis University.
Speaker 1: And tell me how that experience was different from LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: I had no problem as far as anything racial at St. Louis U.  The problem that I had was because I was a woman.  When I first went there (laughter), you know, I was like, in my class of forty-three people, I was the only woman, though as I stayed there, more and more women came.  But I can't say that it was a bad experience for me because I think-- it's a Catholic school, number one, and it's a Christian atmosphere, and I enjoyed being there because not only did I study my areas which is French and math, I also got a very rich, enrichment in my religion also.  They had programs there that, you know, you could go to that, liturgical music and special kinds of philosophy and theology classes that you could attend.  So it enriched me as far as my religion was concerned also, well, I would say.
Speaker 1: Was it common knowledge that you were a nun or sister?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was dressed in the whole outfit (laughter).
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about that.  While you're attending things outside of the school?
Speaker 2: Even at LSU, I wore my habit, yeah, and so everybody knew.
Speaker 1: So you wore a habit from the time you took your orders all the way --
Speaker 2: Until I left.
Speaker 1: Until you left, you always wore a habit?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Story_ID: 29822
Speaker 1: Well, let's get a little history on the habit and what is all involved and what are the pieces of the garment just so that we have the--
Speaker 2: Okay, it was black, for one thing (laughter).  And it was long all the way to the floor, and it was made out of serge which is a type of wool.  And you had the dress which was long sleeved, and on top of the dress, you had a cape with buttons down the front.  And then you had this thing you put on your head.  When I first went there, it was a white linen thing you put on your head, and you tied it in the back.  And on top of that, you had a bonnet that you put on top of that.  So it was hot, especially in the summertime, it was extremely hot.  And I wore that, that particular one until 1965, I believe, from '49 [1949] to '65 [1965] was the one that I wore, you know, with the bonnet.  You saw the picture.  And then at that time, they changed it, and they got rid of the bonnet, and they had, instead of the bonnet, they had a white piece that run across your forehead with the veil on top of that.  But all the rest of it was the same.  And then about a year later, it went to short.  We wore ordinary black dress of any style, and we didn't have this piece across.  We just had the veil with a little white thing on the top of it.  And most people their hair was showing.  And so that was the last one that I wore.
Speaker 1: A lot cooler.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, it's just amazing that you had a lot of problems dressed as a nun, you know what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: It was hot, especially this time of the year.  Most people, when they hit the inside, they took it off, you know.  They didn't wear it mostly on the inside.  It was just when they went outside.
Story_ID: 29823
Speaker 1: So, okay, while you're at St. Louis University [St. Louis University], and you're working on your Ph.D., you write a paper or you have to write a dissertation.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you wanna talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was the most difficult part of (laughter), okay, number one, one of the difficult things is to find a topic.  You have to do a lot of research, make sure that you don't write on something somebody else has already done because if you do, it's null and void.  It has to be original, so that you have to do a lot of research and make sure that no one else in the literature has published anything on what you're writing about.  And number two, you have to find somebody congenial enough to work with because you can't do a dissertation in mathematics without an advisor and somebody to guide you along the way.  So the first two or three years I was there, you know, I started doing research as to what particular subject that I was gonna work in.  And I decided that I would do it in modern geometry, which is on lattice theory and vectors, vector spaces and that kind of thing.  So I found, I got--I changed, I put my major in geometry, and I started taking, concentrating on more geometry courses than the other courses.  And I found a person, Raymond Freeze, whose style of teaching was the same as I told you.  He'd give you the material, and you'd have to work it out and then present it to the class.  It was more, he would make each of us learn the material on our own.  And so I chose him for, as my director, and then I had a hard time narrowing down the topic to one thing that I could work on.  And so what I decided to do, I studied lattice theory, and it was one dimensional lattice theory.  And I decided that what I would do is take the one-dimensional lattice theory and bring it to two dimensional where I would define distance and all of this on the lattice.  And so I had to devise the postulous and the theories and prove, for number one, that it was an empty space that I was talking (laughter) about.  And then, you know, go through and develop from the theories on the first dimension, bring 'em all up to the second dimension.  And that's what I did, define a metric space on the two known lattice.
Speaker 1: And how long did it take you to complete this?
Speaker 2: You wouldn't believe it.  I'd say six months (laughter) all together.  When I read it, I actually got the topic, and worked on it day and night for six weeks--for six months.  I started it, I took my comprehensives that summer and passed them.  And that frees you to start working on your dissertation.  But the six months before that I had to come home because I got sick.  I was very, very sick.  I had to be rushed to the emergency, and--
Speaker 1: Where were you when this happened?
Speaker 2: I was in St. Louis.
Story_ID: 29824
Speaker 1: Well, one night, I just, you know, I got really sick and started vomiting and couldn't stop.  So they brought me to the University [St. Louis University, St. Louis Missouri] hospital.  And I was there, I was hemorrhaging and they couldn't stop the hemorrhaging so I had to get a hysterectomy.  But by the time I got the hysterectomy, I was so weak because I had been vomiting for months, you know, maybe a couple of months before I got it.  And so I had lost weight, I was a hundred and four pounds by the time.  And when I got out of the hospital, I was just too weak to stay in school.  So I went back to New Orleans [Louisiana] for six months to recuperate.  So when I went back, that's when, you know, I took my comprehensive cause I was supposed to take my comprehensive while I was sick, you know, the time that I was sick.  So then I took it the following summer and passed it, and then I started writing my dissertation in '67 [1967].  By January of '68 [1968], I had completed it and I, after I completed my dissertation, I went home.  And I just traveled back and forth, you know, making corrections, you know, to my--I had three advisors who read it and made corrections.  And then they would send it to me, and I'd do the corrections, and then I'd go back to St. Louis [Missouri] to meet with them again.  So that was the, from January to June of '68 [1968].  And then I graduated in June of '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So it took me about three and a half years to get my doctorate.
Speaker 2: Your doctorate.  That's not an unusually long period of time.
Speaker 1: No, it's usually longer than that.
Speaker 2: Longer than that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because a lot of people get stuck on their dissertation.  That's the hardest thing because you're doing it on your own and a lot of times, yeah, a lot of times, you're up all night.  You know, when I would do--I still do this.  I solve my problems when I'm sleeping.  And if I'm able to wake up and write it down, then when I get up the next morning, it is the solution.  Sometimes I'd work on something all day long and couldn't get it.  Then I'd go to sleep, but in my sleep, looked like I would just do it from step to step to step, and then if I could wake up--most times I did, I would write it down.  Then I'd go back to sleep, and the next morning I'd have my solution.  But I've always done it, even when I was in college and I had a problem that I couldn't solve, most times I'd solve it in my sleep.  And I still do that.  If I go to bed, and I'm worried about something, I solve it in my sleep some kind of way, so when I get up the next morning, I have some type of solution.  But it doesn't, it's not good because you don't get much sleep (laughter).
Story_ID: 29825
Speaker 1: So, once you get your Ph.D., where do you go to work?
Speaker 2: I went to work at Loyola University in New Orleans [Louisiana].  And I taught major subjects, and I taught the majors.  I did not teach people who were just taking mathematics for mathematics sake.  I was teaching mostly in the majors in math.  Every once in a while, I'd teach a calculus class, and in that calculus class were students who were not majors, but most times, I was teaching the majors.
Speaker 1: Now, during that time, you published three papers.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You wanna tell me about those?
Speaker 2: Well, they were, my dissertation wasn't published.  So what I did, I took parts of my dissertation and amplified them and published it as a paper.  And I was, when I published it, somebody else used it to do their dissertation cause they brought, they defined the topology on my metric space.  And so I guess somebody else has used it since then.  I don't know.  But it's a very abstract area of mathematics.
Speaker 1: And how long do you stay at--
Speaker 2: At Loyola?
Speaker 1: At Loyola.
Speaker 2: Three years, from 1968 to '71 [1971].
Story_ID: 29826
Speaker 1: And you decided to transfer to where?
Speaker 2: I was recruited at Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  They came to Loyola and recruited me to come to Southern.  And I was glad to come.  I loved Loyola because you, you know, you always love a class with bright people in it, you know, majors, particularly, math majors there were very motivated to do their work.  But I was not meeting very many black people, you know, there at Loyola.  So I decided, when they gave me the opportunity to come to teach, I wanted to give something back.  So I came to Southern and that's when I, you know, I started teaching there.  And I wind up staying here twenty-seven years.
Speaker 1: Who was the, I just wanna step back a minute.  Who was the president at St. Louis University [St. Louis, Missouri] while you were there?
Speaker 2: Father Reider, Reiner, R-E-I-N-E-R.  He was a Jesuit priest.  I forgot his first name, but he is very, he's known because he's written oodles of books, you know, and I imagine he's dead now.  But he was the president there when I was--
Speaker 1: So when you--
Speaker 2: Carl, his name was Carl Reiner.
Speaker 1: Carl.
Story_ID: 29827
Speaker 1: Now, when you transfer or are recruited to Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], who was the president there?
Speaker 2: [G. Leon] Netterville.  And I came right in the midst of the big riots on the campus (laughter).
Speaker 1: And this was 1971.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the riots were in '72 [1972], the spring of '72 [1972], and I got there in '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: Right, now there was an incident that happened in '72 [1972].  Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, two students were killed.
Speaker 1: What happened there?
Speaker 2: I don't know exactly what happened, but it started with a group of students having complaints.  And they wrote up a long list of things that they wanted done at the school, and started, you know, demonstrating.  And it wasn't a very large group of them, but then they started wearing combat fatigues and wearing combat boots.  And then they began to disturb the classes.  You know, they would--I remember I was teaching one time, and they were quiet with it cause I, you know, I was at the board explaining something.  And when I turned around, they had about thirty-five of them and they were this close to my face (laughter).  And they were all in the classroom lined up and demanding that we stop teaching.  And I told them, no, I was not gonna do that.  I said, you have the right to demonstrate, and these students have the right to go to class if they wanna go to class, and I have the right to teach.  I said, now, I said, that's what wrong with people today.  Everybody wants everybody to do what they're doing.  I said, you--I'm not telling you not to demonstrate, but I'm gonna ask you not to come in my classroom anymore, you know.  And I'm not gonna call the police or anything.  I'm just gonna ask you to walk out of my class the way you came in and leave.  And I'm gonna continue to teach my classes.  I said, you can't scare me from not teaching it.  But this went on.  And it intimidated a lot of people.  So what happened is, they went to the president's [G. Leon Netterville] office and did the same thing they did.  They just went in there and just crowded in and took over the building.  And the president called the sheriff.  The sheriff came up there, and they were supposed to be shooting blanks, but they haven't found that particular deputy that had bullets in his gun.  So when the started coming out of the president's building, they started shooting these blanks at 'em.  It was like tear gas, I guess it was, but somebody in that crowd had bullets, and they killed two students, killed them right, walking--they were unarmed.  And they killed them right there on the lawn in front of the--and so after that happened, they closed the school down because they were afraid of, because the students started getting violent.  They were trying to burn the registrar's office down and all.  So they closed the school down and posted guards so nobody could get on the campus.  And it stayed closed for a whole semester, and that was that, the year that I got there because that was in '71 [1971], '72 [1972] that--and that was the big, big thing.  And then they expelled a lot of the students who took part in that, and they couldn't come back on the campus.  They barred 'em from going to any school in Louisiana.  So a lot of them had to go out of state to finish their education.
Story_ID: 29828
Speaker 1: Was this really a first-hand, a first time that you had a first-hand or was a witness to a first-hand incident because we went through--we're actually in '72 [1972], but we went through that civil rights era with Martin Luther King [Jr.] and his assassination [1968] and President [John F.] Kennedy and Robert Kennedy.  What were your thoughts about civil rights then?
Speaker 2: I was in St. Louis [Missouri] when Martin Luther King was killed, and I did take part in the march, an eight-mile march, really from the river all the way to the zoo, which I still have calluses under my foot to prove it (laughter).  I did take part in that, but all the demonstrations before that, I was not in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] when the students went to sit at the counters and all of that.  I was not, I must have been in school some place.  I didn't take part in that.  You know, I didn't--this was my first hand--except for that march in St. Louis, I had never taken part in the civil rights thing until that time at Southern.

Speaker 1: Do you remember when John F. Kennedy was assassinated?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was New Orleans [Louisiana].  That's the year I made thirty years old.  And I remember the very moment cause that's the year that I was teaching at DeLille [a junior college] in New Orleans.  And I remember the moment, the day that he was killed because, you know, the people came running to say that he had been shot.  It was like--we were in, we had just finished dinner, and we were in the process of cleaning up and washing the dishes and stuff when the news came that Kennedy [President John F. Kennedy] was shot.  And so we all left and we went to watch the television to see, you know.  And it was a shocking moment, really.  I remember the very instant, the very time that it happened.  That was, I guess in our time we had never heard of anything, shooting, anybody shooting a president.  And I'm reading the book right now about the assassination, that they're trying to prove that it was the government that did it.
Speaker 1: What's the name of the book?
Speaker 2: It's a documentary.  It's "The End--it's not incomparable (unclear), it's one word "Incomparable, the Life and Death of Kennedy" by Douglass with two 's's.
Story_ID: 29830
Speaker 1: Okay, so we're back in 1972, and you published another paper at that time.  Do you wanna talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yes, at Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] the students were having difficulty passing the national teachers' examination.  And the chancellor at the time, or it was the vice chancellor at the time, asked me to write a book that they could use in that course to make, you know, get the teachers ready to take that examination.  And that's when I wrote that--I took the, I didn't teach any classes for about six months.  And I wrote this book to help them to pass the exam and all of the examinations were comparable to the kind of examination they went to take.  And the teachers used that book to teach the students in the College of Education so they would pass those examinations.  That was the book that I wrote at that time.
Speaker 1: And so in, how, and then what happens the next year in '74 [1974]--'73 [1973], '74 [1974]?  You're still teaching?
Speaker 2: Yes, I taught, at that time I was teaching graduate and undergraduate courses.  I was associate professor in mathematics and in 1982 I was promoted to professor of mathematics.  So mostly during that time I was just teaching, working on committees and that kind of thing at Southern.  And it was in 1986 that I became chair of the Department of Mathematics.
Story_ID: 29831
Speaker 1: Well, let's go back a little bit to 1976--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, '76 [1976].  Yeah, 1976 is when I decided to leave the Order of the Sisters of the Holy Family, and I took a job at Rockwell International in Anaheim, California as a technical staff IV, where I was working on the Poseidon submarine--
Speaker 1: Okay, but--
Speaker 2: --for the Navy (laughter).
Speaker 1: First, let's go back to and tell me how you made your decision to leave the Order and why?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess there were a hundred reasons why I left the Order, but the main one was, I was sick.  In 1963, going back, I was, I started having problems with my joints and being extremely tired, and I went all through graduate school and all of those things with it.  But by the time, in 1976, I guess I was doing a lot of things, and I got extremely tired.  I'd go to bed tired.  I got up tired.  I went, you know, I was just sick.  So I went to the doctor at that time, and he advised me to take some time off, he said because if I would get a serious illness, he said I had no defenses cause I was weighing like a hundred and ten pounds and as tall as--I was very, very thin and not feeling well.  So he told me to take a year off, which I did.  So during that year, and I took leave from Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana]--I didn't quit.  I took leave, and I got, as I said, I applied for this job at Rockwell International, and I went there.  And it was a completely different type of job.  I didn't have all the extracurricular stuff because at the same time that I was teaching full time at Southern, working on all these committees, I was the vicar general of the Sisters of the Holy Family.
Speaker 1: Will you tell me what that entails?
Speaker 2: Well, it's like the second highest person in the Order.  And I had all these responsibilities stuff of going from place to place and solving problems in the Order, like a bursar general taking care of the purchases, keeping up with the money and all of that besides my full-time job at--and every weekend, I was traveling, leaving here going to New Orleans [Louisiana] to do that job.  And I just think it was too much for me.  So, you know, I decided to take leave, and that's when, as I said, I took an entirely different kind of a job, you know, working in industry and not having all these extracurricular things to do at night and all that stuff.  I had every intention of going back.  But after I left, you know, the people in the Order was very upset about it, and they kind of rejected me.  And when I would try to go back there and have some interaction with them after twenty-six years, you know, it wasn't a very good experience.  So I just decided I wouldn't go back because I felt that if I had gone back, it would have been the same kind of thing, you know, that I'd get all stressed, and at the time, I had Lupus all this time and didn't know I had it.  And it was hard to diagnose and it's still hard to, and it wasn't until, you know, I began to swell up and all of that, that they really began to look in and that's when they found out that I had Lupus and all of that.  So I said, in the interest of living, you know, I would let some of the things go because I was doing too many things at one time.
Speaker 1: How long had you been--I know you were with the Sisters for twenty-six years, but this particular position that you were holding, how long--
Speaker 2: Four years.
Speaker 1: Four years.
Speaker 2: I had been in it four years.
Speaker 1: And was this a volunteer--
Speaker 2: Elected.
Speaker 1: It was an elected position.  And who were the people who--just the other superior nuns or--
Speaker 2: Well, there was a superior general who was ahead of me.  I was second in the Order, and the Order is run by a council.  I was, of course, a member of the council.  There were five council members, and we met, you know, to solve problems in the Order.  We actually ran the Order.  And any time there was anything to be done, you know, since the Superior General was mostly, you know, running all the other mundane things and the vicar general did a lot of the running back and forth to solve problems and look into situations.  And so I was driving sometimes to Houston [Texas] on the weekend, doing stuff there, coming back here, working all week, and then drive somewhere else the following weekend.  And it just got to be too much, I think.
Story_ID: 29832
Speaker 1: So this is in 1976 that you decide to leave the Order.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And you stay in California for just one year?
Speaker 2: Just one year.  I worked `76 [1976] to `77 [1977].  It was too different.  I was used to a more flexible life (laughter).  You know, when you're teaching, you don't have to stay on the job all day long.  You know, you go in and you do your duties, and you could leave.  And you have--it's a different type of a life.  I wasn't used to staying in the office (laughter) from 8:00 to 5:00 every day with one half hour off for lunch.  It was boring to me, you know.  And I, even though I liked the work, I just didn't like the whole atmosphere of it.
Speaker 1: And what was the work?  I mean it was some, it was wave analysis or--
Speaker 2: It was research.  It, the Poseidon is a, was at that time, a secret mission.  You had to get clearance to work on.  And it was the submarine that they would put in the waters--it's not secret anymore, so I can talk about it.  And the purpose of it was to get under there and listen to sounds.  And it had to differentiate between the sounds of water lapping, fish sounds, drilling sounds and actual danger sounds.  So we had to put a, a kind of--we were working on the filter that you put on the submarine to filter out all of these other signs.  So if a danger sign came, it would know, you know, this is what they should attack.  And it had sixteen warheads on it.  So that was the project that I was working on.  I was working on retracing, you know, this (unclear) I was telling you about that goes down in the water, to find, you know, different ways that it worked, and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: So you enjoyed the work, but just not the hours.
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 29833
Speaker 1: So after a year, what do you do next?
Speaker 2: I came back to Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], but I came back as a lay person (laughter).  That was my first, 1977, I didn't, I wasn't wearing a habit, but I came back.  And there was no reaction from the people.  I guess they knew me well by that time, and so it was just like coming back to work that I had taken leave from.
Speaker 1: And was there, I mean being relieved from being a Sister and having to wear a habit to just having a regular normal life--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, I bought this house.
Speaker 1: Was the adjustment, was there any period of adjustment that you had to go through or was it just all, you know--
Speaker 2: No, you're--I was out a whole year [out of the habit] by that time, you know, cause I was, when I was working at Rockwell [International, Anaheim, California], I was working as a lay person (laughter).  And so I had a whole year's experience before I actually came back over here.
Speaker 1: So the transition was fairly easy?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're back at Southern, and you're teaching, and what happens next?
Speaker 2: Well, it was uneventful between, you know, '77 [1977].  I worked from there, and again, up to 19--[phone ringing or bell]--nobody ever comes here.  Hold on.  Roy will see who it is. (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION):
Speaker 1: So, in 1982, you're promoted as a professor of mathematics.  What happens in 1983?
Speaker 2: In 1983, in August, I was married to Roy Watson.
Speaker 1: Tell me how you met.
Speaker 2: I had taught him way back in 1977, and didn't keep in contact.  And then it was the summer of '82 [1982] that I met him again, and he asked me on a date.  We went on a date, and then we got close and we, we decided to get married a year later.
Speaker 1: Was this something that you thought that you would ever do being that you were a nun for so many years of your life?
Speaker 2: I never thought about doing that cause, you know, I was satisfied being single (laughter).
Speaker 1: And you had a ready-made family when you married?
Speaker 2: Yes, I really never had contact with his family because he had four children.  Two were living in California.  At the time we were married, the daughter had young children and so we helped her.  You know, they were having difficulties.  I'd buy their school clothes, but I never actually had them here, you know, I just would help them a lot of times.  And we did that for several years, and they lost contact, Roy kind of lost contact with the kids.  And so we didn't do it after that.  But then he had two children in New Orleans [Louisiana], and I was closer to them.  I got very close to his daughter and her children, and I had them here like during, for summer vacation.  They'd stay here the whole summer, and we got, you know, I got very close to her and still keep very close touch with her.
Speaker 1: What is her name?
Speaker 2: Her name Devon Sadette (ph.), but they call her Dee-Dee.
Story_ID: 29834
Speaker 1: So tell me what happens next.  Now, I know you're involved in other projects, and you were the director of Louisiana State, statewide--
Speaker 2: Systemic Initiatives program.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me about that.
Speaker 2: I wrote, while I was chair, I got involved with the state in writing a proposal to the National Science Foundation to train middle school teachers in the state of Louisiana.  And I worked on the original project with, what was his name?  But anyhow we were funded for ten million dollars to work on this project.  And I wrote a proposal then to the systemic initiative cause they had the money, to start a program at Southern University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana] to train thirty teachers.  We had a six-weeks workshop in the summertime, and then we met them every Saturday to teach them to be more retroactive in their teaching instead of staying at the blackboard, you know, to put the children and groups and use hands-on material and all that kind of stuff to teach the kids.  And so I ran that program for ten years.  Each summer besides my charity, I had teachers come in every summer, and we did a lot of good because the students began to improve.  A lot of the people we had in that program, they didn't--they were getting like two credits, two graduate credits for the courses that they took.  And some of them, most of them went back and got a master's.  And they began to move up in their school things.  So, and after ten years, I turned, I gave the grant over to one of my coworkers because I was leaving the math department at that time to run this other program that I wrote a grant to, the Department of Energy to, for five million dollars to bring fiber optics on Southern's campus and to connect the three campuses.  You see we had a campus in New Orleans [Louisiana], one here [Baton Rouge, Louisiana], one in Shreveport [Louisiana].  So what we wanted to do was to connect them by the internet, to--so that in one place, all the records would be kept.  And, you know, and it was, the pay, the pay would all come from one center.  And so I spent three years with that, hiring a person who was in that particular area to do the plans.  But I was just supervising it.  Not only that, I updated on the campus many of the computer labs, got new computers in, set up labs in biology and mathematics and chemistry and computer science, set up labs for the kids with that money.  And I ran, I was over the, they called it the Center for Minorities in Science, Engineering and Mathematics.
Speaker 1: And I just wanna go back to say that it was in 1986 through '95 [1995] that you were the chair--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --you served as chair of the mathematics department at Southern.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  And it was in 1995 that I left to go run this Center for Minorities in Science, Engineering and Mathematics.
Speaker 1: So then you left there, that was 19--
Speaker 2: I was at Southern still--
Speaker 1: Still, but you left that position (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: but I was (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Story_ID: 29835
Speaker 1: Okay, and so it was 1998 that you--
Speaker 2: I retired.
Speaker 1: --retired.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and after that program [Louisiana Systemic Initiatives Program] was finished, I didn't feel I wanted to go back to my position as chair and teaching the mathematics.  So I decided that I would retire because that's the only job I had open after I did that, and I was just, I didn't wanna go back to teaching any more.  So.
Speaker 1: But you still were very, very busy, even--
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: --though you say you were retired, but you weren't really retired.
Speaker 2: No, because I was, I retired for six months and then they called me back, asked me would I come and be associate vice chancellor for academic affairs.  So I did that.  I went back in '98 [1998] and '99 [1999], and I did that and worked those two years.  And then I went back, they asked me to go back to the chair of the department.  Something happened to the chair, to the chair of the department, and they asked me to go back and run the mathematics department for a year.  And I did that.  And just as I was completing that, I was asked to go in as interim vice chancellor for academic affairs.  And that was my last job (laughter) at Southern University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: So finally--
Speaker 2: So in 2004, I left there.
Story_ID: 29836
Speaker 1: Now, I wanted to talk about your involvement with Alpha Kappa Alpha because did you, where did you pledge and when did you pledge?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty three [1983].  My officemate when I first went to Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], her name was Emma D. Jenkins.  She as an AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha].  And she, you know, she kept talking--I had never heard of AKA (laughter).  You know, not having gone to any black schools, I didn't know anything about the sororities and fraternities.  But she was the head officer.  She wrote the newsletter.  And I would see her doing it and I asked her about it, and she asked me did I want to join.  She would sponsor me.  So I did.  It was in 1983, and so I've been with them twenty-seven years, active as a member.  I was, I held several offices.  I was the treasurer for a while.  I was the basileus, the president, for four years.  And during those four years, I renovated the house.  They bought that house across the street over here, and it was an ordinary house, and I had the--got a loan and added to it.  I added a big room that can hold 250 people in it and renovated the, made it handicap accessible.  And I finished that in 2002.  And the important thing about it, I got that loan on my name (laughter).  And they just paid it off.  I am a happy person (laughter) cause I've been having that big note.  You know, they were paying it, but it was on my name which caused a few problems, you know, when you're trying to do things for yourself.  But they finally paid it off in March of this year.  And so they have a place free and clear.
Speaker 1: And what is the chapter name?
Speaker 2: Gamma Eta Omega.  We have about two hundred members in it.
Story_ID: 29837
Speaker 1: I'd like you to, I mean we're at the point where you're retired, but I want you to talk about what you think was your greatest contribution in mathematics.  What was it and explain to me how you felt about that particular project?
Speaker 2: My greatest contribution are the scholars that I sent out from Mathematics.  A lot of people that I taught, even in high school, have gone on to get master's and Ph.D.s and they keep in touch with me.  I think I touched a whole lot of people; never had any children of my own, but I have hundreds of children (laughter) that--and I, the thing about it, even people who didn't pass my courses, you know, they still will come back and I think they see me as a person that has influenced their life.  And I think that's my--my biggest happiness was when I was teaching and I'd see the light go off in somebody's eyes.  And they finally understood what I was talking about.  I didn't do that much in terms of adding to the knowledge of Mathematics itself, or being great researcher.  I was never a great researcher, but I think I touched a whole lot of people's lives and changed their whole attitude toward mathematics.  I think that was my big, my greatest contribution.
Story_ID: 29838
Speaker 1: You also said that you liked to learn and I'm sure one of the ways that you enjoyed learning was traveling.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your travels.
Speaker 2: Well, Roy [Watson] and I have traveled, I think we've gone to about five continents.  We started traveling shortly after we got married.  I think the first big trip we took was 1990, and that was in the United States.  We took the car and then we went, from here, we went to Atlanta [Georgia], and we traveled straight up from Atlanta all the way up to Maine, stopping and, you know, in places.  I had a lot of friends along the way, so we stopped and visited friends all along (laughter) the way.  And then after we went to Maine, we came back to New York and we went straight across the state of New York and went to Niagara Falls.  And then from there, we went to Pennsylvania and went down from there through those states, back to Louisiana.  So that was the first.  But the next year we went on a cruise.  We went to St. Thomas [U.S. Virgin Islands] and that group of islands and Venezuela, Aruba [southern Caribbean Sea], St. Martinique [eastern Caribbean Sea], Grenada [southeastern Caribbean Sea] and all of those places.  That's, was the next trip that we took.  And the following year, we went to Hong Kong [China] and Thailand.
Speaker 1: What was that experience like?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was a wonderful experience, especially--I particularly liked Thailand.  I liked the people and I liked the food; didn't like Hong Kong; people are rude and ugly in Hong Kong, but it's a beautiful city, but, you know, the people are not nice in Hong Kong, you know.  Then the next year, we went on a Mediterranean cruise.  We flew to Nice, France and took a boat at Nice and went all around the Mediterranean to Florence [Italy], and in that area, Barcelona [Spain], and that was a wonderful cruise.  It is so beautiful.  If you ever get a chance, go on that cruise.  It's, the waters and the places are so beautiful.  And we went to the castle. You know--.
Story_ID: 29839
Speaker 1: Have you ever been to Africa?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went to West Africa.  We went to Togo.  We went to Ghana and the Ivory Coast.  Togo is a very, very poor country, and the people, the soldiers particularly, in that country, you know, they're so used to bribing people, you know.  So we spent-- it's beautiful cause we stayed at a hotel right on the ocean.  And the hotel was nice, the food was excellent, but it's heartbreaking to see the people.  They cook on the street, you know, and I didn't see anything beautiful there except for that cathedral.  They have millions and millions of dollars in the cathedral there, but then we got to Ghana, Ghana is a wonderful country.  I liked the people.  They're progressive.  They remind me of the people, the black people here.  That's the kind of people they are.  And while we were there, we went to the slave castle and saw where all the slaves were sent to the United States from the ship.  We, I went to [W.E.B.] Dubois' house and the place where he lived and saw all of his degrees and artifacts and everything there.  And we met some real nice people there.  And I thought it was exceptional because the people who are a little bit well-to-do have servants, and, you know, like the woman who was our tour guide, she was telling us about, you know, she did her work, but somebody was at her house while she was working, doing the cooking and the cleaning and all of this.  And I wouldn't say that she was a rich person, but, you know, they had this caste system over there, like classes of people.  They bring 'em out from the country, you know, and they are so happy to get there because I guess it's much better than they would have had when they were in the country.  And then the Ivory Coast, I was surprised how big the city, that city is.  It's like a New York, you know.  Even though I didn't get to see too much outside of the city of--what was the name of that city, but it's a very big city with all of the department stores and everything that we have here, very nice hotels.  And the thing that I thought was exceptional, everything was run by blacks.  I didn't see any (laughter), the hotel was the--everything was run.  I didn't see any white people except guests in those places.  So, that was--and people in the Ivory Coast spoke French, and I was very happy cause I was able to use a little bit of my French (laughter), while I was there.
Story_ID: 29840
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about any awards that you're most proud of or anything else that you might be proud of as far as your civic organizations that you have belonged to?
Speaker 2: Well, I received several outstanding awards in the last four years.  And as I told them, maybe I was getting ready to die because I was receiving (laughter) so many awards, one after the other.  Well, the award that I received in 1996 was the Distinguished Alumni Award from St. Louis University [St. Louis, Missouri].  That was a great honor to me because it's not given lightly.  And I went there, and I was very proud of that award.  And then here at Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], I received in 2006, I received an award from Southern, one of the Hall of Fame awards from Southern, and I thought that was a great honor too, my not being a graduate of Southern, and, you know, and have only worked there cause mostly they give those awards to, you know, their alumni.  So I received that award, and then the same year, I received an award from the College of Sciences as an Outstanding Leadership award from them, and that same year I received the Outstanding Chair award from the mathematics department.  So I got those three awards in the same year.  And then, of course, last year I received the Distinguished Alumni Award from Seton Hill [University, Greensburg, Pennsylvania] after fifty years.
Story_ID: 29841
Speaker 1: How did you feel about that when they [Seton Hill University] contacted you?  I mean you left there not feeling very good about the school and then after fifty years they want to give you an award?
Speaker 2: All of the people who influenced, who caused that hardship were all dead practically (laughter).  And I was honored, and I was happy to go back there [Seton Hill University, Greensburg, Pennsylvania] because it is a beautiful place.  They influenced my life, you know, my going to Seton Hill changed my life because I think without that degree from there and the knowledge that I got from there, I would have never been able to accomplish some of the other things that I accomplished because you have to realize that, who I was.  I came from a very poor family, even though, you know, I had the ability.  But the opportunities that I received, I would not have been able to do on my own.  So I'm appreciative to the Sisters of the Holy Family because it was number one, through them that I was able to go to some of the places that I went to.  And I am appreciative to Seton Hill because I don't think I could have received a better education even if I had gone to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  It was a very enlightening thing.  And the strange thing about it, I don't tell this to too many people, but I had never been out of the state of Louisiana before I went to Seton Hill.  And when I walked into Seton Hill, and I went, I had the premonition that I had been there before, I knew where everything was.  And it was a very eerie experience, and so I always wondered, I said, well, maybe somebody in their pre-life went there (laughter) cause I would have no other explanation for that, cause I know I had never been there and had never been to the state of Pennsylvania until then.  So that's something that's always been in, that it maybe was a predestined sort of thing for me to go there cause everything that led up to that, my being kept back three years so that I was old enough to go to the convent.  And, you know, from there going to Seton Hill, I would have--you know, if I had finished eighth grade when I was thirteen, my life would have been different cause there's no way my parents [Alphonse Frank Deconge and Adina Rodney Deconge] would have let (laughter), they would never let me get out of the house.  They fought me even when I was fifteen, and of course, I was almost sixteen when I went.
Story_ID: 29842
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I would like to be known as a good person, a religious person who just happened to be fortunate to go where I went.
Speaker 1: If you had to send a message to the future generations because you have to realize this is gonna be available for many generations, what message would you send to the future generations?
Speaker 2: To learn as much as you can learn.  Never say that you know too much cause there's always something that you can learn, and knowledge is something that no one can take away from you, nor--and it will take you places that nothing else can take you to that place.  And that's what I preached every year to my students when I met them.  Before, when I sat down, they knew that I was gonna give them a lecture on the value of being knowledgeable, not so much as getting degrees, but being knowledgeable cause there are a lot of people who have never gotten degrees, but they have the knowledge and understanding to get where they need to go, and they should make it a part of their life, and make them a person who, whom other people are very happy to be around.  You don't want somebody with knowledge to use it to stand on, be a drum major and have, you know, look down on other people.  That's not what real knowledge is.  Knowledge, if you have the right kind of knowledge, makes you an equalizer person who people enjoy being around.  And make them feel, no matter who they are, that they are important.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we haven't talked about that you would like to talk about?
Speaker 2: Not really, not really (laughter).  I think it's been a very good interview, and you're a very good interviewer.
Speaker 1: Oh, thank you very much.  Well, I'd like to thank you from The HistoryMakers for taking the time to share your story because it's very important for the future generations that we have people like yourself of great achievement that we can look to for inspiration and encouragement.  So thank you for sharing your story.
