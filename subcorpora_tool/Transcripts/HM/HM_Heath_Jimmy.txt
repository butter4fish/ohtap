Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: Oh, now, I think he was born in Wilmington, North Carolina, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what we have here but, okay.  So it may not have been Wilmington but it was, and that's a pretty good guess.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So once again like what do you know about your ancestors on your father's side?  I mean, are there any stories about what they were doing or any stories that go back to slavery or Reconstruction or, or life in Wilmington?

Story_ID: 649397
Speaker 1: And their, my father [Percy Heath, Sr.] had a, a brother, half-brother, named Willie Johnson, and that was my uncle.  And Willie Johnson was a magician.
Speaker 2: Really.
Speaker 1: He was one of the first black magicians.  He also worked at, in a cotton gin downtown in Wilmington where he was like a boss over the rest of the black guys, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But Willie Johnson, and he was also like a, a superintendent or something in, in the church.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So--
Speaker 1: 'Cause when my brother--my father, the only time he goes to church when he played the clarinet.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) He played the, played the clarinet in a, in a marching band but he wasn't a churchgoer.  My mother followed her mother who, her nickname was Fatsy [ph.], which were Ella Wall, her nickname was Fatsy.  And Fatsy would be in church and, and she'd take Arlethia [Arlethia Wall Heath], which my mother changed that, I don't know how it became Arlethia from Lethia, but anyway they were church people.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And Uncle Willie was also, can, what do you call that, the, the kids in, on, in the church on Sunday.
Speaker 2: Oh, in the Baptist church, I think they call it Baptist Training Union or something.
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.  He was in charge of the kids.  He wasn't the, the, the preacher.  Sunday school.
Speaker 2: Sunday school, okay.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: He was the head of the Sunday school in the Baptist church in Wilmington, North Carolina.  But he was a very smart guy 'cause he would, he would do things with his hands, he would juggle five or six balls and he could make things disappear and everything 'cause he was a magi- he belonged to the magician's society so.
Speaker 2: Did he?  Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.  So and, so, so did he belong to the, now, the magician's society, was that a integrated group?
Speaker 1: I, I'm not, I'm not sure, but I would think it was because I never seen him with any African American magician in his company, but I never seen him with white guys either but I know he, he got his training from somebody and he could do all these tricks.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I wonder did, did he ever work with somebody that was a magician before, or?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  I, he worked in the cotton gin as a boss or something (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it's interesting, that, that's interesting that, he wouldn't be the first, he's, he's, there were other black magicians but there weren't that many but--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I know the first professional magician in America was a black man named Richard Potter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Who was up in, he was in New England.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In Connecticut or Massachusetts, I'm--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I'm thinking, Richard Potter.  There's a, just like Harry Potter but Richard Potter there's a--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --his house is a state landmark there and there's information about him on the Internet.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's some, some--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --irony to this because my brother, Tootie [Albert "Tootie" Heath], married a Swedish woman in Stockholm [Sweden] in, in Jechteborg [ph.] and, and he lived over there, my youngest brother.  And he's got a grandson that's a amazing magician.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And I don't know how that got to be in the, in the family from Uncle Willie in Wilmington, North Carolina, to Stockholm, Sweden, Yents [ph.] is, his father was--which is one of my, Tootie's two boys that he had--
Speaker 2: You know it's--
Speaker 1: --in Sweden.  And one of them is, and this kid is amazing.  He can do some of the same stuff that I saw my uncle do and he was very young.  And he had gotten plenty of recognition in Sweden because he's so bright as a magician.
Speaker 2: Yeah there's a, it's interesting, I, I've often thought when I watch a magi- a, a musician--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --like a [HistoryMaker] McCoy Tyner--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --or watch you play the sax or Pharoah Sanders or somebody--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and just watch how fast the fingers move and how, you know, how strong the connection is between the mind and the body, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --when a good musician, you know, is playing, that I don't know, you know, it's prestidigitation as far as I'm concerned (laughter).
Speaker 1: It's magic.
Speaker 2: Yes, sir (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, I understand where you're coming from.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's like magic.
Speaker 2: It is.  It is.
Speaker 1: Spontaneity in, in music is magic.
Story_ID: 649398
Speaker 1: So your father played the clarinet--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --too; and he played in a Elks [Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks of the World] band, right?
Speaker 2: He, in a Elks band in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], in a marching band.  And he, excuse me, he would, he was an auto mechanic to support the family but he'd take the clarinet out of the pawnshop on Saturday and go to the rehearsal and play in the marching band and put it back in Monday morning when he go back to (laughter) the garage to work, you know.  He was, he loved music but he was taking care of it.  He was a good man.  He took care of, I mean, I can't understand how somebody could be raised without a father 'cause I didn't have that problem.  My father was always there.
Speaker 1: That's something (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the, and the, the guy at Pete's Pawnshop [ph.] on the corner of Federal Street in South Philly [South Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], he knew my father so well, I said to my brothers [Percy Heath, Jr. and Albert "Tootie" Heath] (unclear), I said, "Pop could put a, a brick in that clarinet case and he'd say, 'Put it over there Percy [Percy Heath, Sr.]'" (laughter) and give him twenty dollars or whatever.  He was, you know, he didn't even have to show the clarinet he knew him so well.  Of course, pop, you know, he was an honest man, and he would get it out the weekend and practice.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's amazing.  So--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --so this is, you're talking about, now you were born in 1926 and the events you're describing are basically taking place during the Depression; right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  This is during the Great Depression when money was scarce.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Well, we, we were on welfare for a little bit.  I remember being on welfare when they used to give us gingersnaps and cheese (laughter).  And that's how I got messed up with cheese (laughter) I guess and ended up later with a heart problem.  But, you know, they give us cans of beans and stuff with no labels, where we had to go and pick this stuff up in Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We went through some hard times but mostly my father is an auto mechanic and at work most of the time.
Speaker 1: Now he went, he's part of a generation, like this generation made the transition from typewriters to computers and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --cellphones and all that, he made the transition between driving a dray with a horse to being an auto mechanic.
Speaker 2: Well, no.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: That was his, what you call it, father--
Speaker 1: His father [Stuart Heath] drove a dray--
Speaker 2: --that was, yeah, was driving the dray and, and carrying stuff on it.  It's like, it's something that's like this and it's hooked on the back of the horse.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it would pull whatever they were taking, shipping, moving something from someplace to the other.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They call it a dray, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he certainly, he lived through that transition, he was born in 1898?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Cars weren't, you know, really--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --plentiful when he was born?
Speaker 2: No.  When he got into the car thing that was another period--
Speaker 1: It was a new period--
Speaker 2: --of his life.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It was a new--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --period for cars.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So, so he became a auto mechanic.  Did he specialize in a certain kind of car or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  There is a story that I don't know how true it is, but he worked for a man named Joseph Wolfson [ph.], a Jewish guy, W-O-L-F-S-O-N, Wolfson, in Philadelphia.  And my brother, Percy, being a little bit older than me, he said actually my father had the garage first and through some maneuvering Wolfson took over the garage, maybe when my father got on welfare or something, but there was some maneuvering where Wolfson took over the garage.  And I remember when my father used to, after he had a, a heart attack or something, he used to go up to the garage on the weekends and, and Joseph Wolfson would give him a check, but he treated him kind of strange, you know, he had to sit around, "Okay, Percy," you know, and they'd go working on cars and stuff, "okay, I'll be right there," you know.  So, I don't know if it's a fact but my older brother said that it was my father's garage originally and it was taken over by the Jewish cat.
Speaker 1: Okay.  May- perhaps during the Depression when the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he might have lost it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --during the Depression.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Some way.
Story_ID: 649399
Speaker 1: So you come from an entrepreneurial family.
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, a lot of--
Speaker 2: --my, my, my father, Percy, was, his mother was Mattie Anderson and she got married again, something, you know, they were all, I don't know how that happened but she married a guy named Oliver Fisher.
Speaker 1: Just sit back just a little bit 'cause you're out of the light.  There you go--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: All right.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Oliver Fisher.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: And he had a grocery store in Wilmington [North Carolina].  There was a, we had our own businesses.  They had banks, black banks in North Carolina.  They had, they owned, there was a gas station right around the corner.  See 'cause when I went to school in Wilmington, I was living with Mattie Anderson, my grandmother, and Oliver Fisher was a, had a grocery store that sold all the groceries to the black teachers at the black school.  So they all came to the, to the store, Fisher's Market [ph.].  They come to Fisher's Market and get stuff on credit.  And it was me and Uncle Willie Johnson and Grandma Mattie who could write 'cause Oliver Fisher could write nothing but a X.  He couldn't even sign his name, but he owned the grocery store and he got a new Buick every year.  He'd get the, when the new one come out he'd get him a new Buick (laughter).  And Oliver Fisher would be letting the, the black teachers at Williston High School [Williston School, Wilmington, North Carolina] have a bill and they get, when they get their check then they'd pay, so we had to keep the books.  And we were the ones that could write and read.  Uncle (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so you, so you kept books when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I helped, I helped 'cause, of course, Grandma Mattie was always there, it was her husband, her next, her second or third, I don't know.  But and Uncle Willie was there 'cause they lived next door, the magician Uncle Willie Johnson lived right next to, to Oliver Anderson--Fisher, and Mattie Anderson, 412 McCrae Street and 414 McRae Street in Wilmington, North Carolina.  This is before Michael Jordan and all that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, now, it was, one of the people we interviewed from Wilmington was General Togo West [HistoryMaker Togo D. West, Jr.] who grew up in Wilmington.  He's the one that told us about the black bus company [Safe Bus Company, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] and it was confirmed by (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh.
Speaker 1: --some other people.  So, I mean, what you're saying just kind of adds on to the fact that there was a strong black business community in Wilmington before--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --integration days, anyway.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, what--
Speaker 2: I think Raleigh [North Carolina] or Greensboro [North Carolina] or something is where the banks were, not in Wilmington, the black had a bank or something, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Had their own.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So, well, tell us about your, is there, well, is there a story about how your parents [Arlethia Wall Heath and Percy Heath, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You don't know it?  Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But they met in--
Speaker 2: Wilmington.
Speaker 1: --Wilmington, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 649400
Speaker 1: So they didn't particularly go to church or anything, that was a (unclear) that they did (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, Pop wasn't in no church.
Speaker 1: Did, did he have a position about it or he just didn't go?
Speaker 2: He just didn't believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He didn't really believe in it.
Speaker 1: Right.  Well, now this is, this is something, we, we don't hear of that much but I know it's true 'cause I, (laughter) I mean, I know people that don't believe (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but so many people always swear that they (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --they believe but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my Uncle Willie [Willie Johnson] did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: His half-brother.  But Pop he didn't care nothing about that.  When he--
Speaker 1: Do you think that, so did you grow up going to church at all yourself?
Speaker 2: Well, they made me go to church.  You know, I'd go to Sunday school and all that.  Sure.
Speaker 1: But who did you look to for, 'cause those who go to church they claim that you, they get their moral guidance from church.  And but, you know, did, did you have a, I suppose you, you got your guidance from your parents [Arlethia Wall Heath and Percy Heath, Sr.]; right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In terms of what to do?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Your ethics.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got married [to Mona Brown Heath].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, when I did get married, church, you know, the church man.

Speaker 1: Percy [Percy Heath, Jr.] is the eldest, right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: My sister, Elizabeth [Elizabeth Heath Reid].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now Elizabeth was a very beautiful lady and my father [Percy Heath, Sr.] catered to her on, if he didn't have but a few dollars he gonna buy her a new dress for Easter whether we got anything or not, but Liz was always, (laughter) babied, she was always, so.  Now he wanted everybody in the family to play an instrument so Elizabeth start to try to play the piano but when she met boys that was the end of the piano, she never did follow up on it and she was a beautiful lady and she just got hooked up with the guys (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Like, I can confirm, I saw her picture--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a little while ago when we were going through the pic--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --pictures and she was, was very pretty.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And like even a lot of the Jewish saxophone players that we hooked up with would come to our house, they wanted to hook up with Liz, you know.  But, but that was her thing.  So she got married twice, and had three or four children.
Story_ID: 649402
Speaker 1: But Percy was the next in line in the family, Percy, Jr. [Percy Heath, Jr.].
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: I used to have to tell him he was junior 'cause he was very domineering, Taurus the bull, my older brother.
Speaker 2: So you had to remind him that he wasn't your father [Percy Heath, Sr.], huh?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd say, "Wait a minute, you're junior, man, come on."
Speaker 2: Now there's a--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --there's a, now how many years separated you and Percy?
Speaker 1: Three.
Speaker 2: Three, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But he's also bigger than you, right?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: He's just a bit, he was a big--
Speaker 1: Well, he was almost six feet tall.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: I'm like my father.

Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Five three [5'3"], okay.
Speaker 1: No, my father was about 5'5", or 6".  He was small.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Percy was much bigger.  And, and my younger brother [Albert "Tootie" Heath] too.  But Percy was, we both went to school in Wilmington, North Carolina.  And Percy was so smart, he was the head of his class in Williston High School [Williston School], president of his class.  He was the president of the State of North Carolina High Y Club [ph.], whatever that is, you know.  And, and then when he graduated and he went to work with pop a little bit in the garage and he couldn't stand being around pop giving him orders, then he went to work down at Pennsylvania Railroad and the guys liked him and he was so smart, the, the, the guys who had the jobs would tell him, "All right, Percy, back that engine up."  So he was doing stuff that he never studied to do.  And then he gets in the [U.S. military] service and becomes a Tuskegee Airman and we went nuts.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause you have to pass a, you had to pass a test to be candidate for that, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We went nuts, man.  Me and my father we had to go everywhere Percy went, junior, 'cause he had on his olive pant- jacket, and them pink looking pants.  And the, and he would wipe his brim of his cap down to all the enlisted men jumping across the street in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], they were doing like this (gesture), and Percy said, "At ease, soldier."  He was a second lieutenant, you know, man, this was odd.  You know what that is like?
Speaker 2: Did, did he go to college?  Did, did, did Percy go to college?  Did he--
Speaker 1: (Shakes head).
Speaker 2: He didn't, so he applied--
Speaker 1: He, he went in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) without even being in college?
Speaker 1: He got drafted.
Speaker 2: Oh, he got drafted.
Speaker 1: And, and he went in the Air Force [U.S. Army Air Force; U.S. Air Force].
Speaker 2: And they--
Speaker 1: And he made the, the, the Tuskegee Airmen.
Speaker 2: Oh, so he was drafted as an enlisted man, but then took the test and went to Tuskegee Airmen?
Speaker 1: Tuskegee.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he became a second lieutenant, not a, yeah, there was a lower position you could get without being a second lieutenant.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But he was second lieutenant.
Speaker 2: Well, I just wanted to emphasize that you have to, you had to apply for that because it meant that you were going to become an officer, if you were a pilot you had to be a second lieutenant.  And so he, I mean, he, he had to know enough (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, he was--
Speaker 2: --or as much as a lot of--
Speaker 1: --Percy was very sm--
Speaker 2: --college graduates and--
Speaker 1: He was very smart.
Speaker 2: --college students at the time 'cause all--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the other Tuskegee Airmen that we've interviewed were college students, who became--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: So Percy becomes a Tuskegee Airman?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: And, I mean, and that was pride, man.  In Philadelphia, man, that was pride to see, "Hey, Percy, where you going, man?"  He be going to see one of his girlfriends (laughter), he'd have on all that stuff.  "Hey, can I go?"  "No, man, stay home." (Laughter) And, and my father said, "Hey, Percy, listen, let me go with you uptown," 'cause we, you know, that was a rare thing at that time.  You know, to live through all of this stuff that people are honoring Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and the killing of Kennedys [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy] both of them, and Malcolm X, and all that stuff, to live through this stuff, man, it's amazing.  This is not no hearsay.
Story_ID: 649403
Speaker 1: We were talking about Percy [Percy Heath, Jr.], your, your brother.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, now he's three years ahead of you.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tuskegee Airman (unclear)--now, you're in high school [Williston School, Wilmington, North Carolina], right, when he's a, he's a Tuskegee Airman; right?
Speaker 2: Well, I had just gotten out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I got out of high school in 1943.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So let me go to, now you've got a, a younger brother.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He's like nine years younger?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  And his name is Albert, right?
Speaker 2: Albert "Tootie"--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Heath [Albert "Tootie" Heath].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: T-O-O-T-I-E, Tootie.
Speaker 1: And how, where, how did he get the nickname Tootie?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandfather, Sandy Wall, he would give everybody one.
Speaker 1: Well, what's--
Speaker 2: Everybody had, Percolator he called Percy, you know, so he called him Tootie.
Speaker 1: What did they call you?
Speaker 2: Skookum [ph.].
Speaker 1: Skookum?  How, really?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You got to ask them when, I got to ask him when I see him (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: Skookum and Tin Lizzy [ph.].
Speaker 1: That was your sister [Elizabeth Heath Reid]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Sandy Wall, all he would do is sit around, and he's married to Ella Wall, my maternal grandma.  Oh, he used to listen to Babe Ruth on the radio, that's all he was crazy about, baseball.  Babe Ruth and all that before we even integrated the baseball world, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so Tootie, now he, he played, he's a drummer.
Speaker 2: Tootie, yes, Tootie started out in high school in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And he came up around the time of McCoy and Bobby Timmons--
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] McCoy Tyner, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --Kenny Barron and all the younger guys after me and Coltrane [John Coltrane] had gone on the road.  'Cause Coltrane moved to Philly also from North Carolina.  And so Tootie, in high school he wanted to play the drums and somebody else had the drums and had already spoken for it so he grabbed the trombone and he start playing that trombone.  And my sister made him put the trombone down 'cause she cut him up, said "Hey, man, get that thing out of here, all that spit running out the bottom," (laughter) "get that thing out of--," (laughter).  So Tootie was playing, he finally got to get on the drums and that was his, where he wanted to be from the beginning.  He became a drummer.  Then he got with Yusef Lateef, the flute player from Detroit [Michigan] and stayed with his band for a while and he learned how to play the flute and he ended up playing drums with everybody.  Tootie played with Monk [Thelonious Monk] a couple, a little bit.  He played with Miles [Miles Davis] a little bit.  He played with Dizzy [Dizzy Gillespie] on a TV show.  He played with the, the Jazztet with Benny Golson and everybody.  He played with Bobby Timmons.  He played with Yusef for a long time.  He played with Thad Jones and the, you know, so he's a, he's a well sought after drummer in the jazz world.  And he's played with everybody over the years.  And he happens to be, he was born May 31st, 1935.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he's eighty-one now.
Story_ID: 649404
Speaker 1: Now is it, is it, I only know of a few families like this.  I was, we were talking on the phone about--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the Freeman family, Von Freeman--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --George Freeman and Chico Freeman, the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Von's son.  And I guess there are other families like, well, Olu Dara's son, Nas, is a rapper, you know, with--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Does, do- does musical talent run through families?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, okay.
Speaker 2: There's a Hampton family that had more sisters and brothers, and Slide Hampton, the trombone player, and his whole family they played the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York] and stuff way back with the Hampton family, not Lionel [Lionel Hampton].  They're from Indianapolis [Indiana] that, this family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But then there was the Jones family, they're from Detroit [Michigan].  There's Hank Jones the pianist, Thad Jones the trumpet and big band arranger and composer, and Elvin Jones who is the drummer who played with Coltrane [John Coltrane], so there's three in that family.  And then you had the, the two Adderleys, Cannonball [Cannonball Adderley] and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right, and Nat.
Speaker 2: --Nat Adderley.  So it, it was a family affair.  And there's, there's other ones I can't recall right now.  Oh, well, even with Keg Johnson and Budd Johnson, that's way back to Earl Hines days, you know.   So--
Speaker 1: Now I remember The Brothers Johnson, the bass players from the '70s [1970s], they were really big in the '70s [1970s] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they get--younger, younger people.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So--
Speaker 2: So there's a lot of family following in each other's directions, if the older person goes into the music, if the older person want to go into medical science then they, you know, that's a custom.
Speaker 1: Well, the thing that may make your family unique in, in a sense is that I don't think there have been so many members of a family that were so well respected in their own right that, I mean, outside of the family, I mean, they, outside of a family context, I mean, each of you has an identity as a well respected musician outside of the context of the other--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --two, you know.
Speaker 2: --I think the Joneses.
Speaker 1: Are closer, yeah, Thad Jones and.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Joneses were.
Speaker 1: Do, do they ever come together and play together--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the Joneses?
Speaker 2: They played together but they didn't have, they didn't have a band together as we did.
Speaker 1: Right, that's I--yeah.
Speaker 2: See Percy [Percy Heath, Jr.], I didn't even mention, Percy went with the Modern Jazz Quartet and stayed with them for forty years or something, and they received world acclaim and, you know, the Modern Jazz Quartet was something really unique.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Milt Jackson was the, the soul of that group.  He was the vibraphone player.  And he had a brother, Alvin [Alvin Jackson], that played bass, and then he had a brother that played drums, they called him the Cooker [ph.].  So that was another family, Jacksons out of, out of Detroit.  The Joneses are out of Detroit too.  And the Chicago [Illinois] ones you mentioned.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Freemans and the--
Speaker 2: The Freemans.
Speaker 1: There are some more, I mean, the Cohrans and stuff, oh, he's [HistoryMaker Philip Cohran] got a, he's got kids playing all over the place--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So that's a family thing.  I think it's, it's a positive thing.  It works.
Story_ID: 649405
Speaker 1: I'm going to talk some more about that a little la- later on, but--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --I just wanted to--do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Of what?
Speaker 1: Of anything.  The first time you remembered anything that you, I mean, the first, as far back as your memory goes.  What's the first thing you think you remember about being at home and with your family and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've had some things where my brother would be punching on me (laughter) when I was a little guy and, my older brother, he would take advantage of me and I was a, and I messed around one day and got even with him.  He'd be punching on me and he'd make his fist up like this and make a, hit you and a, a knot would come up and he'd be punching on me.  So then we were sitting eating in, somewhere in South Carolina and we got in an argument and I said "It did," he said "It didn't," "Did," "Didn't," "Did."  I took a fork up and threw it (laughter) and it stuck right in here (gestures) (laughter).  That's the one of the earliest things I remember, fighting with my brother 'cause the older brothers will beat on the, the younger ones.
Speaker 1: 'Cause as you said you had to remind him that he was Percy, Jr. [Percy Heath, Jr.], not--
Speaker 2: Yes, and all through his life he kept telling me, "Yeah, all right, James [HistoryMaker Jimmy Heath], you got to do this, James, you got to."  I said, "Look, man, you're junior, you're not my father [Percy Heath, Sr.], get off of me, man."  (Laughter) But he was a Taurus the bull, man.  Percy, he was my way or the highway.
Speaker 1: Yeah, great musician, I'm telling you, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I'm, I'm, I'm the Scorpio.  See but Percy started out, I got to tell this story.
Story_ID: 649406
Speaker 1: Percy [Percy Heath, Jr.] started out--after my sister [Elizabeth Heath Reid], the piano, here comes Percy and he's studying the violin.  Now, in the hood where we are living, the violin, and his name is Percy and he's skinny little guy and he's playing the violin, this is not unique in the hood, you know (laughter).  So the thing about it is that he had a teacher named Professor Pugsley, Pugsley, and a pug is a fighter, you know.  And Percy, I'd be watching him and Percy would be playing the violin, (makes sounds) and Professor Pugsley had one of the longest pencils I've ever seen, (gestures) bop, he'd hit him on his hand.  So when my father [Percy Heath, Sr.] say, "Jimmy [HistoryMaker Jimmy Heath], what do you want to play?"  I said, "Not the violin, Pop" (laughter).  So, and then eventually after the Tuskegee Airmen and all of that he went to the bass violin after he got out of the [U.S. military] service.
Speaker 2: So, so that's how he started playing the bass?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He had started--he had played violin in high, junior high school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So he went from the, did, did he go to the viola first or the big upright with the--
Speaker 1: Oh, he went to the upright.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't the--
Speaker 2: But he played it with a bow?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  It wasn't no what you call it.
Speaker 2: Now did, did, did Percy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Wasn't no electric bass though, I'm talking about when Percy started playing the acoustic bass.
Speaker 2: Oh, was he playing jazz in, in, in, in the beginning?
Speaker 1: He studied, he, after he got out of the service he went to Granoff School of Music in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] on the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he learned how to play the bass and next thing I know he was recording with everybody in New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Okay.  So--
Speaker 1: Until Ron Carter came along now and outdid him, Percy was the most recorded bassist around New York for--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, so he had formal training--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --on, at both the--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --elementary level with the violin.
Speaker 1: True.
Speaker 2: And then--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --through the G.I. Bill later?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Well, I had a teacher on the alto saxophone.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah.  I'm, I'm a get to that in a minute (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Private teacher.
Speaker 2: I, I just wanted to ask you about growing up.
Story_ID: 649407
Speaker 1: So was Percy [Percy Heath, Jr.] the, no, your sister [Elizabeth Heath Reid] I guess was the first one to have an instrument, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she tried to play the piano for a minute and she gave it up.  Guys, was, she, she was interested in guys.
Speaker 1: So was she successful when she played?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She didn't get that far.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So she, she was taking lessons when she (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Did she ever play in a church or anything?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And meanwhile your dad [Percy Heath, Sr.] was still playing in the Elks [Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks of the World] and he was playing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, he was playing it whenever he got it out of the pawnshop.
Speaker 1: Now, I saw you, a picture, there's a picture on the cover of your album 'Marchin' On!'--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with your father in a Elks uniform and your mother [Arlethia Wall Heath] in a uniform.
Speaker 2: The marching club.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Did (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They marched in front of the band with the stick like, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Baton.
Speaker 1: So she didn't play anything herself?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: She was just marching?
Speaker 2: She was, they were in the marching club.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the, the band.
Speaker 1: So, I know, Elks' lodges--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in many cities is a, is an entertainment center.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So was it, was it, you know, popular like that in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So did they bring big named acts to the Elks lodge to play?
Speaker 2: They played during the war [World War II].  They were, no, that was more like the union.  The union hall would bring groups in to play 'cause they had a, in Philadelphia they had two unions, 802, no, wait no, 274 [American Federation of Musicians Union Local 274] was the white union [sic.].  I, I may be wrong now.
Speaker 1: Is this the musicians union or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had a white and a black--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --they had that in Chicago [Illinois] too--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a white and a black one.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Not 802 [Associated Musicians of Greater New York Local 802], that's New York [New York], and that's integrated all the time.
Story_ID: 649408
Speaker 1: But in other cities they had different unions, we had different everything.  You know, I'm a victim of getting to the nation's capital [Washington, D.C.] and getting off the train and getting in the colored coach when I was going back to Wilmington [North Carolina] to school, and I'd go back to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in the summer and then go back to school and when I get to the nation's capital I got to get out of the regular coach with everybody else and get in the colored coach.
Speaker 2: So now how did this work?  Now you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And I had to drink colored water.  I said, "Wait a minute, this water ain't colored.  It's the same water they got" (laughter).
Speaker 2: How did, so you're growing up--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --you spent, I know you spent time in Philadelphia--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and you spent time in Wilmington.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean, so you would go to school in Wilmington and come back to Philly in the summer?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And did your father [Percy Heath, Sr.] and mother [Alrethia Wall Heath] both live in Philadelphia all, all the time?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So when you went to Wilmington--
Speaker 1: I was staying with my grand- [paternal] grandmother, Grandma Mattie [Mattie Anderson] and Oliver Fisher the store--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --keeper.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you had like two, two distinct seasons of every year, right?  You'd be in Philadelphia--
Speaker 1: Yeah, for four years or something like that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Until I got out of high school.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So your high school years were spent like that?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Traveling--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --back and forth.  And, you know, the, the indignities, man, of that.  First of all, the one in the school was horrible.  I mean, I didn't learn any geometry, (laughter) trigonometry in high school, you know, algebra, maybe, I don't know.  You know what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: So this is at the Williston Industrial School [Williston School, Wilmington, North Carolina]?
Speaker 1: That's what it was.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Is there any reason why your parents didn't let you go to school in Philadelphia?  Would that would have been--
Speaker 1: No, well--
Speaker 2: --would, would that have been--
Speaker 1: --they were better off at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They had the store and they were, you know, they were more heading toward being middle class.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, yeah, so, so your grandparents had a better situation--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --for you than your parents had in Philadelphia?
Speaker 1: And Percy [Percy Heath, Jr.] had done it and I followed him down there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: All right.  So in your school life did you have any favorite teachers?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I fell in love with the French teacher (laughter) and I got sent to the, to the principal 'cause I, I got fresh with the teacher (laughter).
Speaker 2: What did you say to the teacher?
Speaker 1: I don't know but she told me, (gestures) she sent me to Professor Rogers [ph.], the principal, 'cause I had said something.
Speaker 2: So this is in high school, right?  When you're in high scho- high school?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, studying.  So I know a few words in French, so I use it when I go there [France], a few words.
Story_ID: 649409
Speaker 1: When did you get your saxophone?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think 1940 or for- I was fourteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how, how did it happen?  How did your father [Percy Heath, Sr.] end up sending you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father got it on time.  He would pay monthly or something on credit and he sent it to me in Wilmington [North Carolina] for Christmas 'cause I was down there during my school session.  And when he sent it to me, the first thing I did was to take it, take some of the keys off and just, but I had sense enough to know not to leave them laying around where I couldn't figure out where they went back on, so I took the key off and I lay it down and I look at it and see what, and I have never taken a saxophone apart again since then.  But what, curious being a young kid, I was curious.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so you took your sax apart and then put it back together?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this is a silver Conn [C.G. Conn Ltd.]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --alto, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay now, did you, had you expressed to your father that you wanted a saxophone or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, when he asked me after Percy [Percy Heath, Jr.] he said, I said, "Violin, not that violin Pop, I want to play the saxophone."  So I had heard Johnny Hodges, man, and Benny Carter and ironically enough I end up recording with Benny Carter, he was one of my heroes.
Speaker 1: Now this is, this is interesting.  Now, you've gone from playing the alto to playing tenor, and I know you play most of the woodwinds (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: But in the, in the big band era--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I mean, I can re- you know, alto had a better position than it does today in terms of--
Speaker 2: In the big band?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Lead.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, alto leads the section, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, nowadays people are so used to seeing a tenor sax everywhere, you know, they don't--
Speaker 2: Well, that's a small group.
Speaker 1: Yeah, small groups, rock and roll bands always have a tenor.
Speaker 2: Yeah, tenor.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Solo instrument.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well, it's more popular as a solo instrument.  The alto when you have a section, five saxophones or four as it was started earlier, by early, the black bands in America that started that instrumentation, the big band era.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, and two altos, two tenors, and a baritone, five saxophones.
Speaker 1: Alto had that melodic--
Speaker 2: Well, it's pitched higher so it leads the section, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Benny Carter and--
Speaker 2: Benny Carter and Johnny Hodges, that was the people I was, "Oh," and here comes Charlie Parker.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now this is, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He's the Bird.
Speaker 2: Ooh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Yardbird.  Parker--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he's the, so many people just rave about it, I mean, that heard him play in person, and I wasn't one of the ones 'cause I'm too young but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but he was, they say he was just--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --unbelievable, yeah.
Speaker 2: He was one of the most creative musicians, he was a genius.  You know, they use that word pretty loosely.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: But he's a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But he, he probably was that, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 649410
Speaker 1: So you were inspired to play.  Did, was there a lot of, did your father [Percy Heath, Sr.] play a lot of records around the house, and?
Speaker 2: Ooh, yes, he did.  My father was, he would even play Stravinsky [Igor Stravinsky] and classical music too.  And he would make us be quiet, when, when something was on that he wanted to hear.  But we had a, a friend named Eddie Hart that had a, a record store on South Street in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And Eddie Hart would tell us when something was out.  "All right," he'd call up my father and say, "all right, I got new Erskine Hawkins, I got new Count Basie, I got a, a new Duke Ellington, I got a--," and we'd get them all.  My father would get all of it and he'd get them bargain, his friend, Eddie, would sell them cheap, you know, 78s [78 rpm record], and we had all of the, the jazz records.  Well, you know, and then Philadelphia was a place where they had the Earle Theatre.
Speaker 1: That's E-A-R-L-E, right?
Speaker 2: Correct.  11th [Street] and Market [Street], something, yeah.  And all of us who loved music would go there every week if we could.  So I went to hear, (singing) "I'll never smile again" ['I'll Never Smith Again'], with Frank Sinatra, with Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, and, and I heard all those bands in person.  I wouldn't care what color they were.  I just wanted to be, and I remember hearing the Glenn Miller band [Glenn Miller Orchestra] and they put the blue lights on the saxophone section and I said, "Oh, my god," and they played 'Serenade in Blue,' I still got that record.  I got it on CD [compact disc] now.  But they start playing that song and I was sitting in the audience, I said, "Oh, my god, one of these days I'm going to be up there just like them guys."  That was my ideal.  That's what I wanted to be in a big band with saxophones and brass and all of that, and I eventually did it and I started my own band and all that stuff.  But--
Speaker 1: So, so you get the saxophone, you take it apart, you put it back together again.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You, you had some lessons for a brief period of time; right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had lessons.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: How, how long did you study?
Speaker 2: I studied every summer with this guy.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  So it was more than one summer?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The guy played like Benny Carter.  I'm trying to think of his name, (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this in Wilmington [North Carolina], though; right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, in--
Speaker 2: Back in Philly, I'm in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, the summers are in Philly, that's right.
Speaker 2: --the summer, I'm in Philly.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you started like, so you formed a band, (unclear) you formed a band called the Barons [Melody Barons] or, or was it--
Speaker 2: No, I went in a couple of bands before I ever--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --formed one.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I was in bands around Philadelphia.  Calvin Todd and Mel Melvin and we, we got ourselves a, a yellow school bus, bought it ourselves, a used school bus and took it down south and, and booked our self on a tour in all the black dance halls and stuff, you know, so I got used to that as soon as I got out of high school going on the road.
Story_ID: 649411
Speaker 1: We talked about it off camera but, but your high school went to the eleventh grade; right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Williston High School [Williston School, Wilmington, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was, was, who was Williston, do you know?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Was that, was that a former--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --principal or something?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  All right.
Speaker 2: That was the name of the school that's all I know, I didn't know who it was named after.  I know the principal was named Rogers [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's the guy that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And he was a very, very mixed kind of guy.
Speaker 1: In, in what sense?
Speaker 2: Straight hair, you know, kind of Cab Calloway looking.
Speaker 1: Oh (laughter).
Speaker 2: You know what I mean?  It wasn't a real African American look.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was like Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] (laughter) or my children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's some white mixed in there somewhere (laughter).
Speaker 1: So Rogers was the principal and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, at Williston High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did, did you, now were you a good student in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was pretty cool.  I didn't fail anything.
Speaker 1: Yeah, were you the kind of, I know your brother you said was the president of different things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was in the band.  I started in, played in the band down there.  So I'm really the professional musician before Percy [Percy Heath, Jr.].  He didn't get back, 'cause he, when I was with Dizzy's band, you know, no, I was with, I'm sorry, I was with this band in Omaha, Nebraska, called Nat Towles, T-O-W-L-E-S.  In 1945, I went in that band and it was a good gig and I stayed with them about eight or ten months.  And when Percy came home from the [U.S. military] service, he, "James [HistoryMaker Jimmy Heath]," he say, "Man, I met Dizzy [Dizzy Gillespie].  And, man, why don't you quit that band and come back 'cause they're playing this new music called bebop."  So I quit the band and came back to Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Come to find out, Dizzy didn't even know Percy's name, he called him lieutenant from the Air Force [U.S. Army Air Force; U.S. Air Force].  And I ended up getting Percy in Dizzy's band later.  But he told me, "Oh, I know Dizzy."  Yeah, okay.  (Laughter) He, he called you lieutenant, he don't even know your name.
Speaker 1: So, well, back to the bebop.  Now the, the music you came along with was swing, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And well, what, well, let me pause here and we'll--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --we'll talk about it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 649412
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Swing to bebop.
Speaker 1: When we interviewed [HistoryMaker] Oscar Brown, Jr.--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --he gave us a description of swing and, and I can't even repeat it, but he said the syncopated movement of two object, of objects (laughter).
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: He, he gave a physics definition of it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But he said it, but the bottom line is it don't mean a thing unless it's got that swing (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a Duke Ellington song ['It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)']--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he said swing is what the world is, that's how the world operates on movement and vibration so.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Anyway, so what, what was swing music to, to you growing up?  Now, that that was the, like rap is, is today swing was--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --was that to you when you were growing up; right?
Speaker 2: Yes, swing music was what was happening when I was very young and it was syncopated music.  You know, the European classical music was, a lot of it was on the beat and--
Speaker 1: Can you hum what that would be like?
Speaker 2: On the beat is, (scats).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It's militant.  But (scats), that's syncopated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's off the beat.  The beat is here but the, the other notes are coming off the beat.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what would be the difference in bebop and swing?
Speaker 2: Well bebop had a, a, a, a depth of complex harmony.  That was one of the, the really important phases of the bebop music.  When we were, swing guys weren't, without, and there were some exceptions, you know, Duke had exceptions to, to everything, he was doing everything anyway.  He was one of our other super geniuses.  But bebop, they got that title from a eighth note phrase (makes sounds) and somebody named it bebop.  But it's, it's a swing pattern but, you know, like Dizzy [Dizzy Gillespie] would say or my teacher when I studied with this Professor Rudolf Schramm from Leipzig, Germany, here at Carnegie Hall [New York, New York] for two years.  And he told me (background noise)--
Story_ID: 649413
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The people who named the music bebop was behind one particular phrase, two eighth notes; and that's not all that bebop is about.  So there is a complex harmony, that's what bebop was really about, sophisticated harmony.  Like you wouldn't know what I'm talking about when there are poly chords and different things like that are added where, and the extensions on the regular chords that you hear in church, and playing harmony, the harmony is extended to being very modern and very chromatic and, and a lot of movement.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So that's what bebop had a lot of things in it.  Also it was played very fast.  It wasn't the best music to dance to unless you were a professional dancer.  But black people could, they would cut time and dance half time to the music.  If the music say, (scats), they could dance and cut time or half time of what the tempo really is.  But people now they don't dance anyway.  What do they do?  (Gestures) Standing around with their arms up in the air, they're not dancing, dance with your feet.
Speaker 2: Yeah, now when you were coming along like the Lindy--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Jitterbugging, man.
Speaker 2: --jitterbug, yeah.
Speaker 1: And the Lindy hop and all that stuff.  You had a skill, that was a skillful dance.  Tap dancing and all that stuff, that was a skill.
Speaker 2: And correct me if I'm wrong but a typical bebop song, I mean, one that, that people talk about a lot is 'Salt Peanuts' by Dizzy Gillespie.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: (Singing) "Salt peanuts, salt peanuts."
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: (Scats) But the, you, you said the real creativity comes in the harmony, the harmonic part (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It comes in the harmony, the density of the harmony.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a, yeah.
Speaker 1: And it's gotten so it's, you know, people can hear it now.  When it first came out they couldn't hear it.  The, the average listener, even Stravinsky [Igor Stravinsky] when he did 'Firebird Suite' ['The Firebird'] or one of those symphonies ['The Rite of Spring'] he wrote when he played it in Europe some way and the people ran out of the place.  They couldn't hear it.  You know, it was dissonant, you know.
Speaker 2: So it was always, well, well, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think it's, it's always going to be, the, the problem is the music world, period, is that the people are not as educated to the music as the musicians so they don't hear it.
Speaker 2: So creativity creates a challenge for the listener--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --when the musicians create something new, the challenge for the listener is to pick up on it?
Speaker 1: Unless they go to 'Who Let the Dogs Out.'
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Ain't no challenge to that is there?
Speaker 2: No, no, sir.
Speaker 1: (Singing) "Who let the dogs out?  Who let the dogs out?" (Shakes head).
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: I mean, it's dumbed down, brother.  Visual art, audio arts, they're all dumbed down now because people are getting away with BS, bullshit, that's what they're getting away with.  And then why spend all that time studying all this stuff when I can say two words and get a hit.
Speaker 2: Now, you've referenced classical music a few times in this--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --discussion.  And I know you didn't get any classical music in school [Williston School, Wilmington, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Unh-uh.
Speaker 2: So where did you get your, how, where did you pick up your classical music knowledge?  Was that from--
Speaker 1: I just listened.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I listened and I studied two years with a man at Carnegie Hall [New York, New York], Rudolf Schramm from Leipzig, Germany, 'cause I was interested in writing some larger works, suites, and the larger pieces, not just a thirty-two bar, twelve bar, song and that kind of thing.  I wanted to stretch out in, in my compositional skills.
Speaker 2: So this, this is further on in your career, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Where you studied with Rudolf Schramm?
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I had already been recording and writing for, on records.
Story_ID: 649414
Speaker 1: So, as we have you now, I mean, chronologically, right after high school [Williston School, Wilmington, North Carolina] you're touring--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and you're with, and you're with Nat Towles out of Omaha [Nebraska]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --first.  And then you had your own little band for a minute, the, the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I started my own band in forty--
Speaker 1: The Barons--
Speaker 2: Forty-seven [1947].
Speaker 1: --the Melody Barons, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: That's not me.
Speaker 1: That's not you, okay.
Speaker 2: No.  That was Mel Melvin or something, it's a couple of bands out of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] I played with before I went with Mel Melvin.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Around locally in Philly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One of them was Calvin Todd, he was a trumpet player.  He played like Roy Eldridge.  And, and then Mel Melvin was a guy that just conducted his band.  So those two bands I played, then I went with Nat Towles in '45 [1945].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you saw Dizzy Gillespie for the first time in 1945 we have on here, is that--
Speaker 2: Forty-five [1945] or '46 [1946].  It was at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia, they had a jazz festival.
Speaker 1: Was, was that your introduction to bebop?
Speaker 2: No, I had heard it on records.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: I had heard Charlie Parker and Dizzy on records when I was with Nat Towles.  'Cause the jukeboxes, we went into one of the joints in the South, we were, we were playing a concert and during the day when we were setting up for everything for the big band I was in, we put money in the, nickel in the jukebox and we heard some Jay McShann music.  And Jay McShann was from Kansas City [Missouri] where Charlie Parker was playing the alto with Jay McShann.  And I told my friend Billy Mitchell from Detroit [Michigan], I said, "Man, you hear that alto player?"  And then I later on found out that that was Charlie Parker, one of the, the records from '45 [1945] with Dizzy and Charlie Parker together, the same guy I heard with Jay McShann.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we, we, we've interviewed Phil Cohran [HistoryMaker Philip Cohran] from Chicago [Illinois] who played with Jay McShann's band.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And he was a young man, about, about the same age as you, I think or maybe a little younger.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, we went to what you call it to, we went to Paris [France]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --with Jay McShann.
Story_ID: 649415
Speaker 1: Now did you form a big band yourself at some point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I came home, back home from Nat Towles, I had copied a couple of arrangements from their book; and I had, I wanted to start a big band of my own in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and I did that around 1947.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was fortunate enough, Coltrane [John Coltrane] had just come out of the [U.S.] Navy with a friend, another friend of mine, they were in the Navy together, named Bill Massey, a trumpeter.  And Bill introduced me to Coltrane and I asked John, I said, "Man, I got a big band, man, would you play, would you consider playing?"  He said, "Yeah."  So he played in my big band and that's what this picture is about from 1947 with me conducting the band and Trane is between me and Charlie Parker.  Charlie Parker is sitting in with my band.  And he had used my horn the whole week, Charlie Parker used my horn in the Downbeat club with Miles Davis, Max Roach, and his band, the quintet.  And I asked him would he play this concert with my big band and Bird said yes, he would do it.  And he did it.  And between myself and Coltrane is, I mean, between Bird and myself is Coltrane with a cigarette looking at Charlie Parker like this (gesture).  And I was very honored to have Bird playing my horn for a week, his was in the pawnshop.  And to, to, I used to give it when I was teaching at Queens College [Queens, New York], I would give a copy of it, this same photo that shows that Trane is in complete awe of Charlie Parker--
Speaker 1: Now, this is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) as we all were.  'Cause a lot of young kids they come up in the college and say, "Oh, Coltrane, Coltrane, Coltrane."  I say well, why is he looking at Bird like that (gesture)?  'Cause he's, (laughter) 'cause Charlie Parker was doing some of that stuff he learned to do before he did it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this is, I mean, anyway, just thinking about this is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that's why I wrote the book, 'I Walked With Giants' ['I Walked With Giants: The Autobiography of Jimmy Heath,' Jimmy Heath and Joseph McLaren].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I'm around Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, man.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: I met Duke [Duke Ellington] once, but Pops [Pops Foster], Louis Armstrong, and all these people, I walked with giants.
Speaker 1: So you're twenty years old but, you know, Coltrane is just kind of starting out.
Speaker 2: No, he was twenty, we're the same--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: He's a month older than me.  September the 23rd, I'm October the 25th of '26 [1926].
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, okay.  You're twenty years old and you got a group that includes John Coltrane who you're the same age but you got like, you--
Speaker 2: Benny Golson.
Speaker 1: --Charlie Parker is sitting in your, in your group--
Speaker 2: Sitting in with my band.
Speaker 1: And he's playing gigs with Miles Davis and--?
Speaker 2: His band.
Speaker 1: His--
Speaker 2: He's playing at the Downbeat club in Philadelphia.
Story_ID: 649416
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But this was an occasion where a kid had gotten legs amputated by a streetcar in Philly.
Speaker 2: Oh right.
Speaker 1: It was a benefit concert and I said, "Bird [Charlie Parker], would you play this concert with me?"  He said, "Yeah."
Speaker 2: Okay, now this--
Speaker 1: And he came and played the concert.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this, the little girl's name was Mary Etta Jordan; right?  This, this is the note we have here.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: She had been in a streetcar accident and lost both legs.
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2: And this is--
Speaker 1: I didn't know her name.
Speaker 2: It was Mary Etta Jordan, right.
Speaker 1: I never heard that until today.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so your, it, it, it's interesting to your, you all played at the Octavius Valentine Catto Lodge [Octavius V. Catto Lodge, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], you know; right?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: And Catto was a--
Speaker 1: No, that's O.V. Catto--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --we call it.
Speaker 2: Catto, okay.
Speaker 1: O, O--
Speaker 2: O.V.--
Speaker 1: --O.V. Catto.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was--
Speaker 1: And that's another marching band, the Elks [Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks of the World], and O.V. Catto was another kind of marching band in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: I've read about him though, Catto, it, it was named after Catto who was a voting rights activist in Philadelphia, for black votes, he was a, a pioneer of civil rights.
Speaker 1: But we didn't call it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Catto.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'm, I'm just--
Speaker 1: O.V. Catto.
Speaker 2: It's Catto, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is interesting.  So any rate, but--
Speaker 1: Where did you get that, that's Philadelphia history?
Speaker 2: You know, it's (laughter), we have research (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 649417
Speaker 1: But any rate, so this is, so in 19--now meanwhile in 1946, we can't leave this out, you met James Mtume's mother [Bertha Preston Forman], right?  In--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in, in '46 [1946]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had known her (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or, or, or around that time--
Speaker 2: I don't know around that time, '45 [1945], '46 [1946], 'cause she was in the next block--
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: --from me.
Speaker 1: And your, your son, James Mtume--
Speaker 2: Was born--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --forty-seven [1947].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He was born January the 3rd, he just turned seventy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  So but now were you all considered, well, you were a couple then, were you considered a couple?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were engaged.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: But she ran off with my piano player.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that, and that happens (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) James Forman [James "Hen Gates" Forman].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, that's something that, that you write about in the book ['I Walked With Giants: The Autobiography of Jimmy Heath,' Jimmy Heath and Joseph McLaren], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so, so what was going on with, were you distracted, you know, by, you know?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't distracted.  She saw him and liked him better and split, even with, took my son with her.  Mtume was already born.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And he was raised by--'cause I got in trouble after that, that kind of set me up.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would be a tough thing to deal with; right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, with my piano player.  I got him with Dizzy [Dizzy Gillespie] and he ended up taking my (laughter) fiancee and my son; and I went to drugs.
Story_ID: 649418
Speaker 1: Now it was in 1947 that, that you and Percy [Heath's brother, Percy Heath, Jr.] moved to New York [New York], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we came to New York with Howard McGhee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  With Howard, the Howard McGhee band, he was a trumpet player?
Speaker 2: Yeah, from California.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, but he was really originally from Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he lived in California.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He played with Charlie Parker on some recordings out there.
Speaker 1: And it was around this time that you got the nickname Little Bird, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  I was playing the alto and trying to play like Charlie Parker.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you must have been pretty good or--
Speaker 2: (Cough) I don't know.
Speaker 1: I mean, to be compared with, with Bird is a--
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I was doing my best.
Speaker 1: It seems like it, so.
Speaker 2: We all were trying to be, play like Charlie Parker, 'cause--
Speaker 1: But you're age twenty-one, I guess the point I was trying to make before, you're twenty-one years old, you're all, you're already, I mean, you're a, you're playing with all the, the top musicians in the country (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I got to play with, with Dizzy, me and Coltrane [John Coltrane] together in '49 [1949] we went in Dizzy's band together.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how did that take, how did that happen 'cause--
Speaker 2: (Cough) Excuse me.
Speaker 1: --Dizzy only kind of really knew him as a, you know, by the name lieutenant, he wasn't really that familiar with him but how did, how did you all get a spot in Dizzy Gillespie's band?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the guys left.  Two guys left, alto players and he got, we, I, I know, and me personally I had been following his band around 'cause Dizzy would say every time we go to, he go to Wilmington, Delaware, or Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] or Jersey [New Jersey], we'd be standing in front of the band, me and Percy, with a beret on and artists ties like Dizzy and them, we wanted to be there.  Say I'm following Dizzy.  I said, "Oh, I want to be like that."  So and Dizzy would say, "Hey, there's the Heath brothers from Philadelphia," you know, and we ended up getting (unclear).  And Trane was, was playing in my band too.  So actually I had a, almost a feeder band 'cause we was copying all of Dizzy's music that we could.  And I had Nelson Boyd on bass.  Now, Nelson Boyd went with Miles [Miles Davis] and Miles wrote a song for him, 'Half Nelson.'  He's from Camden, New Jersey.  And he, he was in my band before Percy was able to get his bass chops together.  And then I had Benny Golson and he ended up playing with Dizzy.  Coltrane he ended up, my piano player, James Forman [James "Hen Gates" Forman], he played with Dizzy and took my fiancee [Bertha Preston Forman] and my son [James Mtume] with him (laughter).  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's almost like the farm team for--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had a feeder band into Dizzy's band.  And then eventually I got in.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is a, well, it's something.  So at any rate, so, so you, you come into Dizzy's band in 1949?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is that it?  Okay.  All right.  And so, so he's, he's touring really all the time, right, at this point?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And Dizzy Gillespie is one of the big names now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He's touring around.  And you said that Dizzy Gillespie did something for you that was very important, right, in terms of teaching you how to--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He was always, man, my, whew.  Excuse me a minute.  Itchy, itchy, my nose.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Wow.  Oh, man.  Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: And, and you were telling us I think off camera that Dizzy Gillespie taught you the keyboard; right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he made, yeah, he taught--
Speaker 1: As a vehicle to--
Speaker 2: To arranging and composing, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: He would always be showing us things on the piano, always until he passed.
Story_ID: 649419
Speaker 1: One thing I didn't ask you about, and there's reference in the research here, that a lot of the musicians, when they would come to town [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] they, you would bring them to your house?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My mother [Arlethia Wall Heath] would, well, well, my mother and father [Percy Heath, Sr.] were so in love with music, they would allow us to bring any, you know, we'd bring a whole band down there and mom would fix some food.  So we brought Dizzy's band, that's when he first told me, he said, "Man," I say, "Dizzy [Dizzy Gillespie], I want to write."  He said, "Man, if you want to learn how to write you gotta get to the keyboard, you know."  And I, that was about four or five members of his band and they came to the house.  I had the whole Horace Silver band, I had the whole Yusef Lateef band.  I would invite everybody.  Charlie Parker, (unclear) invited him down to my house, you know, my mother was in tune with that.
Speaker 1: It, it seems, and while I know it's true that, that, that there's a, like being a creative musician puts you in a, almost like a fraternity; right?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it was different in those days because the professionals were not snobs and they weren't ego maniacs.  I call them Ego Stravinskys.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: They weren't Ego Stravinskys.  They would tell you anything that they knew so they were the teachers, mentors.  We didn't have it in all the colleges and universities so we learned from our predecessors and that's the way we did.  And they were, were humble and they gave us whatever they had learned, they'd give it to us.  You know, they didn't charge us nothing, you ain't gotta go to no classroom and all, if they knew something they'd show you.  It was a, a brotherhood thing, fraternity, or whatever you want to call it.
Story_ID: 649420
Speaker 1: What was, I, I just want to ask, what was Dizzy Gillespie like as a per- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nicest man you wanted--he's crazy, that's why they call him Dizzy.  I mean, he's a joker, he was full of, full of pranks and all that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: For instance, what kind of pranks would, would Dizzy pull?
Speaker 2: Oh, man.  Well, and this is about him, he wasn't, he wasn't a good driver, you know.  And his wife, Lorraine [Lorraine Willis Gillespie], was saying, and Dizzy was saying to somebody that, excuse me, now he would drive them somewhere, and Lorraine said, "He'd drive you straight into hell," 'cause he, he couldn't drive.  And him and Milt Jackson was some sad drivers.  And everybody else, and in the music business, in the bebop generation we all had sports cars, that was our thing.  Miles [Miles Davis] always had a Ferrari or a Berlinetta or a Fa- (cough) or a Maserati, the biggest and best you could have, fastest, you know, but everybody had one.  Lee Morgan had a Triumph, I had a Triumph, Charlie Persip had a Austin-Healey.  We were buying sports cars 'cause we were young and fast and playing fast music, fast girls, (laughter) and the fast life.  And that's the way it was.  But Dizzy and, and Milt, you know, they just weren't good drivers.  Well, Dizzy would do a lot of things.  I have to think about that.  He, he was a jokester.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.   Now, some of the names, I know that, that you engaged in, I, I think a lot of people, people in the bebop generation, a, a lot, a lot of friends of mine they engaged in word, word play.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Just like when you just said Ego Stravinsky.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) all that, and all that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Well, that's a, you know, it's improvising with the language the same we do with the musical language.  It's improvisation and through life and all it's, a lot of the terms that we used way back then are still being used by the youngsters now, you know, the rappers, they're using the same terms that we used.  And some of them have some unique ways of expressing themselves.  I don't put everybody down.  It's all, it's some good and bad in everything.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: In every style.
Speaker 1: It's part of the creative personality, I mean, to--
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 1: To do that.
Story_ID: 649421
Speaker 1: What about, now, John Coltrane as you mentioned--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --he's same age as you, but he's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --considered, and I think it's partially due to the fact that he died young too, he's like iconic.
Speaker 2: Oh, of course.
Speaker 1: Almost, almost like a saxophone Jesus in some way, and people feel that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.  They got a church out in California [Saint John Will I Am Coltrane African Orthodox Church, San Francisco, California].
Speaker 1: Do they?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.
Speaker 2: They got a church in California, pray to, for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, you're right, there's a John Coltrane church.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well, he was the most humble and a nice guy.  I mean, he was, I was telling the story the other day that when he was drugging and he stopped, and we all used to borrow money from each other, you know, to get drugs when we were, when we were messed up.  So now, after Trane stopped using drugs, he went and had some cards made that said, "I am broke and I was just getting ready to ask you for some money" (laughter).  So when you say, "Hey, Trane, lend me twenty dollars until tonight's gig."  He'd give you a card, he wouldn't say nothing (laughter).  Say, okay.  Aw, man, (laughter), you know.  So he was a humble person.  There's a lot of things that he would, you know, he was a church person (unclear).  I think his father [John R. Coltrane] was a preacher.
Speaker 1: Yeah, his iconic music, I mean, the, one of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When he, yeah, when he got to, to the spiritual thing, oh, yeah, he got to that.  I just did a what you call, me and [HistoryMaker] Sonny Rollins and Benny Golson are speakers in this new video they just put out called, 'Trane' ['Chasing Trane: The John Coltrane Documentary'], it's a, it's a guy from Canada who did it.  It's a new video out.
Speaker 1: About, about Coltrane?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And it's very interesting 'cause I went to see the premiere and 'cause it had some down-to-earth scenes and with him, him with his kids and the family and stuff that you don't see that, they had some films that they put out that nobody had never seen because every time, you know, Trane when we were with Dizzy [Dizzy Gillespie], we were in San Francisco [California] and he was practicing in the room, 'cause Trane practiced twenty five hours a day.  He practiced all day, practiced all day.  His first wife, Juanita, who had changed her name, she changed her name to Naima [Naima Coltrane]. The city--
Speaker 1: Right, he had a song about her, yeah.
Speaker 2: He was, said he was 90 percent saxophone, that's what Juanita said.  Okay.  But and we're in San Francisco in a hotel and John is practicing and practicing and somebody calls to the desk, "Hey, tell that guy to stop all that noise up there, I'm trying to sleep."  So Trane took the horn out of his mouth and fingered silently for a half hour or more.  He was just a practice, I never, you know, I told John, I said, "John, Willie Mays hit three home runs today."  He said, "Who is Willie Mays, Jim [HistoryMaker Jimmy Heath]?"
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: He was not a sports guy.  Miles [Miles Davis] was, but Trane didn't care nothing about sports, man, all he cared about was that music.  He was the most dedicated musician ever.  And he, you know, I went to the funeral, he was forty, man.  So he's been gone, what?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We're the same age, he would, he left when he was forty; I'm ninety, I been here fifty more years than John, man.  Nicest guy you want to meet, man.
Story_ID: 649422
Speaker 1: Now, I wanna ask you about "Love Supreme."  Now, now that's one of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --spiritual message--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --I guess, cuts that, that John Coltrane created.  And it, I, I think, he, and correct me if I'm wrong here, if you think it's, it goes back even further than this, but I think he created a genre of creative music that, or he, he's one of the early people to talk about the relationship that people have to each other in the universe and that sort of thing out, outside of a normal religious kind of, I mean, a regular religious context, I know the power of love, "A Love Supreme."  You know, Pharoah Sanders, I guess, Gary Bartz at one time and other, others, you know, tried to do the same, Alice Coltrane--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Joe Henderson and some others.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you too, I mean, you know, you wrote some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, no, Trane was a spiritual minded person.  Even in this video ['Chasing Trane: The John Coltrane Documentary'] that I was just telling you about, there's a scene of him in Japan where he went to Hiroshima [Japan] where we bombed them people, he went there and prayed with the Japanese people, you know, which is very different.  Now, you know, we take sides but it was just, just the humanity 'cause it was a horrible thing what we did, what they did to us was horrible to make us do that.  But John was really different.  There was a case of him playing in a place, I think they say it was in Virginia or somewhere and Trane was playing his music and a white guy came up to John and said, "I don't like that stuff you're playing, sound like nigger hate music."  John said, "Oh, I'm sorry."  And I know a bunch of brothers would have knocked him out, or tried, to say that to him but not, not Coltrane.  He wasn't that kind of person.
Speaker 1: So do you think this man was a--'cause a--
Speaker 2: He was a--he was a spiritual human being.  He was a very religious person.  And there's other ones too, you know.
Speaker 1: You know, the image, there's a popular culture image of jazz musicians as being hedonistic, materialistic, and, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --cool, detached, and all that sort of thing, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But there's another side of this, isn't it?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I mean, it sounds like the person, like we look at a person like Coltrane and, and--
Speaker 2: Benny Golson, man.
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Benny Golson is in church all the time.  Played the piano and the organ and stuff in church.  He's a church guy.
Speaker 1: But, but I'm not--
Speaker 2: But there is a lot (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean, I, I'm not asking so much about--
Speaker 2: --but Trane had a, Trane had a, it could have been a vision that he wasn't going, he was going do everything he could while he was here and leave this high mark to somebody to try to get to this.  I just got a, a, a CD ['King of Xhosa'] from one of my students from Queens College [Queens, New York], a white cat named Jeff Siegel, he lives Upstate New York.  And they're into the Coltrane 'cause he got a couple of African guys on there and they're into the Coltrane kind of religious dedicated music to the hereafter and the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I mean--
Speaker 2: --you know, the supreme being.
Speaker 1: I, I would suggest-
Speaker 2: --they're into that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would suggesting, it, it, is beyond like organized religion.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Into a different kind of, it's not just church music, it's like--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --this is music that--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, it's not.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's not just church music.  But Jeff Siegel, man, and he's asked me to give him a comment on it.  And I'm going to try to figure it out because he's a Jewish cat and he's got a white girl [Erica Lindsay] playing the saxophone on it and the girl is playing the piano that went to Queens College when I was there.  Jeff Siegel was the drummer and this girl, Francesca Tanksley, she wrote one of the pieces, a prayer or something, and they're, they're trying to reach that, that outer limit that Trane was, he, he got there but there's other people trying to get in that same direction; go deeper, not, not just church songs, you know what I mean.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: We got people that do that too.
Story_ID: 649423
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a, there's a documentary ['Music Is My Life, Politics My Mistress: The Story of Oscar Brown, Jr.'] about [HistoryMaker] Oscar Brown, Jr., where he talks about that.
Speaker 2: I saw it.  I--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I saw the Oscar Brown--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the documentary.  But that's a different, that's a period that's reaching out, that's reaching into space.
Speaker 1: Now, you're in, you were, you lived in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] for many years.  I know eventually that became the home of Sun Ra.  Did you, did you ever meet Sun Ra?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I met Sun Ra.
Speaker 1: Well, did, did you ever (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I met him here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: When his apartment, when he had the parachute up in the corner of his (laughter)--
Speaker 1: I didn't, tell us about that 'cause I don't--
Speaker 2: Well, he had a, he had a parachute up in the corner of the ceiling and, you know, and Sun Ra and they stopped him at customs somewhere in Europe or and, and Sun Ra said, "This is the most unfriendly planet I've ever visited" (laughter).  And the, the customs people say, "What?"  He say, when they searching him, you know, "The most unfriendly planet I've ever visited."
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, I, I think one of the--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --what I was saying here, one of the, you, you played with Pat Patrick [Laurdine "Pat" Patrick] at one point; right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: He played on my record 'Really Big!'.
Speaker 1: Right.  And he, he was Sun Ra--
Speaker 2: He's, yeah.
Speaker 1: --adherent, and whose, whose son is now the, or, or used to be--
Speaker 2: He was.
Speaker 1: --governor of Massachusetts.
Speaker 2: Deval [HistoryMaker Deval L. Patrick].
Speaker 1: Deval, Pat, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And Pat Patrick's a tenor sax.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Pat's from--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --from Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was on my record the, (laughter) yeah, Deval, he didn't see that.
Speaker 1: And now this is trans- well, we got into this I guess because of John Coltrane trying to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --trying to do, create music that was transcendent, I guess, yeah, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Transcending--that's a good word for it.
Story_ID: 649424
Speaker 1: So you're playing with Dizzy Gillespie, there's your brother, Percy [Percy Heath, Jr.], John Coltrane, who's playing drums for you all at this point?  Was it, do you remember or what was the rest of the band, what was the rest of the band when you played with Gillespie?
Speaker 2: Which one?
Speaker 1: When you played with Dizzy Gillespie in '49 [1949] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Another guy I got with Dizzy.  A drummer from Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] named Specs Wright.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right, Specs Wright.
Speaker 2: When I mentioned Nelson Boyd was a bass player there, Specs Wright I got him with Dizzy.  See Dizzy had Teddy Stewart from Kansas City [Missouri] and Teddy hooked up with Dinah Washington and quit Dizzy's band.  And they're at the Earle Theatre [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and I said, "Dizzy, I got a man that can play all your music," and I got Specs Wright to play with Dizzy.  You know, but Specs Wright ended up, sad, 'cause he ended up taking a overdose and dying, not while he was with Dizzy but later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 649425
Speaker 1: Now, when you toured the South from what I understand the South was not into bebop.  Like it was too new for 'em--they couldn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's true. We went to Little Rock [Arkansas] with the Dizzy [Dizzy Gillespie] band and the, what happened was the, the black people from the neighborhood sent in scouts and they listened to that music we was playing, they say, "Why don't y'all go back and send Buddy Johnson down here."  And Buddy Johnson was a R and B band, big band but had singers, two singers, had Arthur Prysock, male singer, and, and Ella Johnson, his, some relation to Buddy that was singing in the band and they played swing music like Basie [Count Basie] and them, you know.  So when we went in there, man, you know, that music was too advanced.  It got past the dance and when you get past the dance, why, why do you think, what you call it, so, so popular now?  It went back to dance.
Story_ID: 649426
Speaker 1: Concertized, bebop got to be kind of concertized like European classic.  But they get sponsors.  See I was on the New York State council of the arts [New York State Council on the Arts] for a couple of years and I know who they give the money, all them corporations, I know who they give the money, the Syracuse Symphony [Syracuse Symphony Orchestra], the Albany String Quartet, (makes sound).  And the Jazzmobile in Harlem [New York, New York], okay, we'll give you $25,000.  Giving all them people a hundred thousand here, and a hundred, you know, what I mean?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you--
Speaker 1: This is the difference in our country where this music was created and respected all around the world, and all the countries, I, there are about, just about ready to put out a record I made in, in Koln, or Cologne as we call it, Germany.  The, what do they call that?  Norddeutscher Rundfunk or something, North German--or West German Radio Orchestra [WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne].  Germany, Denmark, Holland [the Netherlands], Sweden, Belgium, their governments pay to have a steady big band.  Some of our jazz cats would go over there and get in those bands 'cause they would, like Art Farmer went to Austria and got in the band [Austrian Radio Orchestra] 'cause they get pensions and they, they, you know, what I mean?  And the government takes care of them, playing whatever music is required including jazz.  America?  And this is where it was created, and what did they do?
Speaker 2: Not much.  Is that why (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They don't, they, they don't give us a, money and, man, I don't know what's gone happen now 'cause this guy don't know nothing about music (laughter) that's coming in now.
Speaker 2: Donald Trump [President Donald John Trump], (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  No, he's a chump.  But what, you know, the, we did have Dr. Billy Taylor [HistoryMaker Billy Taylor], had, we had some money one, I forgot who was the president.  They had a program where we were going around to schools and playing jazz in order to educate the people.  Because let's face it, the television is hypnotized everybody.  We all hyped up on television.  And if we are not on there with jazz, we're left out.
Story_ID: 649427
Speaker 1: I know there was a period of time when the National Endowment for the Arts tried to do more for jazz musicians under the, the leadership of [HistoryMaker] A. B. Spellman who was--
Speaker 2: Oh, I know, A. B.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Sure, A. B. was when I got my NEA Jazz Master [National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters Fellowship], in 2004 I got it.  And it was $20,000 then.  And do you know I didn't like that because when they tell you, "Life achievement," and give you $20,000, what kind of life is that?  Denmark got the Jazzpar Prize, Japan got a prize, they give 200,000 [Danish crowns] and, and that kind of stuff in these other countries.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I mean, to be fair, I mean, A. B. had to fight to get that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know it.
Speaker 1: --twenty thousand out of the endowment 'cause he, they, the--
Speaker 2: But now--
Speaker 1: --you're right, they, they give the big money to the symphonies and the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They give it to the same, to, to that, you know.  And then what do they do?  Play the same music they've been playing since the 1700.  And all these creative people out here, right, coming up with this new music, you don't get nothing.  So, you do.  So now I remember going back after they changed to $25,000 and I asked A. B. and them, I said, "Hey, can I get mine retroactive, (laughter) that other five?"  They said, "No, Mr. Heath [HistoryMaker Jimmy Heath] you can't" (laughter).  So now they give twenty-five, Archie and, and Pharoah got it last I was there.
Speaker 1: Archie Shepp and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Pharoah Sanders got it the same time.  But that's the biggest prize that our government gives.  Now, there are a couple of other people, that give money, big corporations, like the girl that plays the violin, the sister that plays the violin and she's got this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, the, the one with--
Speaker 2: --two hundred and something thousand.  Max Roach got it too.
Speaker 1: Esperanza Spalding?  The, you're talking about Esperanza Spalding the sister with the--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, the violinist.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The one from California that used to play with Yanni, is that the one or--
Speaker 2: Little black girl?
Speaker 1: Oh, little, the, I, I think that's
Speaker 2: Small [ph.].
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's Esperanza--
Speaker 2: That plays jazz somewhat.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  'Cause what you call its, his daughter plays in a group, A. B.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In a string group.  But I know A. B., man.  A. B. is a great guy, man.  I was ju-
Speaker 1: It's hard to, yeah, hard to get anything from the, the, the U.S. government doesn't seem to be committed to the arts, period, let alone--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --jazz.
Speaker 2: --special arts they are.  Why do they keep repeating that the greatest music of all times, Bach [Johann Sebastian Bach] and Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven], they say that's the greatest music of all time.  Every culture has their music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they sponsor that.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: I'm on the board of, you know, Thelonious Monk Institute since its inception.  I was there when they started it, the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz [Washington, D.C.] and now Herbie is, is getting bigger in that organization, [HistoryMaker] Herbie Hancock.  But I was there at the first meeting, me and Clark Terry, Max Roach, and Herbie and Wayne [HistoryMaker Wayne Shorter] and them guys weren't there, you see.  The lady from the Beethoven Society [Beethoven Society of America] liked Monk's [Thelonious Monk] music and she started that thing.
Speaker 1: From the Beethoven Society (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Maria Fisher--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --her name.  And that's a Jewish lady but she liked Monk's music and she, and, convinced us all to start the, the Thelonious Monk it's being going about thirty five or forty years.  So and then, you know, as far as that then I'm on the board at the, the Armstrong House [Louis Armstrong House Museum, Queens, New York].  The reason I mention it because the pictures that, that I have, those two things.
Story_ID: 649428
Speaker 1: Well, I don't wanna get too far off of the, off the chronology.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But at this, we were talking about 1949, 1950--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, well--
Speaker 1: --or so.  And--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --now this is a, like a, it's not a creative nadir but's it a nadir in your life in terms of, I don't know if you were depressed that you're, you're, you're, you, you started using drugs, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But it wasn't just you 'cause there's a list of people and everybody from Max Roach, Bud Powell, Charlie Parker, Dexter Gordon, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Stan Getz, [HistoryMaker] Sonny Rollins, Jackie McLean, J.J. Johnson, you can go on and on--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --a list of the great jazz musicians--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --everybody is on her- heroin.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is, and there's a story, I think, in your book ['I Walked With Giants: The Autobiography of Jimmy Heath,' Jimmy Heath and Joseph McLaren] about an incident that took place in my hometown, Dayton, Ohio.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Where you had to hide your use from Dizzy Gillespie, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, what happened? Can you tell me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But a girl, it was a girl that came backstage and in the theater.  We were playing Dayton, there's a theater there or something, and we--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it used to be the Palace Theatre [Dayton, Ohio], probably the Palace.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Sugar Chile Robinson was a little black kid that played boogie woogie piano--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was on the show.  And me and Coltrane and all of us, we had started this, this business of heroin, snorting it in our nose.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And this--
Speaker 1: --how, how were you introduced to this in the first place?  I mean, did you, can you remember exactly--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --when you first got started with that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm telling you when Teddy Stewart came, when he left, when he came, when Dizzy's band came and he says, "Man, I saw your fiancee [Bertha Preston Forman] over here with Hen Gates, the piano player, James Forman [James "Hen Gates" Forman], and they said they were getting married."  And he said to me, "I got something, man, to make you, you know, try this."  And I snorted that stuff with him.  See I'm on the down, my, my reason, I'm on a downer from losing my family that's what ran me to heroin.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's other people, a lot of people during the bebop generation they wanted to be like that because Charlie Parker was a heroin addict and he was a genius, but he stupid too.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard st-
Speaker 2: Come on now.
Speaker 1: I've heard stories that Charlie Parker would be on the bandstand with his head down, virtually in a stupor and when it, when, when it came for his part, he'd stand up and blow the place away.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, see--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --yeah, I saw it.  I saw it, he, I told you he used my horn 'cause his was in the pawnshop.
Speaker 1: Because of lack of funds because of--
Speaker 2: 'Cause he put it in there to get some money.  So that's the most stupid thing that anybody can do.  Here's Exhibit A, I've been through it.  That is the dumbest thing that you could possibly do.  Heroin is the dumbest high that you could ever get into but when you get in it, you can't get out of it.  The only way I got out of it was to do four and a half years in Lewisburg Penitentiary [United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania].
Story_ID: 649429
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That hurt my career and everything, man.  But I was fortunate enough to come home on May the 21st of 1959.  I went in in January the 9th of 1955.  And I was convicted of selling heroin to, to an informer.  Another heroin addict like me was with the, the policeman was with him, an agent, you know.  When I sold it to him, the agent is watching me sell heroin to this other guy so that's, convicted me of selling heroin but I was selling to keep my own habit up, I wasn't what you call a dealer, I was an addict peddler.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So they gave me four and a half year, I mean, six years on each one of the counts.  And I served four and a half years and got out on good behavior.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, during that era John Coltrane almost died in Los Angeles [California]; right?  And, of an overdose (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He took a overdose.
Speaker 2: It was 1950.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Where did you get that information?
Speaker 2: That's, I, I'm, I'm not sure where it came from.
Speaker 1: I know where it came from.
Speaker 2: Do you?  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then--
Speaker 1: I seen two geniuses take a overdose.
Speaker 2: So, who was the other one?
Speaker 1: Charlie Parker.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And now in Dayton [Ohio], though--
Speaker 1: Yeah, but as we're getting back to Dayton--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --there was a woman came around, a girl, and she said, "Oh, y'all ain't gonna get high, this stuff is so cut down here and watered down you ain't gonna get high putting that stuff up your nose."  She say, "I got my works here."  I say, "Works?"  And she convinced me and a couple of us to let her stick that needle in there and that was the dumbest thing I ever (laughter) did because four and a half years in jail, seven years of, total of about six or seven years I was on heroin before I went and the, the four and a half years in.  But the, the blessing is, the day I got out, my brother [Percy Heath, Jr.] introduced me to my wife [Mona Brown Heath].
Story_ID: 649430
Speaker 1: Now, the, before we get there, I just wanna point out that when you were, you were in, what was it called, the--?
Speaker 2: Lexington [U.S. Public Health Service Hospital; Federal Medical Center, Lexington, Lexington, Kentucky]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Lexington, yeah, when you were there--
Speaker 2: That's a drug, cure it was supposed to be, cure.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, when you were there Judy Garland was there?
Speaker 2: There's a lot of people were in there.
Speaker 1: Peter Lorre.
Speaker 2: Peter Lorre, yeah, the actor.
Speaker 1: And but it was, but to tell the truth though, I mean, the public perception was that it was black jazz musicians were all the heroin addicts or, or there--
Speaker 2: Eh.
Speaker 1: --if you were involved in black music you were gone be a heroin addict?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: A lot of people thought that and--
Speaker 2: Well jazz, and there was a certain period when bebop players 'cause you didn't mention the none, other ones I could tell you, Philly Joe Jones, Kenny Dorham, you didn't mention them.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Elmo Hope, you didn't mention none of them when you read that list.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: The problem is it was the big gangsters had this drug and they put it in the ghetto and we get, we get sucked in by this trend and then we messed up for life.  See--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Did--
Speaker 2: --Gene Ammons, Sonny Stitt, you know, all these guys, man.  But it, it was really stupid because, you know, a lot of them died.  Charlie Parker was thirty four.
Speaker 1: Is there, was there a relationship between the club owners and the drugs?
Speaker 2: Huh.  I could imagine that there was some but I don't, I don't, in my connections there were not, the club owner was not into.  The only bad deal I had was in Washington, D.C., and that guy was a lawyer and he ran out without paying me.  He owed me $900, something like that.
Speaker 1: I was wondering like, what was the, well, what was the relationship between the, the mob and, and the drug--
Speaker 2: Well, the mobs had the drugs and they had us black guys selling for them.  The, the big gangsters had the, had the, they didn't use it.  They had the pushers, they had the real drug pushers and, yeah.  And what they now call substance abuse 'cause white kids are using it (laughter) in the suburbs and everything now it's substance abuse but when we were using heroin they called them dope fiends.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And you're addicts and this and all that.  But now they say, "Oh, these kids out in Long Island [New York], they're into substance abuse."
Speaker 1: Right.  As, as we sit here today, we're in the midst of the biggest heroin use epidemic in the history of the country.
Speaker 2: Back.
Speaker 1: Yeah, back, I mean, it's, it's back with a, it's, it's bigger now than it was then.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, mostly white kids in the suburbs.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They found out what it's about.  The, the, you know, it's, it's just stupid, man.
Story_ID: 649431
Speaker 1: But once you get into it, that girl that brought that needle in that backstage of that theater--
Speaker 2: That would be the Palace Theatre (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in Dayton [Ohio].
Speaker 2: --in Dayton, the Palace, yeah.
Speaker 1: In Dayton.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Sugar Chile Robinson was a boogie woogie piano player.  He was a young man at twelve or thirteen or fourteen years old and he could play the boogie woogie, (scats) you know, and then he--
Speaker 2: I think I saw him in a movie ['No Leave, No Love'].  Weren't, weren't there a movie?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but--
Speaker 2: He was in--
Speaker 1: Well, he's, he got to be (laughter) to twenty or thirty and he disappeared 'cause he ain't no novelty anymore.  Now, they got another little kid from Indonesia, Joey Alexander, and he's a monster, I think he's, this, this kid I think he's reincarnated, (laughter) he, to play that advanced.
Speaker 2: He plays jazz?
Speaker 1: Whew.  He plays all Coltrane's 'Giant Steps' and all that stuff at eight and nine, an Indonesian kid, Joey Alexander.  He's a, the, the world is his.  His rep [reputation] is growing.
Speaker 2: Now, let me ask you this though, so, as I was saying when I was growing up--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I mean, we listened to jazz at home sometimes but there was, it seemed to be stigmatized because people would say, "Well, the musicians are all high," all that kind of stuff, you know.  And it wasn't, I mean, it was like a general idea that jazz musicians led a lifestyle where they was always high and, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that sort of thing.  But what are your thoughts on, 'cause you were arrested a couple of times before, before you did the four and a half years--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in Lexington [U.S. Public Health Service Hospital; Federal Medical Center, Lexington, Lexington, Kentucky].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: What are your thoughts on, on the way the country deals with drug addiction now?  I mean, is it a crime?  Should it be a crime or should it be a, a medical--
Speaker 1: It should be a medical problem.  They should be able to go to a rehab place and get clean those who, you know, that's, and that's probably what's gonna happen because they are using it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when you think of a person like yourself or John Coltrane--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --being addicted to heroin.
Speaker 1: Miles [Miles Davis].
Speaker 2: Miles, you know, I mean, all different kinds of people, I guess--
Speaker 1: Dizzy [Dizzy Gillespie] didn't use no heroin.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: John Lewis, the piano player with Modern Jazz Quartet, my brother, Percy [Percy Heath, Jr.], no.
Speaker 2: But, but the kind of people that use it run the gamut, they're not bad people, they're people that got hooked on it; right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, man.  It was a, it was a, a, a bad move.  When you make that move and you get this pleasure from the first time you really, it's just like gambling.  If you win a jackpot you going to be a gambler the rest of your life, you know, 'cause you're (laughter) trying to get some more of that.  The, the heroin thing is so addictive.  And when you ain't got it, man, you're sick as hell, and you're gonna do anything you can to get it.
Story_ID: 649432
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you're in Lexington [U.S. Public Health Service Hospital; Federal Medical Center, Lexington, Lexington, Kentucky], you're actually, you actually, they, they had a band; right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And there were other musicians--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --professional musicians in--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --in jail.  And you were the leader of the band, right?  So you also had a chance to write and compose and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, and was your, well, let me ask you this first of all, was, this is where you basically got off of heroin, right, in, in, jail; right?  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, I mean, how, how was it--
Speaker 2: Sure, that's how--
Speaker 1: --did they make it, I mean, was it, it had to be really hard to do--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  What they call cold turkey.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And that's, you get sick, sick, sick, sick.  I mean, you get sick, man.  You can't sleep, you can't do nothing, you're, oh, you're in pain, it's stupid.  And, and, and, you know, the first, when you're in a place like Lexington they have, were trying different stuff to, to kick habits.  They were trying to, all these synthetic drugs.
Speaker 1: Methadone?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They came up with all these different things when you're in Lexington but when you get in the real penitentiary like Lewisburg [United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania] where I was in Pennsylvania--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: And that's where you were for four and a half years, you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 649433
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But I met, I, in, you know, Bruce Lundvall was--
Speaker 2: How do you, how do you spell his name?
Speaker 1: Bruce, B-R-U-C-E, Lundvall, L-U-N-D-V-A-L-L, I think.  He was going to Bucknell College [Bucknell University, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania] which is near Lewisburg penitentiary [United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania].  Now, Bruce had heard me on Miles Davis records in '53 [1953], 'cause I got busted in '55 [1955].  And he had one of those records in his office when he became the jazz producer with Columbia Records.  But he came in the joint when I was in the joint and heard me with the band in the joint and he sent me a tape of it about two years ago, he passed last year.  Bruce Lundvall was the head, and then he left CBS [CBS Records], Columbia and went to Capitol [Capitol Records], another company, Blue Note, he went to Blue Note Records.  But Bruce and his buddy who were going to college at the time, they came in to see me 'cause they know, they knew I was a professional musician, I was busted then, so they came in while they were in college.  And that's a, a, a stroke of good luck 'cause when the Heath Brothers got with CBS, Columbia Records, it's because Bruce had met me, he had heard my music with Miles before I went to jail and then he came in the joint and heard me again and then we started a group the Heath Brothers and made a few records like, the one you talking about 'Passing,' 'Passing Thru' with my mother [Arlethia Wall Heath] and father [Percy Heath, Sr.] on the cover.
Speaker 2: 'Marchin' On!,' yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Marchin' On!'
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then we made the one for Columbia called 'Passing Thru', the first one.  But, you know, some good came out of a bad thing, that when my brother [Percy Heath, Jr.] introduced me to my wife, Mona [Mona Brown Heath], and we will be married fifty-seven years February the 4th.  So I got, we got with CBS Records, my son, Mtume [James Mtume] was with a subsidiary of CBS and he had hits with Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway, 'The Closer I Get to You,' number two in the world under the Bee Gees, 'Stayin' Alive' was number one.  So Mtume ended up with five gold records or something like that with Stephanie Mills and all these different people.  And then he got sampled by Biggie [Biggie Smalls], and everybody, he's been sampled forty something times, and then he got the TV show, 'New York Undercover,' he was doing the music for that.  Now my, now my son, Mtume, (laughter) he don't do nothing but drink Heinekens and he played with Miles, you know, what I'm saying?  So there's a period when cats started to wake up and get away from that.  That's, you know, there's a few of them out there now, a couple of jazz musicians still into this dumb stuff, but most of the younger guys when they came into this movement of crossover jazz, well, I ain't naming all the people who used things, there are still a couple of other big namers, but, you know, that period from the '50s [1950s], from '59 [1959] when I came home and I, we got with CBS Records probably in, I think, it was around '59 [1959] or, we made four albums for CBS, Columbia Records, the Heath Brothers.  And they were, they were doing good.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But we happened to be on a label that was, had Billy Joel, (laughter) Michael Jackson, and when we sell thousands, they're selling millions so we got dumped after four records.  However, we started out selling 20,000 records, this was good for jazz.  Then we sold 25,000 and got nominated for a Grammy [Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Group].  Then we sold 30,000 or something and 40,000, and we on the way up and got fired (laughter).
Story_ID: 649434
Speaker 1: I'm just going to go back a little bit to when you, when, when you, when you made parole in '59 [1959] and you came, you, you met your wife, Mona Brown [Mona Brown Heath], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And she was someone who was coming to listen to the music, right?
Speaker 2: She was always, she, she had been following jazz, she was from Absecon, New Jersey, Atlantic City [New Jersey], out of Atlantic City.  And she had always been a jazz lover, artist.  She went to the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and the Rhode Island School of Design [Providence, Rhode Island] and all that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then Percy [Heath's brother, Percy Heath, Jr.] introduced me to her.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now, this is 1959 and--
Speaker 2: Fifty-nine [1959].
Speaker 1: --still, we still got a segregated America and she's a white woman; right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So was it tough to--you know--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, it hasn't been as tough.  I got flak from both sides.  I remember being in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], well, my first car I bought was a Triumph, British racing green, English sports car.  And the top is off and my wife's hair is blowing (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Keep talking, you're okay.
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  You can keep talking, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and her hair is blowing and we ride up next to a white guy in his car on this side of me, and he's looking over at me and my wife and he's mad as a bitch, man, he's mad and I could tell.  And I got this sports car, (makes sound) I'm making noise and pull, (laughter) when I pull off he's looking at me and a, a brother was parked for a left turn and he ran right in the back (laughter) of his car, his car, and I looked in my mirror and this guy was out, they was getting ready to rumble, I was gone (laughter).  So that, and then I'm in 125th Street in my Volkswagen I had at that time and some black ladies saw me, "Look at that nigger with that white bitch," you know.  So I got it from both sides but it wasn't, you know, the, the one thing that was really disheartening for me was when we were live- before we moved to New York [New York], me and wife, we're sitting on the steps of my mother [Arlethia Wall Heath] and father's [Percy Heath, Sr.] house in Philadelphia, in South Philly [South Philadelphia] where my family lived, I was there three or four, two or three years before I moved to, back to New York.
Speaker 2: So you lived at your parents' house?
Speaker 1: I lived at my parents' house.
Speaker 2: You and your wife?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We lived there after we got married.  Now, this is around the corner from the police station and the police come by, we're sitting on the steps, and they stop, "Are you all right, miss?"  She said, "Yes."  Then they pulled off.  "Are you all right, miss?"  'Cause you're sitting there with us, (laughter) with my family.  "Are you all right?"  "Yeah," she said, "yeah."  The thing is, the, the other story about that is her being named Mona Brown was suspect to the, see you, when you get out of a sentence they give you conditional release, that's where I was on for a year and a half or something like that after, to make up for the whole six years, I got out in four and a half, but I'm on fifteen months or something on conditional release if I do anything.  So I told the probation officer I say, "Oh, man, I'm getting ready to get married."  And I told him, "Mona Brown" (laughter).  And he, I know just like we're sitting here, man, he thought Mona Brown was a black lady (laughter) and when he went to say, "Oh, tell her to come by and see me, you know, so and so, that's a good thing, Heath [HistoryMaker Jimmy Heath].  You should be getting married (making sounds)."  I say, "Okay."  The moment we went up there he tried to convince her, "You know who you're marrying?  This guy is a drug addict and he been busted for this, he's a musician, he (makes sounds), he been busted two times for heroin," and he tried to convince her but she said, "No, I'm, I'm marrying this guy."  (Unclear) so that's three incidents where race come into play.
Story_ID: 649435
Speaker 1: I have a note here that Orrin Keepnews helped you get your cabaret license, and stuff, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yeah, he just passed.  And my friend, Orrin was Riverside Records'--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --guy.
Speaker 1: Right.  So--
Speaker 2: And when I got out they, Blue Note Records had gotten Coltrane [John Coltrane] and they knew how close we were and all that stuff so Cannonball Adderley and Philly Joe Jones were with Riverside and they say, "Oh, yeah, Orrin, you better get [HistoryMaker] Jimmy Heath, man, 'cause he's a guy that, you know, don't let him go over to, with Blue Note," so I signed with Riverside Records.  And during that time whenever I went to New York [New York] to record I'd have to get a leave, it's like twenty-four hour leave.  I'd come over and record with somebody (laughter) and go back to Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] until that fifteen months was over.  So I recorded with quite a few people.  And, in fact, I wrote a song called "24-Hour Leave" for the record ['Keep Swingin''] I made with Julian Priest [sic. Julian Priester], the trombone player, with Tommy Flanagan and Elvin Jones and some other people, you know.  But it was, it was incidents that I had to go through to get back on track.
Speaker 1: But your first album with Riverside was 'The Thumper'?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: And was this your first solo album?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, I mean, the--
Speaker 2: I had played with other people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Dizzy [Dizzy Gillespie] and Miles [Miles Davis] and J.J. Johnson, I had recorded with them.
Speaker 1: But this, this is a, I look at the lineup here, Nat Adderley on cornet, Curtis Fuller, trombone, Wynton Kelly, piano--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Paul Chambers, bass.
Speaker 2: That's bass, that's--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --that's Miles' guys.
Speaker 1: --Albert "Tootie" Heath--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on the drums.
Speaker 2: That's Miles' guys.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I had, when I got out, Miles, Miles told the people, you know, Trane split Miles and he sent for me, to California.  And when I got to Chicago [Illinois], the Regal Theater, the probation officer say, "Well, when you're back in town stop by and see me," and they put the damper on me that I couldn't go back out.  I said, "Man, look, this is the best job I've ever had," and Miles was paying me a good salary, "you mean to tell me, 'you gotta stay within a ninety mile radius of, until your, what you call it is over'?"  So they put the clamp on me with, when I went back with Miles 'cause I had been with Miles in '53 [1953] before Coltrane but that (gesture) what you call, messed me up.
Story_ID: 649436
Speaker 1: Now, what was Miles Davis like?  I know, we, we've asked like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, Miles Davis was a great guy.  He wasn't as evil as some people thought; but he was, you know, he had his ways of, he had a lot of black pride, you know, he wouldn't take nothing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know he--
Speaker 2: You couldn't, you couldn't, no, he wouldn't take low on nobody.  He just was a proud person.  But he's a middle class guy.  His father [Miles Davis, Jr.] was a big-time doctor (laughter) or something so he came up in the middle, he wasn't on no welfare, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they, they all, the story of him like turning his back on the audience and that sort of thing (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh, well, see he did that to let, to take the attention off of himself and, and let the soloist who's playing when he's not playing be paid attention to.  So that was a, you know, that was a, a bad impression of what he was doing.  Diagno- you know, they diagnosed it to be he was arrogant and all that but he was not.
Speaker 1: It's interesting.  We've interviewed [HistoryMaker] Wa- Wayne Shorter and [HistoryMaker] Herbie Hancock, I know at least say, they, they, they talk about Miles Davis--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in a very affectionate way.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And they said he was really a nice person.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Which is against what, what the general (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --idea of it is.  Yeah.  They, they, they both did his voice in the interview (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Said, "Yeah, that's right--" (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: "Hey, James [HistoryMaker Jimmy Heath], say give him a, give him, I want you to go on an interview on my book."  I say, "Well, when I write my book you gonna?"  "Yeah."  But he died before he (laughter) gave an interview for my book ['I Walked With Giants: The Autobiography of Jimmy Heath,' Jimmy Heath and Joseph McLaren].  And, but I gave an interview and the guy, what's that guy's name [Quincy Troupe] that wrote the book on Miles ['Miles: The Autobiography,' Miles Davis and Quincy Troupe]?  He put all the words in Miles' mouth, all I said, two hours or three hours interview.
Speaker 1: Oh, he put your, your testimony in Miles' mouth, in a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do, do musicians normally trust writers?  I mean, I mean and people that (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Well, there are some.
Speaker 1: 'Cause there's a, even the movie about Miles ['Miles Ahead'] is about a writer trying to get an interview with Miles and Miles saying, "I don't even want, I don't even wanna do this 'cause I know" (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That movie--
Speaker 1: --"how you all are," you know.
Speaker 2: --that movie is corny.
Speaker 1: Is it?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they made him a gangster with guns and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: That was Hollywood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know people who hates it, actors and stuff, they wanna know why what you call it would put out a movie like that and belittle Miles.  You don't put out a, a, a, a new movie on Duke Ellington?  Why?  They got Gershwin [George Gershwin], why?  See he didn't get no drugs and no womanizing or whatever.
Speaker 1: So, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They choose.
Story_ID: 649437
Speaker 1: So you started, so you start with Riverside [Riverside Records]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Fifty-nine [1959].
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And you replace Coltrane [John Coltrane] with Miles' quintet [Miles Davis Quintet]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And there's something about, there's a note in here about Miles' band working in a modal style and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that was, was that easy to do?  Was that hard to do?
Speaker 2: No, it was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --difficult--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because I hadn't been used to it.  He was playing modal music like his hits, his biggest records he ever made were, Miles [Miles Davis], was it Miles, the one with "So What" (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'All Blues' [sic. 'Kind of Blue'].
Speaker 2: 'All Blues'--
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, "So What" and--
Speaker 2: --and "So What."
Speaker 1: --'All Blues.'
Speaker 2: That's the biggest selling jazz record of all time.  Won a, and that was with modal, the music was modal in that it stayed on one particular mode and didn't have all the chord changes and the different harmonies like the music he had been playing before, like playing Broadway and the 'American Songbook' ['Great American Songbook'] where songs went around different keys and moved, the music was very fluid and modal music is staying with one bass line or something and playing different stuff on top of that.  So when I went with him out in California it was difficult for me to fit in to that but he was gonna take me all, all the way but the probation officer made me come back home and then that settled that; and then he end up getting Sonny Stitt or somebody else, Hank Mobley or somebody.
Story_ID: 649438
Speaker 1: Tell us about 'Really Big!'.
Speaker 2: Well, 'Really Big!' was my second album with Riverside [Riverside Records] and that was a, a tentet.  And the, the title is, it's almost like a big band but it's not so I called it 'Really Big!'  And it had Cannonball Adderley and Nat Adderley and Clark Terry.  It was my first affair with Clark Terry.  And Clark Terry was a person, he loved my music, my arrangements and stuff so much he said he would, would play on my records for union scale and that was a big deal, man, 'cause Clark Terry was on 'Tonight Show' ['The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'] and he was making all kinds of money, but he said he would just, he liked my music so much he would play for union scale.  Of course, that was all right with the Orrin Keepnews and the company, you know, 'cause they didn't have to pay him a lot of extra money.  But that's the one where Pat Patrick [Laurdine "Pat" Patrick], you were talking about on the baritone.  And I used the French horn on that record.  See I'm a person who, I'm a saxophone player basically, but I like a whole lot of different instruments, and I love the French horns.  I've got maybe four or five CDs [compact discs] where I use French horn.  I like that sound.  I like big band sound.  I like the tentet sound, three saxophones and four brass, seven and three rhythm.  That's what 'Really Big!' was in 1960 when I made that.  And I wrote this song called "Big 'P'" for my brother, Percy [Percy Heath, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Right, right.  This is the era when you start like naming songs after people, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm always doing that.
Speaker 1: Dedicating the--
Speaker 2: People I love.  Dedications, yeah, I, got dog it.
Speaker 1: Oh, what, what?
Speaker 2: I got a, I got a whole list of dedications.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: But I'd have to send them to you if you're gone use them in something.
Speaker 1: Well, people can read, they can find out.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: If they listen to this, they can, you know, today--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you can go on the Internet and find out all of them, probably.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But that's, that's interesting though.
Speaker 2: No, but I, I'm a list maker.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Like I'll make a list of all the drummers I've played with and all the piano players I've played with; and all of them gets up in the hundred over my lifetime, you know.
Story_ID: 649439
Speaker 1: I asked earlier before we started this like--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what was your, what was your, what's your favorite saxophone to play?  'Cause, I mean, I, I always ask musicians what they like to play 'cause I think it's, it's probably important to the musician.
Speaker 2: Well, I like the tenor, but I found out in the later (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause you started off as a alto man?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I like the tenor.  But I found out in my playing of the soprano saxophone I got the most response from a audience probably and from fellow musicians.  And I, you know, that, like Milt Jackson, and, and Dizzy [Dizzy Gillespie] 'cause I played with both of them a lot.  "Oh, man, where is the soprano?  Where is the soprano?"  You know.  The same thing happened to Coltrane [John Coltrane] now.  Once he start playing the soprano, 'My Favorite Things' and all that stuff, you know, they wanted to hear the soprano.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's funny, it seems to be a center of, a lot of tenor players end up playing soprano, but they skip the alto in the middle.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, well, it's a different key.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's one thing.  The tenor and the soprano is the same key.  You, you can, if you play one you can play the other.
Speaker 1: See I didn't--I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: It's a B flat instrument.  It's just an octave higher than the tenor.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but the E Flat alto (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now Pharoah Sanders, [HistoryMaker] Wayne Shorter--
Speaker 2: --is a octave higher than the baritone.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Baritone and alto.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.  I just didn't realize that but I know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but they go more than that.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I said like--
Speaker 2: They go--
Speaker 1: --Shorter, Pharoah Sanders, Gary Bartz, a, a lot of them play either (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Soprano.
Speaker 1: --soprano or--
Speaker 2: Well, he--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and Bartz played the alto and the soprano.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: He's one that can jump between--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he can, you know, I could play soprano, alto.  I played it on a couple of things.  Orrin [Orrin Keepnews] asked me to do it on a couple of records.
Speaker 1: And you (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)_And I went back to the alto.
Speaker 1: Then you got a guy like Yusef Lateef will play the tenor and the flute, play the flute.
Speaker 2: Oh, he's a super flute player.  But he also is a oboe player.  And so what call you him, Illinois Jacquet would play the bassoon and he'd play jazz bassoon, you know.  So all of those instruments, I like all of those instruments and their sound, you know.  I'm not stuck on just the saxophone.
Speaker 1: In terms of, did you know Roland Kirk?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, Rahsaan.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Rahsaan Roland Kirk.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I know I, once I was playing Roland Kirk in the car and my daughter was asking me who that was and I said, "That's Rahsaan Roland Kirk.  And he was playing like three horns at"--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --"the same time."  And she said, "Oh, Daddy, come on now, nobody can do that."  Now, (laughter) I had to show her pictures of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) but (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he was actually playing three.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he played, yeah.  The stritch and the manzello and the tenor, yeah, he was a talented guy.
Speaker 1: And then in '60s [1960s], I mean, there was some, I remember a brother named Rufus Harley played the bagpipes.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  He's Philly.
Speaker 1: What?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Rufus Harley.
Speaker 1: And I'm mentioning him because you mentioned the bassoon and the oboe and (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and a lot of, Rufus Harley played the bagpipes, and then Roland Kirk playing everything.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, I mean, there were, there were a lot of--
Speaker 2: Doubling and, and playing other instruments.
Speaker 1: What did you think of 'The Electrified Eddie Harris' [sic. 'The Electrifying Eddie Harris']?  Now, in the late '60s [1960s] he emerged (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Eddie was good.  Eddie--
Speaker 1: --he, he emerges with the electrified--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --sax.
Speaker 2: Eddie was good.  He had a lot of talent.
Speaker 1: I think, you know, if you can play anyway does it, Ornette Coleman played a plastic saxophone, no problem, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --fiberglass sax.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, he played the plastic.
Speaker 1: And people didn't like that.  I mean, they, they didn't like to, they thought, they were shocked when they saw it, when they saw him come out with a fiberglass sax.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: But he certainly could play.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he could play.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, and that's gone.  That's the drummer that was with him that I wrote the "Smilin' Billy Suite," Billy Higgins, the one that played with Ornette and Don Cherry, trumpet.  They were playing a, a new form of jazz, free--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --from harmonies.

Speaker 1: As you get into the, you get married [to Mona Brown Heath] in '60 [1960] as we said before.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And now, now, you moved to New York [New York]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in '64 [1964]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the, the year of the World's Fair, right?  The New York World's Fair [1964 New York World's Fair]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was over there.
Speaker 1: And it was over in Queens [New York], same place?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right across from--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --where I live.  I can see the building now.  It's over there, the tennis now, Arthur Ashe tennis stadium [Arthur Ashe Stadium] is over there now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's where I live now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so what, did you, and that was an interesting era, the World's Fair being there, it was on TV all the time.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I know all the kid shows, you know, had--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --segments on the World's Fair (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I, I--
Speaker 1: Everything from 'Captain Kangaroo'--
Speaker 2: What you call him got me in that place, Clark Terry and Cannonball Adderley, they were staying in the, it's the Dorie Miller Co-op [Dorie Miller Residential Cooperative, Queens, New York].  Dorie Miller is a World War II [WWII] hero.  He was the one that came out of the galley, you know, we weren't supposed to be able to shoot guns, all we could do is cook.  And Dorie Miller came out of the galley and shot down a couple of Japanese planes.  And it's ironic because a year or so ago they finally came to our buildings over there.  You know, who put, who put the buildings there was Adam Clayton Powell [Adan Clayton Powell, Jr.].  Adam Clayton Powell is the one that's responsible for us putting the Dorie Miller, he wanted to build these six buildings, co-op apartments to get those who wanted to move out of Harlem [New York, New York] to move to Queens.  So he's the one, because now, and when you look around now, Fred Trump had buildings out in that same area, we couldn't go in them.  Black people couldn't live in Mr. Fred Trump's buildings.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the father of Donald Trump [President Donald John Trump] the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the millionaire.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's where he gets that from.  He's a racist--he's talking about, when they asked him yesterday on TV about his heroes, he didn't name nobody but his father.
