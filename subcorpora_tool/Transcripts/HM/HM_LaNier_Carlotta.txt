Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer for the HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Observing is Julianna Richardson.  And we're interviewing Carlotta LaNier, one of the members of the Little Rock Nine.    Okay.  Can you describe this photo for us?
Speaker 2: Sure.  This is a photo that was taken in the summer of 1958 at the NAACP's office, if I'm not mistaken, headquarters in New York City.  And to the--starting, yes, from that in the right is Roy Wilkins and myself, Carlotta Walls LaNier, and Herb--I can't remember his last name, but he was over the educational arm of the NAACP, Terrence Roberts, Melba Beals or Melba Pattillo Beals now, Ernie Green--Ernest Green, Jefferson Thomas, Thelma Mothershed-Wair, Minnijean Brown Trickey, Elizabeth Eckford, Gloria Ray Karlmark; all of the Little Rock Nine.
Speaker 1: Next.
Speaker 2: That picture was taken in the stairwell at Little Rock Central High School in 1997.  It is the nine of us, and was one that I really admired of us aged.  And I can point those out as well starting with Terrence Rob--Doctor Terrence Roberts, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Jefferson Thomas, Minnijean Brown Trickey, Ernest Green, Thelma Mothershed-Wair, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Elizabeth Eckford; and in the center, Melba Pattillo Beals.
Speaker 1: Next.
Speaker 2: Again, this was a photo that was used in Newsweek Magazine in 1997, in front of the Little Rock Central High School in preparation for the fortieth anniversary that was going to be held in September.  This picture was taken I think in August.  To the left is Carlotta Walls LaNier, Melba Beals--Melba Pattillo Beals, Doctor Terrence Roberts, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Thelma Mothershed-Wair, Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, Minnijean Brown Trickey, and Jefferson Thomas.  This was a centerfold in the Newsweek.  It was supposed to be on the front of Newsweek; however, Ted Turner had gave ten billion dollars, I think, and bumped us off.  And I can understand that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Next please.
Speaker 2: This picture was--
Speaker 1: You've got to (unclear).  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: This picture was taken at the White House in President Clinton's first administration.  It was January, honoring [Martin Luther] King's Birthday.  It was the first time that all civil rights participants over the years were invited to the White House.  So a number of us were there.  I would say a good 300 people or more.  And it was a reception that President Clinton wanted to do, and this was my, oh, third encounter of being in the presence of now, at that time, President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Next please.
Speaker 2: This picture was taken--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).  Okay.
Speaker 2: This picture was taken in 1997 at the fortieth anniversary.  It was a reception that was held on a--by Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, who sponsored that reception.  And in this picture we have Bob Nash, who was the President's--President Clinton's--I'm not quite sure of his particular title--he was kind of the head man in charge; Alexis Herman, who was at that point in time Secretary of Labor; and I think Terrence Roberts behind there, then Jefferson Thomas, myself, Thelma Mothershed- Wair, Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Melba Pettillo Beals, the secretary of--Slater, Rodney Slater, Department of--he could have been over Transportation then.  I'm not sure what his position was, but he became later Department of--Secretary of Transportation; Minnijean Brown Trickey, President Clinton, and in front is Mrs. Daisy Bates; and the other three around her, I think, two were nephews, and I'm not sure about the other person.
Speaker 1: All right.  Thank you.  Next please.
Speaker 2: Yes, some air would be nice. This picture was taken right after the program that was held for the fortieth anniversary on the grounds of Little Rock Central High School.  It was quite a momentous occasion.  The nine of us walked to--after the program, we were asked to stand in front of the school, in front of the doors of Little Rock Central High; and that was Thelma Mothershed-Wair, Minnijean Brown Trickey, Ernest Green--I'm sorry, Jefferson Thomas, Doctor Terrence Roberts, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, Melba Pattillo Beals.  Behind us was the mayor of Little Rock, Mayor Daley; the governor of Arkansas, Governor Busby; and the President of the United States.  They're clapping for us at that point in time.  It was ten thousand people out on the--children out on the grounds; and after that, the three political figures there opened the doors to Little Rock Central High as it should have been in their various statements, forty years prior.
Speaker 1: Next please,
Speaker 2: This picture was--
Speaker 1: (unclear) Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Yes.  This picture was taken on the grounds of Philander Smith College, another activity during the fortieth anniversary week.  And this picture was taken with President Clinton, who had--actually Mrs. Clinton gave the address at this particular affair.
Speaker 1: (unclear)  This will be recorded for people who will be preparing captions from some of your (unclear) descriptions.  Could you spell "Philander," please?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Philander is, P-H-I-L-A-N-D-E-R, Philander Smith, S-M-I-T-H.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.  Next photo.
Speaker 2: Well, this was a picture taken in 1957, a picture of my mother who had prepared breakfast for me one morning prior to going to school.  And looking at the clothing it was probably late-October, November, December timeframe, especially if I was eating pancakes, it appears.
Speaker 1: (unclear).
Speaker 2: This picture was taken at the White House after receiving the Congressional Gold Medal.  We all had the opportunity for our families to take a picture with the president.  And in this picture is my youngest sister, Tina Walls; a nephew, Brian Henry; a cousin, Kevin Cullins; a niece, Shonna Terry [ph.]; my son in the back, Whitney LaNier; and my daughter, which you can't see too well, Brooke LaNier, next to President Clinton; my husband, Ira LaNier; and to his left is a niece, Marian Henry; my sister-in-law Shirley Henry; myself, Carlotta Walls LaNier; my mother, Juanita Walls, in front of President Clinton; and my middle sister, Loujuana Terry.
Speaker 1: All right.  Very good.  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: This picture was taken in 1997 at the fortieth reunion--I mean fortieth anniversary at--in Little Rock [Arkansas].  And after opening the doors at Little Rock Central High School, we all, again--well, this was the first time for a family photo with the President of the United States and Mrs. Clinton and--who is on the left; Mrs. Clinton, my uncle Med Cullins; a cousin and judge, Judge Joyce Warren, who happened to be in the first administration with Governor Bill Clinton, who had worked with Hillary Clinton; a great aunt who is the matriarch of our family; Mrs. M. E. Beard, who lives in Chicago, Illinois; myself, Carlotta Walls LaNier; my mother, Juanita Walls; my sister Loujuana Terry; my youngest sister, Tina Walls; and in the back row is a cousin, Jonathan Warren, who is Judge Warren's son, oldest son; President Clinton; my son, Whitney LaNier; and my husband, Ira LaNier; and my daughter, Brooke LaNier; again, not able to get into the picture.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)  I can see the back of her head.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What about this one?
Speaker 2: This picture I'm pretty proud of, too.  It was on the front page of the New York Times, and it was a picture of the celebration of the fortieth reunion that we had been discussing--other pictures had been about.  And this was on the stage in--on the platform, and during the program.  And I was sitting to the right of President Clinton, and that's Gloria Ray Karlmark; Ernest Green, who gave the keynote--well, he didn't give the keynote address, but basically thanked all of the--all of those that were involved in having this activity; and then Elizabeth Eckford.  And let me see if there's anything I'm supposed to say about
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Yeah, go ahead and (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  Sure, right.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was in the New York Times, on the front.  (unclear).  This--I decided to bring this.  This was a quite an honor.  My mother was on the cover of Jet Magazine in 1957, I think that is.
Speaker 1: 1958
Speaker 2: '58 (1958), okay.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Oh, that's good. 1958.  And, that was during the times when the schools were closed and they were still keeping the news before the country about what was happening in Little Rock; the schools were closed during that time.  But fortunately, they put Mrs. Carlotta Walls on there when they should have put Mrs. Juanita Walls.  But that's my mother.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was very upset with it.
Speaker 1: This is Carlotta Walls (unclear).
Speaker 2: (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--the woman who tried to kill King and (unclear) (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).  She didn't like that.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) there anything on the inside (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I can't remember to be honest with you.
Speaker 1: I don't think I have either (unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay, this--
Speaker 1: You don't have to (unclear)
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  No. That's good.  Well, here, I don't know.  I just--this, oh, yeah--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: It was probably a regular Kodak--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--getting a Kodak (unclear)?
Speaker 2: --during those days (laughter).  Yeah, in fact, that medal was in that long one.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  (unclear).  Oh, you got a medal?  Oh, you got the medal (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I just happened to--I kept that picture within the--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Next picture.  (unclear).
Speaker 2: That was a picture taken once I--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: That was a picture taken once I had returned from Cleveland, Ohio, from the national convention of the NAACP, where the nine of us and Mrs. Bates received the Spingarn Medal, the highest medal given by the NAACP.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay.  This--that was--
Speaker 1: Do you want them all?
Speaker 2: Well, it's up to you. I mean--yeah, that one was--must have been (unclear) me and my mother and Mrs. Bates.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)  These are from the same issue of Jet, right?
Speaker 2: No, that's--well, it's nineteen--what year is that?  That's '58 (1958) as well.  That's another Jet Magazine.  It's not the one that she's on the front of.
Speaker 1: In that case  shoot the cover (unclear).
Speaker 2: It's just my mother's birthday.
Speaker 1: Okay, now.  All right.  Next picture.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And this was during the days that the schools were closed.  And Saundra (ph.) Johnson just happened to be--she was not a part of the Little Rock Nine, but she signed to go the next year.  And because schools were closed, naturally, she was--this article was about what some of us were doing.  And, I think the article has to speak to what was going on throughout the country, actually, regarding integration.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And this, again, is--well, at the front--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  (laugher)
Speaker 1: (Unclear).  I wonder if they're going to return again, you know--(unclear).
Speaker 2: This was--you see the date on it?  '94 (1994).
Speaker 1: That's '97 (1997) (unclear).  Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's when the civil rights heroes were honored at the White House by the President and Mrs. Clinton and inside
Speaker 1: Okay, ready to go to inside, yeah.
Speaker 2: And that was the picture--that was kind of a special reception for us with President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton because we're all from Arkansas, prior to going into the reception with all the other honorees.  But that was Mrs. Clinton, Ernest Green, Doctor Terrence Roberts, President Clinton; myself, Carlotta Walls LaNier, and Jefferson Thomas who had attended this big reception.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: And the one on the bottom is--that's just  other people that were at the Browns; Thurgood Marshall Junior--I don't know who the others are; Mrs. Clinton and President Clinton, yes, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.  (unclear)
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is the yearbook
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Central High School yearbook
Speaker 2: This yearbook, I've had to have rebound, too, so that's why.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It has all of, you know, I mean we can discuss it at a later time but, you know, some of the little inscriptions from some students there.  But in all the pictures, the pictures tell about--in words, as they say, about the 101st Airborne being there.  You might want to--you might want to show them this one.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Oh, at that time, there was a wading pool in the front.  This is where the fortieth anniversary was held on these grounds, but the landscaping had changed, as you can tell from the other pictures that you have already taken.  But this was nineteen ninety--1957.
Speaker 1: That's why I asked (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right.  Little Rock Central High School in 1957.  Take the one with the helicopter, right there.  It's probably not a good picture, but just to give you an idea, I mean, there was a helicopter buzzing over the school when you're trying to have classroom activity. The--to the left you would see the pictures of the Airborne with their guns, and basically they were (unclear) there for awhile on the grounds of Little Rock Central High.  That was the commanding officer to the left, left picture right there in the middle and down below.  I guess he was--and the picture to the right--over.  That was when to keep us out basically.  And then above it is showing the--some of the sidebys and the mob.  These are just various pictures that were taken by the students during that time that made up the yearbook, and they did not want to ignore what really took place, so, there it is   The one where you have the clip--you want to go to the clip.  No, turn it the other--yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  Barbara Barnes on the right--when I speak to high school students or college, you know, when I take this book--if you want--I don't know whether the clip is what you--there you.  She happens to live here in the metropolitan Denver [Colorado] area.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She was a senior at the time and in--really in Ernie Green's class as a senior, senior class.  But she happened to be a person that, who gave us a friendly smile during our times there.  Senior really didn't speak to sophomores, and I was a sophomore, but I knew who she was because she was one that was involved in a lot of school activities.  So this is a positive force, a positive person from that era, from that time.  And I always like to show this one when I'm speaking to groups because I don't want it to seem as if all of it was bad.  It was bad enough, it's no question about that, but there are good people in the school; some had their issues where they could not speak out as they would have liked to.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: There you go right--that was right next to the homeroom teacher.  That was always the case (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Go ahead with the (unclear).
Speaker 2: This is my tenth grade class--my homeroom class.  Pauline Dunn (ph.) was the homeroom teacher, and this was the sophomore--one of the sophomore classes.  And my--the students in my homeroom, surrounded by them.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: That's right.  And, yeah.  Okay.  That picture was taken at the reception that was given by Southwestern Bell in 1997, at the fortieth anniversary.  That is Mrs. Elizabeth Huckaby who was the vice president--I mean vice principal of Little Rock Central High when we were going through our crisis.  She's written--her memoirs were put into a movie, "Crisis at Little Rock," and she happened to be my English teacher as well.  I think a lot fell on her more so than the principal and the male vice principal.  That's myself to the left and my husband to the right.  I was introducing--this is a picture of that--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Okay.  That was a little plaque that I thought I'd bring.  It was used on the--in 1958 we were invited to Washington, D.C., for the National Convention of the Elks, and they had a parade and there were nine desks on this float, and that was just, we sat behind each desk and they had our names on them.  I just happened to still have it and I thought I'd bring it.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay.  That is something that I worked for, my Central High School diploma.  I--this is the last of the Little Rock Nine diplomas, and Ernie Green received the first and, I, being the youngest of the group when I graduated in 1960.
Story_ID: 55541
Speaker 1: Probably something I never expected to receive, and this is the highest medal given to any civilian in the United States, and Congress passed the Act to give the Little Rock Nine the Congressional Gold Medal and we received this at the White House.  I'd like for that--the front of it is the nine of us walking up the steps of Little Rock Central High with the 101st Guard protecting us.  And I'd like for you to turn it over.  And with that it lists the nine of us and it states on there, is it "Courage First?"
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: Yeah, "Courage, bravery, justice, and opportunity."  That's on the back of the Congressional Gold Medal, with the list of the--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) 1998.
Speaker 1: --1998.  We received it in November of 1990, but Congress did pass that.  And I applaud Congress because you've got to get both sides of the House to agree to do something of this nature.  To be among the list from George Washington, the first President of the United States; we were the last to receive the Congressional Gold Medal in the twentieth century and actually, Congress had not passed any Acts or any Bills for giving out the Congressional Gold Medal; probably ten, fifteen, twenty years prior to that.  So we felt rather honored to receive the Congressional Gold Medal.  I know I did and I--I'm sure I speak for the other eight.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: Okay.  This medal is the Dunbar Legacy Award, and it was given at the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] convention that--Dunbar High School was the high school that we all came from, our junior senior high school.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: That's the Dunbar Legacy Award that was given -- I can't remember what year--nineteen--oh, mid '90s (1990s).  Dunbar High School has a reunion every two years, and this was held in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And this--we received their first Legacy Award.  And we all came from the Dunbar Junior-Senior High School plant--of the school system there in Little Rock which was segregated.  So it was quite an honor to receive that as well; something that they wanted to bestow on us, and as I stated in my thank-you to them that, you know, we were successful because of what we had learned there at Dunbar.  We were prepared to handle the adversities that we encountered.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: Oh, it's Dunbars, all over the United--Okay.  That's the Spingarn Medal that--you took the other picture where I was alone with a medal around my neck, and this is the medal.  And this was--we received in 1958 at the NAACP convention that was held in Cleveland, Ohio.  And the highest medal given or award given by the NAACP which in our minds was equivalent to the Congressional Gold Medal at that time among people of color; let's put it that way.  It's the highest medal.  But on the back I think it just shows--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: I don't know what has happened.  Yeah, that is the Spingarn Medal.  I'm not quite sure which side is best, but that shows our name--my name, July 11, 1958, and it-we are among a number of people that have received the Spingarn Medal.  Sammy Davis Junior happened to be one, Ossie Davis and others.  In fact, I was at a--one of their meetings in New York recently in the past two or three years, and I think it was Earl Graves who had received the Spingarn Medal.  So we are in an elite group, I would say.
Story_ID: 55542
Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewing today for the HistoryMakers.  The videographer is Scott Stearns.  Observing is Julianna Richardson.  Could you please state your name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Carlotta, C-A-R-L-O-T-T-A, Walls, W-A-L-L-S, LaNier, L-A, capital N-I-E-R.
Speaker 1: What's your date of birth?
Speaker 2: Twelve--December 18, 1942.
Speaker 1: And what's today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is June 21st, nineteen--I mean 2002.
Speaker 1: And where are we?
Speaker 2: We're in Denver, Colorado, at the Doubletree Hotel.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  And now, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am a Realtor, real estate broker.
Story_ID: 55543
Speaker 1: Okay.  I have five "People Magazine"-type questions that just require a brief answer that I need to ask you.  The first one is what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, favorite food.  I really don't have one.  Oh, let's just say salads. I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm really--I can't tell you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Oh, I like the red and the jewel colors.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Not necessarily.  I do like to vacation, but I like to see the world.  So I try to pick something different each time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year, I enjoy all of the seasons.  I really do.  So I like seasons.  So that's what I like about here as well.  Winter I do enjoy.  I enjoy summer because I play golf.  I, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Not a favorite, you know, sometimes I think of various phrases when the occasion permits.  But I do believe in people stepping up and--to the bar basically, and taking it to another level.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A higher level.
Story_ID: 55544
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your background.  Now, you were born in Little Rock, Arkansas, right?
Speaker 2: Mmm hmm.
Speaker 1: And can you tell us something about your mother and father, and their background, and where they came from?
Speaker 2: Sure.  My mother and father both are from Little Rock, Arkansas.  And my father came from a family of seven, of seven children, and was a brick mason, and his father outlived him; my father passed away at an early age of fifty-three of leukemia.  My grandfather was instrumental in my life, on both sides of the family, and he lived to be 101; my grandfather did, Porter Walls.
Speaker 1: Mrs. LaNier, can you give us their names?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: I mean your father's name?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Cartelyou Walls, C-A-R-T-E-L-Y-O-U.  And my grandfather's name was Porter Walls, P-O-R-T-E-R.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us something about your father's name.  It's an unusual name.
Speaker 2: Yes, it is an unusual name, and I'm not quite sure.
Speaker 1: (PHONE RINGING.  PAUSE)
Speaker 2: Okay, we were talking about your father's name.
Speaker 1: Yes, Cartelyou Walls.  I'm not sure exactly where his mother got the name.  It is a Spanish derivative from what I've been told.  But I can't tell you any more than that.  Other than my mother get confused as to who she was calling; whether it was Carlotta or Cartelyou.  I was called by my father's name many times.  But he was born there, and my mother also was born in Little Rock, Arkansas.  And my mother, Juanita, J-U-A-N-I-T-A, Cullins, was one of four children to Med Cullins, my other grandfather that I had a lot of--I learned a great deal from both of my grandfathers.
Speaker 2: Can you spell Cullins for us?
Speaker 1: C-U-L-L-I-N-S.  And they both graduated from Dunbar High School, and later on in years I had some of their same teaches in junior high school there, so.  And my mother was a homemaker, worked part time in a sense; various small-type jobs such as a voter's registration, helping out at the state press that Daisy Bates had; have two sisters, Loujuana Walls Terry, L-O-U-J-U-A-N-A, and who's six years younger than I; and then my youngest sister Tina Walls, T-I-N-A, who is twelve years younger than I.  So I'm the oldest of three girls.  And they were all born there as well.
Story_ID: 55545
Speaker 1: Okay.  So do you know much about your parents' background?
Speaker 2: Well, somewhat.  Yes, to a great--probably more than just somewhat.  It depends on what you're looking for, but the Walls, we are still having--I think we're in our ninetieth reunion, Walls reunion, which is a pretty long time of having consecutive reunions.  They started out in Cornerville, Arkansas, from what I understand.  And I happened to be in Seattle for one of the reunions in the '80s (1980s), and I met the Canadian Walls.  And one of them, only one of the Canadian Walls.  And you might know about the Freeman--the Walls' Freeman Museum in Canada.  A book was written by Doctor Bryan Walls, who is a dentist in Canada.  I looked at her, she looked exactly like my father, and my grandfather and her father had spoken ten or fifteen years prior.  I wish I had the time to kind of make this--the whole connection, but I've read the book; I see the family resemblance.  I just haven't been able to connect the dots.  They talk alike, my grandfather and her father's voice--pitch and so forth is very similar.  And like I said, she looked just like my father but with blue eyes.
Speaker 1: And the name of the book is "The Road that Lead to Somewhere"?
Speaker 2: That's correct.  And I had the opportunity to go up and see the museum and Bishop [Desmond] Tutu had been that person who had come there for the inauguration of that museum, which is, you know, quite an honor as well.  So it was quite a history of mine.  My son is really interested in knowing more about all of that.  I am too, I just don't have the time.  On the Cullins' side, it goes back a long way as well.  They're in Arkansas; Batesville, Arkansas.  And my grandfather was one of eleven.  And he was a general contractor.  And my father, who was a Walls, learned the business from--learned the construction business from my grandfather Med Cullins.  And Med built schools and churches throughout the state of Arkansas.  And my mother's mother, who was a Holloway, and I have a lot of history on them; it goes back to Georgia, and one--my great--I was fortunate enough to know my great-great-grandfather--my great-grandfather, Aaron Holloway, and that was, A-A-R-O-N.  His father was documented back during the late '30s (1930s), early '40s (1940s) about his growing up in Georgia, and how he had seen slaves being auctioned off and so forth.  And that was--his father was Spaniard and his mother was Indian, and from there he made the statement in his documentary that he was the only one that didn't speak the Indian language; then he migrated to Arkansas, and that's how--that's how he got there.  So a Virginia, Georgia-type.  And back to the Walls' side.  I always asked my grandfather Porter Walls about his background, especially after Roots, you know.  Everybody--Alex Haley's book, everybody was into that.  And he said to me that, all I really needed to know is that his great-grandfather was--owned property.  That's all he wanted me to understand is that they've always owned property, so meaning land.  And I guess what he was trying to tell me is that he was not a slave; that this was not a slave-type situation.  But anyway, I never was able to get any more than that from him.  And he did own quite a bit of property then in Arkansas.  That grandfather owned a lot of businesses, he was a businessman; restaurants, pool halls, and rental property, and so forth.  So I had--and I learned the business side from both of those grandfathers.  I was always around them more or less.
Story_ID: 55546
Speaker 1: So was it like growing up in--
Speaker 2: Little Rock?
Speaker 1: --Little Rock.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of Little Rock?  Can you paint a picture for us?
Speaker 2: It was a--a town that you always wanted to achieve, to do well; you were known by certain families; the neighborhood was such that they looked after you--you had to do well because--or present yourself well because the word would get back home before you'd get back home.  You took advantage of what was around you by learning from neighbors or friends or what have you.  To be in the downtown area of Little Rock, you recognized that you had a place; you knew that before you got downtown just by getting on the bus; we sat in the back of the bus.  We were--I lived in a--somewhat of an integrated neighborhood; one block was black and the next block was white, and I played with white kids from the time I was--we all did, among each other.  But, you know, school starts Labor Day, and a day after Labor Day and it's out the day before Memorial Day, and then all summer we interacted.  Downtown you did not acknowledge each other.  You might recognize one of your neighbors, but you continued to walk the street. My grandfather owned a restaurant, so it was a lot of--he cooked, my father helped him; my father barbequed on Fridays for the whole weekend, and after he got off of his regular job.  So I was around everyday people.  I recognize how you--I guess, I learned how to see all types of people and treat all people the same.  That's one thing I did learn from my family.  The food was always wholesome and good and smelled, you know, smelled well. I -- You know, as far as people were concerned, they were good people.  They were just people that worked hard; everyone was supposed to take care of their family the best way they could; the children were supposed to do well in school the best that they could.  So it was a lot of softball in the summertime, a lot of bike riding and that sort of thing.  So those are some of the--fishing was another thing.  I had a great aunt and uncle that I loved to go fishing with, and so, I could probably get a whiff of that every now and then.  I was somewhere recently and I smelled a cigar, just a brief smell of that, and all I could think about was being at Arkansas Traveler's Field in Little Rock, watching the Indianapolis Clowns or the Birmingham Barons or whatever; black baseball being played and, men smoked cigars and pipes during that time, and that whiff that--it just took me back, you know, to those days.  So it--I enjoyed the summer times in--as far as doing things because I was always an active person anyway.  So I remember getting on the small little buses being packed, you know, the city bus, to go to watch a baseball game.  We had a celebrity basically that lived there who had played for the Kansas City Monarchs, who lives here in Denver.  And that's who I lived with when I first came here.
Speaker 1: Can you name him for me please?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Byron Johnson.  Byron "Mex" Johnson.  And he's one of the few that are still living that was from the old Negro League.  And he also taught in the school system in Little Rock, and then went into the post office.  And he came here in 1958, and that's the family that I lived with.  And they're probably distant relatives.  I've always called him Uncle Byron (unclear) so.  They're responsible for me being here ever since.  But those--you know, I can't just give you any kind of smells other than probably being near the Arkansas River on occasion, you know; that sort of thing.  But I think summertime is probably the best time for me doing--as far as doing things.

Speaker 1: Can you describe your household?  I mean in a--
Speaker 2: Well, my mother and father and two sisters, and my father being a brick mason--actually they had bought the home from my great-grandfather and my father went about bricking it.  So we were one of few, one of only two had--later on, that had a brick home were on that street and, which was a big thing for black or Negroes as were called, or Coloreds, as we were called at that time.  Hardwood floors.  I helped my father lay the hardwood floors so, you know, I know a little--a lot about construction only because I was around it all the time.  And the extension of the home.  My father loved to cook, and he also did a great deal of cooking, especially on the weekend.  We had the cats and the dogs.  We had more--probably dogs than cats.  And my mother did a lot of sewing; most of my clothes were made by my mother.  And my middle sister took that art; she's very artistic as well, and she's the one of the three that has taken that characteristic of my mother to another level.  So, anyway--that's--we sat on the porch or in the yard after--at the end of the day and other kids would be in the yard, so it was a gathering place at my house.  And that lifestyle kind of continued.  I remember even when they moved, we used to have people come--relatives coming to Little Rock and they always, you know, wanted to stay at our house, which as a kid I really didn't enjoy all of that because you had to give up your bed or bedroom or what have you, and you slept on a pallet,  you know.  And I was so happy that, as years went on, people were able to stay in motels and hotels.
Speaker 1: Was it a large house?
Speaker 2: Three bedroom.  I wouldn't say large.  It was a two-bedroom house; living room, dining room, kitchen, bathroom, and then my father put an extension on which was a much larger bedroom and another bath; and actually, I had that my last year at Central.  So that--and most things were done by him or with the help of others in the family to improve upon certain things.  We were fortunate enough to have a car as well.
Story_ID: 55548
Speaker 1: What kind of little girl were you?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I mind my elders and I was a tomboy.  I loved to ride a bike with everybody, and I was pretty good at ball, at playing softball.  My mother was very young along with Uncle Byron, Byron Johnson, the ballplayer I was telling you about, were directors at the summer program at the elementary school, and so I was there every day.  So, you know, I participated in what they had.  My mother was the pitcher for the team, and she played volleyball; so those sorts of things I grew up around and so, I did those things as well.  I came along during the time that we were all proud of Jackie Robinson and Joe Louis.  And Jackie Robinson was a person that I just followed.  So I was a Brooklyn Dodgers fan.  And I had the opportunity to see him many times in St. Louis [Missouri].  And so, I was that type of person, but I was also one who knew that I could not bring a "C" home on my report card, so.  I was an "A" and "B" student, stayed that way throughout; got my first "C" at Little Rock Central High School in geometry and the only one.  I had to represent the family.  That was a part of growing up that you represented your family well.  I had to be responsible so I was a responsible person.  Didn't talk back.  You listened.  You could only speak when spoken to.  So that was my type of upbringing.  I was curious about many things.  I loved reading about other places in the world, and always wanted to get to certain places.  I was also fortunate that I had--my father's sister lived in New York [New York], so at the age of eight, I had the opportunity to go there and spend the summer, and that was how Jackie Robinson got to be, you know.  I went to the Brooklyn Dodgers games, but I spent the summer in New York, and she still lives in the same apartment that I used to visit, which is really a part of the projects there at Lincoln Center, right across the street in--the west side there.  So things that I would read and hear about, I always had dreams about, okay, and I knew things were better for others in certain parts of the world, and especially here in the United States.  And I was able to do things in New York [New York] that I couldn't do in Little Rock [Arkansas].  But I knew that things would change because my parents told me so.
Story_ID: 55549
Speaker 1: There were several questions I wanted to know, but one of the issues (unclear) I just read here that they called you half--
Speaker 2: Half-breed?
Speaker 1: --half-breed.  Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, I'm--you know--you're ready?  You know, name-calling was just a part of growing up.  And to be honest with you, when I got to Central [High School], that name-calling was just minor, because among black people to start with, we had so many different shades; unfortunately, we would say sometimes that, you know, you're high yellow or--those types of name calls, okay, among my own people.  There were many colors within my families by both sides of the family.  My father was a brown-skinned man, but some people thought I had an advantage or those that were fair skinned had an advantage.  Well, in some instances I guess we did, okay.  But at the same time, it was a disadvantage.  So it did prepare me for the name-calling that I received at Central when I, you know, that was a plus as far as that goes.  So for anyone to call me out of my name, it just runs--I consider that ignorant and move on.  I don't have time to come to that level to discuss that issue with them.  If people really wanted to dwell into this, they should recognize that everyone is mixed.  I mean history will tell you that.  But there's always a majority and a minority, and that's to keep everybody in their places, and I recognized that sort of thing.  Again, name-calling just--I just dismiss it as ignorance.  So that's where I am with that.
Story_ID: 55550
Speaker 1: Let me go back over one more thing. I'll never forget my uncle who was with the Urban League and running the program down in Colorado Springs [Colorado].  And I was working for the YWCA at that time, and this was in the '60s (1960s).  And he came to me and he said, "Carlotta, this business of being called 'black,' I don't understand it, you know.  What do you call yourself?"  And I said, "I call myself black."  And he said, "Well, to me it's just difficult to stand up there looking the way I look and for someone and for me to consider myself black."  I said, "But you're looking at it as color.  I'm not looking at it that way.  My birth certificate stated Negro, if I'm not mistaken, and I became Colored, then I became black, then I've been African-American, I've been Afro-American, I've been a person of color--I've been it all.  But I'm not going to take my wasted breath on all of that.  Whatever the going term is at that point in time in life, I just run with it."  If it--as I explained to him, I thought it elevated the group of our race to make them have a sense of worth.  And if that is what is needed, then that is what we will say.  03:04:29:28 And as far as skin color is concerned, you know, I can't even--my husband gets upset with me.  He says, "Well, you know, dark-skinned, light-skinned, da, da, da."  You know, I can't really help him out with that, you know.  Is it my color or he will say or is it--it does not matter to me.  So I just bypass all of that.  I have a lot of white-looking people in my family, and I have a lot of dark-skinned people in my family, and everything in between so, and I love them all.  So I just leave it at that.  So that was never an issue.  My issue is being respected and--for what you do.  And normally, people will try to get past some of that color issue once they get to know you and recognize what you're attempting to do or trying to do or have accomplished or what have you.  And I think, hopefully, we will get to that someday as a nation.  But, you know, I've recognized when I've traveled in Europe, I have no problems with--overall people are welcoming.  I mean, I understand what they say about people of color in the Europe, you know.  You're welcomed.  And overall, I've always felt that way.  I was never put to the side, so.  And I like that.
Story_ID: 55551
Speaker 1: Did any member of your family who are light-skinned (unclear) who have passed?
Speaker 2: Did any pass?  Not unless they had to, let's put it that way.  Yes--what am I talking about.  I have to stop, haven't even thought about this in a long time.  My great-grandfather Aaron Holloway was one of--he told me that he only knew--he was of many children, and he had a sister that lived in Cleveland, Ohio; and then he told me about his other brothers and sisters.  And I said, "Well, where are they?"  He said, "They passed.  They're white now."  "But where are they?"  "They're all in parts of the United States."  So they went on, that Holloway side, went on to be white.  In Little Rock, per se, I know my mother's--at one time I think they had white on there for a card, like at the library.  They would look at her and then write it down, okay.  The same way with aunts and uncles.  And then they'd come back and laugh about it, you know.  It was kind of a joke, if you know what I'm saying.  I'll never forget one of the teachers at Dunbar by the name of Miss Copeland who was extremely fair, who would pass to go into the public library or go to a theatre to see a movie, to come back and discuss it with her classroom.  So those were the advantages they took of color--that we took of color to get what was necessary, to take it up, you know, to make things a little bit better.  I have an aunt--my mother's sister is fairer than my mother, and many times whatever was written on her card, whether it was a library card or a medical card, it might have white on it, you know, a "W" on it, so.  Like I said, they'd come back and it would be a big joke, you know.  "Guess what they thought today?"
Story_ID: 55552
Speaker 1: Mrs. LaNier, you said that your father was involved in contracting and building?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What did your--people in your family build?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My grandfather Med Cullins was a general contractor, and as I stated before, they built a lot of schools and churches; many churches throughout the state of Arkansas.  The one that I'd like to really mention that my grandfather had a lot to do with was Wesley Chapel Church on the grounds of Philander Smith College.  And he did a lot of building there at Philander Smith.  The other plus I'd like to mention is that, while I was a Central, later on he told me that he had done--he had help build that school.  And I just couldn't believe that, you know.  It was hard to believe that, and he went on to tell of an instance about him being on the scaffold outside.  I guess he was doing some tuck pointing or what have you, and he overhead what was going on in the classroom.  And it was a math class.  And he got so frustrated, and you'd have to understand knowing him.  He bowed to no one, black or white.  And he got frustrated with how the teacher was teaching the class and how the students were not coming back with the right answer, that he stuck his head in and gave them the answer, and told them what he thought of them.  But anyway--and he was very colorful.  He used colorful language.  I always had to--I think I could have learned more from him if I was not afraid of some of--I mean, it was always an expletive in there somewhere that, you know, I'd--not something I heard at home on a continuous basis, but I heard at home.  But from him it was a continuous sort of thing.  So I just--sometimes just didn't like being around that sort of thing.  But Philander Smith College is one that I--and Wesley Chapel Church in Little Rock.  And there was the Seventh Day Adventist Church, I don't know the name of that one in Little Rock that he built, but--and throughout the state because my father went with him and my uncle when there was a big job.  Another big job that they worked on was Arkansas State College.  It is now a part of the University of Arkansas college system or university system.  But it's located in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.  That was one.  So right off the bat, those were the ones that I remember the most.
Story_ID: 55553
Speaker 1: You said at the beginning that you were close to your--to both of your grandfathers.
Speaker 2: Mmm-hmm.  In different ways, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, can you describe that--well, you talked somewhat about the --
Speaker 2: The Walls side, my grandfather--because my father was in the war, I spent--my mother and I stayed with him a period of time, and he owned a restaurant and a pool hall.  And I have been--I can still remember falling asleep in the backseat of his car and waking up and there was a man with a pool stick in his hand checking on me, so I was not inside the pool hall.  I was--he was there to check on his business and that sort of thing, and I had fallen asleep in his car, locked and so forth.  I went many places with him.  My most vivid and memorable times was going to the Walls' reunion.  So I rode shotgun in the car, and we would leave from Little Rock [Arkansas] and go to Detroit [Michigan] or to Flint, Michigan; or to St. Louis [Missouri] or to wherever, for that reunion, which is always held the first Saturday in August.  And for that to be going on for ninety-some odd years is kind of cool, I think.  This year it's going to be on a cruise, but I'm not going to make this one.  But anyway, that--he taught me how to--he had a third-grade education, but was quite a businessman.  He worked for Little Rock Tent and Awning, and most of his boys including my father worked with him on the weekends or after school or during the summertime in putting up awnings or whatever that company did.  And he always had his side business going which was the restaurant and pool hall and kind of like a jook joint.  It's when I hear Quincy Jones's "Jook Joint," I think back to one of the two places that he owned, because he owned a couple of them.  And the fact that he could sit down with anyone, whether they were educated people or everyday people, taught me that that was the way that you work with people.  And I feel like I have a lot of that from both of them really.  But I'm comfortable in the White House, and I'm also comfortable down on Five Points here in Denver [Colorado], so.  You know, I'm just--Five Points used to be kind of--well, you probably heard of that from some of the others.  But being able to walk with all people, and that's--I feel that I'm comfortable with most people.
Story_ID: 55554
Speaker 1: And tell us about--you talked about your grades in school; what activities were you involved in?
Speaker 2: Oh, Student Council; I was captain of the basketball team in junior high school; I--oh, what other--a lot of community activities, the YWCA.  I went to camp in the summertime, I was also a camp leader which transcended.  As I was looking for pictures here recent--last night, I ran across some other things that I had done in New York, and it was really from the education that I had received as a--much younger in Little Rock going to Girl Scout camp or Wooten (?) camp.  I sold the "State Press," which was a black newspaper owned by the Bates.  That was my little extra money along being a babysitter.  The--where was I coming from this--. The--
Speaker 1: The activities--
Speaker 2: Oh, the activities, yeah.  I like to have my own money so, you know, I did what I needed to do.  I was one of the top salesmen with the "Y" in selling potato chips to go to camp, so.  I got an early start in dealing with everyday people or selling to people as a kid.  And I got to know a lot of people that way, and they knew me and knew the family or what have you.  So on my bike, I'd go around and take orders for potato chips or try to get people to buy the "State Press" that came out every week. I was president of the Girls' Council at Dunbar Junior High School.  I was vice-president of the Student Body; I was the Glee Club.  I don't sing very well, but I was in the Glee Club.  Love to dance; that was an activity of mine.  I love swimming, and we were fortunate enough to get a swimming pool during my--in the city, Gillam Park.  And that was a place that we gathered during the summertime, and I never understood why I couldn't swim in the swimming--well, I understood it, but I wanted to swim at War Memorial Park which was just down the street from my--who--that city park was my mother's front yard as she was growing up.  So she knew all about the zoo and the park there, and that's where we would, you know, go during the summertime if you wanted to have a picnic, either there or--but we couldn't swim and we could not get on the rides at that park; only on certain days or certain activities that had been set up with the City for blacks to go there.  So when we finally got a park at Gillam--it was named Gillam Park--I spent a lot of time there.  So I, you know, T.V. was just starting as I was, coming into various homes and you would see things that other people were doing that you wanted to do.  And in a sense, that's how I got to Colorado.  I'll never forget Miss Colorado being Miss America, and in 1957, I guess it was, and I'll never forget this black and white picture of her showing her at the top of this mountain skiing.  I said then, that's where I want to go, I want to learn how to ski.  And just a few years ago in 2000, the two of us were on it here in--by the Girl Scouts of Women of Distinction, and I had the opportunity to meet her, and it was interesting, the conversation we had because she recalled everything that I had gone through.  And she came to introduce herself and to tell me her emotions during that time, and I had to tell her that she's the reason--I mean, I can remember her becoming Miss America and how I wanted to come to Colorado because of what I saw, so.  It's kind of a parallel there.
Story_ID: 55555
Speaker 1: You mentioned earlier, too, the trip to New York, going to New York City. Can you talk about the experiences--
Speaker 2: (Mmm-hmm)  Experience there?
Speaker 1: --yeah, that you (unclear)
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Oh, that was wonderful.  That--having the opportunity to go anywhere and-that your money could take you, to be around people speaking other languages, eating other foods, playing new games.  One of my best friends was a little white kid in the projects called Frances, and we played Tops and we played--it was a little pink ball and I can't remember what the game was called, but it was a ball game.  And my daughter tells me today that evidently the best years of my life was when I was eight years old because I can always say, "Well, when I was eight..."  But anyway, to eat a pizza; I had never had pizza.  I had heard about it because one of my friend's grandmother used to take her to New York and it exposed her to things.  The plays, I saw the Rockettes when I was eight years old at Radio City [Music] Hall.  I saw "Showboat" being presented there.  All of that was just--the people going places, seeing the mixture of people being friendly, being open; it was just wonderful.  I didn't know until probably the last twenty years that one man that I used to see sitting on a bench in this--the projects, we used to kind of throw things at him because he was just sitting there on the bench and he didn't have much to say to us and that sort of thing, and he would fall asleep.  And we later--I later now understand why he was falling asleep.  And I took my kids to New York about fifteen years ago and took them around various places that I had experienced, and I went to this bench and there was a plaque there, and another plaque about a house that was just a few feet away from there; it was Thelonious Monk.  And I mean, I had been in his environment, you know, at the age of eight, you know, and I didn't know it was Thelonious Monk, and I had seen him perform when I was in my teens at a club on the East Side in New York.  So anyway, I've had some great experiences, I think, some related to the Little Rock Nine; a lot just kind of on my own.  And that is kind of on my own, you know, I had an opportunity to--not knowing that that was Thelonious Monk, but anyway; meeting various people.
Story_ID: 55556
Speaker 1: I even met Malcolm X long before Little Rock [Arkansas].  I mean, he was called "Red" then, and he had come to Little Rock.  And I'll never forget a heated conversation in my uncle's kitchen between--
Speaker 2: How did he come to be invited to your uncle's place?
Speaker 1: He was with someone from that movement.  I think--well what it was--I don't know, how should I put this--he was with a--and I can't remember his name, he was from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], but he was a Muslim and I guess he was just kind of with him learning all about it, had--was out of prison at the time, and had been invited to Little Rock [Arkansas] by this Muslim because he was married to my uncle's sister.  And so, it was Thanksgiving time and he came with him.  And I did not know that this later was Malcolm X until many years later, I got to thinking about some things, and I was probably about ten, twelve years of age at that point in time.  So, you know, to meet a--to be in that environment as well was, you know, something--I had the opportunity to meet Langston Hughes when I was a freshman in college and he was helping Mrs. [Daisy] Bates write a book.  I've just been around a lot of black people that--that I'm real proud of, you know.  We've done some great things.
Story_ID: 55557
Speaker 1: I just want to set the stage for where you were just before the Little Rock Nine took (unclear).  Now, you were--you've been described as being athletic, energetic, and full of life at Dunbar (unclear) this and that.  I just want to set, you know, that you've had a lot of experiences (unclear)(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: I was a part of the--yeah, I was National Honor Society, always on the national--on the honor roll and that sort of thing.  I looked up to the seniors to--they were people that I tried to emulate.  They were always in the library.  My aunt was the librarian at Dunbar High School, at Junior-Senior High School.  So I would spend my--what do you call that hour that you--study hall hour or what have you in the library because I always wanted to be around the older ones.  That was another reason.  And I've always been around older people I guess.  I've learned from older ones.  And--they had accomplished a great deal, at least by those standards, and they were going off to college and so forth, and I--you know, I looked up to them.  So I always wanted to do some of those sort of things.  And I would hear about their accomplishments through my family; my mother or my aunt or Mr. Fox who lived across the street, who was--who really prepared me to deal with Central [High School] as well.  He knew the principal at Central because the two of them had each summer, they had met at KU, University of Kansas, so he knew a little bit about him.  But Mr. Fox also, A.B. Fox was his name, he also prepared me to do well in school.  When I went to junior high--when I left elementary school going into junior high school, his advice to me was to always be prepared.  "You will be tested every day."  And he literally meant being tested every day, but I didn't understand the testing that he was talking about.  Now, we were tested weekly, okay.  So in a sense that is kind of an everyday thing because you don't hear that today about how classrooms are set up to be--teachers are testing you on what you have learned during the week.  So I'm a pretty good test taker, I think, because of my schooling in that seventh, eighth and ninth grade timeframe.  And the other piece of that, of being tested, I think, helped me to deal with what I dealt with at Little Rock.  And not--I don't think he knew that that's what was going to happen.  In fact, I'm sure he didn't know, but he did tell me to be prepared, and I always tried to be prepared.  And he happened to be a person that we looked up to in the community and at the school as far as that goes.  So doing all those sorts of things, you know, and then leading up to go to Central, I knew--one thing I haven't stated that I learned at home, and it was then verified and solidified at my segregated elementary school and at my church, is that I was just as good as the next person despite the color of my skin.  Even though I could not, you know, I had to go to certain--I had to go to the "Colored Fountain," or the "Colored Bathroom," or sit at the back of the bus, that did not make me a lesser person.  So for me to--that was kind of a foundational sort of thing for me, along with the preparation that I received at my segregated, black schools.  I think I learned just as much there as I did at Central.  I always have felt that the teachers were just as good, if not better; in fact, in my opinion, they were probably better because they didn't have what was necessary to teach their students.
Story_ID: 55558
Speaker 1: Set this up for us now.  What happened?  How did you become a member of the Little Rock Nine (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, in April of 1957, my homeroom teacher came in and stated--they would read a bulletin every day, okay.  And midway through the bulletin it stated, "Anyone who lived," and he gave the boundaries, "that is interested in attending Little Rock Central High School in the fall, please sign this sheet of paper."  He plopped it down on the first desk and then started coming around the room.  He went on to item number eleven, twelve, thirteen, whatever.  When it got to me, I signed the sheet of paper, passed it back.  I had always been taught at home that once you had an opportunity for something, that you grasp that opportunity and run with it.  We had--I was well aware of the Brown versus Board of Education ruling by the Supreme Court decision.
Speaker 1: Can you just explain about what (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, did--you know, the Supreme Court stated that segregated schools were unconstitutional, and basically stating to integrate schools forthwith.  There were two Brown versus Board of Education decisions.  A lot of people don't know that; the first one, the 1954 decision, and then the one in 1956.  And the one in '56 (1956) basically--what was happening is that they--the appeals situation was, "Well, how soon do we have to do this?"  And in my opinion, unfortunately, the Supreme Court's statement was "With all deliberate speed."  It did not give a real timeframe.  And so, we're still in "all deliberate speed," many years later.  But the Little Rock School Board said that they would abide by the Supreme Court decision; and understand, that Little Rock was a moderate-to-progressive town and for the South.  Let me paraphrase that, for the South.  And so, the Little Rock School Board under the guidance of Virgil Blossom, who was the superintendent of schools, sat down and came up with a plan.  Now that plan wasn't, in my opinion, not the best plan, but that was what was available.  And you--I learned early on in age that you use what you have within the confines of the law basically.
Story_ID: 55559
Speaker 1: I was asking you how the Little Rock Nine came together.  You all were chosen or organized by somebody or--how you came together?  I think you said before that--seen the paper was passed around the last day of school when you were a freshman at Dunbar, and people signed--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: up or were interested in attending Central High School--
Speaker 2: --in April, not before--not the last day of school--
Speaker 1: Oh, all right.
Speaker 2: --but in April.  It was a part of the bulletin that basically anyone who lived in certain perameters, and they gave the street--you know, the cutoffs--that had any intentions of attending Little Rock Central High School, that, you know, please sign this sheet of paper.  So when it did get to me, yes, I did sign it and I passed it on to the next person and didn't think another thought of it.  So, and then later that summer of '57 (1957), I received a registration card or an announcement saying where to go and when, okay.  And that's kind of how my piece of it was.  Now, I have learned that 147 kids, if I'm not mistaken, lived in those blocks within the perameters they had given us that could have gone.  I think it was probably about 114 or somewhere in there that had signed up.  And over the summer, the numbers dwindled.  Now, I did not know anything about that, okay.  I was only concerned about Carlotta.  I ran into Ernie Green, who I have known ever since we were little kids and he asked me was I planning on going to Central in the fall, and I told him, yes, and he asked me who else.  And I said I have no idea.  And so one thing led to another, and I did call one person and that was Gloria Ray to see if she was planning on going, because I know she lived in that particular neighborhood and would qualify as far as just where she lived, just to see whether she was interested, and she said yes.  And so, actually the two of us went to register the day that we were supposed to.  However, we could not register.  We were told by Miss Opie to--that we would be getting a phone call and to bring our parents or at least one parent to a meeting with the superintendent of schools.  And in that meeting, there were about thirty-nine children and parents.  And from then on, things continued to--and that was in August, if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 1: Now, what did they tell you in the meeting?
Speaker 2: Various things that could, you know, explaining the situation that we were only--the school board plan was to integrate one high school, and there were--he gave us the do's and don'ts, and we could not participate in any extracurricular activity, and I'm sure that that probably turned a number of people off.  We couldn't go to the sporting events such as football games, basketball games; we could not participate in track or choir or drama or the student government there at the school; could not belong to any clubs.  All we could really do is go to school, and I think that in itself probably--I do know it changed the minds of some others that I have since spoken to over the years, or they have brought that to my attention, that they were editor of the yearbook at Horace Mann [High School], and if they couldn't transfer those skills to Little Rock Central High School, that, "Maybe I just should just stay here and finish here at Horace Mann."  So for me, I was involved in student government, National Honor--Junior National Honor Society, prior to going to Central, which I maintained that level of grades even at Central.  I was captain of my basketball team, the girls' basketball team.  But those things I knew I would not be able to do once I got to Central.  So but that was okay for me.  I figured somewhere down the line that that would probably change, and then I would be able to step up at that point in time.
Story_ID: 55560
Speaker 1: Did you have a sense that you were making history, is that it were--(unclear)?
Speaker 2: No.  I had--that was not the reason for going to Central.  It was my right and the Supreme Court decision gave me that right.  And I had always been taught at home that once you have an opportunity to exercise something that's better than whatever it is that you have, be prepared and be able to grasp that brass ring or gold ring, and I was ready for it.  So I didn't--I knew I was just as good as the next person.  I didn't care what they thought, but I knew where I belonged, and what I could do, and what I could achieve.  And it was just kind of a natural progression for me.  I passed that school every day going to the black junior-senior high school.  So I knew what was within those walls.  I played ball with some of the kids who went to school there in the summertime, and it was actually from the information I got from them I knew what was going on in their school.  So I knew I was doing the right thing.  And that's what I did.  Like I said, I really didn't go home and discuss this.
Story_ID: 55561
Speaker 1: Your parents didn't talk about it?
Speaker 2: We did not discuss this.  I mean, I didn't bring it up.  They really didn't know, I don't think, until the card came that I had really signed up, because I did not go home and make a big issue over this.  It was just the next step in my life and anyone else's life within the community if they wanted to take advantage of it.
Speaker 1: Now, what did your parents think after the orientation?  What did they say?
Speaker 2: Well, not much was--I really don't recall too many conversations with my mother and father about it.  It was--my father basically was stating, "If you want to go, then you have a right to go."  And, you know, I thought many times I had heard him state how he defended his country in World War Two, and yet and still, he was considered a second-class citizen, but at the same time things were going to change.  And I just saw this as a part of changing, things getting better.  You know, I had all these dreams, so it--to me it was just a natural progression.  Little Rock was somewhat of a moderate, progressive little Southern town; a hundred thousand plus, and most people got along with each other, and yes, we--it was because people knew their places, and you learned how to do things within the frame of reference that you had, and you worked the system basically is what it boiled down to.  So I didn't know that that's what I was doing, but that's basically how it was happening for me.  Like I said, I was fourteen years of age.  I had no fear. So it ended it up, I think, the week prior there were--the numbers from that thirty-nine came down to seventeen, then fifteen, and thirteen, and I think eleven was the number the week prior.  And when we showed up that day, it turned out to be nine of us.  And I'm sure that it had a lot to do with parents being afraid for their children or some afraid of losing their jobs, and I know my father did--had--my father had plenty of problems job wise because I was going to Central; or just overhearing what was being said in white homes.  If there were domestics that worked there and they had children that--or nieces and nephews and they would go home and call up that person and say, "You know, this is what I heard," and so forth and so--well, I did not have all of that, okay.  Mine--none of that was talked about in my home.  It was about just doing well and taking advantage of an opportunity.  And I believed in access to an opportunity and that was my access.  I wanted to go to a school back East.  I mean, it was nothing wrong with the historical black colleges.  I knew that I would be going to either Arkansas State [University] there in the state, or to a particular school--I knew I could get into most colleges.  But I also thought of the Oberlins and the Antioch colleges, and the Big Ten schools, and the Big East schools.  And I knew at Little Rock Central High School that a large percentage of the graduating class got those type of scholarships and so forth.  I mean, they had ten percent of national merit scholars at Little Rock--at Central.  And to this day, that percentage is still there.  So, I mean it's a well-known school.
Speaker 1: It's a good school.
Speaker 2: It's an excellent school, yeah.  And despite the fact that it's fifty-fifty now, fifty-five percent are people of color, the standard in it has not changed.  So that to me is a credit to those who have worked there and continue to see to it that it maintains its credibility.  And that's with a large percentage of people of color teaching and principals.  So it's a tradition there.
Story_ID: 55562
Speaker 1: Can you walk us through the first day of school?  What was the first day like?
Speaker 2: The first day was, oh, a lot of anticipation, was happy that school was starting.  I was tired of seeing whatever it was on television.  None of that really registered with me other than ignorance.  That's how I really perceived it.
Speaker 1: What did you see on television?
Speaker 2: Well, the governor coming forth, you know, spouting off things that didn't even sound like him during his normal campaign, okay.  And since then, I'm older and I, you know, have talked to a number of people, and I since discovered that he had a lot of pressure on him from those in the Southern part of Arkansas that helped put him over as governor, and his constituents were looking for payback time.  And it was a lot of pressure on him.  That's not to say that he was right in doing what he did just because his constituents wanted it done.  It shows how spineless he was as far as I'm concerned.  But that's what he did.  So it was a political agenda on his side.
Speaker 1: Just for the sake of the tape now, did Governor--what's his name?
Speaker 2: Orval Faubus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very seldom do I use that name.  Even say it.  But anyway, that--the rhetoric was on there--the White Citizen's Council, which was a group of mothers, I guess, that was constantly on T.V. to not wanting their children to go to school with those Negroes, you know.  So--and that the federal government had no right being in the state's government's business, and this was their way of life and they didn't want their way of life changed, and yada, yada, yada.  And so, it was on.  But I still didn't hold it to--on a pedestal as if to say that, you know, that I should be afraid or anything of that nature.  And so, I was just happy that school was starting because I enjoyed school, always did.  And we were told to meet at a certain corner and we did, eight of us did.  And there was the Little Rock Ministerial Alliance that was there, and they wanted to walk with us.  So I guess looking back in retrospect, yes, the adults knew that it was more--that it was history-making.  The nine of us didn't see it that way, okay.  But the adults were there and they did walk that block with us to a particular corner, to the corner of the school, and in fact, it's the corner of Park [Avenue], and it is now called Daisy Bates--Daisy Gaston Bates Drive there.
Story_ID: 55563
Speaker 1: And we were approached by the commanding officer, I'm assuming, who basically came to us and told us that we weren't allowed on the grounds.
Speaker 2: Now, this is the commanding officer of what?
Speaker 1: Of the Arkansas National Guard, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  We saw the guards there.  The night before, the governor had come on T.V. and stated that he was calling out the Arkansas National Guard to protect the citizens of Little Rock, Arkansas, and I surely considered myself a citizen.  My father paid taxes just like everyone else.  And so, I considered that protection for any and everyone.  Yes, it was stated that there were outsiders coming into Little Rock, and that blood could flow in the street; and I just kind of thought it was Hollywood-ish, in a sense, a movie-type thing going on.  Exaggeration, let me just put it that way.  That's what I really thought.  And so, I dismissed it.  And we get there and I hear all of the mob across the street, and the name-calling and, you know, but I'd heard it before.  I hadn't seen the mobs before, but I felt that the Arkansas National Guard was there to protect the citizens of Little Rock, Arkansas.  A few blocks down the street on the same Park Avenue, Elizabeth Eckford got off of a bus to--did not get the information the night before to meet at a certain corner.  So you see, if her parents thought that that was a problem, they never would have put her on a bus to send her to school, okay.  So that's why I have a problem with some of this, that what--the truth is there, why exaggerate the whole situation; let's just tell it the way it really took place.  And she got off of a bus, saw the Arkansas National Guard, thought the same thing, that they were there to protect her just as they were to protect anyone else.  As she walked up, the guards closed rank; she moved down a little bit further, they closed rank again; and so, then she realized that they were there to keep her out.  No one told her--at least that's what she--I understand.
Speaker 2: So the guards were there to protect the school from nine black students?
Speaker 1: And you can look at it that way.  And the fact that, if we had gone in, then the mob would have rushed maybe, who knows, and then that's when the guard would have to do something, okay.  So--but they were told by the governor to keep us out.  That was the direction to the commanding officer.  So they did for the next three weeks while litigation took place.  The NAACP legal defense fund sent down the--one of my biggest heroes, and that was Thurgood Marshall, who handled the case with Wiley Branton in the federal courts there--in a court in Little Rock.  And I had the opportunity to sit in on one of them, and I was so impressed and so proud, so.  And then after those three weeks--
Story_ID: 55564
Speaker 1: Just to be clear--you all went back to school every day for three weeks?
Speaker 2: No.  We only went to school that day.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we were told to remain home until this whole thing could be settled.  And with that happening, then that's when we were told--Mrs. [Daisy] Bates basically told the parents or told us all including the parents, that the legal defense fund was sending down an attorney to help the NAACP attorney, who was Wiley Branton, to go forth with the case or represent us in court.  And that's what took place.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us who Mrs. [Daisy] Bates was.
Speaker 2: Mrs. [Daisy] Bates was president--state president of the NAACP.  And also she and her husband owned the "Arkansas State Press," which was the--probably the only black press that, you know, spread the word in the black community or the Negro/Colored community.  And, in fact, that was my first job when I was probably about ten years old.  I delivered the "Arkansas State Press."  And because of her position with the NAACP, she was more involved with all of the things that was going on, especially on the political side that none of us were involved in, okay.  And, in fact, the first time I really saw her in that position was the day that I went up to register.  And when we--Gloria and I came out, we were getting in the car and she was about a block away, and she waved at us and wanted to know what took place in there, so we told her, you know.  So that's kind of how that all took place.  And I'm sure that with talking to the parents that it turned out that it would be wise to have one voice instead of nine, ten, fifteen voices, and it--that was basically how she started being the spokesperson in a sense of the Little Rock Nine.  So that's kind of how that developed.  And we moved on from there.  So--
Story_ID: 55565
Speaker 1: --can you describe each one of the Little Rock Nine for us or tell us a little bit about each one?
Speaker 2: Well, there was one senior, Ernie Green.  Ernie and I have known each other since we were little kids going to each other's birthdays, and his mother was my first-grade teacher; second-grade teacher.  I knew his family.  Then there were five juniors.  I knew Terrence Roberts because he was president of the student body, and I was--which made him also president of the Boys' Student Government, and I was vice-president, which meant I was president of the Girls' Student Council.  So I knew Terrence that way.  Terrence is very articulate, and he always had a dry sense of humor, but we always waited to hear what he had to say.  So I knew him only in those confines, okay, of the student government.  I did not know Minni Brown.  I did not know Melba Beals.  I knew a little bit about Elizabeth Eckford because her grandfather had a grocery store, and her father sold real estate for my uncle.  And she was in my mind had just this rosy look about the world, and I didn't really see it that way, but I listened.  And Thelma Mothershed I did not know either.  Thelma, I soon found out later, had heart problems.  So again, if you as a parent know that your child has heart problems, you are living in this environment all these years, you don't--you're really not expecting these things to happen.  If they--if you are expecting those things to happen, I know that the Mothersheds would not have allowed Thelma to go to school there, okay.  So these things evolved because of a governor and those people that were manipulating him, okay.  And then things just got out of hand.  He couldn't control them.  So that group, that was the five juniors.  And then there was Gloria Ray, who I knew because we took classes together at Dunbar Junior High School and was very bright.  And I've always thought of Gloria in the field of math and science.  And then there was Jefferson Thomas, who I also knew because he was in student council as well, and he ran on the track team.  And Terrence and Jefferson and I loved to dance, so, you know, I'd run into them at the Dunbar Recreational Center.  So I knew some--I didn't know it--they weren't my best friends; they became my--we all became very close.  But my best friends went to Dunbar and to Horace Mann, and one went off to a private school.  So I did not--I'm not one that need my friends around me to do something that I feel that this is right for me.
Story_ID: 55566
Speaker 1: You're saying--so these are nine individuals with individual stories?
Speaker 2: Yeah, nine.  Nine individuals with nine different stories.  And you had asked me about Minni [Brown] being, you know, with a temper.  I wouldn't say that.  I--Minni was a fun-loving person who I felt that she probably heard the superintendent say, "Yes, you cannot participate in the extracurricular activities that one normally participate in when you're in high school," right?  Melba and Minni were in the choir and had beautiful voices.  And I--my--I feel that they probably thought, "Yeah, right.  Once they hear me sing, they're going to want me in the choir."  Okay.  For me, I didn't--it didn't bother me that much.  I figured I was a junior--I mean, a sophomore and I had three years to go there, and I knew if things just progressed in a normal progression, basically--when one thing is good, then another door will open, and another door will open.  So, you know, that's how I saw it.  With Minni, I think that some of the students recognized that they could get under her skin, and they just stayed at it.  She didn't like the name calling.  I didn't like it either, but I'd been hearing it all of my life.  I was well prepared to hear that, okay.  Among black people, among Negroes at the time, and Coloreds at the time, you know, with--you heard so much.  And because I'm of--lighter hued than some of the others, you know, I'd hear that sort of thing.  "You think you're better than we are because your skin is fair," and "dada, dada, da."  And that was not the case.  But I knew I was just as good as the next person, so I never considered myself better than, but I was just as good, okay.  And that was my demeanor, and I just kind of took life that way.  I was always trying to work around a situation, I guess.  I'd step up to a situation when I felt the need, but I also looked at my opponent in a sense, and if they were the type of people that no matter what you say or what you did, that you would never get that mind to open up, then, hey, I'm not going to waste breath or my time.  So--and I'm like that today.  So anyway, that--I just feel that all nine of us just have nine different stories, and we all weren't close, but we became close.  It was just nine of us, so we got to know each rather well as far as that goes.  Again, I really feel that the heroes and sheroes are our parents.  They're the ones who suffered the most.  For me, I didn't go home and repeat what went on during the day.  And I'm sure that worried my mother and father.  My mother grayed that year.  She was the youngest mother out of the group and probably showed more gray hair at the end of that year than anyone else.  Others went home and told the gory stuff.  But I was never that way, and today I'm not like that.  I just figured if you can't think positive about some things or give that--the good kudos, then let's not belabor on all the negative stuff.  I mean, it can wear you down.  And it wore Minni down, and I think that was the reason that on that particular day Minni just had had it and took the bowl of chili and dumped on the guy's head.  It had been going on for too long.  So some people's--you know, your threshold is different for each person.
Story_ID: 55567
Speaker 1: How did the--maybe you can tell us maybe what happened on that day, but I just wondered, you know, in a broader sense how the administration of Central High School dealt with the situation.  Did they protect you all at all?  I mean, how--I know they had to on some level.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, Mrs. Huckaby was the vice principal, and I have to be honest with you, I think she did more at that school than the principal did.  He had his vice principal of boys and vice principal of girls.  She also taught me English, but because of all that was going on, she spent more time outside of the classroom and in the administrative side of the--of public education.  And Mr. Matthews was the principal, and we jokingly called him "Smiling Jess," I mean, because he always had a smile on his face, and I mean it could be bombs going off and he had a smile on his face.  So, you know, it--I really felt that she was the one who did most of the controlling and directing and planning in that sort of--it felt into her lap.  The discipline part of it fell into the vice principal of boys lap because it was more boys that were having--getting involved in making it miserable for us, and some of the girls as well, now, because I had a few.  I had--there was one particular redhead that gave me a lot of problems, but I can't remember her name now, but anyway, used to walk on the back of my heels all the time, and I figured if she was going to back walk on the back of my heels, then she was going to have to work for it.  So I was kind of known as the roadrunner around there because I walked very fast.  And I also recognized that I was losing my guard all the time.  I was getting one every week when everybody else was getting one every two weeks.  Well, they were being worn out by the way I walked, I guess.  So, anyway, that was kind of how it was for me during that year with the 101st Airborne.  But--I don't know.  We digressed a little bit here.
Story_ID: 55568
Speaker 1: You said you--so did you had to have a guard every--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Once--well, you know, you mentioned--before we get to the three weeks, well, during those three weeks with all the litigation going on and then what was handed down, and then what the governor still did not do, he goes to Rhode Island to see President Eisenhower through the efforts of Congressman Brooks Hays, and we had the Senator [J. William] Fulbright from our state, they knew that this had to take place.  And so, Brooks Hays was one who really talked Governor [Orval] Faubus to coming and sitting down with the President [Dwight Eisenhower].  And I think, and this is just my opinion and I'm going by pictures that I saw on T.V.; that they came out, smiles on their face, everybody seemed to be pleased.  And I said, "Well, boy, we're going to school tomorrow," you know.  And although the governor didn't say much.  It was the President doing most of the talking.  And the next day, I don't know whether it was the next day or two days following whatever, the governor did pull away the Arkansas National Guard and left the police there to be the protectors, to take care of the mob that was across the street.  And we attempted to go to school, and we were in there until about noon, and then we were ushered out of the school because the police could not handle the mob across the street.  And that is when President Eisenhower came on national T.V. and stated that he was calling out the 101st Airborne to protect the nine black students at Little Rock Central High School, and in rolled a thousand troopers and they protected us along with the Arkansas National Guard.  Now, all of a sudden the National Guard is now under the auspices of the 101st.  And so, now they've got to do just the opposite of what they had been doing.  And so, that is how we got in on that day.  We then moved in and we came by military convoy, and we each had a guard assigned to us, and that's how it went for the next eight, nine, or what--eight months left, I guess.  They didn't stay bivouacked on the campus.  I think probably by November they were off the campus.  They were over at the Little Rock Air Force Base then, but just imagine a helicopter buzzing over your high school and troopers bivouacked on your campus.
Speaker 1: Troopers were camped out on the campus?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  So that's kind of how we went to school.  And every morning we would meet at Mrs. Bates' house and then get into a military station wagon and with a Jeep in front and a Jeep in the back, and they took us to school every day.  The same way at the end of the day, and then at the end of the day we would go home, you know, whether our parents were picking us up or--I was part of a kind of a carpool.  There were many people that helped my parents.
Story_ID: 55569
Speaker 1: Now, when you got home, were you relatively free to roam your neighborhood like you usually did or were you a target?
Speaker 2: I did not roam the neighborhood.  I did not do any of the things that most kids do when they come home from--I, other than fix me something to eat and turn on "American Bandstand" or the radio and start preparing my homework and for the next day.  You see, I always felt that, given the same opportunity, same timeframe, same information, that I could compete with anyone, okay.  Now, three weeks have gone by, and I was the antsy one in the group.  It was bugging the heck out of me that a week had gone by now, now we're into the second week and they are getting ahead of us, meaning the white kids in school.  They are learning every day.  And I'm thinking to myself, "Here we go again.  You got to be that super-Negro again."  Okay.  So once I got into school, not only did I have to catch up, and then maintain, okay.  So I was an "A" and "B" student, and I intended to keep "As" and "Bs."  And continue to be on the Honor Roll.  And so I was--it was--it didn't--it was now a job, okay.  I'm three weeks behind, and I've got to, you know, do all these things to stay with the group in my various classes.  So I was coming home and doing homework.  I was preparing for the next day.  Did I get on the telephone and talk to my friends at Horace Mann [High School]?  No.  Did I get on the telephone or have a conversation with any white kid in any of my classes about a particular problem or homework assignment or what have you?  No.  I did not have that.  I had my family, and thank God for that; but--my mother and my father and my two sisters.  So that is what I did, you know.  American Bandstand was probably my biggest outlet, okay, and Dick Clark.  And so, anyway, that was how it was for me almost every day, okay.  Now, we--for me, I did go to Horace Mann's homecoming game or a football game during the year.  But as far as socializing, there was very little of that, for all of us.  We socialized among each other, you know.  That was about the extent of it.
Story_ID: 55570
Speaker 1: We had enough to keep us busy.  We knew being there, not only that the fact they didn't want us there, that we really had to be on top of whatever we were doing.  We understood that part of it, okay.  We understood that only because of the way we were raised probably, okay.  Because you had to do well in school anyway, whether it was black, white or indifferent.  All right.  That was--you were taught excellence in the black schools or Negro schools, so segregated schools.  So they prepared us well as far as I'm concerned.  I was always tested, and so, as far as homework and taking classes and all that sort of stuff, that--none of that was new or really different other than the fact that they had the best of equipment.  Now that was new, okay.  But as far as study habits and being prepared, all those sort of things we had already learned.
Speaker 2: So you didn't feel that you were entering a situation where you--they were ahead of you--
Speaker 1: Only ahead of me because they had been in school three weeks prior to me getting there.  Outside of that, I felt that if anything, my black teachers were just as good, if not better; in fact, I thought they were even better and I'll tell you why.  They didn't have the materials to work with.  They had to be creative in teaching us.  They didn't have the latest books.  I mean, there were teachers that passed to go to the Little Rock public library to pull books out so they could take them back to Dunbar [Junior Senior High School] and do particular work from the later books that the school didn't have.  I mean--or they would--some fair-skinned teachers, one in particular I used to hear about--that had gone to see "Gone with the Wind," which was only being shown at the white theater, right.  And then she would come back and then tell her classroom or her various classes about the movie.  They had read the book, so then she was going further into it.  So, you know, those sort of things took place.  Our science teachers, I mean, we had to--at Central, two of us could dissect a frog.  At Dunbar, ten of us were standing around a frog trying to dissect it.  So it had more to do with that piece of it than--I mean, I have since looked at the credentials of the black teachers that I had and the credentials of the white teachers that I had at Central, and those black teachers were just as good if not better--most of them had Masters.  So I can't say that for all the white teachers that I had.  So they went away every summer to the University of Kansas, to the University of Chicago, the University of Michigan, to work on their masters; University of Iowa, the Big Ten schools most of them went to or Big Eight; University of Colorado, Denver University.  In fact, my ninth grade teacher had gotten her Masters there at Denver University.  And I used to hear about Denver [Colorado], and that's why I wanted to leave and I ended up there, I think.  So that is what I saw, okay.  Now what the other eight saw, I don't know.  But that's kind of where I was coming from.  And all the things that I had read about, and I was the kind of person--I'm the type of person want to touch and feel or smell that that I have read or rub up against these things, you know.  So I had these dreams and visions of going places and I just wanted the opportunity.  And that opportunity presented itself in the Brown versus Board of Education, and the Little Rock plan to--at Little Rock school board's plan to integrate.  So I took advantage of it.
Story_ID: 55571
Speaker 1: Now, did things gradually ease up, you know, you say after November the (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, not really.  In December I think is when Minni had the incident.
Speaker 1: What exactly happened?
Speaker 2: She was standing in line in the cafeteria and I guess, in fact, the young man that had annoyed her and was pushing on her or what have you, was someone that I had spoken to, talked to many times because he was--his girlfriend's locker was next to mine, and he liked to dance.  And we had a common thing about what we had seen on American Bandstand or some new dance step or what have you.  So whatever little conversation we had, it was like facing the locker and talking, but not one of those outward social conversations.  He was a person that the group, the troublemakers, I guess, in initiation sort of thing, probably pushed him in to doing this; you know, "show us that you don't want these black--you know, these Negro kids here.  niggers here," you know.  So anyway, I think he was pushed into that.  And that particular day Minni just had had it, and she had a bowl chili in her--on her tray and she just picked it up and dumped it on his head.  And it was dead silence, and then all of a sudden, it was clapping from the cooks, and you know the cooks were black, behind the--they clapped and then a lot of--lot of--hoorah going on--lot of, you know, verbiage and so forth going on, and then the counselors who were in the cafeteria came and got the both of them, and because of a couple of other incidents prior, I think, not to that extent, but Minni was expelled; not suspended but, you know, expelled from school.  And she went on to New York and lived with Doctor Clark and Mrs. Clark and went to Lincoln High School, if I'm not mistaken.  I think that's the name of it and graduated from there.  So that left the eight of us for the remainder of the school year.
Story_ID: 55572
Speaker 1: And some things eased up--it was something going on every day, okay.  It's just to what level you put it on, you know.  And I think a lot of people thought things weren't happening to me because I was not repeating it.  Well, I don't like to relive something that I'm not enjoying, okay.  And I guess that's part of the reason I never really talked about things when I got home.  That day was over, I have another day to deal with, okay.  So again, I don't like to waste my time and breath, so.  I--that's just how it was with me.  I know Mrs. Bates tried to pull a lot of things out, and she would want to know the names of who's doing what, and I didn't really know the names.  I could probably describe some of them to a degree or whatever class they were in and, not really knowing, she was taking that information and passing it on to someone there at the high school for them to watch and so forth.  But I didn't like being questioned after I had already been through it all, you know.  I'm going through this every day, let me just get this job done, okay.  Let me get through this year.  And that's how it was for me, I needed to get through the year.  See, once you commit to something--I had always been taught you make a commitment and you see it through.  Now once that timeframe is up, it's left up to you whether you want to continue.  And, you know, I--there were some things that I look back on and that's why I did continue.  But all I wanted to do was get through this year, maintain my grades, and go on into my junior year.  And that's what I wanted to do.  And by the way, that first semester, meaning you asked me what I did when I would come home.  That first grading period, Mrs. Huckaby told me this twenty-five years later or twenty years later that she had received a phone call from some reporters wanting to know our grades for the year, which she would not give out because those were confidential.  But she said, "If I were you, I would look on page so and so of the 'Arkansas Gazette,' and you might recognize something."  And my name was one of--was on the honor roll, so that's kind of how, you know--so I felt proud about that, that I continued to do the quality of work that I had done before, and under different circumstances.  In fact, under worse circumstances.  So I knew I belonged.  And I was not about to slip in my grades to let them be right, that we didn't belong.  It's kind of a mind thing, I guess.  So that was part of my driving force.  And then afterwards, you know, schools were closed in my eleventh grade year.  I could have gone many places.  I had relatives all over the country, but I felt after all that I had gone through in 1957, '58 [1958], I needed something to show for that, and that diploma was what I needed.  So I didn't move like some of the others did and out of the nine.  I mean, those juniors who became seniors, naturally wanted to graduate.  Terrence Roberts's family moved to California; Melba [Patillo Beals] moved to Northern California; Minni [Brown] was already in New York; I think Thelma [Mothershed] and Elizabeth [Eckford] remained and they did correspondence courses as I did, and Jefferson [Thomas] did.  Gloria [Ray] moved to Kansas City, her family and--her father sent his wife and daughter to Kansas City so she could finish up school there.  And so she had her eleventh and twelfth grade in Kansas City.
Story_ID: 55573
Speaker 1: So are you saying the school actually closed?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: The governor, again, closed all the schools in Little Rock, okay.
Speaker 1: You say going into your junior year?
Speaker 2: That was going into my junior year.  So litigation took place again on the federal level.  And, you know, people were thinking the schools would eventually open up in another month or so.  Well, that didn't take place.  What did take place is private schools popping up all over flying the Confederate Flag.  Well, you knew you didn't belong there.  And black kids either went to--over to North Little Rock's school system or to the country schools or they left the city.  And parents were able to either send them somewhere else.  And for me, I took correspondence courses through the University of Arkansas.  I came to Chicago [Illinois] one--the summer of '58 (1958) and went to Hirsch High School and took two classes there.  And then I went back into Central [High School] when the schools finally opened up again in the year of '59 (1959)-'60 (1960).  I was a senior then.  And I still needed one more credit, and I got that in St. Louis [Missouri] at Beaumont High School after I had participated in graduation in May of 1960.  So that's how I completed my eleventh grade year, okay.  Void of classroom activity, void of peers or conversation with others within a classroom.  But it was important to me to receive that--that diploma which you took a picture of.  So I have that to show.  So it was three of us that out of the nine that really participated in the graduation exercises, and that was Ernest Green, the first; and Jefferson Thomas and I, who were sophomores when we started out.  We finished up there.
Story_ID: 55574
Speaker 1: What's your impression of--well, I know it's probably a mixed bag, but what's your impression of the white students that were at Central High School?  Were they conflicted about all this?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Were they conflicted you say?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I imagine they were.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I think that there were a great number of them that would have accepted us, just acceptance.  "Well, they're here.  It's the law," you know. I think there was a group there that would have befriended us; a larger number of people.  A larger number of students that would have befriended us had they not had the peer pressure on them not to do certain things.  And then there's always that group that's--that does not want you there; they will make it miserable for you.  The conniving kind; those that are upfront and in your face with it, or those who are helping to plan things behind the scene.  So all of it existed.  Anything within any walk of life, it was there, okay.  Now, I have since in the past ten years there have been a couple that I communicate with.  They were seniors, so one was a senior at the time; and as you know, seniors really didn't talk to sophomores, even if things had been right, okay, or had been okay.  That's just not the way it goes in high school.  But anyway, this person lives in Colorado, and I didn't know it, but I knew who she was, and she was evidently taking a class at Iliff School of Theology, and my minister happened to be there and one thing led to another.  And he asked me would it be okay to give my telephone number to this person who was taking this class, and I said sure.  And he gave me the name and I said, sure I remember her because she was a cheerleader.  She was one of the leaders in the school, okay.  And always had a smile on her face.  And because we had a twenty minute free time every morning, because we got to school so early that the guards didn't know what to do--didn't know what to do with us.  I'm not quite saying it right.  But we would go to chapel, and at chapel at the school, these were supposed to be Christians anyway, right?  So--and she happened to be there, so I knew she was one of those that didn't mind us going to school there.  Since then, we've discussed it many times.  She's told me the pressures that she had at home; how her parents, especially her grandfather really didn't want her going to Central [High School] with black kids.  And she would use the Bible.  He was one of those that took her to church every Sunday, and she would challenge him on what he had to say by using certain things that he had taught her.  And that's what she has told me.  And that's how she got around things.  She had a Negro maid there in her home that cooked and cleaned and so forth, and she would challenge him, "You mean to tell me she should be treated any different than, you know, she's like a member of our family and so forth."  So those were the sort of things she would do to him.  We talk once every three, four months.
Story_ID: 55575
Speaker 1: There were others that I'm sure the other eight will tell you about or would tell you about that were friends, as friendly as they could be.  There were some that would discuss the work, the classroom work within the classroom if they sat behind me or were--or in front of me.  Then there were others who sat next to me.  They always moved their seat once they came in.  They just--they were assigned to that seat but didn't want to sit next to me, so they moved seat which was fine.  Because you see, I was not asking them to love me.  That was not what I needed and I don't get a buzz sitting next to a white person.  So they had the wrong idea as to why I was there, okay.  So all I wanted to do--I preferred a person not even recognizing me.  That was okay with me.  Just let me go on about my business doing what I need to do while I'm here.  And I didn't need them to love me as far as that goes.  So that was kind of how it was for me.
Story_ID: 55576
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, since that time, have you been able to--how has life been?  I mean, do you--does this, like, affect everything you do?  I mean, after (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Only in the past ten, twelve years I guess.  You know, to be honest with you, for thirty years I put it out of my mind.  And it was 1987 before I really--'88 [1988], I started talking about it only because the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] had their fall meeting, and they decided after thirty years what we had gone through, let's have it in Little Rock [Arkansas]; and they did, and they invited the eight of--the nine of us to come and be there for those three or four days.  And at the time, there was a black principal at Central, also a black student body president, and that was my--our first time meeting Governor [William J.] Clinton.  And because of the CNN exposure and one thing after another, then people started saying, "Oh, so you, you know, in my community," because a lot of people in Denver [Colorado] did not know all of my background.  There were some in the black community that did know and respected the fact that I didn't want to really talk about it.  And I didn't, okay.  But due to that timing there in Little Rock, along with the fact that my children were getting--were in junior high school I think--in elementary school, there was a need to discuss a little bit more.  And that's when I started talking about it.  And since then, it has grown into something even larger.  So--but for thirty years I had put that in the back of my mind.  I did not want to bring up or think about all the things that I went through.  And today I still don't.  I still try to put the bad things to the side, and I recognize that those things took place.  I don't want to ever see them again.  I don't want my children to have to go through it.  I don't want children of color to go through what I went through.  So that's where I've been, you know.  And from there to today, I do see the need to have to tell this story because so many have missed out on why they have what they have today, and I think that we played a part in it.  But we were standing on shoulders of others though.  I mean, I was always, you know, Black History Week is what we had at--we had Negro History Week in the segregated black schools.  And I was always proud to read more and hear about what African-Americans or Negroes or Coloreds did for this country, or had participated in making this a better place to live.  So I knew I was standing on their shoulders.  Now, this generation, the newer generations I don't think understand all of this only because things have been better.  They haven't had the hard knocks.  Their hard knocks are little different.  I mean, it's like water off a duck's back with some of the things I hear them talk about.  But it is important to them, and I understand that, but they need to also understand, you know, how things have gotten to where they are today.  You know, children today can't fathom the fact that someone would call them a name and they didn't have--and they couldn't fight back.  And that was one of those requirements by the superintendent of schools.  You, you know, there should be no retaliation; no fighting, none of that, okay.  So you were going to hear some things, but you could not--you had to turn the other cheek and we did, generally speaking.
Story_ID: 55577
Speaker 1: But the administration, didn't they try to curtail some of that stuff, too?
Speaker 2: How could they?  I mean, how can you--how can you, you know, curtail someone's mouth in a sense?  Or tripping you in the hall or, you know, even the guards couldn't do some of the things.  I mean, you--people would say to me, "Well, you had a guard," you know.  Well, yes, we did have a guard, but children are children.  They will find a way to make it miserable for you, okay.  So, you know, putting glue in your seat, and spittle in your seat, or spitting on you, or throwing eggs at you.  How do you--how does the administration stop that?  They stand in front of you when the egg comes?  No.  Okay.  So--
Speaker 1: They have a hard time trying to stop that in some of the inner city schools now--
Speaker 2: Today.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) that are all black.
Speaker 2: Right.  So I know.  And they didn't--they did the best they could, some of them.  Some of the teachers looked the other way, you know.  So, those are the sorts of things that had just happened.  It's just human nature, you know.  Because we all don't like each other, you know.  And one must understand that.  And it's unfortunate.  But I've always been the type that want to learn more about the next person or their religious beliefs or their backgrounds or what have you.  But that's me.  I recognized long time ago that's not everyone.
Story_ID: 55578
Speaker 1: So now, after graduation from [Little Rock] Central High School, you went to the University of Michigan?
Speaker 2: No, I went to Michigan State University in East Lansing; spent two and a half years there, and I had visited in Denver, Colorado, between my freshman and sophomore year and couldn't get it out of my mind.  So I ended up out there.  And three months--around Thanksgiving, my parents came to visit me, and my father made the comment that it's the first time he had seen me really smile the way I--he knew I was happy or felt good about things.  And that made him feel good.  And they were living in Kansas City [Missouri] by that time because of jobs, and not being able to continue to do what he was--had been doing, and having to fight that system.  So he moved the--they spent--my sisters were in school--when school was out, he moved the family to Denver [Colorado] and they--I've been there since 1962, then the family came in '63 (1963).  And my sisters finished their schooling there in Colorado and went off to various colleges throughout the United States.  So it's home, you know.  I've lived there longer than any other place.  I spent sixteen years in Little Rock, Arkansas, and you know, vowing never ever to return, but that, you know, you never say never ever.  And I must say that fortieth reunion that took place in Little Rock was probably--I didn't think anything could be better than what the city and state had done--attempted to do that week of commemorating or celebrating.  I still think that they're trying to determine whether it was a commemoration or a celebration of the fortieth anniversary of us being there. But that was a great, great moment.  And to be well received by the city and by the state, and by the students on the grounds, and the President of the United States being there, and quite a large number of his cabinet members being there.  But the true highlight was receiving the Congressional Gold Medal; something none of us expected.
Speaker 1: A moving experience.
Speaker 2: Very much so.  Very much so.  So that kind of--does the--the years that--from reading about other history makers from elementary school or on up to now, you know, I'm basically on the shoulders of those that laid another foundation.  And we made another foundation, I would say or at least another layer, and I'm sure that there are young people out there today that will take it to another level.
Story_ID: 55579
Speaker 1: You're still young--
Speaker 2: Well, thank you.
Speaker 1: --how would you like to be remembered in terms of your--
Speaker 2: Oh, one who tried to do her personal best.  That's all I ask of others.  And try to help people.  I get some self satisfaction from that, but I always try to do my best at whatever it is.  And--and I do it from my heart.  And because I believe that it is the right thing to do, that's the other thing.  And that is the reason I went to Central [High School] because it was the right thing.  So that's one way.  And being a grandmother and wife, and wanting the best for them, and hoping that they will take it to another level.
Story_ID: 55580
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything that you'd like to say that we haven't asked you?
Speaker 2: Not that I can think of.  You know, I don't know how you're going to take all of this-I mean, what you're editing out, what you're putting in, and all that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: We don't edit--(unclear)
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --what you say--
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: --(unclear) will be here--
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: --as long as this interview lasts in some form or another--
Speaker 2: Uh huh, I see.  I can't--I'm just happy and proud that all nine of us are still here.  We were able to be together, and our parents, to witness that fortieth, and also the Congressional Gold Medal ceremony at the White House because they really are the heroes and the sheroes out of the nine of us.  And I understand that now because I'm a parent, okay.  So knowing what they probably had gone through, not really knowing that all these things were going to take place.  And they did, you know, but they hung in there and stayed with it.  And I know that I could have quit, but I was not taught to quit.  I know that I also didn't have to continue in the--going to my twelfth grade.  I had fulfilled that commitment which was at tenth grade, and I could've gone many places to go to school.
Speaker 1: Did you have discussions about it at home as to whether you--(unclear)
Speaker 2: I don't recall them--that to be a roundtable discussion, okay.  It could have been asked, you know, "Is this what you want do?"  Or "You have the opportunity to--" well, like going to St. Louis, and I stayed with Attorney Freeman, Frankie Freeman while I went to school there, when she opened up her home to me and to Elizabeth [Eckford] to--so that we could take those classes at Beaumont [High School].  I have met some great people because of Little Rock that I probably would not have met--had not been for that time.  Lena Horne was one.  Thurgood Marshall, again, is you know, is just one that--Langston Hughes.  I mean, there were so many people that I had the opportunity to be in their presence--Adam Clayton Powell, I mean just being in his presence and the way he handled himself was very much like Thurgood Marshall as well.  The power that they seemed to have.  And the pride I took knowing them.  There're so many others.  I mean, Maya Angelou, coming from Arkansas as well; now, that was not until years later, but how proud I was of her, in reading her background and "The Caged Bird Sings," her autobiography, and then recognizing she's from Arkansas.  Same way with the black press, you know.  [John Harold] Johnson being from Arkansas.  There are a lot of people that have--were born, and bred, and groomed in the state of Arkansas that went on to do wonderful things, and to give to this country.  And I'm just happy to be a little piece of it.
Story_ID: 55581
Speaker 1: It seems like the nine of you did quite well.
Speaker 2: I think all of us have done as well--in fact, in some instances, better, you know, because of that experience, and had some opportunities, and again, took those opportunities.  But we had to bring something to the table as well.  And we were prepared, most of us were prepared for whatever endeavors that we took, so.  I mean, you have the list of the things that, you know, that each one has done, and I mean, Ernie [Ernest Green] being the vice president of Lehman Brothers, senior accountant of--senior manager, I guess, with Lehman Brothers--not a vice president; but, Melba [Patillo] Beals has written a couple of two or three books, and PR Firm Media Communications, that she's been involved in all these years, and teaches public relations that she has going for her; Terrence Roberts with Antioch College; prior to that, the UCLA [University of California - Los Angeles]; prior to that, Angwin College, and heads of departments.  Jefferson Thomas is with the government and should be retiring soon.  Gloria Ray Karlmark has lived in Sweden all these years and for the most part--and owned a magazine, editor of a magazine, retired now; worked for Phillips and IBM so--and also an attorney.  We've all done some things, so.  Elizabeth [Eckford] is the only one that is living in Little Rock today.  And Thelma Mothershed is a retired school teacher and counselor.  And I don't know who I'm missing right now, but I think I've touched base with about everyone.
Story_ID: 55582
Speaker 1: Well, I should ask something else, but.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--I don't know where else we can--I can't think of any particular things right off the bat about that time.  I mean, as I said, there was some things I just really don't like, you know, thinking about; all the negative things.  I mean, there's some positive things that have taken place, and let me just mention a couple of those.  At the fortieth anniversary, the Mobil station, Mobil Oil Company, donated the Mobil station that was, kind of in a sense, used as headquarters for those that were against us being there.  And they refurbished that place and made it into a museum.  And it is the Central High Museum.  And through the efforts of Red Tucker and Skip Rutherford, and a number of others on that particular committee, other things took place.   And one being that we--it is now a part of the Parks system, that across the street there's a garden.  And it's really something to see.  And the nine benches there, they represent the nine students, and all the various pictures that reflect what took place these past forty-plus years; in fact, more than that because there're pictures of Dunbar High School and some of those participants, such as Principal Christophe, and some of the teachers that were there at Dunbar, so there're two arches there.  And this is, the museum and this garden is run by the National Parks.  So it is everlasting.  And I just think that's wonderful.  And that took the commitment of those who still remain in Little Rock, who really wanted a positive spin on this, as it should have been in 1957.  The symbolism of the principal, the mayor, the governor and the President of the United States opening the doors to the Little Nine in 1997, that was the way it should have been in 1957.  So I give kudos to those that are still working on that particular committee that is trying to get this history out there as it took place, and to give not only the piece regarding the governor and his political agenda our agenda, but also the community and what they did and did not do, okay.  There were some that could, you know, could have made things better.  And some of their children that are still living there are trying to make things better, so.  That I think is a plus.  And ground will be broken for a museum and conference area and place where people will come and study this timeframe in our history.  So--and that will be run by the National Parks Service.  So I think all of those are positive things that have come out of this whole thing.
Speaker 1: You have our heartfelt thanks.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you for having me.
