Speaker 1: Okay, I'd like to know what your favorite food is?
Speaker 2: I, I don't know if I have one favorite.  That's an interesting question.  I can't--I can think of things I don't like, rather than things I like.  But favorite food, I guess I--for interest, I'll say steak, all right, but--okay, all right.

Maybe it'll come to me, but, oh, it's (laughs)--be--I can't think of it now.  And it's just part of me and I say it.  And I'm sure my family member could tell me what that is?
Speaker 1: Do you know what it is? Sure, there're a few.  Make it look like an accident.

Speaker 2: Yeah, well, it's a story behind that.
Speaker 1: (laughs) okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know if you need it for this (laughs), but the other one was, be, you know, I say it all the time.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (target?).
Speaker 2: No, that's another, but the other one I say, "be", not "be nice", what is it?  "Help me, don't hurt me".  Help me, don't hurt me, that's it.
Speaker 1: Help me, don't hurt me (laughs).
Speaker 2: What's the origin of that?
Speaker 1: Of what?
Speaker 2: You've got some interesting phrases.
Speaker 1: Oh, I've got, I have four or five, and--.
Speaker 2: (laughs), these are, I just (unclear) (simultaneously)--.
Speaker 1: Oh, I say--and there's one I used this morning to Madeline, and I can't remember it now.  I say it all the time, to you.
Speaker 2: No leftovers?
Speaker 1: No, not that one.  "Be nice, yeah, what is it?  All right, be nice, something like that, but "help me, don't hurt me".
Speaker 2: Okay, won't you just help me, don't hurt.
Speaker 1: That means, I need some help or assistance so help me, don't hurt me.
Story_ID: 11961
Speaker 1: Well, first of all, I want to ask the origin of your name.  I found Farnandis interesting, and I found Rabb interesting.  So I want to sort of understand the origin of that, those two?
Speaker 2: Well, I think, and I can be corrected on this, my great grandmother was named--okay, my great grandmother was named Farnandis, and one side of the family was Rabb and the other was Farnandis.  And they spelled it F-A-R-N-A-N-D-I-S, as opposed to, I guess, the Spanish way.  So it came from my father's side--well, he was Rabb, but I guess on his mother's side.  I'm not very good at being a genealogist.
Speaker 1: Do you know the name, what its origins?  It sounds Jewish.
Speaker 2: It, well, it depends on what part of the country you're in.  When I was in New York for a couple of years, everyone I ever met in New York and elsewhere who were Caucasian were Jewish.  I, I never met a Caucasian with the name Rabb who wasn't, and I had a couple of friends in college.  And then in, later in graduate school, who had the name Rabb who also was Jewish.  However, I've learned since that, that there are Rabbs elsewhere who are not necessarily, in the past, who had that time, who weren't Jewish.  For a long time, every black person I met named Rabb had some quasi connection to the South, whether it was Mississippi or Texas or Alabama, had some connection in that way, either in my family or having no actual connection to, to my family.  So I've met black Rabb's and I've met white Rabbs.  But I've never personally ever met a white Rabb that wasn't Jewish.  And so Jewish friends would say, that where the derivation came from, when they came from Europe, they took off the last part, Rabbenowitz and was it was shortened to be Rabb.  Well, there are two types of Rabbs that are Jewish in American.  The one's that are spelled R-A-B-B like my name, and then the other is R-A-A-B.  So if you look in the New York telephone book, there're more R-A-A-Bs than there are R-A-B-Bs.  And then if you look at the name Rabbi, you just take the "i" off, and it's R-A-B-B.  So, is the origin from Europe and Jewish or is it something else, I can't tell you.  I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you were named after your father?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He was the senior, and--
Speaker 2: Oh, can we cut (unclear).  All these questions you're asking me now--.
Speaker 1: Don't worry about it--.
Speaker 2: I would have a great, a better answer if, if I'd ask him [Rabb's son, Chris] first cause he knows all the answers to this.  He, he can tell--.
Speaker 1: You know all the answers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, all about--.
Speaker 1: [Chris Rabb:] It's Irish.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's Irish?
Speaker 1: [Chris Rabb:] They spelled the name wrong about three hundred years ago.  It was supposed to be Robb, R-O-B-B, and the Rabb's come from--.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: But how do explain the Jewish one, from what I just--.
Speaker 2: [Chris Rabb:] Yeah, what you said was true.
Speaker 1: It's for the Jewish side.
Speaker 2: [Chris Rabb] There are far more gentiles who are Rabbs in the states than, than Jewish people.  It's just that he's been around more Jewish people.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in New York.
Speaker 2: [Chris Rabb:] Right.
Speaker 1: Right, so that's, so that's what happened, is that you think the slaves spelled it wrong or did--?
Speaker 2: [Chris Rabb:] No, it was the Irish family itself whose name was, was changed to, to Rabb, and they were definitely from Ireland, but they were also German, non-Jews, who--.
Speaker 1: Right, that's what I was wondering if it was German, non-Jewish.
Speaker 2: Right, and then the other thing--.
Speaker 1: [Chris Rabb:] His family, his Rabb comes from an Irish family in South Carolina, the Rabb plantation in Winnsboro--(simultaneously)--.
Speaker 2: That's what I was saying.  I was trying to warn you before that he's done this.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, you have to say that then to me (laughs).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I will.  But I have to, I have to--see.
Speaker 1: [Chris Rabb:] I think I'm causing more problems than--(unclear) (simultaneously)--.
Speaker 2: You're not.  But it's important to have it more accurate.  I mean that's important information.  Okay, now--.
Speaker 1: Right, but, and there's one other thing about the name Farnandis.
Speaker 2: [Chris Rabb:] You were right.  Your great grandmother, her maiden name was Farnandis.  It came from the, the Farnandis family is a prominent family in Mississippi, but we don't know their origins.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: [Chris Rabb:]  But it sounds like it'd be Spanish, Fernandez (unclear) (simultaneously)--.
Speaker 1: Right, that's (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: [Chris Rabb:]  And you should remember how your father was upset at how his middle name was changed.
Speaker 2: His was Fernando.
Speaker 1: [Chris Rabb:]  Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, and I'm Farnandis.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I don't--but he, he knew his name was Fernando.
Speaker 2: [Chris Rabb:] But he was upset because it was, they changed it for him when it should have been Farnandis.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.  I get it.
Speaker 2: Okay, so can we go back--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the one thing about the Irish was it was R-O-B-B, and they switched it to--.
Speaker 2: You just pulled on your mic.  Okay.
Speaker 1: [Chris Rabb:]  It was originally R-O-B-B, but it was--there was a switch way--in the seventeen hundreds to Rabb.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: [Chris Rabb:] And the Rabbs, our Rabbs and most black Rabbs come from South Carolina.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, so can we, you got that, okay.
Speaker 2: I got that.  Well, a little interesting history about my name.  Originally, the name came from Ireland, and it was R-O-B-B.  And it was changed somewhat in the early days of America to R-A-B-B by people settled in South Carolina.  So actually, the name came from that particular area of the United States, and it was Rabb from that point on, from slave owners.  And so it kind of migrated from South Carolina to the other Southern states.  So it came really from Robb to Rabb, R-A-B-B.  So it's probably a, an Irish heritage.  However, there's another aspect, as I mentioned, I have mentioned before about in New York City where there's a large Jewish population, there are a lot of Rabb's, and that may--derivation may be from original Rabbenowitz, and they took off the -witz off it, and left the R-A-B-B or the R-A-A-B.  That's about as much as I know about that.
Speaker 1: Now, let's go to your middle name, what you were saying about that, you know.  But you know what, I--so, you know, what about Robb, Robb, the Robb family in, in--that were married to the Johnson is it?  Johnson girl, President Johnson, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: That name was Robb, R-O-B-B.
Speaker 1: He's R-O-B-B?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: May be related (laughs).
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Have you checked that out, Christopher?  Okay, let's--true, well, it's true--Okay, what about the, the, you know, your, your middle name?
Speaker 2: Well, middle name is Farnandis and so it's F-A-R-N-A-N-D-I-S, rather than the Spanish sound.  It was on my grand--great grandmother's side, that name.  And my father's na--middle name was Fernando.  And he was real upset because he wanted to be an original Farnandis.  So when I was born, my middle name became Farnandis, as, just as the family name.  So he was Maurice Fernando Rabb, and I'm Maurice Farnandis Rabb.

Speaker 1: Let's talk about your father.  Can you tell us what you know about his background and, and his growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, he grew up in Columbus, Mississippi.  He was born in Columbus, Mississippi and grew up there.  And there were a number of brothers, and a few siblings that did not live long.  I don't--I can't give you that exact information.  But his father was an entrepreneur very early.  He owned a meat market.  And it was called Rabb's Meat Market.  And in those days, that was very unusual for a black man to have his own business.  And it was a very good business as well.  I never knew my grandfather or my grandmother, 'cause I was too young when they died.
Speaker 1: Did he share anything with you about growing up in Columbus, Mississippi?  Did he ever share any stories or anything?
Speaker 2: Not much.  My father really didn't like to talk too much about--if I can remember, did not like to talk too much about his childhood in Columbus, I mean--yes, in Columbus, Mississippi.  I, I don't know why.  Sometimes I, I've spoken with my mother about it, and I think at times, he didn't always have a happy childhood.  So he left early and went to school at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Do you--did he talk anything about his mother or anything like that or did?
Speaker 2: I think that his mother, during the later years, was an invalid, and really couldn't get around a lot, and so was not in good health.
Story_ID: 11963
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your mother.  Where, what was her maiden name?  She was Jewel?
Speaker 2: Jewel Miller.
Speaker 1: And where was she from originally?
Speaker 2: Louisville, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--okay.  So did she talk about at all growing up herself in Louisville?
Speaker 2: Yes, she, she did.  And she had several brothers and sisters, let's see.  Three brothers and two sisters.  And she was next to the youngest.  And she would talk about her life in Louisville [Kentucky].  She was, I mean she's still very much alive, and, and so I think she had a more interesting, at least as far as I know, childhood.  Her father was an entrepreneur also and had his own truck and business.  And in those days, that was very unusual.
Speaker 1: So did she--can you share with us some of those--like at least maybe one story you remember from her growing up?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think.  Well, she liked to dance, and she used to do kind of a modern or interpretative dancing.  And that's what she did a lot before going to college.  And I think she may have done some even at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  Right off hand, it's difficult for me to think of a real interesting story.
Speaker 1: Did--with your parents, how did they meet?
Speaker 2: Oh, at Fisk.  He was at Meharry Medical College [Nashville, Tennessee] and she was across the street at Fisk.
Story_ID: 11964
Speaker 1: Can you describe your father [Maurice Rabb Sr.] to me?  What type of person was he?
Speaker 2: Well, he was a person who was very interested in, in several things.  He, he was interested in accomplishments, and he was also interested in civil rights.  And he was very much involved with the NAACP.  And he was a true integrationist.  In those days, that's what the goal was, was integration.  And that's what I can remember about him most in the later years of life.  He also was a, a lot of things.  He was a family doctor in the early days in Shelbyville, Kentucky.  And he also was interested in sports.  He was referee of basketball.  And he loved to go fishing.  I'm trying to think of the, of the things that interests him, and those were the, primarily the things, I think.
Speaker 1: And your mother [Jewel Rabb]?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was a school teacher and, and a housewife, both.  And I'm trying to think.  I don't think she had any hobbies.
Speaker 1: But how would you describe her from a personality standpoint?  Was she strong?  Was she meek?  Was she--?
Speaker 2: No, she was strong in a quiet way.
Story_ID: 11965
Speaker 1: Your growing up, I'd like you to talk about your growing up, you know, in Shelbyville [Kentucky].  And you are, are you the oldest?
Speaker 2: I'm the only.
Speaker 1: You're the only child, okay.  That's makes, okay.  So, wow.  So, let's talk about growing up then.  What was it like?  How, what was Shelbyville even like?
Speaker 2: Shelbyville was a small town in Kentucky, somewhat thirty miles East of Louisville in Shelby County, three thousand people, maybe four thousand at most, a very small town for a segregated, with separate but not--unequal in all ways.  And I grew up there as a child, and I, I really had a, I think a pretty good time there in Shelbyville.  I got along with most everyone, and I think everyone got along with me.  And I had a pretty good time except for maybe the segregation aspect of it.  You couldn't, when you went to movies, you had to go up to the balcony.  You couldn't go in restaurants.  You had to stand if you wanted to go and take something out, the same thing that we all know about that in those days.  And, of course, segregated school, which was inferior as far financial support, size and that.  My mother was a teacher in the school there, and it went to the, I think the eighth--ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Now, you--I want to, though, Shelbyville, let me just understand the nature--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of the town we're talking about.  There were three thousand, three to four thousand people.  How many blacks, how many whites?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: Well, now, see I don't remember the percentage, but I know that we were a minority, let's put it that way.
Speaker 1: And did you--what, what would you say most of the blacks--what did they do?  Were they, you know, workers?
Speaker 2: Yes, most of them non-professional.  The only, the only professional people in town were my father.  He was the only black doctor for miles.  There was an undertaker, the principal of the school and the school teachers.  That made up the middle class.  Most everyone else were laborers.
Story_ID: 11966
Speaker 1: And did you have a sense growing up that you were middle class or had more--(unclear) (simultaneously)--?
Speaker 2: No, at that time, I didn't even know the different.  That was interesting.  All I knew was that my father was a doctor in town.  So that kind of made me a little bit different, but as a person, I didn't--I wasn't really at the time into that, middle-class and that in those days.
Speaker 1: And did your father, did he spend a lot of time traveling around to see people, or would they come to him?
Speaker 2: Well, both, because in those days, you--they made house calls.  And so he was both the Shelbyville doctor and the country doctor.  So in the area around Shelbyville, he was--there were no other black doctors for miles.  Louisville was the closest on one side, and perhaps, either Frankfurt or Lexington on the other.
Speaker 1: And did you ever go with him as a young child?
Speaker 2: Occasionally, I would go in the car, and--when he would go out, and I would sit in the car.  And the office was in the, kind of, sort of the basement of the house.  So the office and the house were connected in a way.  So I would see patients coming and going, and occasionally, I would go with him.
Speaker 1: Were you fascinated by your father's profession?  I mean was there--?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I--what you're asking me is saying, gee, looking at it, did I want to do that?  Absolutely not.  I had no desires at the time or even thought about being a doctor.  But everyone called me Little Doc because I was his son.  And, of course, after a while I got a little irritated with the Little Doc stuff.
Story_ID: 11967
Speaker 1: Will you share with me, like maybe three or four memories of growing up or family times or, you know, times that--?
Speaker 2: In Shelbyville?
Speaker 1: Um-hum, in Shelbyville.
Speaker 2: Well, let's see--.
Speaker 1: Church or, I mean any--or whatever, if it wasn't, school or--?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, well, school meant so much--I, I guess with school, I started school at five.  I was in the first grade.  What happened was that there was no place for me to go when my mother left to go to school.  So she took me to the school with her.  And she sort of put me there in the kindergarten at first.  And then next thing, the teacher said, well, let's go put him in first grade.  And you'd sit there.  So I would sit there with the other kids in the first grade. I wasn't supposed to be there.  But somehow, I was able to read and count and everything as well as, better than the there people in the first grade.  So the teacher said, let's just keep him in there.  So, therefore, I passed the first grade at five, and I mean the principal was upset.  But during the second grade, I was six.  So I got a one-year start on everything.  So that's one area.  The other thing I think I liked was in the wintertime, I used to slide down the hill right in front of my house on, what do you call it, a sled.  And I always liked the wintertime and sledding down the hills.  That was one thing.  The other thing I think was paper route was interesting.  And then also, I had an army.  Of course, I was the captain (laughs), and I would gather up all these kids.  And we would do demolition and chemical warfare.  And I would make up all these bombs and flame throwers and that sort of thing.  I was in--that was pyro--a pyrotechnic ability there.  And that was interesting.  And then, of course, I joined Cubs scouts, while I was still in Shelbyville.  And I was called a lone cub because there was no scout troop or Cub scout troop in, in Shelbyville.  The nearest one was Louisville.  So I became a lone Cub.  I, I was my own Cub person.  I had my uniform and everything.  So that was interesting being, doing those sort of things.
Speaker 1: Now, as a lone Cub, how did--cause usually, people come together for Cub meetings.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Well, since I, I had no Cub troop, I was called the lone Cub, and there were certain--that existed for people who lived in rural areas that wanted to be scouting, and if there was no around, they--that's what the name was called.  So I was a lone Cub, and I went up through the ranks.  And I don't remember how I did that, but it was not until, actually, I left Shelbyville, that I actually became part of, of a troop, a scout troop.
Story_ID: 11968
Speaker 1: What were you like?  Were you shy?  Were you mischievous?  Were you--?
Speaker 2: Oh, as a kid?
Speaker 1: Um-hum?
Speaker 2: No, I, I wasn't shy, and I, I always think of myself, never being mischievous and never doing anything--I was never a discipline problem as far as I can remember, you know, like in school, doing things.  I was, I always respected authority.  Maybe that's why I became a Cub scout, you know.  I never thought of myself as ever being mischievous.  I always kind of got along with everyone as far as I can remember.  I never really had any enemies or any real significant fights as a child or anything like that.  I can only think of one, but other than that, that was a rarity.
Story_ID: 11969
Speaker 1: Did you daydream?  Did you--you know, were you, you know, what were the things?  Did you read certain books or certain--?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, let's see.  Well, I--yeah, I used to like to read books.  I like photography.  I used to like making pictures.  I remember that as a youngster with, you know, black and white, of course.  There was no color in those days.  And I'm talking about pre-junior high now, my time in Shelbyville.  Oh, I forgot one important thing, yes.  While I was still in Shelbyville, I liked to experiment with batteries and radios, and that--so I used to hook up on batteries and wires and run them from my house to the neighbor boy's house across the field, so we could communicate with either telegraph keys.  And so I would hook up these batteries, wires that would go, they could go as far as a hundred feet.  And I used to hook these up cause I, I liked that kind of communication.  It was later that, got into the radio thing.  But I remember hooking up this, this telegraph keys from my house to the other kid's house with a lot of wires and batteries.
Story_ID: 11970
Speaker 1: Do you remember who your best friend was at the time?
Speaker 2: I had several in Shelbyville, and I can't remember their names now.  Yes, Roy--yes, I can.  I remember.  Roy Kanai (ph.) was one, and that stands out in my mind because we used to play--ah, this brings out another thing, yeah.  I was into guns, B.B. guns.  I used to--had a lot of B.B guns.  In those days, the parents didn't worry about sling shots and B.B. guns hurting you.  You know, now, you know that.  I'd never let my kids have a B.B. gun.  So I used to have a B.B. gun, and I used to shoot at everything.  And also, we used to play with sling shots.  One day we were playing with sling shots, I think, well, that was on my birthday or some festive time.  And Roy Kanai says I shot something at him, not at him directly, but near him.  And he says, I ought to get you for that.  So he slung back his sling shot, and he broke out my front tooth.  And my father wanted to kill him.  And from that day on, I had to see the dentist a lot because I had to get a cap put on my tooth, and that was my beginning of seeing dentists in my life.  It was a permanent tooth, unfortunately.  So, that was one thing that I can remember that I will never forget because it had an impact upon me.
Story_ID: 11971
Speaker 1: You were saying that the thing you didn't like about Shelbyville [Kentucky] or you experienced was that, you know, inequality between blacks and whites.  Do you remember your first or racist experience there?
Speaker 2: Well, well, the very fact that everyone was separated.  You had a black school and a white school.  That was obvious, and the fact that if you went to an ice cream place, you, you couldn't sit down.  You would have to stand and get it and go out the door.  That, that always left an impression on you.  And another impression was if you went to the movie theater, you couldn't even go to the front ticket booth.  You had to go to the side ticket booth.  And one day, I remember, I said, "Gee, I'm getting sick of this.  I'm going to the front booth.  And the lady looked at me, and she said, "Are you colored?"  And I said, "Yeah."  She said, "Well, then go around to the side booth," say, here's a front here and a side booth two feet away, but there was a difference.  You couldn't even buy your ticket.  You had to buy it at a separate little window, and go up the stairs.
Speaker 1: Do you remember first when you understood what color meant, though, being colored?  I don't remember the year, and I often think about that.  When you're a youngster, a lot of times you don't look at that sort of thing. I think it first hit me was, was either school or when you go to Main Street.  And you go to a store, then you find out you're different.  At home, you know, everybody's family.
Story_ID: 11972
Speaker 1: One interesting thing, you know, about my father [Maurice Rabb Sr.] being a family doctor, in those days, you know, doctors are not  like what they are today, you know.  They, they really didn't make a lot of money, particularly, in rural areas like this.  And he was often paid with chickens and vegetables.  And I always remember, there was one family would pay him in sausages.  And they would come in glass jars, and the white lard would be in the jars surrounding the sausages.  I know how you think about fat these days and cholesterol.  I mean sausages in those days, you--were only good if they came packed in the lard.  And I used to see this--it was the best sausage you ever had in life.  And that was one thing about it, but he often didn't have cash because, you know, this was Depression time.  This was back in the early 1930s, and, and, moving into the late '30's [1930s] before World War II.  So people didn't have a lot of money.  So I remember that, yes.
Speaker 2: Do you know why he wanted to be a doctor?  Do you know why he ended up--?
Speaker 1: That, that's interesting.  I, I think that, number one, he, he wanted an education, and couldn't get it in Columbus, Mississippi cause it just wasn't available.  And if you wanted to get an education, you'd have to leave Mississippi.  So he went to Nashville [Tennessee] to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], and I think it was during that time that he realized that he wanted to be a doctor.  In his day, and even after that, you either were gonna a doctor, a lawyer, a minister, a--the other areas weren't opened.  I mean entrepreneurial things were there, but not like today.  And so the number of things that a black man could do in those days were actually the professions.
Speaker 2: Do you think your father enjoyed his, you know, being a doctor?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, oh, absolutely, yeah, I think so.  Matter of fact, he was the sort of person that he didn't--he wanted to kind of impress upon you things.  And what he would do as a kid, he would have me come by the hospital, the little hospital in Shelbyville [Kentucky], the so-called colored hospital, because you couldn't go to the white hospital.  And it was a small hospital and doctors there had to do everything.  I mean you, you might be the physician, the internist, the anesthesiologist and the surgeon.  So, at times when they had surgical procedures, my father would have his coat in and say," I want you to come by the hospital with me."  It wasn't, I had any choice.  He says, "I'm gonna take you by the hospital."  And they would gown me up.  And I would, I was not even--let me see, this was before junior high.  I could have been ten, eleven, I, I don't know my age, now.  But I would go in the operating room, and, and watch.  He wanted me to come in the operating room and see these procedures.  And a lot of times, I didn't want to go.  And I mean these were surgical procedures.  I remember seeing amputations and other types of surgical procedures as a kid like that.  And a lot of times, I would resist wanting to go because it's not always good to sit there and watch surgery.  And I'll never forget that.  And what he was trying to do in his way, he wanted me to be a doctor, and he thought by taking me by there, that this would bring about some interest.  But it really kind of turned me off in a lot of ways about it because times, mentally, I just wasn't ready to see all those surgical procedures.  But I never was a, the kind of person that would faint at the sight of blood.  And I guess not, because I saw it very early in life.
Speaker 2: That's sort of fascinating.  But at the same time, you were interested, you liked B.B. guns and you liked, you had--.
Speaker 1: That's, that's not the same thing as being in a surgical suite.
Speaker 2: (Laughs) That's true (laughs).
Speaker 1: It's not the same.  I mean, you know, many people in college or in med school really never see that sort of thing until later in their training.  And here I was, I wasn't even a teenager.  So in those days, you could do that.  I mean you could take somebody in the room, operating room and have them stand there and watch.  And these days, you, you really can't do that.  Things are totally different now.  But I'll never forget that.
Story_ID: 11973
Speaker 1: We each take some attributes from our parents, and I'm wondering, you know, what do you have of, of both of them or, you know--?
Speaker 2: I have my mother's personality, not my father's.  My father [Maurice Rabb Sr.] was sort--he liked things to be always right, always--don't bring any bad news.  That was my father, 'don't bring any bad news'.  I mean he expected you to excel and no failure, failure is not acceptable.  And my father, one thing I can remember is I never in my entire have heard him ever say 'I'm sorry', because I think to him, to say 'I'm sorry' or 'forgive me', was a weakness.  And it really isn't.  But I remember that he could never say that.  He, he was never wrong.  And so, therefore, I think I took the other side, my mother's side on that.  It's from my father I think I took the idea of, of always moving ahead,  progressing, excelling, achievement,  I got that from my father, but my, my father also was not very affectionate.  We didn't, we didn't hug in our family and that's interesting.  And later on in life, I, I didn't really think about it.  The only time I thought about it was after my children were born, and they came around and my wife, then hugging.  You know, certain families hug every ten minutes.  In my family, no, none.  It was just not the--not that we didn't have feelings for each other.  It's just something that didn't occur.  So I, I learned my father had a temper.  If anything didn't go right, he, he would let you know it, whereas my mother was more even keeled.
Speaker 1: And did you have any of the loneliness that, you know, only kids are said to have?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  You know, people used to say, "You're an only child," and "Aren't you lonely?  Don't you want a little brother or sister?"  And I would say immediately, "No, why?"  I never felt the need for a sibling.  And now, I don't know, is that good or bad, but I've never had it cause I would always go with the neighborhood kids, when I wanted to play, I would, and when I didn't want to, I would be with myself.  And I was perfectly happy without, you know, company at that time, but I was friendly with other children.  But I've never--matter of fact, I would think, you know, maybe I wasn't really supposed to have any brothers or sisters.  But I've never, ever thought about, gee, I wish I had a bro--you know how children say, Please, I want a little baby sister."  I never, ever said that.  Now, that's interesting in itself, isn't it.
Speaker 1: It is, yeah.
Story_ID: 11974
Speaker 1: In eighth grade, I mean when you were--did you go to the school?  Was this a one-room school house?
Speaker 2: No, it was almost.  There were several rooms.  They would have rooms like for the first grade and the second grade; then the third and fourth grade.  And I think it went up to the sixth grade.  And so I, I went to the sixth grade, and the reasons why I only went that far was because my mother was a teacher there.  And that was always a problem, your mother's a teacher in the school where you are.  Plus, they wanted me to get a better chance of education.  And the only way to do that is for me to leave and go to Louisville [Kentucky].  So when I graduated from my sixth grade, I went to Louisville to go into junior high which began in the seventh grade.  And I stayed with my mother's mother, my grandmother.
Speaker 1: So how was that experience because you're used to, you know, sort of--?
Speaker 2: Well--.
Speaker 1: --having a certain lifestyle.
Speaker 2: It, it wasn't, it was lonely at first.  I missed being at my home.  I missed my parents.  But my grandmother had a great personality, and we called her 'Mother Dear', everybody called her 'Mother Dear', not grandmother.  And so I lived with her and my stepfather, Mr. McKee.  And from the seventh grade, I think through the, I think the tenth grade, I, I'm trying to think right now, junior high, and I went into high school.  So I went to, the name of the junior high was Madison Junior High, never will forget that.
Speaker 1: Now, you, when you say that was your step-grandfather, you meant, you said, stepfather, but that was your step-grandfather.
Speaker 2: Step-grandfather, I'm sorry, yeah, step-grandfather, and my grandmother, who we called 'Mother Dear', yes.  And so I had my own room.  I remember that.  And it was, it was a nice--I, I--except for missing Shelbyville and my parents, it was all right.  And what I used to do, every other week, I think it was every other, I would--on Friday, I would catch the L&N [railroad line]--I think it was L&N, Louisville and Nashville Railroad, train, from Louisville to Shelbyville, which is thirty miles, but it seemed like a hundred, you know, to a kid.  But it was only thirty miles.  And I would catch the train on Friday.  And then on Sunday afternoon, I would take the train back.  So it--on Sundays, I remember having Sunday dinners in Shelbyville and having that little sense of depression when I had to get on that train and go back to Louisville and school the next day.
Speaker 1: And so you, you think that was every, you said, every other weekend?
Speaker 2: I think, I, I didn't think--I didn't go every weekend.  I think I would go every other weekend because it would be too much every weekend.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you did that for like, three years?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see, seventh, eighth, ninth--.
Speaker 1: And tenth?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was several years.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember on Sundays, it would be depressing cause I knew I'd have to, you know, get up and go to the train.  So what was important about those years of your life in terms of your own development.  You know, you're a teenager at this point, and I'm just wondering, you know?
Speaker 1: I'm trying to think.  What age was I at that time, in the seventh grade?  You, you said you skipped a grade.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was six in the sec--in the second grade, seven in the third, eight in the fourth, nine in the fifth, ten in the sixth, eleven in the--no, I wasn't a teenager.  It, if I, if--if I was five in the first grade, six in the second, seven in the third, eight the fourth, nine in the fifth, ten in the sixth, eleven in the seventh.  I wasn't a teenager.  I was eleven years old.
Speaker 1: About eleven years old, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, but I'm saying in this period of time, you became a teenager?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in this period of time I became a teenager, right.
Speaker 1: So, I'm just wanting to know what, what was critical in that development as you were sort of maturing or?
Speaker 2: I don't know, knowing that I had two family, one in Shelbyville [Kentucky], with my parents and then with my grandparents in Louisville. [Louisville] So I had kind of two families to fall back on.
Speaker 1: And was there anything about the, at the home environment of your grandparents that differed dramatically from the home environment of your parents or--?
Speaker 2: Well, that there were uncles around, my mother's brothers were around at the time, one in the house and maybe one who's away and one who lived elsewhere.  So I got to see my uncles which was an extended families.
Speaker 1: And what were--were there subjects that you had that were favorite subjects?  Were you leaning towards math and science in--?
Speaker 2: No, not--my favorite subjects at the time, biology and the sciences, not math.  I can remember now.  It was, it was the, it was the sciences, primarily, the, the living sciences, sciences.
Speaker 1: Now, so when tenth grade--when your, when you finish tenth grade, where do you go from Madison Junior High [Louisville, Kentucky]?
Speaker 2: Well, you finish the ninth grade.  It's seventh, eighth and ninth.
Story_ID: 11975
Speaker 1: When I graduated junior high, I then went to Central High [Louisville, Kentucky], which is--it's all--these are all segregated schools, of course, you know.  And so I, I'll never forget that.  If you were black in Louisville, you went to Central High.  That, that was it.  There was no other school.  And so I went to Central High, and I like to think about it because later in life, you know, at one time in Louisville, it was called Central Colored High.  And even though that sign--I don't think the sign was over the front of the school when I went there, it, in the years past, that sign was up there.  And I think they removed that colored part, and just be--it was Central High.  But we always liked to say, dear ole, (singing) "Dear ole Colored Central High, we're in love with you."
Story_ID: 11976
Speaker 1: Did you like the school?
Speaker 2: Oh, I liked Central [High School, Louisville, Kentucky], yeah, I had friends there.  It was a good experience.  I, I had no real--the only bad experiences that I can think about school in Louisville was junior high.  And that was physical education.  We had a physical education teacher who took it seriously.  And although I was good, oh, I--and one thing I forgot to tell you about, if I can go back in days of Shelbyville [Kentucky], and this is part of my early days.  My father--I mentioned that he was a referee for basketball.  And he used to referee high school basketball as well as Kentucky State College basketball.  And he also was the physician for Kentucky State College.  And so, and also being a referee, he would going to all the tournaments, all the high school games and also the college games at Kentucky skate--State College [Frankfort, Kentucky].  And they would play, like Tennessee State and Wilberforce and all those.  So as a kid I would be there--my mother would tell me how, when I was born, I mean months after I was born, I would be at the basketball game in her arms while he was out there refereeing games.  And people used to hold me at those games, and so I grew up, you know, in those games.  So, as I got to be a little older, like four and five and six, I used to like basketball.  And at halftime, I used to be the halftime show.  And people who are much older than I, remember me as a kid.  And I could do amazing things at that time, that other kids couldn't because basketball wasn't like it is today.  I mean, you know, it's really big today.  But in those days, I could shoot the basketball, amazingly well.  And I wasn't very tall.  And so at half time, I would go out dribble and shoot basketballs, and I was a half-time show, and I loved that.  I remember that.  I even have pictures somewhere where I would, me and my basketball.  And people thought at that time, that one day, I'd be one of the best basketball players in the world.  Well, that never happened.  But that is an interesting part of my life that I remember.  And I remember one little kid was named Henry Arthur, I remember he came out on the court, and I wouldn't play with him because he was too small.  And I said, "You can't, you don't belong out here with me." Later, he became a Globetrotter (laughs).
Story_ID: 11977
Speaker 1: Now, you were saying about Madison Junior High [Louisville, Kentucky], what was that experience like?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, yeah.  Well,  the gym teachers, well, really believed in physical education which is fine.  But there's one thing that I couldn't do.  To this day, I cannot climb a rope.  I couldn't get two feet off the floor.  I, just, somehow I could not climb a rope.  I could anything else in the world.  I, during my entire physical education at Madison Junior High School, I never got ten feet off the floor. So as a result, I got a D in physical education.  Also, he would love to match up people and, and have boxing matches.  And I didn't like that because I didn't like boxing.  I didn't like hitting anyone else.  So that wasn't fun to me.  It was okay for somebody else hitting each other, but not me.  And I remember, I remember, I didn't like to be placed in this situation where we'd be boxing.  I remember that.  So--.
Speaker 1: Now, you, so in high school, what are--you, you said biology was your favorite subject.  Were there other things or activities that you were involved in.
Speaker 2: Oh, I was in the acting class.  My uncle was a school te--teacher at Central High [School, Louisville, Kentucky], Mr. Miller.  And he was also in charge of the acting class.  So I was in several school plays.  I remember that.  I liked that a lot.  I also, was also into some demolition, pyrotechnics.
Speaker 1: You didn't burn down the school, did you (laughs)?
Speaker 2: No, no, I didn't.  But, you know, it's important to let you know that in, back in those days, in Shelbyville, and particularly, I loved fireworks.  And I used to blow up everything, bottles.  I would, I would, I would get more firecrackers.  Number one, in those days, you know, we didn't think about fireworks being dangerous.  You know, today that's part of my job is to tell youngsters, you don't play with firecrackers.  In my day, I did everything you weren't supposed to do with firecrackers, cans, bottles, dangerous things.  One time, I--well, the firecracker blew off in my hand, had a short fuse, and I didn't realize it.  And it was pretty bad, but everything's okay now.  And then when I was in junior high, I believed in setting--and making what we called, not Molotov cocktails, but I would call them screw bombs.  We'd take two bolts and a nut.  We'd take the nut.  We'd put them on match heads.  You'd cut match heads.  In those days, we had wooden matches, and you'd cut the tips off.  That's, that's phosphorous.  Now, at the time I didn't know it was really bad stuff.  So I cut the, with the heads off of matches and put them in the bolt.  Then we'd take the two screws and slowly screw them into the bolt.  And then you'd throw them like hand grenades.  And when it hit, they'd boom, crazy things like that.  That was it, and that was the only kind of risqué things that I did as a youngster.
Speaker 1: But how did you know about those things?  Did you read about them in a book?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I was into chemistry and into science.  So that wasn't difficult, yeah, it was--.
Speaker 1: Now, did you continue with your photography at all cause you said earlier--?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, which brings up another interesting story.  When I moved to Louisville, some years after I was there, my father's brother also moved to Louisville.  And he was a photographer, professional photographer.  And he would do portraits.  So I used to work in his darkroom.  And I have a love for photography, and I would see his work, and I would like to take pictures.  And I used to take a lot of black and white pictures as a kid, which I will into that in a minute.  But it was interesting that Uncle Alvin, Uncle Alvin was a true Rabb (laughs), meaning he had a temper too like my father [Maurice Rabb Sr.].  And it'd be interesting to see the two of them together.  My father was older, and he was like my uncle's overseer, and he would like to tell my uncle what to do.  And I know, my uncle [would] always say, you know, "Your father is getting on my nerves, telling me what to do.  I'm a grown man."  And my father didn't like anyone who smoked.  My father was in the forefront of nonsmoking before it ever, ever became in the journals, in the medical journals.  I used to remember him preaching to people about not smoking back in--I'm talking about the '40's [1940s], yeah, I'm talking about the '40's [1940s], not smoking.  And he would tell them, you know, the price of that, that pack of cigarettes, if you added how much you spent every day, every week, every month, at the end of the year, you'd have X amount of dollars.  And my Uncle Alvin smoked two cigarettes at the same time.  He literally would light one up, while the other one's going.  And he also liked to drink, which people do, which is fine.  And my father didn't like anyone to drink if they were members of the Rabb family.  Now, if you weren't a Rabb, he would give you all the drinks in the world.  I mean you come by the house, he would say, "Want a drink?"  And as a kid, you know, like five, six, seven and--I always remembered when people would come to the house, you know, people coming to visit, the first thing my father would say, "Can I get you a drink?"  Well, I always noticed that none of us in the house drank.  Of course, I didn't.  But my mother didn't, and my father didn't.  And all these years a kid growing up, I felt that other people, other than Rabb's must (unclear), must have drinks in order to exists because they came to my house, to have a drink. they would say, yes.  And as I kid, I, I just couldn't understand why they had to, and we didn't.  So anyway, getting back to the point was, my father didn't like smoking or drinking, and particularly, drinking if you were a member of the family.  And, and Uncle Alvin said, you know, "Your father's really bugging me."  I, he didn't use those words, he used some other words.  And Uncle Alvin was great.  I really liked working in that darkroom to get--but unfortunately, my father was right.  My Uncle Alvin smoked too much, and he died in the forties, in his forties.  He didn't get to be fifty.
Speaker 1: Now, what did you like about the darkroom?
Speaker 2: Well, the, taking the picture, and then you'd suddenly--you'd put it in the developer.  And suddenly, that white paper and the image would come up.  It was like magic.
Speaker 1: Now, it's, it's your senior year?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you are going to--now, school, go on--what?  You want to say--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but we still have to stay on high school.  You said, well, one of my other hobbies was, in junior high and high school, was making crystal radios.  You know how you do that.  You, you take a, the oatmeal box, and you wrap a wire around it, coils, and then you get a crystal, and a, and a large safety pin and earphones, and you'd have a radio.  So in the morning, I used to listen to the radio on the, on the crystal radio.  I loved doing crystal radios.
Speaker 1: And there was no TV then.  Now, what is crystal radios for those of us who are not--?
Speaker 2: Well, it's a little quartz, and if you connect to wires, and with the safety pin, and you scratch the, the little crystal, you, you'd get the radio frequency.  It comes through the air.  And with a little antenna, it goes into the coil around the oatmeal box, and that gets the frequency.  And so with the earphones, you can actually hear one or two radio stations with a crystal radio.  You can still buy those for kids today.  But in those days, that was great because there was only radio, and you'd make your own little radio.  That was a hobby.  So I was into doing that sort of thing because there was no television at the time.  You'd have a radio, and in the back, it would say, plug for radio and plug-in for TV.  That was a hoax.  And it never, ever worked.  But they said this is a TV connection.  And people would buy a radio and said, when TV came, you just plug your wire in, then you'd have a TV.  That was great advertisement, but it was really not true.  So that was one of my hobbies, and we, you'll see as we go along, a little later, you'll see what I mean by that.  Well, actually, yeah, that was a hobby, radio.
Speaker 1: So, you--is there anything else about high school?  I mean--?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, as I said, was interested in the acting, and I was interested in biology and I was interested in scouting.
Story_ID: 11978
Speaker 1: When I went to Louisville [Kentucky to attend Madison Junior High School], I became part of scouting.  Now, prior to going to Louisville, I was a Cub Scout in Shelbyville [Kentucky], but every summer I used to got to Day Camp Dan Beard, which was between Shelbyville and Louisville.  And it was a, the colored Boy Scout camp.  And I moved all the ranks of Cub Scout up to being a Tenderfoot.  And so when I got to the Louisville, I was in the Boy Scout troop.  And we used to--every summer, I used to go to camp.  And I'd go to camp for two or three week at, at, at one time.  And camps at those times are not like now.  We had to cook our own food, carry our own water, you know, it was like survivor.  And I loved Boy Scouts.  Scouting was great.  And I moved through the ranks, from Tenderfoot second class, first class, Star, Life.  And when I was fourteen, I was fortunate enough to be one of those scouts who went to the World Jamboree in France.  So, in, in Aug--in August 1947, two years after the end of the war [World War II], I went, along with another scout from Louisville to the World Scout Jamboree in Moisson, France.
Speaker 2: Now, that's interesting.  So what was that whole experience like?
Speaker 1: Well, it, it was great.  We, the two of us--we were Louisville.  We were in region four, which is Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky.  And we had to go to Ohio to meet up with the other scouts.  And in our scout troop, all the scouts were white except for one guy from Cleveland, Ohio, who's now a judge or a lawyer and William Queen and myself from Louisville. And we were with region four.  And so we met there as a group, and then we went from there to New Jersey, port of embarkation.  And we left on, on army transport ship.  And we went by boat to, to Europe, landed in Le Havre [France].
Speaker 2: So, how--but how was this because your parents, they had never--had they traveled like that?
Speaker 1: No, no one had traveled like this.
Speaker 2: So, how was, so--and you're still young?
Speaker 1: Yes, well, my parents were the sort of parents who always allowed me to travel.  And, and I loved to travel.  And so they were able to support the trip and let me go to Europe.  And so I was one of the Scouts going to World Jamboree, and Scouts from all over the world were going there.  And this was the first World Jamboree since World War II had ended.  And it was very interesting because it was in France.  And we landed in Belgium.  And, and the first place was Brussels, Belgium, and from there we went to the Netherlands, and from there--we took a train to France, to a place called Moisson outside of Paris.  And it was just land, I mean and we had to pitch tents.  I remember the first, first night I got there, it was late.  And we had to pitch our tents, and I almost froze to death that night in my little sleeping bag.  But it was an enjoying experience.  I, I loved Scouting, and at the time, I was a Life Scout.  And so after it was offer, we took a transport back home from, I think it, I can't remember the city of the embarkation from France.  Going over there, I got really seasick.  I was so seasick, I said, I didn't care if they threw me overboard.  It was a rough seas going--coming back it was okay.
Speaker 2: So did you--I just want to know what your impression of France was?  I mean this is a foreign country, where people were speaking a different language, and this is your first time--?
Speaker 1: Well, it was just, it was amazing because I'd never been overseas before, and, you know, we could still see signs of the war [World War II].  And because it was only two years after the war had ended.  And we could see, it was buildings that were, had been damaged and all that.  Paris [France] was Paris, of course, and it was, it was wonderful.  We didn't get to do a lot of traveling because we were at, at the Jamboree a lot.  So it, it was somewhat limited, but I got to meet scouts from all over the world.  And there were even scouts there from everywhere, but the iron country--the iron country [sic]--it wasn't there yet, the Iron Curtain, but I know, at the time, the Soviet Union wouldn't send any Scouts.  They boycotted it.
Story_ID: 11979
Speaker 1: We took a train back to Ohio, and so when we got to Ohio, we would have to, you know, take another train in order to get back to Louisville [Kentucky].  So I told William Queen who was the other [Boy] Scout with me, I said, "Look, let's get back home fast.  We don't want to take a train.  Let's take a plane."  So he said, "How do you do that?"  I said, "Just leave it to me."  So I made reservations--this is 1947, I made reservations on the TWA, from Dayton [Ohio] to Louisville.  And so I let my parents know that we were arriving at a certain time at, at Bowling Field, cause that was the airport at the time, and we were gonna be arriving.  So, we took this plane--this is 1947, landed in Louisville, and when we got off the plane, the press was there.  And we have pictures to prove this, and William Queen and I got off.  We were two black [Boy] Scouts going from Louisville, and the, the press was there and took our pictures.  They were wondering, where are the other Scouts.  The other Scouts were on the train somewhere, you know, those who were from this Kentucky area.  So we were the only ones in the paper coming back from the World Jamboree in Paris [France].  So at that early age, I was into travel and into flying
Speaker 2: How could you afford that?
Speaker 1: It didn't cost as much then.  And we'd had this money that we had left over from the trip.  And I just thought it'd be a good idea to fly home.
Story_ID: 11980
Speaker 1: World War II happened in 1941, and I, I was still in Shelbyville [Kentucky].  And I didn't, I remembered when people, I remember the Sunday of Pearl Harbor, and people saying, you know, we're at war.  And I was saying, "Gee, we're at war.  That's interesting.  I wonder what that means," as a kid, you know.  And, and so as the years went on, I didn't know that my parents [Jewell and Maurice Rabb Sr.] were concerned that, you know, my father might be drafted as a doctor to go, I mean, because doctors were being drafted.  So one day, he was actually told that--to report to a center for induction.  And so, you know, I heard this story from my parents.  And so he went to the induction center, and he says, they say, "What are--who are you, and what are you doing here?  He says, "I'm Maurice, I'm Dr. Maurice Rabb."  They said, "No, it's got to be a mistake."  He's says, "It's not a mistake.  I'm Dr. Maurice Rabb, you told me to report here."  So they looked at him, and they looked at the fact that he was a doctor, and they said, "There's got to be some mistake.  Go back home, and keep up the good job."  What had happened was that they would have had to made him an officer because all doctors were an officer.  So they, having any idea that they wanted him to be in the service as an officer, they didn't need him.  So they told him to go back home and keep up the good work.  So, he never went to the service because of his race.  And he says that's one time, being black, in a way, kept him out of the war.

Speaker 1: You're graduating from high school [Central High School, Louisville, Kentucky]--,
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you know, you know, that you're going on to college at that point?  Was it already predetermined?
Speaker 2: Well, that was interesting because when I was in high school, we had guidance teachers.  And they said, "What do you want to do?  And I said, well, "I either want to be an airplane pilot or a,"--I'm trying to remember exactly, "...airplane pilot, pilot or a doctor.  And the guidance teacher looked at me, and said, well, right away, "There's no way you're gonna be a pilot in an airplane because you're black, and you're never gonna get a job flying a plane."  And so I thought about it.  I either had to be a lawyer, a doctor or a teacher in those days.  That's the way we thought.  So I eliminated everything else, and I knew my father wanted me to be a doctor.  And as much as I rebelled against it because I knew he was putting the pressure on me, I finally decided, well, it was, it was a goal, and I have to prove something.  So I was going to college with pre-med.  So I couldn't go to the University of Louisville because I was black, and there was segregation.  So in order to go to a school, I would need to go somewhere else out of the state.  And so I decided on Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana], which--.
Speaker 1: Now, see, that was interesting to me.  Why Indiana University and why not Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], you know--(simultaneously)--?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't want to go to Fisk because all my life, that's all I heard about.  My mother went to Fisk.  My father went to Fisk, 'Fisk College this, Fisk College that'.  And the last place I wanted to go to was Fisk.  You know how you rebel.  So that was no question.  So I applied to--I'm trying to think where I applied besides Indiana.  I, in those days, it wasn't like now, where, you know, kids, you know, SATs and all that stuff, and getting into college.  It wasn't like that.  I just chose Indiana cause I thought it was close by, and I really can't answer that question now.
Story_ID: 11982
Speaker 1: So how was the experience in Indiana [University, Bloomington, Indiana], cause you're away for school, this time, you know, you know, you're away for a longer period of time.  And I'm wondering, you know, for--did you like it or didn't you like it?
Speaker 2: Well, that wasn't a problem being away because it was only ninety miles away from Louisville [Kentucky], Bloomington, Indiana.  And, yeah, all kids want to get away from home.  So being away from home wasn't a real problem at all, and I was close enough that I could go home when I wanted to.  And I guess the biggest thing college was the difference between Central High [School, Louisville, Kentucky] and, and, going to Central and without the real need to achieve to the level that I knew I could.  I might have been coasting to a certain degree in high school.  And the competition was different.  I don't care who you are, when you--sometimes you leave high school to go to college, there's a--the bar is raised.  And the bar really was raised because I really didn't have really good study habits.  Like one of my teachers told me in high school, says, you know, you're doing all right, but you're, you're coasting.  I'll never forget that, my social studies teacher told me that once; said, you know, you could do a lot better than you are.
Speaker 1: So you found out.  Was, was the University of Indiana [sic Indiana University], it was, you're in the first non-segregated--(unclear) experience?
Speaker 2: First, non-segregated experience, right.
Speaker 1: And so how many blacks were in your class?
Speaker 2: Oh, I couldn't tell.  There were thousands.  Indiana U freshman class was so large, it was amazing because in Indiana, they would have to accept anybody from Indiana in those schools.  So the freshman class could be thousands of people--I don't know whether it was two thousand, three-thousand, I have no idea, a lot of people.  And they always said that at the end of the year, fifty percent were gone.  It was that sort of thing.  So the classrooms were huge.  I mean you'd be sitting in a room with three hundred people.  That part I, I didn't like so much.
Speaker 1: Now, were you staying at, you know, off-campus--?
Speaker 2: No, on campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a brand new dormitory, had just been finished.  And we were the first students into these dormitories, but it was segregated.  There was still segregation in, in the dorms.  In other words, your--you would have all people, but your roommate would have to be of the same race.
Speaker 1: And, but all--but everyone living in that dorm had to be of the same race?
Speaker 2: No.  There were some that were all black, and then it was the other, the new dorm had whites and blacks, but your roommate was black.  And they were all either male or female.  It was none of this coed sort of thing in those days.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had a sense that you had to just work harder, period?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, being pre-med, it was difficult, and pre-meds go by the wayside.  And so it was difficult.  And so it was in college that I realized that being a pre-med was a definite problem in that if you didn't really succeed, you were out.
Story_ID: 11983
Speaker 1: Why did you end up going back?  I know that the University of Louisville [Louisville, Kentucky], you know, decided they would allow blacks, and they, you know, but, what, why did you end up, why did you not finish out at Indiana?
Speaker 2: A very good question, and the reason is, I do--the first two years at Indiana U, freshman, sophomore, I was being a pre-read--pre-med.  I realized that I would never be able to go to the University of Indiana School of Medicine because I was out-of-state.  And, and ninety-five percent of the people they took into med school were Indiana residents.  I was a Kentucky resident.  I knew my chances were nil at Indiana.  And just at that time, the Supreme Court made its ruling about segregation in higher education, and so schools were opening up around the country.  And one of the first schools that opened up was the University of Louisville because they were waiting for any excuse to open their doors for integration.  And as soon as that law was passed in '54 [1954]--it was actually, not '50--it was '52 [1952], the initial one, yeah, '52 [1952] for the universities.  And they opened up in June of '52 [1952], and I entered as a junior student, the summer of '52 [1952].  Matter of fact, I knew it was happening, so in my sophomore year at Indiana, I started taking courses that were applicable to the University of Louisville.  So I was ready when I transferred to go right into the junior year.  So I did my junior and senior year at the University of Louisville.
Speaker 1: So how was it being back at that point?  Did you--you know, you're on this track.  You know, you know direction, but are you staying at home at all?
Speaker 2: Yeah, staying at home.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's a different--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a different--.
Speaker 1: --you have freedom?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had freedom, but I was at home.  But I, I didn't mind being at home.  And I did well at, you know, the university.  Really, I liked the University of Louisville, and I knew that being at the University of Louisville, I had a, a good chance of getting into med school at the University of Louisville, being home and being at the University of Louisville.
Speaker 1: Now, the University of Louisville, how many people were on the--were you the only black in the pre-med program there or were--?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't the only black.  There were, there were a few blacks.  I don't know how many there were now.  But prior to my being accepted at the University of Louisville, there was one other and two other blacks who had been accepted, Jay Alexander was the first black to be accepted at the University of Louisville since 1779.  He was the first ever.  And so it was newly integrated, the medical school.  So I was a, I think the third or fourth black to be accepted at the University of Louisville.  I was also accepted at the University of Cincinnati [Cincinnati] and Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  But I decided to stay at Louisville to go to medical school.
Story_ID: 11984
Speaker 1: When you got into medical school, was there--first of all, that must have been your father's [Maurice Rabb, Sr.] proudest day?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it probably was, yeah.
Speaker 1: And did he show, show--?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't, he didn't show it, but I know it was.
Speaker 1: And when you got in, was this, because this was something you, you know, I would say that had been subliminally planned in your, you know, in your head, and then the fact that maybe you couldn't be a airline, airline pilot.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, well, that, that was--the airline thing was way out, a long time ago.  I, I knew, and I knew entering college that this was going to be it, one way or the other, yeah
Speaker 1: And, and so, did--what, what about that whole experience, then, you know, during medical school.
Speaker 2: Well, it was rough.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You're talking about going, the transition from high school to college, college to med school was another transition.  That was rough.  I, I had, I had a difficult time my first year, I mean cause I, my study habits from college weren't like what the study habits from--so med school was gonna something that I realized was gonna really be a problem.  So I had to buckle down.  So--.
Speaker 1: So what sustained you during all that time then?
Speaker 2: Just the goal of, of achieving and, and getting through the first year of med school which is the roughest.  And I did.  And the second year got better. faster finishing that second year.  And then the last--two, the junior and the senior year were much less stress.  It became clinical.  And I felt a lot more comfortable after that.
Speaker 1: Did you find that the things that, you know, the fact that you had gone with your father and observed operations some times--?
Speaker 2: The only thing that helped out is that I wasn't squeamish.  Nothing would make--you know, there are stories about people fainting and getting upset because they see blood or they see dead bodies.  And that never bothered me cause I had already been broken in at age eleven.  So that factor was, helped.
Speaker 1: And did you have any idea at the time that you wanted to do, you know, become a ophthalmologist?
Speaker 2: No idea whatsoever.
Speaker 1: So what were you, what you were looking--what kind of--?
Speaker 2: First of all was to finish medical school.  Graduate from medical school, okay.
Story_ID: 11985
Speaker 1: After graduating from medical school, where am I gonna go to do my internship?  That's the whole thing.  And one thing I knew, it was gonna be out of town.  I was gonna get away from Louisville [Kentucky].  You know how, you know, been there all these years, see.  So I wanted to go somewhere out of town.  So where was my favorite place to go?  New York.  So my first choice was Kings County in Brooklyn [New York]. My second one was in Milwaukee and third was, I don't remember where.  So I got my first choice at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, internship.
Speaker 2: And how--had you been to New York before?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd been to New York, oh, yeah--.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) to travel--?
Speaker 1: Well, I actually, when--there's a story, you know.  Back in 1947, I flew from Louisville to New York City, Eastern Airlines, DC-3, stopped in Pittsburgh.  I always liked to do things a little different.  I said, "I'd like to fly to New York."  I was, I was only about fourteen, fifteen.  And people had never been on an airplane before, but I flew up there; didn't want to take a train.  I just said, I've got to have the experience of flying.  The year after that, when I was fifteen--now this is where this travel thing comes in, see, when I was fifteen, I told my parents I wanted to go to California and during the summer.  So I planned the trip myself from Louisville to Chicago [Illinois] on the train; Chicago to L.A. on the El Capitan, then from there down to San Diego and Tijuana, then back up to L.A., from  L.A. to San Francisco, San Francisco [all California] to Seattle [Washington]; then Seattle to Minneapolis [Minnesota] where I stopped off and stayed overnight with the Urban League person that you might know who all the schools are named after now, Whitney Young.  Actually, Whitney Young was one of my first babysitters cause he lived at Lincoln Institute, right outside of Shelbyville [Kentucky].  But anyway, my parents let me do this all by myself.  And they, they didn't mind me going--you couldn't do that today at fifteen, travel all over the country.  So traveling was one of the things.  So anyway, getting back to this issue of, I went to New York and--as an intern.  Usually, people at that stage of the game knew what they wanted to do in life.  All I knew was I wanted the internship in New York.  I had no idea what I wanted to do as far as medicine.  Did I want to be a primary care doctor, an internist or what, I had not idea.  It was halfway through my internship that I made a decision on what I wanted to do.  And the way I did it was I eliminated all the things I didn't want to do.  I didn't want OB-GYN [obstetrics-gynecology] and I didn't want general surgery.  I didn't want orthopedics, going right on down the line.  I eliminated it down to radiology and ophthalmology.  My father was an anesthesiologist which we didn't get into.  He--which is another interesting part of, of his life and his contributions and how it affected me because he once told me, he says, "I don't want you to go into anesthesia."  Go into some other field, but don't go into anesthesiology cause that was what he was in.
Speaker 2: And why did he say that?
Speaker 1: Well, at the time, anesthesia was sort of not well recognized.  It, it was in its early days, and patients didn't understand this.  The doctors didn't.  It was difficult--when he gave the anesthesia, and he would have to be paid by the patients, patients said, well, I don't remember you, because they didn't because they were sleep (laughs).  And they, they would pay the surgeon, but they said, I don't know why I have to pay this guy who put me to sleep.  And he felt that the, that that specialty was fine, but it had its drawbacks.  And he felt other specialties were much more interesting.
Story_ID: 11986
Speaker 1: My father was a pioneer in Kentucky and in medicine as far as civil rights because it was my father who integrated Louisville General Hospital as being the first black resident there.  He--it was my father who was the first black to ever be in a white hospital in Louisville because he was an activist, and he sued to do this in order to open up the hospitals in, in Louisville, Kentucky.
Speaker 2: And what year was this, that he did this?
Speaker 1: This was in the early '50's [1950s], the early '50's [1950s], and he was the first into the Jewish hospital.  He was first to get into Louisville General Hospital, the first one to do a residency at Louisville.
Speaker 2: And was this around the same time that he became active in the NAACP?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was active in the NAACP before, during and after that, and, yeah.
Speaker 2: I'd, I'd like to ask, and I want to get back to your, to your residency, but--or, right internship--but I want to ask one question about the NAACP and its functioning or what you know of its functioning in the South?  You know, you think--you hear a lot of it functioning in the northern cities, but this is still, you know, in the--you're talking about '40's [1940s] and '50's [1950s]?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, it was very, very active in the, in the South.  I mean in Louisville, Louisville [Kentucky]  had a very active NAACP chapter.  My father [Maurice Rabb Sr.] was not involved in the local chapter, but he was a, in the national committee dealing with life memberships.  He was one of the most active persons in the country in obtaining life memberships for the NAACP.  So the NAACP was active across the country, not just in the North.
Speaker 2: Do you remember him talking about the organization?
Speaker 1: Oh, all the time.
Speaker 2: And what would he say?
Speaker 1: He would say, you remember the life--"Are you a member, life member of the NAACP? " Anybody who'd come to the house, anybody he could ever grab anywhere, and he would ask them.  And they'd, well, I can't afford it.  Then he would break down how they could do it on the installment plan.  And another way he did, he asked them, "Do you smoke?"  And they'd say, yeah.  And he says, "Well, how much do you pay, how do you pay each week, each month for a cigarette?  If you add that you up, you could have a life membership."  So I--he would always be talking about the NAACP.  And he would go to all the national meetings and--.
Speaker 2: Do you remember when he actually integrated the hospital there, what that whole experience was like and whether he had any disappointments over it or he was happy about it?
Speaker 1: Well, and one thing I can say, when he was accepted into the residency program for anesthesia, he would have a separate room at the hospital, and he would have to take his meals in his room because he couldn't eat in the cafeteria with everyone else.
Speaker 2: So even though he had integrated it, and he was there--?
Speaker 1: It was segregated, still segregated within--?
Speaker 2: Who were his clients?  Was he allowed to--?
Speaker 1: Well, he was told at first that, you know, you won't be able to provide services for whites, particularly, white women.  And the irony of it, his first patient that he had was a white woman.  So that broke down right away.  You couldn't say--it would be different, oh, you do this one or you do that one.  So that broke down right away.
Story_ID: 11987
Speaker 1: So you're in New York, and you are, you know, trying to decide between--well, you know, your father's talked about don't do anesthesia.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I, I--.
Speaker 1: So that's not even an option.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I looked at it, and I decided against it on my own too.  And I was looking at a lot of other things, so it was down to either radiology or ophthalmology.  So I saw where there was going to be a graduate program at NYU [New York University, New York, New York] on basic sciences and ophthalmology, and the fact that I was half through my internship, I was late for applying because you should really be applying in the junior or senior of med school.  And so I was at least a year behind applying, so because I said, well, if I get accepted into the NYU basic sciences class, I can use this time to apply to med schools.  And that's what I did.  So after internship, I went to NYU in Manhattan and did nine months of basic sciences and ophthalmology.  And while I was there, I was president of the, of my basic science class.  And I applied to med school, I mean applied to residencies throughout the country.  And one of those that I applied to was the University of Illinois [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: But I, you know, I und--why did you choose--you're still not saying why, why--?
Speaker 2: Why I chose ophthalmology?
Speaker 1: Yeah, why did that fascinate you?
Speaker 2: Well, okay, all right, I looked at radiology, and I looked at ophthalmology. And one thing about ophthalmology I realized is the eye is but a camera when it goes back.
Speaker 1: So that's where it came from, this the darkroom?
Speaker 2: Yeah, subliminally, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And I think that's the answer.  There's something about it, and I said, why not?
Speaker 1: And so, I mean how many in your class--how many blacks are in your class at NYU?  That's what I'm wanting to know.  How many people--?
Speaker 2: Me, I'm the only.
Speaker 1: Cause you're the only one, okay.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: And did you have--you're used to be the only at this point, okay?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm used to the minority no mat--no matter where you are.  Even though there could be others among you, you're still a minority.  I mean like internship, there were a number of black internships, but we still were a minority.
Speaker 1: But who is mentoring you or did you have mentors?  Your father really wasn't?
Speaker 2: No, no, I became my own mentor.
Speaker 1: And were there any experiences in New York before you came here that, I mean was New York hopping then?  Were you--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yes, yeah.  Well, I, I, no, I lived at, I lived in the dorm in Brooklyn [New York] the first year.  The second year I lived in the dorms at NYU next to Bellevue [Hospital, New York, New York].  So I would go to various places in the Village and also to, around Manhattan to hear jazz and all that sort thing.  So New York was great, you know.  I'd just drive all over Manhattan and Brooklyn.  That was a real experience.
Speaker 1: So you had, you had time to do this, med school didn't have--I mean that, and not (simultaneously)--?
Speaker 2: No, but, but, now, internship, it depends on what specially in the wintertime when you have night call.  And, and certain services, you'd have free nights.  So some services are more difficult than others, like neurosurgery, you didn't do anything while you're on neurosurgery, on call every other night.  And you would be totally wiped out.  On other services, you'd have more time.  The second year in it, doing ophthalmology and basic sciences, every night was free, yeah.  So that wasn't a real problem.
Speaker 1: So you--so who, what, what is the, what is this young Maurice Rabb who's this hot shot gonna be, you know, of this doctor?  What, what are you like at that point?
Speaker 2: You mean while I was in New York?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Just a free spirit, you know, just interested in various things.
Speaker 1: Did you go to, you know, you had had your background and, you know, were you hanging out at all at the arts group or anything like that?  Were you--you know, did you go to any plays?
Speaker 2: No, no, I, I did go to the [Greenwich] Village.  I had a friend who was a Bohemian poet who was from Louisville, and I'd often go to the village and, and listen to his poetry and record it.  That was a interesting thing, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you would record it?  Of course, that goes back to your days in--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, I had a tape recorder, oh, yeah, yeah, one of those old tape recorders, a little better than the wire.
Story_ID: 11988
Speaker 1: You come to Illinois [University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, what happened was that because the, the chairman at [the University of] Illinois would select half his class one part of the year and the other half later, I wasn't behind in my application.  And so I applied to Illinois, and I was accepted, even though I was late applying because he didn't chose all of his candidates at one time.  So when I was accepted at [University of] Illinois [Eye and Ear Infirmary], I said, well, "I'm going to Chicago."  So I, I left the post-graduate course [at New York University, New York, New York] when it was over and went back to Louisville [Kentucky] because there were a few months before starting my residency in Chicago [Illinois].  And during those few months in Louisville, I took over the practice of a, of a general practitioner's so he could go on vacation.  So those months of--I think it was June, May and June, I took over his practice, and practiced for those two months before going to Chicago.  So it gave me a, a taste of what private practice would be like as a general practitioner.  And I didn't like that much.
Speaker 1: What didn't you like about it?  It was too unfocused, too--?
Speaker 2: It was too--yeah, it was too general, too unfocused.  I wanted to focus in on, on a particular area.  And I, it was interesting.  It was a good experience.  I was glad it was over cause I was looking forward to starting my residency.
Speaker 1: And residency lasted how long?
Speaker 2: Three years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're here in Chicago.  Where are you living?  Are you living in the dorms--?
Speaker 2: Lake Meadows [apartment community].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, Lake Meadows was newly, was it--?
Speaker 2: It was new.  So was Prairie Shores [apartment community], brand new.
Speaker 1: And this was a very prestigious place to live, you know, it was supposed to--a prestigious place to live, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had a studio apartment, I'll never forget, on the eighteenth floor.
Speaker 1: And so you're, you're the only one in your class?
Speaker 2: Yeah?
Speaker 1: In your residency, only black, I mean.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, but you're used to this?
Speaker 2: Yes, used to this.
Speaker 1: Okay, but how are you finding that environment versus New York in, you know, the--your internship?  Are you finding that there's some differences?
Speaker 2: Well, the only thing--yeah, the difference is it's like I'm in slow motion here.  In, in, being in Chicago from New York, it's like going in slow motion.  And I would tell my colleagues that, I said in New York everything just moves faster.  The, the competitive nature is just different.  So it was like everything kind of slowed down a little bit, as far as people's personality and the way that things would go.  So it wasn't difficult going from New York to Chicago in medicine.
Speaker 1: Did you find that--were there any disappointments when you were a resident here that you experienced or did--was it just, you know, sort of all the way up?  Were there people that, you know, didn't want you in the program or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have any problems like that.  My chairman was supportive, and he was from the old German school--he actually was from Germany.  And he'd been in his country for years, and it was interesting the way he ran things.  There was one person in charge, and everyone else was under that person.  But we got along fine, and as a result, I ended up being chief resident.
Story_ID: 11989
Speaker 1: Another colleague who entered with me was named George Raab, R-A-A-B.  He became a good friend of mine, died a year after his residency; shook me up.  So here I am--but what you didn't find out in the interview, during my years in med school, I was, I was a member of Phi De E (ph.), which is a Jewish medical fraternity because all the members were Jewish because they weren't, they weren't accepted in the other medical fraternities.  So I became a member of this fraternity, and my best friends, throughout med school, were either the Jewish guys from Louisville [Kentucky] and the Jewish guys who got into med school from New York at the University of Louisville.
Story_ID: 11990
Speaker 1: The supporters of the civil rights in Louisville [Kentucky] and elsewhere, in New York, you know that argument about how in the civil rights Jews and blacks were together, and there became that, that division.  So in my college at the University of Louisville [Louisville, Kentucky] and med school, my closest colleagues that I worked with were, were Jewish, with, with a few exceptions.  And to this day, my colleagues that I still am in touch with from med school, primarily Jewish with one exception.
Speaker 2: Let me ask you, with this exposure to, you know, the Jewish race or whatever, whatever, what did you learn that you had, you know, about--what did that exposure--how did that exposure sort of broaden Maurice Rabb?
Speaker 1: Well, it broadened me about another religion and another way of life and also their feeling about goals and achieving.  And there was always that striving to, to get to a certain place in life and excelling as far as education and academics.  And, as you know, there's a large Jewish population in medicine.  And so meeting them, seeing a different view of life, I think was very helpful; a great deal of competition, even among themselves, and being part of that makes you want to also succeed and excel.
Story_ID: 11991
Speaker 1: As a resident in ophthalmology [at University of Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary], did you find that it, it met all of your, you know, expectations?
Speaker 2: [nods yes]
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, it, it's a combination of surgery and medicine.  It's the one special that has both.
Speaker 1: But it's very delicate surgery.
Speaker 2: It's very delicate too.  So it's a great deal of desire to accomplish.  So aft--after I got into it, I said, this is absolutely perfect.  I, I've never been sorry.
Speaker 1: Now, as the chief resident, when he made you chief resident, that was after he found out you were black, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Oh, yes, two years later.  That was, that was two years later, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what--was he mentoring you along that time or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually, he was I feel one of the few mentors that I've had in ophthalmology.
Speaker 1: And what are the things that he sort of taught you or, you know, 'cause mentors--?
Speaker 2: Well, he, he would say if you want something done, you got to do it yourself.  He never relied on anyone else to do something.  He would always--and I know from many times that late at night, we would be photographing the patients, and we would be doing this, rather than having someone else do this.  So he was the one that really inspired me to do the things I did ophthalmology.  I had no idea as, at the time of being a resident that I was going on to academic ophthalmology.
Speaker 1: And what were your thoughts at that point, you know, about what you wanted to do with it?  Was it to set up a practice and--?
Speaker 2: Well, at the time, I really didn't have a goal to say I want to go out into private practice.  During my internship--during my chief residency, I was really just sort of involved in, in the residency, residency itself.  So at the end of that, I stayed on as part of the faculty.  But Dr. Cromfeld wanted me to set up a practice, [even] if it was part time.  So I did.
Story_ID: 11992
Speaker 1: I opened an office at 55 East Washington.  But at the time, I went there to check on renting space, I had no idea that there were no black doctors in the Loop in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: And this is what year?
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-five.
Speaker 2: Okay, so no black doctors in the Loop?
Speaker 1: The only one was Dr. Earl Winfield, who was a very famous orthodontist, who was at the University of Illinois.  He had been in the Loop.  Other than, than Dr. Winfield, who was a dentist--there were no physicians at that time.  I was the first one.
Speaker 2: And did you--so when you went there, do you think the fact that you were, you're, you know, light skinned, that that had something--?
Speaker 1: I have no idea.
Speaker 2: Okay, but it may have not hurt you then?
Speaker 1: Maybe, but at the time I was really naïve about the whole situation.  I didn't realize until after I was in the Loop that I was the only one in the Loop.  And people [would] say, what are you doing down there?  I just, because all the other doctors I knew, colleagues, well, when they opened, they went to the Loop.  So I never thought anything about it.
Speaker 2: So who, your part-time practice was, I mean setting up practice, I think then was a little different than it is today, but I mean who, who was sort of helping guide you and who were your clients?
Speaker 1: Well, and this is the funniest thing, when I opened up, a doctor was retiring, a white ophthalmologist.  So I would see some of his patients.  I'm sure, some I didn't.  So I opened up part time, and I saw a few patients a day, not a lot, but I also was at the University [of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois] the other part of the time.  So I was fifty-fifty, kind of a split sort of thing.  So the point I'm making, I, I've never been in full-time private practice.  I've always been part time at the university and part time in practice.
Story_ID: 11993
Speaker 1: You were chief resident, as soon as that was over, he suggests you set up in private practice, and then you would become part of the faculty?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was part of the faculty too.  So--.
Speaker 1: Okay, was there a lot of discussion about you becoming part of the faculty?  Was--?
Speaker 2: No, you just did--Dr. Cromfeld made all the decisions.  It wasn't up a panel sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Did he ever talk with you about, I mean later, about what he saw in you and why he decided to mentor you?
Speaker 2: No, never any explanation.  And the interesting thing is that after I was in practice for, I think a year, I was newly married, and Madeline was expecting our first son, and Dr. Cromfeld called me one time and says, "I want you to go to San Francisco to study with Dr. Max Fine, corneal transplantation."  And I said, "But I'm at an office and in practice, and I'm newly married,"-- was--not newly married because it was two years; been married about two years, and this was 1967, I think, '66 [1966], '67 [1967].  He suddenly wanted me to go to San Francisco [California] to do this fellowship with Dr. Max Fine.  I said, "Gee, can I do this?"  So [wife] Madeline [Murphy Rabb] said, by all means we can do it.  So we had an apartment here.  I had an office, she was pregnant.  And we took off for San Francisco to practice--I mean to do this fellowship, and leaving a practice.  And that was an interesting time, but it was no question.  When Dr. Cromfeld says, you're gonna do, you, you do it.  So I got my pay because I was doing a fellowship from the University of Illinois, [Chicago, Illinois], but other than that, that was, that was it.  So I spent four months in San Francisco working with Dr. Max Fine in corneal transplantation.  So when I came back I was more involved with corneal surgery and corneal disease.
Story_ID: 11994
Speaker 1: Let's go back to your meeting your wife [Madeline Murphy Rabb].  How did you meet her?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was a blind date.  It was back in nineteen sixty--I don't know, '64 [1964], '65 [1965], something like that.  I don't know the exact date.  And what had happened, her cousin and a friend of hers was also a friend of mine that I knew.  And she was in town visiting her cousin, and they said, "We want you to meet this young person."  She said, "I'm not interested in meeting anyone."  And they said, "Yeah, but you ought to meet him.  You'll--it'll be fun," you'll--so they called me and said, you know, "We've got this young lady that we'd like for you to meet."  Well, you know how I feel about blind dates.  So I said, well, I said, I guess I can.  It was a Saturday.  It was in the summer, June, something like that.  And I says, "Okay, I'll come by and, and meet her, but I, I got somewhere I have to be that night."  So they said okay.  So I went by her cousin's house, Jim Bruce, and I met Madeline.  And it must have been--I got there at 8:00 o'clock, and about midnight, they had to kick me out of the place.  So then I pursued her for the next two years cause she wasn't interested, and finally she agreed to (unclear) marry me.  Now, she says she proposed to me.  I don't know if that's exactly--I think that may have been it.  So anyway, that's how it happened.
Speaker 1: Now, was she visiting Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: She was, yeah, she was visiting, yeah.  She was in Baltimore [Maryland], right.  So I, for the next two years, I was traveling back and forth to Baltimore, trying to convince her, you know, but she wasn't really interested in settling down in the beginning.
Speaker 1: So, okay, that's a--so you're out, when you go, when you guys are--I want to go back to, so when she, when you get married, you're still living in Lake Meadows [apartment complex, Chicago], right, no?
Speaker 2: What?  Yes, we were living in Lake Meadows.
Story_ID: 11995
Speaker 1: You have this practice.  Your practice is primarily, is it a mix between black and white?
Speaker 2: It was a mix between black and white.  As time went on, it became more black.
Speaker 1: Did you have trouble at that time getting black people to come downtown--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Because they were not used to--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, that--absolutely, that's true.
Speaker 1: So what was that whole thing--I mean cause I'm just saying, you know, there was a point where people said they didn't go past 47th Street.
Speaker 2: That's true.  That was, that was a new experience, and then probably if I had not been there and been somewhere else, I may have seen more patients.  But, you know, I never even ever sent out an announcement in my life.  I've never in my life ever sent out an announcement that I was in the practice of ophthalmology.  I just kind of glided into it.
Speaker 1: Now, in terms of--so you go out, and you have this special, you said it was a special--not internship, but a special fellowship in corneal transplants?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And does that, is this a new thing that's happening ophthalmology?
Speaker 2: Well, fellowships were fairly new, but there were other fellowships around the country.
Speaker 1: No, but I'm saying is this, this--the fact that you went and studied with Dr. Fine--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, was that a new thing in ophthalmology or?
Speaker 2: No, it's, it, it wasn't, it wasn't.  It all depends on the type of specialty.  There were real fellowships around in the country.
Speaker 1: No, I didn't mean fellowships.  Was the study, the fact that you--?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, other people had, had, were studying corneal transplants elsewhere, other than this, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't brand new, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, but does this set you up in a specialty here--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that you hadn't had before?
Speaker 2: Right, it, it allowed you to do specialty surgery, particularly in corneal disease, right.
Story_ID: 11996
Speaker 1: Your teaching, what were you teaching at the point?  Were you teaching sort of entry-level, you know--?
Speaker 2: Primarily, residents.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you were teaching ophthalmology?
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: And, any aspect of it that you were known for or just, you know, the--?
Speaker 2: Well, at the time that I was involved in corneal transplantation, I, I still was involved with other aspects of ophthalmology due to my work with Dr. Cromfeld in di--diseases of the optic disc and then later with pleurisy and angiography (ph.).  And he, he also told me at one time that I should get involved in pleurisy and angiography which was a new technique of studying the retinal vasculatures, where there's was the coronal vasculature in the inner eye.  And he told me I should get involved with that, so back in the late '60s [1960s] and the, and the early '70s [1970s], I started pleurisy and angiography at the University of Illinois and then later at Michael Reese which is another interesting story.  Around in 1963 and '64 [1964], I had, there was some exhibits I put on at the American Academy of Ophthalmology and also at the AMA [American Medical Association] where I demonstrated stereoscopic photographs of the optic disk and retina.  And because of that, an ophthalmologist at Michael Reese, Dr. Stillaman saw that and asked me if I would apply for the staff at Michael Reese Hospital for ophthalmology.  And at that time, there was no black on staff, particularly, in ophthalmology there.  And so I applied, and at that time, I had my boards in ophthalmology.  I was board certified, and I was either assistant professor of ophthalmology at the University of Illinois [Chicago, Illinois].  And it took me two years to get on staff, and I was either the first or the second black to be on the staff at Michael Reese Hospital.  You have to realize that back in the '60s there weren't hardly any black physicians on the staffs of white hospitals.  And the same time I applied to Mercy Hospital, and I was accepted there in either '66 [1966], something like that, 1966, and at that time, I was only the third black to be on with Mercy because most of the doctors were at Provident [Hospital, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: So what were your black, your fellow black doctors thinking about this or applauding you or, I mean, you know, because this is, you know, you represented sort of a, a new wave right there.  So did you find them supportive or were they--?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think supportive because soon after that, other blacks started applying to these hospitals, and were admitted.  But believe me, in the first few years of the '60's [1960s], I didn't, I didn't realize at this time, there just weren't any black doctors at any of the hospitals I, I applied to.  The same thing about Illinois Central Railroad Hospital, which is on the South side.  There was only one black doctor on staff there when I applied.  So it was a new area.
Story_ID: 11997
Speaker 1: Did you ever have any doubts about having chosen, you know, ophthalmology?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: You found, you found the area fascinating and continuing to be fascinating?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And this whole, with your, with your practice, can you describe how it has changed--well, one, I want to go on the academic side.  How has that changed or grown over the years cause we're talking about almost a forty-year, you know period?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, that's, that's true.  I guess.  How has it changed?  Well, it's changed in size and it's changed in intensity and changed in the degree of variety.  It's much larger and much more involved in technology.  It's a great much--a great deal of, more competition now than then, in the earlier days.
Speaker 1: What are you most proud academically, what would you say, have been different milestones along the way?
Speaker 2: Well, one is the, receiving an honorary degree from my alma mater.  That's not common, from the University of Louisville [Louisville, Kentucky], the very school that I couldn't go to back in the '50's [1950s] because of segregation, then later getting a honorary merit from the [University of Louisville] College of Medicine several years after that.  So I guess being the recognition of my alma mater, it would be, I guess the other would be having the opportunity of being first in a lot of things.  And the reason why I was the first is because no one was ever allowed to do these things prior to my being there.  I guess the first black chief resident at the University of Illinois [Chicago, Illinois] and reaching the rank of professor; I guess publications and presentations around the country.  And I guess the most recent is the National Medical Association Section of Ophthalmology choosing the, a form of scholarship payment to residents in the name of Rabb Veneable Award.  Rabb being myself and Veneable (ph.) being Dr. Veneable, formerly of St. Louis [Missouri] who was a great educator in his time in ophthalmology who's passed on.
Story_ID: 11998
Speaker 1: In your practice, were there people that you, besides Dr. Cromfeld, are there other people that you admired or you considered--I don't want to say heroes, but people you patterned yourself--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there, there were, there were a number of black ophthalmologist, Dr. Axel Hanson from Nashville, who I knew.  I was not in his program.  He was chairman at Meharry.  Of course, Dr. Veneable, who was a real milestone in training black residents at Homer Phillips in St. Louis, and Dr. Clay Collins, Sr., who was in charge of the Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] program.  All these men were there when I was a young ophthalmologist coming up.  And as far as the others, there are ophthalmologists such as Dr. Cromfeld and Dr. McDonald who was one of my early chairmen.
Story_ID: 11999
Speaker 1: Did you find, on, in the area of ophthalmology, is an eye just an eye no matter what the race is or, you know--?
Speaker 2: Well, certainly.  A patient is a patient, no matter what race.  But the--?
Speaker 1: I'm just talking about diseases--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there are certain diseases that affect certain people more than others, like macular degeneration affects Caucasians.  Diabetes affects Hispanics and, and blacks more than Caucasians.  There are certain diseases that affect all different groups at a different prevalence, but we're all human.
Speaker 1: And did you find, did your practice focus on more elderly people or, or, you know, is that--or were you, 'cause there are difference between-- (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, there, there's pediatric ophthalmology, obviously, which, which deals with children.  And I was never actively involved in pediatric ophthalmology, but all diseases affect all age groups.  At present, I would say the diseases I'm involved with affect the elderly more than, than the young people.
Story_ID: 12000
Speaker 1: And what are some of the exciting developments that are occurring that maybe you didn't think you would see in your lifetime in the area ophthalmology?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, one think is the new technology where one day people who are blind might be able to see.  That's being worked on across the, the world now, by putting in implants, chips in the back of the eye that one day may electronically allow people to see who are now blind.  That's still in its experimental stage.  Ways of doing surgery for diseases of the eye that I've never even thought about--matter of fact, all the training that I received as a resident is now obsolete as far as surgery is concerned.  All the surgical techniques that are being done today are not the techniques that we learned when I was a resident.  So all these things I have to learn when I'm teaching residents, that weren't around when I was a resident.
Speaker 1: So do you han--how have you been able--so being really in academia has kind of--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, being academic, yes, being on the forefront.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's helped a great deal?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And the, and the publication by, in the earlier days, doing a lot of publication also helped to the fact that I'm still involved in, in academic ophthalmology.
Story_ID: 12001
Speaker 1: Did you find on the practice side, what was the nature--, has your practice changed or grown or--I mean I know it was always a part-time practice.  I know you never had to really advertise.
Speaker 2: Well, it changed from going from, in earlier days from glaucoma to corneal disease to retinal disease, and now, I'm, I'm specializing with di--diseases of the retina.
Speaker 1: And what's what, what's it about that specialty that sort of put--who gets diseases of the retina--(simultaneously)--?
Speaker 2: Everybody gets diseases of the retina.
Speaker 1: You know what Dr. Rabb, I need to see you.  I should come and see you.  I have to get my eyes tested.  I haven't been--had them tested in a long time, so (laughs).  But I think, anyway, okay.  What are your thoughts about this Lasik, this--that surgery?  Do you have any thoughts about it one way or the other?
Speaker 2: It's, it's elective surgery.  It's for, it's only for those people who can't or don't want to wear contact lenses, don't want to wear glasses, but you basically, you're performing surgery on normal eyes.  So it's an elective procedure, like a cosmetic procedure.
Story_ID: 12002
Speaker 1: When you look back over your life, are there things that you would have done, you know, differently, or, you know, in terms of your career?  I mean do you think you would have done anything differently?
Speaker 2: No, I can't, really not drastically, nothing really differently.
Speaker 1: For young people who want to pursue, and I'm talking about African Americans, would--who would want to pursue a career in medicine, things have changed--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --when you talk about--I mean we look at how medicine was, you know, at the time your father [Maurice Rabb Sr.] was practicing, and then how when you came along, you were sort of, really sort of a hot shot and that was different.  You know, you were sort of leading the path for people who preceded you.  And, now, you know, you had talked about it being more competitive--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, just over all, but what advice would you have for, for people coming along and wanting to pursue medicine?
Speaker 2: Well, I would them to get a good academic background and to do the very best they can because it's competitive to enter medical school.  And once you get into medical school, it's competitive.  So having a good basic educational background and good study habits are important.
Speaker 1: And would there be any--would you advice people not to do it because it's more of a business now.  Would you--?
Speaker 2: Well, the point--that's true.  It's more of a business now than it was twenty, thirty years ago, but even so, a lot of things today are more driven economically.  So you still have to have a desire for a particular profession.  And so if you still have that profession, that goal in mind, you still have to have an idea of setting goals to have a good background, education-wise in order to compete.  It's like when, when you think about college, you know, back in our days, no one thought about getting into college like you do today.  I mean it's so much more difficult, so therefore, it's even more important that students achieve in order to be competitive.  I, I wish it weren't that way, but that's the way it is.
Speaker 1: And do you, are there any other advice you would give young African Americans looking to pursue, let's a, you know, a career in ophthalmology, is there anything else that you would advise?
Speaker 2: You mean other than ophthalmology?
Speaker 1: No, no, a career in ophthalmology.
Speaker 2: Well, first they have to get into medical school.
Speaker 1: Right, I know, I know, but--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, once one is accepted in medical school, one has to--while they're in medical school, unfortunately, while they're in their second and third year prepare themselves to be competitive.  That means that they have to have good grades, good skills, and they have to be involved in ophthalmology in some way whether in research with someone or getting experience in ophthalmology.  Just simply finishing medical school is not enough to get a residency in ophthalmology these days.  If one waits as long as I waited in my time, they have an opportunity.  And it's such a competitive specialty that only so many are accepted, unfortunately.  So I say, they have to know, number one, first, in the early days, if they want this, then they have to get mentoring from someone to know exactly what they have to do so they are competitive because it's on a matching program.  That's how it's done.  All of the names go in the computer, and accordingly, everyone lists the names of the people that rank from one down, that's how it's done, unfortunately.
Story_ID: 12003
Speaker 1: That night that I came when you were being honored, what struck me was the fact that they said that the University of Illinois [School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois]has more graduates, you know--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --outside of Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], I think, Howard--(unclear)--.
Speaker 2: Howard and Meharry [College of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee].  They graduate more black medical students than any other--.
Speaker 1: Why do you think that has been the case?  I mean is it a--?
Speaker 2: Well, because of the creation of the Urban Health Program at the university, there was a goal to recruit students for the School of Medicine.  And as a result, the program has worked well there.  A large number of African Americans and other minorities have been accepted into med school.  The problem is that after that, many of these same students have not been selected into the specialties.  Many of them go into the primary care specialties, but it's been difficult getting a large number of minorities into certain specialty residency programs.
Speaker 1: And so what do you think would make the difference there, training?
Speaker 2: Training, mentoring, mentoring those who are interested in certain specialties to tell them how they can get an advantage in order to be matched into a specialty.  So getting into med school is one hurdle, but getting to certain specialties is another hurdle.
Story_ID: 12004
Speaker 1: --You've been involved with the World Health Organization, could you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Well, fortunately in my early days of, of ophthalmology, I was academically involved, and I've been, over time, of being author or co-author of five books and numerous publications.  And I've had the opportunity to be involved in various institutions such as being on committees at the National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration, CDC [Center for Diease Control], and World Health Organization.  This has been a really great opportunity to be involved, and many of us don't get that opportunity.  And also academically, being able to be involved, I think has been great to my development.
Story_ID: 12005
Speaker 1: What has motivated you throughout your life?  Has it been money?  Has it been fame?  Has it been--?
Speaker 2: Actually, it's never been a financial thing.  I've never really striven to do that.  Anything that I've gained financially has been because of what's just happened.  It's never been a goal.
Speaker 1: Why was that?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: And the cheap--you know, then they have the cheaper ones too, the half the price.
Speaker 2: Yes, I know.
Speaker 1: I was like, well, maybe I should go to them.  But then I'm thinking--but, you know, it seems like it should be relatively simple, and then someone told me that if they scraped, it used to be, that was better than the laser.
Speaker 2: No, it's not better than the laser.
Speaker 1: You should mention these laser surgeries?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that's, that's not-- the other stuff's more important.
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's--you were talking about money did not motivate you, and I was wondering, and you were--hadn't finished, when you said that?
Speaker 2: Well, I really never had a goal of financial success with the ophthalmology.  I guess it was more academic involved mentally.  Not that I didn't want to, you know, make a living, but it was never a goal to make a lot of money.  I don't know why.  It just never was.
Speaker 1: You've always had a very comfortable and (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, always been comfortable, but I--the goal was never to achieve a vast amount of money every year.  It wasn't that way.  Otherwise, I would not have done things the way I did.  I never would have remained fifty percent at the university or--more than fifty percent.  I would have sent out announcements and, and advertised or that sort of thing.  I never, never did any of that.
Story_ID: 12006
Speaker 1: Well, is there anything else about your practice?  You were talking about the sickle cell anemia.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, back in 1972, the NIH [National Institutes of Health] sent out an announcement that they were going to fund universities to have grants to deal with the diagnosis and treatment of sickle cell disease.  And at that time, we knew that sickle cell disease, besides affecting the body also affected the eye.  And so there was a meeting at the University of Illinois [Chicago, Illinois], the faculty, to see who was interested in applying for one of these grants that would fund a sickle center.  So I attended that meeting.  And I remember there, along with other faculty members, when the dean said, well, who is interested in writing a proposal and grant, and writing it to send to the National Institutes of Health, to be funded.  And nobody's hand raised.  And I raised my hand and said, I'll do it if there's someone else sitting here who will be a co-writer.  And so Dr. George Honig, who at the time I didn't know, raised his hand.  He was at the time in the department of pediatrics.  So the two of us together wrote a grant for, to be a competing center for sickle cell disease.  And I was an ophthalmologist, he was a pediatrician.  So we wrote the grant, and fortunately, we were funded.  And part of that grant was, was to study diseases of the eye as far as sickle [cell disease] was concerned.  And that part of the grant was, the author was Dr. Morton Goldberg.  And so we were funded like $1.6 million.  Following that, Dr. Honig left [the] University [of Illinois] to go to Children's Memorial, and I became the director of the center.  And we had another competition where we applied again for refunding of the center, and we were funded again, and, and for the third time.  So I was director of the comprehensive sickle cell center at the University of Illinois.  We dealt with not only pediatrics and ophthalmology, but internal medicine, and, and hematology.  And over those period of years, I brought in $16 million.  And the same time, I was involved in the sickle eye disease project.  So that was a great experience, and it was good for the community.  And it was good for the university.
Speaker 1: So that, that really probably put you on the map.  Is that why you became chief of--what were--you were chief--?
Speaker 2: Well, no, that--I--well, way back I was section chairman of ophthalmology, and later we became a division, and recently, in the last two years, became department of ophthalmology at Mercy [Hospital, Chicago, Illinois], and I'm the chairman of the department of ophthalmology at Mercy.  Besides that I'm also a medical director for the last ten years of Prevent Blindness America, which is one of the largest non-profit organizations in the country dealing with prevent blindness.
Story_ID: 12007
Speaker 1: You've had a, you know, a long career, and I would a prestigious career almost from the beginning.  What would you--what do you want to see from this point on, you know, what haven't you done that you would like to do, and what books haven't you written?  What--?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know if I want to write any more books at this time--probably some more publications on interesting and unusual diseases of the eye. I'd like to hone down on the unusual.
Speaker 1: Can you give some examples of that to us laymen of what that is?
Speaker 2: Well, diseases that are out there in the world, that we may have seen or may not have seen and have not previously been written, to go to the outreaches where no man has gone before.
Story_ID: 12008
Speaker 1: Family has been important to you in many ways, and I would like you just to sort of touch upon that because you've had a very productive, you know, family life.  And I would to say, why--how do you attribute your success to that?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to say my parents, number one.  My father [Maurice Rabb Sr.], who has been gone now for a number of years, was still an inspiration.  You know, after all he, he had one goal in mind, and he succeeded.  I became a physician.  And then my mother [Jewel Miller Rabb], who is still with us, who has always been there for me during this entire period of time has been a great deal of support, and still is.  And then, of course, my wife and my family who've supported me through all these years.  And Madeline [Murphy Rabb], without her, a lot of this wouldn't have been possible.
Speaker 1: And why do you think family is important?
Speaker 2: Because it gives you a basis of support, and you're not out there by yourself.
Speaker 1: There's a lot of talk right now, like, you know, family taking on different forms and all of that, and not--the nuclear family not really being as important.
Speaker 2: --I'm old fashioned.  I'm very old fashioned along those lines.
Speaker 1: How?
Speaker 2: How?  Well, I just think family structure is important.  Family has to stay together to succeed.  I guess I'm a man of few words along those lines.  Action speaks louder than words.

Speaker 1: Success is defined individually, but what would you say, how do you define success?
Speaker 2: Doing what you want to do when you want to do it, and feeling accomplished about what you've done and having the feeling that you can continue to accomplish whatever you put your sights on and being happy during that period of time cause if you're not happy, in a sense, you're not successful.

Speaker 1: A lot of times people talk about the good old days.  And some people talk about, also the importance during these interviews of the Civil Rights Movement.  And I'm wondering if you, one, you're a believer of the good ol' days, and you have concerns about the way you see the black community heading, and I'm wondering if you have those concerns what they are, and then I'll ask the second question.
Speaker 2: Well, the good ol' days weren't so good in certain aspects because there was segregation.  And even though many people accomplished a great deal of things during the times of segregation, we don't know how much more would have been accomplished if there were not those days of segregation.  And so the good ol' days may be the days that pres--that followed by work by many people in breaking down those barriers like my father [Maurice Rabb Sr.] and others who allowed us to do things now that we could have never done before.  I mean I could have never made the accomplishments that I did if things were the same in the '60's [1960s] and '70's [1970s] as they were in the '30's [1930s] and '40's [1940s] and the '50's [1950s].  So I owe it to a lot of those civil rights people who did those things and made it possible for me to do what I've done.  There're still many obstacles out there.  I mean, listen--there are still certain degrees of, of segregation in various ways, and we got a long way to go.  But it's certainly not as bad as it was it was when my father came along.  And I hope that it is not as bad now as it was when I came along because now, a person can't say that they're the first doing this as much as we could say we were the first doing that back in those days because anybody that did anything in those days was the first.
Speaker 1: Now, you, are you an integrationist like your father?
Speaker 2: Well, whether that still comes across because I came up during the time of "six, four, eight, we've got to integrate." And I understand the reason why people today are not necessarily integrationist because it's not necessarily the goal to integrate now, but to break down barriers so that people can do what they want to do.  See, back in those days, we--the idea was to integrate because we were against segregation.  There was a rebound; so, 'they're gonna segregate us--well, we're gonna integrate'.  So I think we've already allowed things to integrate to a certain degree.  And what we need to do is to build up the academic, eco-economic situation where people can have a better financial balance, because even today, there's certain degrees of the population that's still financially bankrupt.  That's, that's a real problem, a problem that we didn't perceive necessarily back in the days of civil rights when were prevented from going places and doing things.  Now, we may not be prevented from doing that, but we don't have the financial means because certain segment of the population is denied certain access to jobs and economic advantages.  So it's bigger than just integration.
Speaker 1: So, what do you think are important for the next generation to take up?
Speaker 2: Well, you mean as far as--?
Speaker 1: 'Cause of, you know, what is the next generation--?
Speaker 2: It's--.
Speaker 1: Your, your--your, your children, what's important (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: One is to be competitive education wise, have the knowledge to know where you've got to go to be competitive in the next decade.  That, it's not an easy question, but it's obvious now, with, with the way things are going that unless you can compete or have the opportunity to be in those areas where you can, you're gonna be at a disadvantage, particularly, the minorities.
Speaker 1: Do you ever want to see a color-blind society?  Do you think it's possible?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think it's ever possible to be color-blind.  I think that we shouldn't let the color blind us.

Speaker 1: And what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Oh, good question.  That I came along during interesting times, and I hope I took advantage of the opportunities that were presented to me.  And that I hope that what I've done may be a legacy for somebody to do it even better in the future.
