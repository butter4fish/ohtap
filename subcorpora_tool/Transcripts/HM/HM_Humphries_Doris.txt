Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight, People magazine-ish type questions that I am compelled to ask you.  And they only require a short answer.  The first question is what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food, I don't seem to have a favorite food, I love food.  I guess I can pick a nice steak.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I don't have favorite colors, I just love colors.  I don't seem to have a favorite anything.  I pick colors as I feel I need a color or where it's going to sort of say something for me.  So I don't really have a particular color in mind.
Speaker 1: These are five favorite questions so here we go.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I like the summer.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: A favorite vacation I like is New York.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I don't believe so; let me think if there is something I might be saying all of the time, no.
Story_ID: 216608
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your family history and I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Bertis Blanks] side and I'm going to start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Bertha Corrine Robinson, R-O-B-I-N-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: November 22. What's my mom's year? 19-0-- 1902 I believe.
Speaker 1: Where was she born?
Speaker 2: In Louisiana, in Lecompte, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Can you spell Lecompte?
Speaker 2: L-A-C-O-M-P-T-E [sic.]
Speaker 1: C-O-M-P-T-E?
Speaker 2: Yes P-T-E.
Speaker 1: What do you know about her side of the family, how far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Actually I can't go much further than my grandfather [James Robinson (ph.)] and my grandmother.  I lived with them for a while and they're the ones I was very close to.  I never got a chance to meet any of the others because they were from New Orleans [Louisiana] and we never went back--to travel there.  So most of my memory is just with my grandfather and my grandmother who we lived with here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: So did your mother grow up in Louisiana?
Speaker 2: My mother grew up in Louisiana and from there they came to Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay so your grandparents never told any stories about--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: About things that happened?
Speaker 1: Yeah way back when?
Speaker 2: No not my grandparents and my aunts, I had seven aunts and two uncles from that family--on my mother's side and they would talk a lot about things but not things that really happened there.  Most of their conversation was about what was happening here.  They probably came here when they were younger and so a lot of their talk as I was growing up was from here.
Speaker 1: Well tell us about your grandparents and then your mother.
Speaker 2: My grandmother was from New Orleans as I told you.  She was a sweet little woman that was always working with her husband and very much working with all of her children.  My grandfather when he came here became a janitor and he was a janitor for quite a few buildings.  One in particular which was on the West Side of Chicago on, I think it was Maypole [Avenue] and Wood [Street]; it was a great big building there.  All the people in--all the tenants were just crazy about my grandmother and my grandfather.  My grandmother used to make these hot rolls that would seep through the building; pretty soon everybody was coming down and get some of mama's rolls.  My aunts and-- my aunts and uncles we all grew up there too and finally my mom got her own apartment and we moved from there.
Story_ID: 216609
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother [Bertha Robinson Blanks] and her parents came to Chicago [Illinois] and did they have a story about why they chose Chicago?
Speaker 2: I can't really remember why they, why they left there but it seems that my grandfather [James Robinson (ph.)], I don't know for certain but it seems that my grandfather was doing pretty well in Louisiana and wasn't very liked about that so he had some problems so then he left there.
Speaker 1: Did your mother talk about Louisiana and growing up there at all?
Speaker 2: No she didn't.
Speaker 1: Do you know if she had a chance to go to school there and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah she did go to school there.  She never really talked much about it.  You know like some would sit and talk about the things that happened and I myself never even questioned or asked a lot of things so probably why I don't know so much, I didn't ask.  But she went to school there and then came there.  She was the oldest of all the girls and she was like the mother to everyone.
Speaker 1: So she had a lot of brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: She had six--there seven of them and two boys and she as I said was the oldest.  Here--they were just the only ones here and I think finally there were some other relatives that came from Louisiana here.
Speaker 1: What was your mother like and what did she do?
Speaker 2: My mother was strictly a mother.  She actually work, she stayed home and took care of her children and then after a while she did work and my mom starting taking studies in nursing and she would go to the nursing homes and work with them.  She did get a little certificate from nursing and then she would work with the people in the nursing homes and finally she was called to be-- to take care of a private family.
Story_ID: 216610
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how they [Humphries parents, Bertha Robinson Blanks and Bertis Blanks] met that you know of? Do you know how they met?
Speaker 2: No, he never-- my mother never would say and I never even asked them but my dad was from Mississippi, Meridian, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Now what was his name, can I get his full name and date of birth?
Speaker 2: His name was Bertis Blanks.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: B-E-R-T-I-S B-L-A-N-K-S
Speaker 1: Okay and do you know his date of birth?
Speaker 2: My dad-- he was, dad was January 8th, I believe.  No honey, I'm sorry I'm getting the dates mixed up 'cause January 8th was when he died.  Mom was November 22nd; my dad I think was in October.
Speaker 1: Do you know the year?
Speaker 2: Yeah my dad was 1900.
Speaker 1: All right. So he was born in Mississippi, do you know town?
Speaker 2: In Meridian right, you said that.
Speaker 1: Meridian, Mississippi that town has been made famous by Alice Walker now.  She's got a book called 'Meridian' [Alice Walker] or is that, I'm sorry not Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, one of them I'm confused now, it's one of the two of them. A book called 'Meridian.'  It is Alice Walker, yeah, yeah 'Meridian' right.  So, do you know much about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: Not too much about his family.  I know that my dad when he left there and came to Chicago [Illinois]--not even too much about what school he went to but I do know that after a while when he started working, he was working with the--as a chauffeur and-- at a garage and during the time of--what was this gangster, the gangs he was chauffeuring a lot of those people.
Speaker 1: Oh Al Capone era?
Speaker 2: Yes and my dad--now he would tell us stories about that.  He would just say how they were and how he would have to drive them here and there.  We would hear stuff like that but--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Can you remember any good stories?
Speaker 2: No I really can't, I wish I could. That I would really tell you to remember clearly. I just remember some of the things that he would talk about.  He had an old Lincoln that they gave him and he would come and drive it home and show us this Lincoln that he had.  They weren't talkative people just like I'm not too much of a talkative person but they didn't talk a lot.
Speaker 1: So your father never-did you ever meet your father's parents?
Speaker 2: I only met my grandmother, my grandfather had died by the time I was able to meet my grandmother and my dad did take me to Meridian where my grandma lived and that's where I met her and the other family.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you went down there?
Speaker 2: I must have been-- I must have been about six; no I'm sorry I must have been about eight years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was about eight years old.
Speaker 1: He didn't go back a lot?
Speaker 2: No he didn't.
Speaker 1: Did he talk about why he left Mississippi?  I know it probably seems strange that I ask why but since this is a historical document--
Speaker 2: He was just wanting to get out, to move on that's the only thing that I know about my dad, he just wanted to move out.
Speaker 1: I suppose a lot of people did.  Everybody interviews people that leave, they don't really go back either but there is usually a specific story everybody has about why they left.
Speaker 2: And he probably had to and never said.  I know when I went there to Mississippi, I was shocked at some of the things that happened because I would hear about segregation but I never experienced it and to me to see a water fountain, a black sign and a white sign that, that was--I just couldn't believe it, it blew me away.  But he never, never said a whole lot about it.
Speaker 1: Okay so did you spend a lot of time there when, when you went down?
Speaker 2: Yeah we stayed there oh I guess about two weeks visiting with my families.
Story_ID: 216611
Speaker 1: What kind of personality did your father [Bertis Blanks] have?  Can you describe his personality for us?
Speaker 2: He was very quiet person.  He was a loving person and when you would meet him and you could get him to talking he was a very--you found yourself really liking this guy.  He was very quiet, but he-- and he was a working man, he worked and took care of his family.  He was a jolly person as well.  He used to laugh a lot and tell little jokes.  He loved fishing.  I know my aunts on my mom's [Bertha Robinson Blanks] side, she used to always go fishing with him and my dad would be telling these jokes and she would laugh.  I never heard the jokes but because of the way she laughed at them I would laugh.  She was-- she just enjoyed all of the stuff that he was telling her but I never heard any of them.
Story_ID: 216612
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory in childhood, what's the first thing that you re-- that you can remember that you remember?
Speaker 2: That was, let's see I guess when I started going to school well even more than that, way back but I don't know if--when I was little how my mom [Bertha Robinson Blanks] used to take care of me and how we--my mom, my mom was such a wonderful mother and you had to listen to what she had to say.  Many times when she would dress us up, here in Chicago [Illinois] when you used to go downtown, you use to dress.  Nobody would go downtown looking like a bum, you always had to dress up and you'd put on your best manners and if I did one little thing wrong my mom didn't like, all she had to do is look, right away I'd stop.  Then I remember like the schools I would go to my mom would take me into school, she was very, very protective of her children.  One of the things too I remember when I was-when mom would take me to the show, we'd get a chance to see these big stage shows that was so fascinating.  I just got carried away; I just loved the stage shows.  I loved it more when you would go to the movies and you'd see the movie and then a sheer curtain would come across the screen letting you know the stage is going to start.  That was my biggest moment to see that stage starting.  Those are the sort of things I kind of remember--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 216613
Speaker 1: Can you describe where you lived and you may have lived in different places too, and, and, yeah you know?  Well go ahead-- (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We did. We certainly did.  Mom [Bertha Robinson Blanks] and dad [Bertis Blanks] sort of struggled.  They worked hard together and struggled so we were constantly moving.  That's another thing I remember, to me it was like a new neighborhood I had to get used to or in a new school which I hated to go to a new school.  But we were constantly moving trying to find a place or getting settled or she would have--I forget this help that they use to have for families like they have, what was the name of this--mom would have to use these stamps and stuff and then of course eventually mom and dad got out of that and they were so grateful.  We moved like from the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] to the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] maybe back to the West Side and then back to the South Side.  So I knew the West Side and the South Side.
Speaker 1: Now you were growing up during the Great Depression and a lot of people were--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: In that WPA [Works Progress Administration] time, yes that's right.  They had these stamps, I remember mom used to send me to the A&P [The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company] store at that time and she'd always had this little blue purse and this little blue book that she'd give me that I had to take to the store when I go to get the groceries and give them this little book and they would put these stamps and stuff on it.  Yeah we went through sometimes there.
Speaker 1: What parts of town did you live in mostly on the West Side or--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Most of it was well from my very younger life it was the West Side 'cause I was born on the West Side and then we moved to the South Side.  When I went back to the West Side, we didn't stay there long maybe it was like during the summer when I didn't have to go to school or something.  My very early age I went to Brown School [William H. Brown Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] on the West Side.
Speaker 1: That's by the Chicago Stadium [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: That's right, right across from Chicago Stadium.  I went there and when we moved from there we went to the South Side and we stayed pretty much on the South Side then and then I went to quite a few schools.  I went to [Austin O.] Sexton [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], I went to Brown School, and I finally graduated from Corpus Christi [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] a Catholic school.
Speaker 1: Now did your--was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: From what I remember, my mom used to and my dad--my daddy was not going to church that I remember.  My mom used to always talk but we never really had a church that we went to but I as a little girl when we went into all these different neighborhoods, I would find a church and I would just go into the church, it didn't matter what kind of church, it's just a church and I just knew I had to go to church.  So I went to these various churches and I went to--when I went to the Catholic church, I just fell in love with the Catholic church then bring in-- then I brought my family into the Catholic church.
Story_ID: 216614
Speaker 1: So you came out of Corpus Christi [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] grade school?  (unclear) Back up and just ask you, we always ask this question, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well if-- now to speak about sights when we lived in the apartment building it's like the old sounds was all the children used to look for was the man coming down the alley, the ice man and we would all run behind this truck getting pieces of ice.  He had the big chunk of ice that he would sell and so I think he had one piece that he just knew the kids would come and so he would chip it off and it would laying there for us.  When you think about it that's something running behind this bus and eating the ice right off the truck but I remember that.  And then the other one was the man coming down the alley singing, "Old rag, old rags for sell," and people would bring out whatever garments or something they didn't want.  A lot of the sound was the merchants going up and down the alley selling this and selling that and then the other was kids which you don't see much of that now, out in the front playing marbles, playing jacks, playing hop scotch, dancing, playing rope and doing tricks with their ropes.  When my grandfather [James Robinson (ph.)] had this building, we used to have this great big yard and he would allow us to play house and we would bring our toys out and play house and then we would also play like we had a club and we would have music and radio.  These are the kinds of things that kids in the community would get together and play; you don't see a lot of that anymore.
Speaker 1: These are organized--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah they have organized but we would create and do these things ourselves that was the fun part of it.  When I think back, it was really fun to create these things ourselves.
Speaker 1: Yeah you don't see that that much anymore where kids would get together and put on a show or something like that.
Speaker 2: Yeah we would put on our show, make our own costumes out of crepe paper that was the big thing, is crepe paper 'cause you could stretch it and move it around like cloth.  It was cheap and we were able to put on little shows.
Story_ID: 216615
Speaker 1: What kind of a little girl were you, what did you like to do?  I know you liked the stage shows you said like the Regal [Theater, Chicago, Illinois] and the other venues but what did you like to do, what kind of personality did you have?
Speaker 2: I was quiet, a lot of times even in school I was very quiet.  I would only speak when the teachers called me or someone said something to me even when I went on to play for the recess, I would sort of sit off to the side, I don't know why I was like that, kind of shy but then I grew out of it and the next thing you know I was hitting show business which shocked a lot of people.  How in the world did you get into show business and you were always so quiet?  But I don't know, I guess I had it in me, I just wouldn't let it out.
Speaker 1: Did you like school?  I know you moved around a lot.
Speaker 2: Yeah I'll tell you I did like school, once I got into the school, I liked it.  The only thing I hate about moving around was I had to meet new people and when you walked into the room all heads would turn to this new person.  You do not know--maybe that was one of the reasons I was so quiet.  You're not knowing the people--the kids enough to be able to raise your hand and talk and when the teacher talked to you and you had not been in that class for a while and the teacher calls upon you, you were always afraid that you're were going to say the wrong thing.   Many times I had the answers to things and would not raise my hand because I was always afraid well maybe I won't be right, maybe it's not right.  But I was an obedient child and my mom [Bertha Robinson Blanks] taught me to always take care of myself, take care of my room, everything had to be nice and neat, be respectful of everyone and I always listened to her on things like that.  When we did go to the shows, I really did like the show business.  I was just thrilled to it.  My mom used to laugh because I used to have a lot of problems with shoes.  I'd like a shoe and I'd say it was okay but that shoe would be hurting.  So because of that, I had trouble with my feet and sometimes I would be walking somewhere and my feet would hurt and my mother said, "She's okay just let her dance over there, she will be all right 'cause she loves to dance.  Once she's start dancing, she doesn't feel the feet anymore (laughter)."  But-- I used to do things like that and when we would put on our little shows, we'd have those soft tennis shoes and we'd take the pop bottle caps, stick it on the shoe so you could hear the taps (laughter).
Story_ID: 216616
Speaker 1: We talking about the difference between the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] and the West Side [Chicago, Illinois].  Okay now what were you saying? (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. I think on the South Side the kids were able to do a little more because the South Side--I mean the West Side I think was more whites over there and maybe they didn't have as--I don't remember having as much freedom there except for one little park which was, Union Park [Chicago, Illinois] that we went to.  But over on the South Side we had--on the South Side was the South Side, our South Side was a beautiful South Side in my days.  We had everything, we had their clubs, we had our theaters, and we had our shopping areas.  The parks--we could go out into the parks and just stay there all night if we wanted to, no problems everything was beautiful.  We would go shopping; we could leave our windows open, leave the door you know.  These were the wonderful days or the good old South Side they're all gone now and I'm sorry.  But there was quite a difference there.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about--what you said has been said by a lot of people that you could go to sleep in Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois] with your wallet or your money on you and wake up and you'd still have it.
Speaker 2: And still have it, no one bothered you because it used to get real well you know what it's like in the summer how hot it could get and you didn't have fans and all that sort of stuff.  So the families would take their little pallets or blankets and go out to the park and we'd stay out in the park all night.  Lay there, play there, you know no one bothered you and it was just a beautiful thing and then we would go home.  Many times we would go shopping and we'd put the windows up because like I said there were no fans or anything so you'd have your windows up so the air could blow in and you could leave your windows open and come back and you still had a home.  As the old saying was, your home is your castle and it was.  You never expected anyone to break into your home and no one ever did.  Even when you were children the other thing was respect.  When you were a youngster and you did something wrong no matter where you were if an adult called you down, you would listen.  And an adult would say something but now you can do anything and nobody is going to say anything to you because I guess of the retaliation.  Those were just the most beautiful times.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about the living conditions?  In the [Great] Depression when I came to Chicago [Illinois] in the '70s [1970s] I didn't really realize that a lot of the big greystones, the big brownstones on [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] Drive or Michigan [Avenue] had like multiple families living in them.  Was it real crowded in Chicago?
Speaker 2: For me I wouldn't know, I was blessed with the fact that my grandfather [James Robinson (ph.)] had this building and then my mom [Bertha Robinson Blanks] was able to get her own apartment and we never had this like they had the front and the rear--they used to have a front and the rear apartments and used to have it where they would have to share the bath.  I knew of this through friends but I was fortunate enough that I never had to live like that.  But yes there were cases where they were really piled up and they had these long halls.  Then they also had--there was also where in order to have an apartment they would have roomers and so a home was really not a home because you've got all these locked doors where roomers are renting a room in order to have a place to live.  I too was fortunate there where we didn't have to live like that.  We were always experiencing family and had a home to live in.
Story_ID: 216617
Speaker 1: Well I forgot to ask you do you have any brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I had a sister and her name was Winifred [ph.], she died when I was eight years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was born--I was born September 10th and she was born September 15th.
Speaker 1: Okay she was--you all weren't were born the same year? Or, not the same year--?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, she was younger.  She was just a year--it was just a year difference in our age and she was born like a year later.
Speaker 1: What did she die of?
Speaker 2: She had pneumonia, she caught pneumonia from an operation when she was in the hospital and she died from pneumonia.
Speaker 1: That's pretty tough for a kid to lose your sister.  So you were kind of a shy, quiet kid, you had to have been a little effected by that too, right?
Speaker 2: It could be because we were always playing and then I had some cousins that we grew up with and we were always active and playing and then when she died I was always kind of quiet after that.
Story_ID: 216618
Speaker 1: In grade school did you have a favorite teacher in grade school of all the grade schools you went to?
Speaker 2: Yes and that was my teacher Sister [Mary] Norma [ph.] from Corpus Christi [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  She was really a sweet teacher.  I liked a teacher that would have patience with me and would really show me how to teach me because of the fact that I was so shy and I think she recognized that.  When she called me she would let me know I'm getting ready to call upon you or its okay that you can answer this question but yeah it was Sister Mary Norma.
Speaker 1: So how many years were you in Corpus Christi?
Speaker 2: I went to Corpus Christi when I was in sixth grade.
Speaker 1: So you did the last three years of grade school--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: And then the last--I finished my last years there.
Speaker 1: Where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I first went to [Lucy] Flower Tech [Lucy Flower Technical High School, Chicago, Illinois], it was known as Lucy Flower and then they changed it to Flower Tech.  I stayed there for--I think it was two years there and my last year I finished at Englewood High [School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay now Lucy Flower that's on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: That was on the West Side and it was an all-girl school.  It was an all-girls school when I went there now I hear it's--I don't know if Flower School is still there.
Speaker 1: I think it is.  So did you live on the West Side when you were going to school there or did you--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No when I was going to school at Lucy Flower I lived on the South Side as a matter of fact, I lived at 61st [Street] and Vernon [Avenue], I remember that very well 'cause I used to take the train to Flower Tech.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right, so well, how did you like high school?
Speaker 2: I liked it, now I did well in high school.  I don't know--they had what they call the impostures [ph.].  It wasn't a contest but it was sort of a thing where every--once a month they would pick out a person with the best posture and I made it for two months (laughter).  And then the activities the activities there--actually the reason I left Flower was because most of their like teaching was cooking and sewing and I wanted more, I wanted to get into the business end of it so I went to Englewood.
Speaker 1: Now Englewood--now that's on--that was sort of the southern border where blacks had moved at that time, right?
Speaker 2: Yes over on Stewart [Avenue] that's 62nd [Street] and Stewart, I believe it is.
Speaker 1: Black people really hadn't moved that far south, I think.  That was like--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Just moving there 'cause we--there are two, I was at--I was still on Rhodes [Avenue], 61st [Street].  So we were just coming across 63rd [Street] around that time.
Speaker 1: Were there still a lot of white students at Englewood?
Speaker 2: Yes there were a lot of white students when I went there.
Speaker 1: How were relations between the races in the school?
Speaker 2: They seemed to be fine as far as I knew. I never encountered any problems.  That whole area too where the school was had a lot of whites.  We would walk over to the school or take a bus to the school.  But I never encountered any problems there.  There might have been but I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. So you majored in, you were studying-- looking to study business, all right--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Business courses.
Story_ID: 216619
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite teacher at Englewood [High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No I didn't and at Englewood that's where I met my dance partner [Ann Henry], when we went to Englewood (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: I used, as I said I used to have a time with shoes and feet.  I used to wear my shoes out so badly that my mom [Bertha Robinson Blanks] would put little taps on the toes and on the heels to kind of protect the shoes and my girlfriend saw the taps and she said, "Do you tap?" I said, "Yeah, I tap."  Well I tapped, I knew I tapped, I never had studies in it but I tapped, yes.  So then she says, "We need to get together," and she's the one that wanted to start the team so then we just hooked together and started creating our own dances.  Oh I did take--when I met her I did start taking dance lessons from Sadie Bruce [Glover].  I was with Sadie Bruce, I guess for maybe two years and during that time we hooked--this girl and I hooked up together and we got our own little routines and stuff together and then went on auditions and then we moved on from there.
Speaker 1: Can you give the name of your dance partner?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head no)
Speaker 1: You can't okay you told me before there was an issue.  Now was your family musically inclined was anybody else in your family aspiring to be a dancer or musician or an actor?
Speaker 2: No that was a surprising part of it, none of them were into music or into dance or into acting, none of them were.  So at first, of course it didn't encourage a lot of that from me but then my mom says--she allowed me to go on to audition and to go into the shows.  Of course, they would tell her I don't see why you let her do that.  They were all against it so my mom was kind of between the two but she did let me go.
Speaker 1: So you started performing in high school?
Speaker 2: I started performing--we started performing right after we graduated.  All this time while we're still in school, we're getting our little dances together and I'm really now getting into learning how to dance and all that kind of stuff, not just teaching me anymore.  After we graduated which was '43 [1943], the year of '43 [1943] we graduated, in '44 [1944] we were still getting our little routines together and I think that's when we went down to Berle Adams, we decided now we're going to go to Berle Adams' agency [William Morris Agency; William Morris Endeavor] and audition for--to become a team.  He liked our act and booked us from that point on.
Story_ID: 216620
Speaker 1: Now that's--you didn't have any other experiences as an amateur performer or anything, you didn't?
Speaker 2: Isn't that something. No we didn't, well my partner [Ann Henry] danced a lot.  She has had more experience in dancing than I did and she was like the spear of this thing.  But the thing is she turned to me and we danced, we worked out our routines together and created our own style and our own costuming that we wanted.  Our dancing at that time, we were classy.  We created a routine to [George] Gershwin's music.  We even had it where we would take off our gloves with the music and put our hats on with the music, everything was just so and then we had that type of number which we called a ballet boogie and yeah we called it the ballet tap then we did sort of a boogie number which we called the ballet boogie 'cause' we did a lot of leaps and spins.  We patterned ourselves after the Nicholas Brothers [HistoryMaker Fayard Nicholas and Harold Nicholas] and we would do a lot of things that they would do except run up the walls (laugh).
Speaker 1: So can you do the knee drops and all that sort of thing and the splits and things that they did, spinning?
Speaker 2: I used to do a thing where we would--I would jump over her and we would go into splits.  We'd do a thing where we would go up in the air and come right down into a split; we would do things like that--
Story_ID: 216621
Speaker 1: Other spins and things that I used to do was when I was--I used to do a lot of things when I was skating.  I joined a group--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Oh now yes right tell us about that, right, right.
Speaker 1: You remember that, skating--? I met this group when I went to the Savoy [Ballroom, Chicago, Illinois].  The Savoy used to have the skating rink there and Todd [ph.], oh what was Todd's name, he used to play the organ there, boy could he play that organ and could we skate and then I met Melvin Hill [ph.] who had this group called The Musketeers so then I hooked up with them and we did many USO [United Service Organizations] shows and shows at theaters and mostly we did for the USO centers.  Now we did a lot of acrobats and stunts on skates and I would do a little costuming design for the group.
Speaker 2: Yeah I read that you actually made the costumes.
Speaker 1: I made one of the costumes--I made one set of the costumes.  One set what it was--one set was made then we had to have quick changes and I designed and made the other costume that they needed to go over there and make this quick change.
Speaker 2: Were you still in high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois] when you were in The Musketeers?
Speaker 1: Yes I was still in school when I was with The Musketeers.
Speaker 2: So you did have some experience performing but not as a tap dancer?
Speaker 1: That's correct when I think back that's true we performed.  I remember performing at this theater on stage where we used to hold the gentleman's hand and we would move in a circle.  The girl is supposed to put her foot around his neck, he would let go and they're still going around in this circle well we did this on stage, just as I--he doesn't let go of your hand until you're hooked very well around his neck, my foot slipped so that's before he lets go of my hand, my foot slipped and I ended up doing a flip and into another spin.  It looked like a good act, it was an accident but it was great (laughter) and everybody applauded and I was so shocked 'cause I just knew I was going to end up off stage.  We did quite a few shows.  We used to do things where we would--the guy would take us backwards, we'd go down on the floor, the girl would have a match in her mouth and she would light the match on the floor.  We had quite a few stunts.
Speaker 2: That is some remarkable stuff.  Now this is--you say you toured with them to--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Most of the shows we did was here, was in Chicago [Illinois] but it was in various areas of Chicago.
Speaker 2: Around Chicago and a lot of people live around Chicago so I guess you'd go to a lot of--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: How many people were in The Musketeers?
Speaker 1: If I can remember there must have been about at the time that I would--must have been about twenty, it could have been more but the twenty I remember are the ones that I did the shows with.  Some of them--I don't think any of them are still skating; it might be a few that are still skating.
Speaker 2: Do you still skate?
Speaker 1: No I don't (laughter), no I don't skate anymore.
Speaker 2: Well that's something.  That sounds like an exciting show.
Speaker 1: It was nice.
Speaker 2: And people skated to the organ--to a live organ?
Speaker 1: To a live organ and his name--I can't remember Todd's full name but his playing was just great.  The kids would just skate and do these backward stunts.  I see some of the kids are skating now but not the way we used to skate then.  They are more wild now (unclear).  We had, we had little routines and things we doing and of course they had the precision skating which we were not doing, precision skating, we were just doing a lot of stunts in skates.
Story_ID: 216622
Speaker 1: What else did you do in high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois]?  Did you ever--so you never got involved in any amateur talent shows or any of that kind of thing as a dancer?
Speaker 2: No well at Corpus Christi [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] they used to have what they called operettas and once a year they would have a little operetta which was a nice little thing for the kids in school.  They'd get to put on little shows; they would get to do shows.  I never had a speaking part in these operettas; I always had the dancing part so that too was another way of performing in front of an audience.  I don't think there were any other times that I would do a show maybe in the community where we would make up our own little shows and sometimes we would charge--we would create a little show and charge five cents to come and see the show and things like that.  So actually I was always letting out my emotions and feelings when I'm dancing or I'm working with the group or something like that but other than that I was pretty quiet.
Speaker 1: A couple of days ago I interviewed [HistoryMaker] Jeni LeGon who's a--she's in town now and she's from Chicago [Illinois] and she was a--she studied with Mary Bruce, Sadie Bruce [Glover]'s sister.
Speaker 2: Her sister, that's right.
Speaker 1: And she was with the Whitman Sisters [Mabel Whitman, Essie Whitman, Alberta Whitman, and Alice Whitman] too.  Did you know about the Whitman Sisters?
Speaker 2: I knew of them but I never really knew them, I heard of them.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other--well who were some of the people in Chicago or were there any people in Chicago that you kind of idolized or looked up to or knew about in those days?  I don't know if you knew about Jeni LeGon in those days or not.
Speaker 2: I didn't, I didn't know about her but when I saw her on the television on FOX, they had her on and it was really something and then I read a lot about her since then and it was amazing.  But the ones that I knew, I knew Sadie Bruce there was Sammy Dyer and there was also Joe "Ziggy" Johnson who was a choreographer, Larry Steele and I'm trying to think of some of the others, Earl Hines.  Do you remember Earl "Fatha" Hines, they called him Earl "Fatha" Hines who appeared at--I appeared with him at the El Grotto [Cafe, Chicago, Illinois].  The El Grotto came much later than the Rhumboogie [Cafe, Chicago, Illinois] and the [Club] DeLisa [Chicago, Illinois].  A lot of my stars came from watching on the movies.  I'd go-Bill ["Bojangles"] Robinson watching him, the Nicholas Brothers [HistoryMaker Fayard Nicholas and Harold Nicholas] watching them and Eleanor Powell watching them, you know mine came from watching--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: That's why I'm intrigued.  We interviewed Ms. LeGon; she was in some of the movies when you would have been a teenager watching the movies.  Were you aware that she was from Chicago?
Speaker 2: No and--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: She danced with Bill Robinson in 'Hooray for Love'--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: I saw that.
Speaker 1: And she was in the big, 'Stormy Weather' and other movies--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah and I didn't know of her or anything.  When I saw her I said, wait a minute, but a lot of the movies that they had I didn't see.  I do remember her with Bill Robinson, I remember seeing 'Stormy Weather' but I don't remember her part in that.
Speaker 1: So you were inspired by the Nicholas Brothers or--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh very much so, very much so.  They were so classy.
Speaker 1: Did you ever get a chance to meet them in those days?
Speaker 2: Yes I did, I met them and I also had a chance to see-- to meet Fayard Nicholas again when we did the show at the Chicago [Human] Rhythm Project [Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right okay.
Speaker 2: So it was nice seeing him again there.
Story_ID: 216623
Speaker 1: When you got this contract, you all had graduated from Englewood [High School, Chicago, Illinois], right?  And you auditioned so what happened.  It was Berle-- (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Berle Adams and I think that was William Morris Agency [William Morris Endeavor] at that time.  The first booking was at the Rhumboogie [Cafe, Chicago, Illinois], was T-Bone Walker there at that time?  I think it was T-Bone Walker there at that time.
Speaker 1: About what year would this be?
Speaker 2: Around '44 [1944], '45 [1945], around '44 [1944].  Things started moving for us really fast and then from there our first out-of-town booking was to [Club] Plantation in St. Louis [Missouri].  The Plantation in St. Louis, a no no, a no no.  The experience there was horrible; we didn't finish out the contract there.  We went to the Club Riviera [St. Louis, Missouri] which was opened by a black guy who had just opened up the Riviera.
Speaker 1: What happened at the Plantation in St. Louis?  Now the name sounds like it's going to be trouble already but what happened?
Speaker 2: Let me tell you who we went in with just to--our time in show business was amazing the way we were moving on.  We went into that as a package with Sarah Vaughan, Billy Eckstine, Dizzy Gillespie and the Manhattan Debs; I think we were the [Manhattan] Misses then that was the package, that whole package left the Plantation.  The people were very rude.  One of the things they didn't--you know Sarah Vaughan has this kind of singing, didn't go for that, they definitely didn't go for our classy dance well I told you we did the [George] Gershwin--oh no they'd walk all over the floor for that.  They didn't like Dizzy Gillespie's loud--the way he blew.  All the real details of it, I can't really tell you because the managers took care of that and while my partner [Ann Henry] and I were in show business, we had more uncles and uncles to look over us and protect us from a lot of stuff.  A lot of things we don't know what truly happened but the next thing I knew we were all over at the Riviera, doing the shows over there.
Speaker 1: So was the Plantation a white owned--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: It was white owned.  There was a friend of mine, Lester Goodman who was also a dancer and he worked there and he happened to mention that and he said, "That Plantation," and I said, "Oh no you had problems there too?" and he said, "Yes indeed, that was horrible.  We left that place."
Speaker 1: Well it's always a--it's an old story leaving the plantation.
Speaker 2: Yeah we left that plantation (laughter).
Story_ID: 216624
Speaker 1: We were talking off camera about some of the people you performed with and I just mentioned that Dizzy Gillespie was considered kind of way out in those days, right?
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: He was a bebopper and--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: So it would be like a hip hopper now performing with an R&B man in a way.
Speaker 2: That sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Maybe, I don't know.
Speaker 2: I didn't know a whole lot about Billy Eckstine except when we--I mean Dizzy Gillespie except when we did shows together and then he would go his way and we would go our way.  But yeah he was kind of a way out kind of a guy.
Speaker 1: Did he have his horn pointed straight up in the air in those days?  Did he play that horn with the bell pointed straight up?
Speaker 2: I can't remember if he did or not.  I do remember--no I don't remember I don't believe so.
Speaker 1: I imagine he blew the horn the same way with his cheeks puffed up.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah those cheeks were puffed up.  I think that other came when he started doing his own thing, I don't remember him having it when I was with him.
Speaker 1: He was a member of the Billy Eckstine band [sic. The Billy Eckstine Orchestra]?
Speaker 2: Billy Eckstine band
Speaker 1: This is more of a big band sound, elegant kind of sounding.
Speaker 2: Right
Speaker 1: So Sarah Vaughan, Billy Eckstine, Dizzy Gillespie were on this show and you all were called the--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Manhattan Misses.
Speaker 1: Why Manhattan [New York, New York], what's wrong with Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: We were crazy about New York [New York] (laugh), you didn't seem to get anywhere in Chicago and so we figured we'll say we're from New York (laughter).  But we were just fascinated with New York and so we said Manhattan--we're going to be Manhattan Misses and then we thought nah we're going to be the Debs.
Speaker 1: Okay so you performed under two names, Manhattan Misses and--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Well we started off with Manhattan Misses and then we changed it to Manhattan Debs.
Story_ID: 216625
Speaker 1: You talked about how the [Club] Plantation [St. Louis, Missouri] was a bad place to be, you know, which, you know, would seem to be about right with the name (laughter) but you performed in St. Louis [Missouri] and where are some of the other places, where are some of the other places some of the highlights of your performances?
Speaker 2: We performed at-- in California, San Francisco [California], in Canada, in Nashville [Tennessee].  Nashville, Nashville was another bad experience.
Speaker 1: Now that sounds like that might be--Nashville is a Tennessee town, what happened in Nashville?
Speaker 2: That was a shocking thing to me too because I'd never experienced this kind of thing but the club that we worked in the people were very rude.  You could be performing and if they see somebody across the room they'd walk right across the stage whether you are performing or not and we put up with that, we were young and we weren't there with our uncles and uncles and the Billy Eckstines  and what not, it was just us booked there.  From the hotel we'd have to, of course take the bus to get to the club and this was really a shock to me when we went to get on the bus, I remember getting on the bus and giving the gentleman my fare and the bus was crowded and he says, "Now you go to the back."  Well I'm wondering, why is he telling me that I see I've got to go to the back it's crowded there are no seats here.  As I started he said, "No you get off the bus, you go to the back of the bus and get on at the back door."  I could not believe what I heard and that really happened.  We had to get off the bus, go to the back.  You paid now, we had to pay get off and then get back on the bus and then stand 'cause naturally there were no seats, I couldn't believe it.
Speaker 1: But you couldn't walk down that aisle pass the white patrons.
Speaker 2: I couldn't even walk there, couldn't walk pass there.  So in the back of the bus there are blacks but then where there are seats they're sitting there.  That doesn't make any sense does it?  When you think about it, it doesn't make any sense at all 'cause if you can't walk there and then you are standing there, they're sitting there but I was really shocked at that.
Speaker 1: It takes time too to do that.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: When everybody presumably on the bus is trying to get somewhere.
Speaker 2: And not only that the bus could drive away while you're walking to the back (laughter) and not knowing how it is there--how it was there I said to her when the people are sitting there I said, "Now this is strange what are we suppose to do next take a rope and run behind the bus?" Miss smart me, I don't know what danger I'm putting myself in.  But nobody said anything they just looked at us and I didn't say anymore.  Then we got off and went to our rude job (laughter) so I was very glad when we finished.  Oh another experience I had there was when anyplace that I went I always found a church to go to and you're always welcomed at any Catholic church, you're a Catholic, you're welcomed.  So I thought nothing of it, I found this Catholic church, I went into the Catholic church to Mass, I'm sitting in this pew and all of a sudden I'm the only one sitting in this pew and then when I get ready to go to communion, I can't remember if this is before or after they had communion but when I go to take communion there is nobody at the communion rail but me.  So they didn't sit with me, they refused to--now isn't that horrible, refuse to receive communion with me.  Forgetting what communion means, what it's all about and you're still going to practice this foolishness.  I was very glad to leave Nashville that was a horrible experience.
Speaker 1: So you weren't often booked in the South, I take it?
Speaker 2: No, thank heavens no.
Story_ID: 216626
Speaker 1: Now, was it rough being on the road, two young ladies from Chicago [Illinois] right out of high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois].  You said in some instances you had your uncles with you, the older black men (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah with the band or something like that and the uncles actually were not my family, it was the show business that took us on.  My aunts, my uncles, my moms so many times when you would have a booking you had a group but my partner [Ann Henry] and I didn't experience too much as we traveled.  We were able to take the train and then from there go right to our hotel or to our private homes.  A lot of times we stayed in private homes.
Speaker 1: How would you know about these homes?  I've heard this before.
Speaker 2: Previous entertainers would tell you go to so and so's home and they would have these big dinners and things there.  So you'd have these places to live.  So it was always through someone else.  Now how it ever got started but from word by mouth and you'd know these places to go.
Speaker 1: Yeah a friend of mine in Detroit [Michigan] has a house that was used like that by the original owner.
Speaker 2: Yeah the entertainers used to go there.
Speaker 1: Little Richard stayed there and I don't know who else.
Speaker 2: Yeah many old stars.
Speaker 1: That's the way the people would avoid having to go to these hotels and be mistreated in the hotels.
Speaker 2: That's right because if I'm right there were the big hotels were always white owned.  It was always owned by whites so therefore a lot of them you couldn't get into.  So then they had these little private homes where you could go.  In Montreal [Quebec, Canada] we stayed in a private home in Canada.  The experience there was fine, you know; we didn't have any problems there.
Story_ID: 216627
Speaker 1: You said you had a chance to meet the Nicholas Brothers [HistoryMaker Fayard Nicholas and Harold Nicholas], I didn't really explore that.  How long had you been performing when you met the Nicholas Brothers and how did you--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I would say about a year or so and I met them through Fleecie [Moore] Jordan who was the wife of Louis ["Louie" Thomas] Jordan and she was like a mom to us.  So it was through her that I met them.
Speaker 1: Maybe we should back up and talk about how you got with Louis Jordan's band.
Speaker 2: That was through Berle Adams because when he booked us into St. Louis [Missouri], Louis Jordan was booked there too. Louie--then Berle Adams would try to book us--no it was Louie, whenever Berle Adams had places for him to go he would ask for us, he would ask for the kids and so he booked us in a lot of places.  One very bad experience was with Louie and I'm not going to mention any names here but when we were booked in California this was way back in Orpheum Theater and Louie was pretty much--oh he was very popular then, a big star and there was a star that was doing a movie that was on the show with us.  Louie had us to come with him.  We were supposed to do our act, my partner [Ann Henry] and I but it was cancelled because of this white performer that was also going to dance so they wouldn't let us do our act.  Louie said you're going to stay and you'll do 'Caldonia' with me.  So he created this little thing where he sings 'Caldonia' and these two little girls come out and we dance to 'Caldonia' with him.  That was Louie's creation to have us with him and my partner got sick and so he said well that's okay [HistoryMaker] Doris [Humphries] you do it, you can do the show, I said okay.  So I was just the one Caldonia that was supposed to come out.  The manager there had a better idea, let Dinky as I was called in those days, let Dinky sit off in the audience and let it be that she gets so carried away with you playing 'Caldonia' that she runs on the stage.  I didn't like that too well but Louie thought about it and he said well okay.  So I'm sitting in the audience waiting to do my bit with Louie which I can't stand it in the first place.
Speaker 1: You didn't like the number?
Speaker 2: I didn't like that part of it, I didn't like that I've got to act all crazy and run on stage.
Speaker 1: And the song is, "Caldonia what makes your big head so hard," (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) "Big head so hard--."  But I'm supposed to be in the audience and I'm supposed to so carried away, I'm one of these little--I didn't like that but anyway I'm sitting there waiting to do my part and Louie has finished his number and--now this was before they announced 'Caldonia' so this big star comes out, now he's the master of ceremony and he's got his big number to do and in those days the best act was always last, the best act was always last.  So naturally this big star was last.  So then he comes out to introduce the next number that Louie's is going to play but before this happened while he's singing--while he's doing his act the audience is always hollering, "We want Louie, we want Louie," you know that kind of thing so of course he doesn't like that.  When the next show starts Louie does his number, I'm sitting out there waiting to do my part, the guy comes on the stage and he takes his finger and rubs it down Louie's face and says, "The chocolate is running."  The theater got so quiet, Louie just turned to him he said, "I don't play the dozens," quiet, quiet then finally the show goes back on.  I do my little bit that I'm supposed to do and then Louie says, "That's the end of that, you come out the way I told you to, you're back stage, you put on your costume, you're right with me," so, you know, he put an end to that.  And from that point on Louie was the one that closed the show.
Story_ID: 216628
Speaker 1: The dancer that they wouldn't let do the dance because she was dancing, she used to dance with [Donald] Don O'Connor and she was appearing alone this time but they wouldn't let us do it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know Ms. [HistoryMaker Jeni] LeGon had a story about getting a contract from MGM [Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc.] and then dancing in a preview show with Eleanor Powell and doing so well that they called her the next day and told her they didn't need her anymore, she got three ovations or something.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah see, that sure will happen, once you outshine someone and in my time don't you be too classy.  Our acts were a lot of times too classy, we had to eliminate that Gershwin thing, and we couldn't do that.
Speaker 2: That dance is probably obvious but I'm going to ask you why was being classy a threat or problem?
Speaker 1: In some areas if you didn't act like a clown, if a black person wasn't a clown then he didn't--he couldn't make it into show business.  In some situations and in some areas you had to act like a clown and to be clownish but we weren't.  We saw how classy the Nicholas Brothers [HistoryMaker Fayard Nicholas and Harold Nicholas] were and they made it, that's what we were going to do.  So it wasn't always that you couldn't do it but there were areas where you couldn't make it unless you acted like an idiot, we refused, we did not act that way.
Speaker 2: This is something that Fayard Nicholas talked about too.  He talked about how he had intentionally wanted to be classy and he talked about the hand gestures they made and how they would dress and comport themselves always with the intention of being classy.
Speaker 1: That's exactly right and see because we started off--now we're just starting off with this classy stuff and now who knows about us.  So we're in these southern areas trying to be classy, naturally they don't like it.  We're not the Nicholas Brothers yet, we're just trying to make it so you don't come up with that.  It's sad to say but that's the way things were.
Speaker 2: How long did you perform with [Louis Thomas] Louie Jordan?
Speaker 1: Let's see, we must have stayed with Louie about well because we both had the same agents, we were on and off with Louie and we were in show business maybe two, two/two and half years or two years like that.  So most of it was being booked with Louie and a lot of times we were booked on our own in clubs and a few theaters but a lot of that was with Louie.
Story_ID: 216629
Speaker 1: Now, what was your act like?  (unclear) Go through-- just kind of walk me through the act.  Did you all sing as well as dance?
Speaker 2: My partner [Ann Henry] did, that reminds me when we really got started we went to New York [New York].  Now that Apollo Theater [New York, New York] is another theater to talk about.  We were told how they are in New York, how the Apollo Theater that, that--if you could make it at the Apollo Theater, you could make it anywhere.  So and then they also told us that like the first show opens on a Friday, a lot of kids would take off from school to see that first show, that first show meant a lot.  They had us kind of nervous about it, you know, so my partner would sing and then we would go into the act--into the tap.  When we first appeared in New York at the Apollo Theater, she wanted to sing and nothing came out, she could not sing, she froze.  I'm trying to say well forget it, let's dance, you know, and I'm trying to make motions to tell her let's go on and dance and I fell (laughter).  We finished the number, we got booed, they threw things at us, and we went off the floor.  This is where Louie [Louis Thomas Jordan], this is where Louie first came in, took us over as an uncle, he really looked out for us.  We went off that floor just crying, crying up a storm and Louie kind of took us over and had us to try and finish out the thing, I don't think--yeah we did finish it out.  But we weren't never supposed to go back and then from that point on when we started doing shows all around and New York and that, now we're really becoming okay.  We're booked back into the Apollo Theater so we thought oh my goodness here we go again.  But this time we really got it together.  So we did our number and we tore down the house.  On our way up to our dressing room, we had a flight of stairs to go up to our dressing room. When we reached our dressing room they were calling for us, "To come back, get back on stage they were still applauding."  We had to go back on stage and they applauded us and when we got off, we said, "We made it, we made it (laughter) at the Apollo Theater," that's how tough that Apollo Theater was.
Speaker 1: That sounds pretty rough.  Did they have the [Howard] Sandman [Sims] then? The character that--
Speaker 2: The Sandman was the audience and yes they did have their amateur hour, the amateur time when we were there and he used to come with a hook and hook them off.  So that same kind of crowd that was your audience for a legitimate theater.
Speaker 1: What a bad experience at first.  Well at least it's got a good ending.
Speaker 2: It had a good ending.
Speaker 1: So they actually threw things on stage at you and everything?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah they threw stuff at you.
Speaker 1: They hadn't got pass the stage of throwing vegetables and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: They probably made them stop that, you know after a while but they sure did.  The stage was like here and they were like this and boy you could see their eyes and their expressions.  Now that's our first theater that we were ever booked into so you can imagine how nervous we were after hearing all that other stuff.
Story_ID: 216630
Speaker 1: Now tell me about the Nicholas Brothers [HistoryMaker Fayard Nicholas and Harold Nicholas] now, and how, that story okay and meeting them the first time and you said you were introduced to them by--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: By Louis ["Louie" Thomas] Jordan's wife, Fleecie [Moore Jordan] she was known as.  She introduced us and we were at a club and I think they were performing at that time and she had them to come over and we met them and actually we were just sitting there all enthralled over the fact that the Nicholas Brothers we're talking to them.  But we never really got to go around anywhere with them or anything like that, we just met them and then here I meet Fayard again and I was so happy to be with him again in the show.
Speaker 1: Well what are some of your other memories of performing?
Speaker 2: Show business. Let's see aside from the clubs when we worked with W.C. Handy in St. Louis [Missouri].  We worked with Cecil [ph.] wait a minute what was his name?   I'm trying to think of that band that we worked with.  One did the--not "St. Louis Blues" but "I'm Just Wild About Harry," I think that was--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Noble Sissle?
Speaker 2: Noble Sissle that's who we worked with and I think that was in San Francisco [California] that we worked for them.
Speaker 1: Did you meet Eubie Blake too?
Speaker 2: No I didn't meet him, we didn't meet with him.
Speaker 1: Yeah they were partners for many years, I don't know if they still were then.
Speaker 2: Yeah that's what I heard.
Speaker 1: But that show that they did, that show they put together in 19 teens [1910s] I think with 'Shuffle Along,' "I'm Just Wild About Harry."  So they've been doing that for a while.
Speaker 2: Yes they had, they had been doing that for quite awhile.
Speaker 1: So you went to San Francisco--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: San Francisco, New York, Baltimore, Maryland of course California, Los Angeles [California], Canada, Montreal [Quebec, Canada] and Toronto [Ontario, Canada].
Speaker 1: Now you were in a movie at one point?
Speaker 2: That movie too was through Louie.  Berle Adams--Louie was booked to go do this movie, 'Swing Parade of 1946' and that was with Gale Storm and Phil Regan and The Three Stooges.
Speaker 1: Gale Storm and she went on to become a TV star in a series called 'My Little Margie.'
Speaker 2: 'My Little Margie,' right.
Speaker 1: And The Three Stooges, we all know about them and Phil Regan.
Speaker 2: Phil Regan, he was a singer.
Speaker 1: Now he's disappeared from history?
Speaker 2: You don't hardly hear about him but Phil Regan and Gale Storm were the stars of that and so through Louie he booked us in 'cause they wanted his "Caldonia" and he said bring my girls on to "Caldonia" with me.
Speaker 1: That's something, I've seen that performed, I think my first experience at a club ["Brother"] Jack McDuff was playing in Dayton, Ohio and they did a rendition of "Caldonia" and a lady got out of the audience and danced the part, that was the first time I saw it performed and the only time in person and it was interesting.
Speaker 2: I wonder if that was the same set up they were setting up for me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah 'cause' she actually came out of the audience and danced.
Speaker 2: Maybe that's how it all started.  Maybe they talked about it and said let [HistoryMaker] Doris [Humphries] do this since she's alone.  Oh but he knew I didn't like that but he said, "No that's it, you come on stage like we always do."  So he sings, his Caldonia, gets to a certain part and then we come out and then all three of us dance together.
Speaker 1: Now did he write "Caldonia," is that his song?
Speaker 2: I never really knew but it seemed to me that someone said his wife [Fleecie Moore Jordan] had something to do with the writing of that, I don't know for sure.  I do remember them getting it together and rehearsing it day in and day out.
Speaker 1: It's a song, the name Caldonia sticks in the mind like Sapphire and these other names of a hard headed black woman.  I don't know. Do you have any reflections about that, the meaning of the song or anything?
Speaker 2: No, no I don't.
Story_ID: 216631
Speaker 1: I have to ask you about her too, did you ever meet [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham?
Speaker 2: No I never met Katherine Dunham.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're rolling again, but you said you never met Katherine Dunham or--there are so many questions I probably should be asking you and I'm trying to think of one.  You were performing for two years.  Oh the movie, we were talking about the movie before we cut off. 'Swing Parade [of 1946]'-(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah 'Swing Parade'--
Speaker 1: So you did "Caldonia" in 'Swing Parade'--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: We did "Caldonia" in 'Swing Parade.'
Speaker 1: Was that the only movie you made?
Speaker 2: Yeah that was the only thing that we did as far as movies were concerned.  The other part of it was just theaters, clubs.
Speaker 1: Now what was that experience like?  I guess you were excited, right?
Speaker 2: With the movie?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh very much so and then let The Three Stooges walk in, my goodness.  I wanted to run and get autographs and Louie [Louis Thomas Jordan] said, "Sit down, sit down quit acting up," and he made us sit.  But yeah that was very--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: You all were all there in the same scene with The Three Stooges?
Speaker 2: Well they are like sitting over--it's a great big old room and they're sitting waiting to do their part and we're over here doing our part.  It's like the club is opening up and we're rehearsing and they're over here sitting and waiting for their part to come.  So when you see the movie, we're rehearsing and they're doing the walls and they're keeping time with us and stuff like that, it was really exciting.
Speaker 1: What were they supposed to be doing and what were they like--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: They're like working around this club and they had things to fix and they had things to paint, they're the waiters and all kind of little parts that they had in there and they'd do all kinds of foolish things (laughter).
Speaker 1: Had they only known before they hired them as contractors that they were The Three Stooges.  You know what they are going to do, they're going to turn the ladder around, hit somebody.  Gale Storm and Phil Regan so this movie this is something that I've got to go find too to see you in this.  So that was-- what studio produced 'Swing Parade'?
Speaker 2: That was Monogram [Pictures; Allied Artists International]-- it was called Monogram studios.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. Is this in black and white?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes it is.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Story_ID: 216632
Speaker 1: Now why did you stop performing, I mean-- ? What happened?
Speaker 2: After a while I just wanted to have my own--I wanted to get married and have my children.  I guess when I met my husband [Hedrick Humphries] in New York through a friend of mine, that's probably how he encouraged this marriage business and then I really wanted to settle down and have a home, have my kids and that's when I quit.
Speaker 1: Okay now he was a sergeant or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah he was a sergeant.
Speaker 1: Was he just back from the war [World War II, WWII]?
Speaker 2: Yeah with the Buffalo Soldiers [U.S. Army 92nd Infantry Division] and I think he was on leave when I met him in New York.  Low and behold he's a Chicagoan [Chicago, Illinois] and I'm a Chicagoan and I have to meet him in New York (laughter).  Then shortly after that we dated and then we decided to get married.
Speaker 1: So when did you get married?
Speaker 2: In '46 [1946]
Speaker 1: So you just decided then well traveling and show business didn't mix--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah I kind of got a little--I kind of got a little tired of it.  We maybe I wasn't--I don't know we were moving pretty good but I don't know what else I was looking for but it wasn't in my blood like it was in my partner's [Ann Henry] 'cause after I quit, she went on, she stayed in show business.
Speaker 1: Did she go on and do more movies and things like that?
Speaker 2: No she didn't do any more movies but she did a lot of--she got another group together and they performed quite a bit and then she pushed on with her singing and then she quit dancing altogether and started singing.  Now she has her own band so she's something that you could talk to.
Speaker 1: We can't talk about who she is?
Speaker 2: Only when she is ready to say what she has to say.
Speaker 1: We all know her name though, you told us.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you ever have mixed feelings about quitting show business?
Speaker 2: After I quit, no I didn't.  I think I did not because when I got married it wasn't too long afterwards that I had my first child and I was really into my children, I really--I wish I could keep them little.  I really enjoyed my children so I was so into that, I never missed show business at all.  But then I started working with communities doing shows with children, founding my own--well through the church they allowed me to house a community theater workshop.  I was always doing something with the children.  With my kids going to school and being--trying to get them in little programs, I was constantly doing those shows and things for the groups.
Speaker 1: When you look back on your show business career, what would you think would be the highlight of those two years that you were really touring and so forth?
Speaker 2: I think making that movie ['Swing Parade of 1946'] 'cause it was so fascinating to watch how it's made and the stars that were coming in, I think that really would have been--that is the most exciting.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 216633
Speaker 1: Did you meet any of the other black stars in Hollywood during that period of time when you were out there?
Speaker 2: Not in Hollywood, no.  Only like on stage, Pearl Bailey and--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: She was in it too?
Speaker 2: Like on shows, like theaters, let's see which ones you would know about, Four Step Brothers.  The Four Step Brothers, I'm saying the Four Step Brothers but the one that I knew was Flash McDonald.  [Rufus] "Flash" McDonald was a dancer that we worked with in St. Louis [Missouri] at the [Club] Riviera and Flash was alone, he was a single performer.  Then he joined The Four Step Brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay so they weren't all brothers?
Speaker 2: They weren't, no.
Speaker 1: Were any of them brothers?
Speaker 2: I only knew Flash so I didn't know who was a brother or who was not.
Speaker 1: What about [Clayton] "Peg Leg" Bates, he's an intriguing--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes he is, "Peg Leg" Bates I met him, we did some shows and this is through the clubs--night clubs again but working on the show with him was like we did a show, we talked between shows, after that I don't--no contact or anything.
Speaker 1: Tell us something about him.  I think people watching this don't have an idea of who he was.  Just tell us something about--how did he lose his leg?
Speaker 2: Those are things that I really don't know about, I wish I did so that I could tell you about it because he was such a--all I knew of him was being such a great guy and a great performer the way he worked with that peg leg.
Speaker 1: He could dance with one leg basically with a peg?
Speaker 2: Yes he did and he did this thing called the airplane [Bates' Jet Plane] where he would just hold out and just dance, just work on that peg leg, he called it airplane something.
Speaker 1: A lot of stamina to do that.  Who else during that period?
Speaker 2: Let's see there was Sammy Davis [Jr.].  Now when we worked with Sammy Davis he was with his uncle and his father [Sammy Davis, Sr.] known as the Will Mastin Trio or something like that.  With Sammy we used to have fun just backstage and Sammy was always going to be quite the star but we always had a lot of fun with him and he was a real great guy, a fun guy.  Then we wouldn't see him until maybe we were booked again at some other show and that's the way it is with a lot of stars, you are with them for that week, you wouldn't see them again unless you're booked at another show for another week or two weeks.  We were booked with Sammy in Detroit [Michigan].  Now this is when Sammy is just Sammy and Sammy at that time had a girl that he wanted to make a star, a singer just like my agent tried to make me a singer.   All this after Lena Horne, all these Lena Hornes.  I couldn't sing worth two cents so they had to drop that and Sammy would have this girl rehearsing.  Now our dressing rooms used to be close in theater and you could hear them rehearsing this girl.  Our hotel rooms used to be close and you could hear them rehearsing this girl.  So my partner [Ann Henry] and I used to say here she goes again with this song, "You've got to accentuate the positive," we had to hear that over and over and over again, I don't think she made it though.  And it was nice working with him; he was a real good guy.
Story_ID: 216634
Speaker 1: Anybody else that you remember?
Speaker 2: The only acts that I've been really close to like you're with them out of the show business as well as on was with Louie [Louis Thomas Jordan] and Billy Eckstine.  Those were the two that I could say that I was really close to.  The others were real close while you're doing the show, then you're gone, then you're back again, "Hey," we see you again, we're doing the show.
Speaker 1: What was Billy Eckstine like?  I know at the time he was an idol basically.  All the women loved him and crazy about him (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: From what I knew of him, he was just a real guy--a real fine guy.  Later I hear there were some problems which I didn't know of.  The same with Sarah Vaughan, she had her style of singing and I knew, I could kind of see little problems that might be going on but I was never really around them but then she grew out of her situation.
Speaker 1: Did you know of like seedy characters hanging around the theaters and I mean you know show business has its dark side.
Speaker 2: Yeah it has its dark side but we got out, we never--I tell you we were like really protected when we were in show business.  We didn't have to worry with anybody hanging around for us and if there were some hanging to see the other stars, as far as we knew they were people that they knew waiting to see them, we never encountered a lot of that stuff.
Story_ID: 216635
Speaker 1: Now, when you were on the movie ['Swing Parade of 1946'] set did the stars interact, did you have any much interaction with Gale Storm, The Three Stooges or any of them?
Speaker 2: No not with Gale Storm and Phil Regan, no.
Speaker 1: What about the Stooges were they better--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact we never even saw Gale Storm and Phil Regan when we did the movie they weren't even there.
Speaker 1: They didn't shoot there scene at the same time.
Speaker 2: When you see the movies it's just like we're all there and no we're not even with the audience, there's nobody there while we're doing this but then it looks as if we're all together so no we never did it.
Speaker 1: What about the Stooges, did you have any interaction with them at all?
Speaker 2: Just sitting while they were waiting to go on to the show--while they were waiting to do their part.  I wanted to go over and talk with them and we just talk and, how is the show and how are you, you couldn't say too much but that was all just light talk, very light talk while we're waiting to do a show.  The fascinating thing was to watch how the movies were made, how they put these parts.  They shoot everything that's going to happen in that particular scene, tear that down and put up another and at the time that we were making this movie they had a little western town, a little town going on and Ida Lupino was appearing in that one.  I wanted to, of course, run over there but couldn't do it.  It was really exciting that's why I say I think that was one of my most exciting experiences.
Speaker 1: Just being on the set and seeing what was going on.
Speaker 2: Yeah, just being on the set and watching things going on.
Speaker 1: I suppose in those days people did not have as much of a sense of how a movie was made as they do now.
Speaker 2: No they didn't they really didn't and then to a lot of the stuff that they did then, they don't have to do it now 'cause they go to the cities.  Then they used to have to make their own cities or their little towns or whatever.  Now they don't have to do all of that.
Speaker 1: Most of the movies in those days were actually shot in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California], right?
Speaker 2: Right in Hollywood.
Speaker 1: So a set--in the back lot they'd have a set of Manhattan [New York, New York] street or whatever.
Speaker 2: Or a little storefront, a little house that's not really a house and they'd break it down and that was really fascinating to see that.  One minute a little town, next minute it's something else, you know.
Story_ID: 216636
Speaker 1: Well let's talk about your teaching.  You said you got involved in community activities with your kids and teaching dance and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Tell us about some of those activities.
Speaker 2: I've done a lot of projects for various communities.  Communities like the, called the street projects.  A lot of the community things that I've done--oh the Better Boys Foundation [BBF Family Services, Chicago, Illinois] was one.  But a lot of the community work that I did was work that I just pulled together and worked with the children myself.  I had a--in my block where my kids lived, I pulled the kids together and they did a little show and then it turned out that there was an organization that wanted the block clubs to put on their talents of their block and of course the block would win a prize and I gathered the kids together, put them in my mom's [Bertha Robinson Blanks] basement, got their little show together.  They did the show, they won and then they appeared--how wonderful for them to appear downtown at the McCormick--it wasn't the McCormick Place [Chicago, Illinois] then, was it--yeah (laughter).  Then I also started the theater workshop--community theater workshop at my church [St. Therese of the Infant Jesus (Little Flower) Parish, Chicago, Illinois] which they allowed me to become housed there.  I got a grant from the arts, Chicago Arts and started a little theater there.  From there the kids did various shows.  I was able to let them do their shows at Dunbar [Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]--you know at the high schools so they had a big stage to work on and from the kids on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] when I worked with the Better Boys Foundation, a lot of those kids--(unclear) it's such a difference from the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] and the West Side.  A lot of those kids hadn't even gone downtown--hadn't even been downtown--
Speaker 1: Now what--
Speaker 2: --which was surprising.  So when I did work with these kids and did the show, I took them from there and they did a show at the old Sherman [House] Hotel [Chicago, Illinois] which is torn down now.  But they did a show at the Sherman Hotel and they were really excited about that. So it was--
Speaker 1: About when were you doing some of these things?  When were you at the Better Boys Foundation?
Speaker 2: Oh let's see.  That must have been, must have been in the '60s [1960s]. It must have been in the '60s [1960s] because I also worked at the Chicago Park District teaching millinery.
Speaker 1: Making hats?
Speaker 2: Making hats and letting my ladies do their shows and they won prizes there.  So I was kind of successful in all those little things that I did.  But the Better Boys must have been around in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay was this before they had the theater built?  They had a little theater named LaMont Zeno [Community] Theater [Chicago, Illinois] and it was in the '70s [1970s] I guess, that was probably the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Yeah this was way before that. Yeah 'cause all they had was this little two story building and at first it was just like the Better Boys who had the gym right down on the first floor and then they decided they would have the programs for the girls as well.  It was [HistoryMaker] Warner Saunders that started getting this going and so I was with the ladies, a group called--it was with Warner Saunders, this ladies that was the auxiliary part of Warner Saunders' clubs.  I stayed and decided to work with them and do the shows and teach them how to dance and from there it just took off and that's how I got the kids to do the shows downtown, and I took them from there over to the South Side and they did shows there so they were busy traveling back and forth.
Story_ID: 216637
Speaker 1: Now, you got involved in Latin dance too, tell us about that.
Speaker 2: With the Latin dance, that was when I went to Jimmy Payne I was to teach the ballroom there and then got interested in his Afro Cuban and started taking lessons in to that.  I met Tony Cortez who was also taking it and he and I--Louie [Louis Thomas Jordan] saw a team and he put us together and we started teaming and we did shows at The Blue Angel [Night Club, Chicago, Illinois], Club Matador [sic. El Matador Lounge, Chicago, Illinois] and worked with Tito Puente and what's that Gutierrez [ph.]--I can't think of his name right now and I just had it the other day.
Speaker 1: Is this the Club Matador on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: The Club Matador--it was--yes it was southwest (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) On 75th [Street]?
Speaker 2: And the Blue Angel at that time was north and then they moved to Michigan [Avenue] to some hotel down in the basement also at the Edgewater Beach Hotel [Chicago, Illinois] which is no longer there.
Speaker 1: The building is still there but it's not a hotel anymore.
Speaker 2: No it's a senior apartment.
Speaker 1: It's that big pink building.
Speaker 2: Yes it is, it's called the Edgewater--it's still using the name Edgewater and then we travelled but most of my travel was local when I danced with Tony.
Speaker 1: So this is something that kind of picked up.  This is a second professional advocational kind--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Exactly and one of the guys in the Gutierrez band said--no Tito Puente said we were known as Tony and [HistoryMaker] Doris [Humphries] and he says, we should call you Tanya Bell so from then on we became Tony and Tanya Belle so now I've got another stage name.
Speaker 1: That's a big deal dancing with Tito Puente.  Tito Puente is the king of the timbales, he's the man.
Speaker 2: Yeah we got booked with him and we got booked with [Antonio] Tony Contreras I guess it was and that was in Elk Grove [Illinois] the club called El Toro [ph.] I believe.
Speaker 1: So I suppose people thought you were Hispanic?
Speaker 2: They did especially when we did the show at--it was out in Elk Grove and this lady thought that I was Spanish but she said, you are a black Spaniard and very popular.  She was talking about how they were and they would come expecting me to speak Spanish and Tony would have to run up and talk for me and protect me.  We also appeared at the Fairmont theater--Fairmont Hotel [Chicago, Millennium Park] here in Chicago [Illinois] down in the Loop and a lot of people there would think that I was the black Spaniard.
Speaker 1: Well you're quiet anyway, I guess if you just look arrogant or something--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: But when I hooked up with Tony, I was married 'cause I was teaching ballroom and everything then and my husband [Hedrick Humphries] was a steward with one of these auto--GM [General Motors Company] I think it was, I know he's going to hit me because I can't think of the name of it--General Motors I think it was.  So he used to have a lot of Spaniards beneath him that he would have to talk to and help out and so when he would come to the show to see us, he, all of these Spaniards and my partner are all talking and I'm sitting there just looking but I'm the black Spaniard, I don't know anything. I'm just listening to them.
Speaker 1: So you never learned any Spanish?
Speaker 2: Not well, very little but my husband he started picking it up because he had to deal with a lot of Spanish people.
Story_ID: 216638
Speaker 1: --You could do the dance apparently well enough to--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: I could do the dances, as a matter of fact, I used to teach Spanish kids how to dance but I could do that.
Speaker 1: That's interesting, one never knows.
Speaker 2: And still doing it.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. Well did you ever open your own school of dance?
Speaker 2: No just had that little community theater.  In the community theater we introduced--it was like fine arts and I'd have other people that had talent in whatever, sewing, drama, ballet to teach the kids.  There was a very lovely guy named Mr. Haggett [ph.] who had the aikido classes and he--there is a wonderful history about him too which I can't tell you at the moment 'cause I can't remember a lot of it and I wouldn't want to even start it.  But he had the aikido classes there and I had the tap, the ballroom, ballet, the kids had drama, they had music.  It was like in the community but kids came from all other communities would come there, as a matter of fact, we almost became the babysitting part because parents would bring their kids and just leave them there, put them in all these different programs.
Speaker 1: Now this is the Better Boys [Foundation; BBF Family Services]?
Speaker 2: No this is right here at [St. Therese of the Infant Jesus] Little Flower [Parish, Chicago, Illinois], that's where my church allowed me to have things.
Speaker 1: What's the name--what church is this?
Speaker 2: That was Little Flower. It was called Little Flowers.
Speaker 1: Oh the church?
Speaker 2: Yes which is at like 81st [Street] and Wood Street, it isn't there any longer but that's where we had our little theater workshop--
Story_ID: 216639
Speaker 1: So you're teaching now too, you're still teaching?
Speaker 2: I'm teaching. Yes, I'm teaching now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And teaching a variety of different styles?
Speaker 2: Yes, when you do ballroom you've got your waltzes, foxtrots, tangos, meringues so you're teaching all of that and then in your Latin you have the salsa, the bachata, mambo, meringue again and then the tap class, you certainly have a lot of variety of dancing there because you are forever creating combinations of taps.
Speaker 1: When you were in high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois] as a senior, did you envision being able to spend your life with dance like this?
Speaker 2: No I didn't, it just came about through this girlfriend of mine and just came about then.  It all just seem to happen, it wasn't that I dreamed I'm going to do this or I--like she knew what she wanted and she went out to get it and I was there so it just kind of came to me.  I used to love it, used to be crazy about it, I never dreamed that I would be able, that we would be doing it but I used to certainly pretend a lot.
Story_ID: 216640
Speaker 1: If you had to do it all over again would you change anything or do anything differently?
Speaker 2: No, I don't believe so, nothing that I did would I, would I change.  I naturally wish other things had had been better because had they'd been better, I would probably be more into it or known like the Nicholas Brothers [HistoryMaker Fayard Nicholas and Harold Nicholas] but, no I don't think I would have changed anything.
Story_ID: 216641
Speaker 1: We always ask this question and that's, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my concern is I hate to see some of the things that the--well I'll say with the kids.  What they are going through now--in our time there was the disrespect that you don't seem to get anymore, I wish the kids would understand that it is so important to respect themselves and to respect others.  They could get further into life if they would do this.  I'd like to see more of them working together and doing things for each other, having a little more pride in where they live, really getting in to their studies to make something of themselves.  Tell yourself now what you would like to be and work on it.  Get all the studies that you can in that particular field that you would like to go into and really make something of yourself.  Regret is the worst thing in the world to have.  It was sad that you--if a person lets a beautiful life go by where they had the chance to do something or to make something of themselves and they didn't do anything, to live that life of regret is the worst thing in the world.  So don't let yourself get into that regret state, tell yourself that if you didn't make it, it isn't because you didn't try.  I would like to see the kids do more of that and for the younger ones I would like to see them do-- get away from that TV and do more little imaginary things that we can do to help develop their minds.
Story_ID: 216642
Speaker 1: When you look back on all the things that you've done, with dance and throughout life, what would you consider today to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I guess the training that my mom [Bertha Robinson Blanks] gave me--it is the training that my mom gave me because the training that she gave me it wasn't just growing up, it was--you had chores, you had responsibilities these things which she taught.  Whatever you do, be the best that you can be and all these things I'm growing up with, I'm growing up doing these things.  Yeah it's my mom.
Speaker 1: And how did she feel about--you said she was ambivalent about you going into show business in the first place.
Speaker 2: Yes she was, she was a sweetheart, she let it go but I can't imagine--now as I think back I can't imagine it was kind of hard for her but when she would come to see me do the show, oh great, my daughter, my baby.  But I know it must have been pretty hard because she was not into show business.  She was not into that kind of thing at all.  She was always there, she was there for me and she was glad when it was time for me to come home between shows mom--I know she was hoping I didn't have any others to go to so she was happy when I quit.

Speaker 1: The last question is and then we will go to the photos but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a person that was very concerned about other people because wherever there is a need, wherever I can do something, I want to do it.  A lot of times if I'm in an organization and I'm not doing anything, I don't feel like I'm part of it.  I like to do--I'm one of the kinds that if I'm in a group and I need to clean the table, do the windows whatever, I'll do that because I feel I'm doing something for you.  So I'd like to be remembered as a person that was always concerned about others, considerate and like to encourage others to move on.
