Story_ID: 15774
Speaker 1: Let's begin talking about your mother.  Starting with your mother's name and where she was borne and where she grew up as a girl.
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Julia Frances Braxton Wood.
Speaker 1: And where was she born and where did she grow up as a girl?
Speaker 2: Gloucester County, Virginia.
Speaker 1: And did your mother ever share any stories with you about what life was life for her growing up as a girl?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She worked in domestic work in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] for German people.
Speaker 1: And what kinds of stories did she tell you about her work?
Speaker 2: Well, how they--arranged the plates on the table and the silverware on the table and the tablecloths for different occasions and different foods they had.
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of the things she talked about specifically?
Speaker 2: Well yes--she had seven sons, no daughters. So she trained us to do housework in case we someday would get married. So she gave us the pattern as to how the German people, their culture, such as you don't lay your arm on the table, you wash your hands every time you come in the house, you--hold your fork and knife in a certain way and always have a napkin and carry on conversation while you eat.
Speaker 1: Okay. And how was it that your mother ended up coming back to Gloucester, because she went to Philadelphia to work for this family?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well she fell in love with my father, and he was from Gloucester. So they got married in a church in Gloucester by a white minister.  In those days, the black ministers were not performing weddings or were not permitted to perform weddings, but--she was married at the Shepherdsville Baptist Church in Gloucester and she and my father settled down in the district of Ware Neck of Gloucester County.
Speaker 1: And what kind of work did your mother do when you were a boy growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh she stayed home. She stayed home. She was a housewife.  My father did the work.
Story_ID: 15775
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your father now--starting with his name.
Speaker 2: His name's Frank Tucker Wood.
Speaker 1: And he was born and raised in Gloucester [county, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What kinds of stories did he tell you about his life as a boy?
[Note: In the following anecdotes about slavery times, Rev. Wood is probably speaking of his paternal grandfather, Moses Wood, born ca. 1850, rather than of his own father.] Well, he was raised on the plantation and the owner of the plantation picked him--the owner's madam picked him to be her carriage driver. They didn't have automobiles in those days, there were carriages.  But before he grew up to that age, he was--slavery was over--and he never fulfilled that task.
Speaker 1: Being the carriage driver?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now did your father and his family--did they continue to live on the plantation?
Speaker 2: Until slavery was over. That is my father [sic] and his mother and my father's sisters and brothers lived on the plantation.
Speaker 1: So were they like sharecroppers on the plantation?
Speaker 2: No, they were slaves and some cases in the South, the slaves were permitted to have certain amount of freedom in spite of the fact that so much of it was taken from them.  And there was this color line.  My father and my mother both were light skinned and his father was light and --some of his brothers and sisters were light and some were dark. And he, he stayed on--some of them stayed on the plantation.  But he tells us that the master came around one day and said, "You know that slavery is over now. And all of y'all get out of here and go where you want to go."  So there was a white man in that community who designated some land for these persons, told his slaveholders to go--and his mother took him and the rest of the family to a little section called Back Creek in Ware Neck in Gloucester County.
Speaker 1: And did they farm? What did they do there?
Speaker 2: Well my father became a carpenter.  And he did mainly carpenter work all of his life, along with the farming. And as his sons grew up, then they took over the farming until they decided to leave home for college.
Speaker 1: Did he teach you how to build things?
Speaker 2: Not really.  He taught the others.  I just didn't care for that kind of work.
Story_ID: 15776
Speaker 1: Did you know your grandparents at all?
Speaker 2: I knew my grandmother on my father's side. [Susan Wood].
Speaker 1: Who was a slave?
Speaker 2: A slave, yeah.  She died five years after they were released [sic] and I was born--and she was five years old when I died--when she died--I was five years old when she died [1925].
Speaker 1: Did she ever tell you stories about her life, what her life was like?  Do you remember some of them?
Speaker 2: Yes.  For an example, how the masters would treat them.  And would treat the light skinned slaves different from the others because they knew that they were products of the white population that would crawl in the tents at night and so on.  The idea was that if you're going--we brought these blacks over here, now we need to change the color of the racial group in America. And so the masters felt it was their duty to have children by the slaves so they would be brown skinned or light skinned. All Americans would be like that and they would have no problem mixing.
Speaker 1: Was your grandmother light skinned or dark skinned?
Speaker 2: In between. But very stylish as the slaves took their culture from the masters and the madams in the house as they called them.
Speaker 1: And how was she treated?  You said she was in between. So how was she treated?
Speaker 2: Oh very well. And her husband was white.
Speaker 1: Her husband was white?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He was a Dutchman as far as we know. But had very, very light skin. So he was in the house, called a house slave or something.
Speaker 1: But--oh, he was a white slave?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: She was--I don't know her middle name, but we called her Grandma Susan Wood.
Speaker 1: What about your maternal grandparents?  Did you know them at all?  Your mother's parents?
Speaker 2: No I did not know them personally.  I was told that my mother's [sic, maternal grandmother, Julia Braxton Wood] parents --were Indians and that my [maternal] grandparent--grandfather [Donahue, later changed to Braxton] was a rebel who escaped from England and came to America. My father told me this because he taught him how to read a blueprint.  He couldn't read when he came here from England.  He was one of these stowaways on the ship. And my father [sic] had to teach him how to read a blueprint. So--and teach him the carpenter trade.
Story_ID: 15777
Speaker 1: How would you describe your mother [Julia Braxton Wood]?
Speaker 2: Well she was a very pleasant woman, very much cultured and concerned about the culture of her children, the culture that she had picked up from working with domestic work in Philadelphia, the people there who employed her.  And she was concerned about the behavior of her children even after we left home. And so she gave us a good foundation of manners and sayings that we were governed by. In those days, we had very little to go on as far as values.  They came from our parents and the people of the community.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your father [Frank Tucker Wood]?
Speaker 2: He was very subtle. He was one--a man who worked every day when he could find work, because in those days, they employed the white carpenters against blacks. He was very stern, but he never said too much in the home at any time other than he made provisions, but my mother was the one who kept rattling off idioms like 'picture doesn't go to the right too often, it doesn't get broken' (laughs). And at night, 'it's too bad to go out at night because a dog wouldn't go to a persimmon tree tonight'. And some others that are still lingers in my mind that she used to say.  Served as guidelines for us.
Story_ID: 15778
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well my earliest memory I suppose is being sent on to school, walked to school in the country which was about three miles from home, and bringing wood, going to the pump for water and you had no cups, so you had to put both hands together and drink out of your hands (gestures drinking out of hands).
Story_ID: 15779
Speaker 1: Can you give us your siblings' names and their birth order, including yourself?
Speaker 2: Well there was Frank who was the oldest brother, then Alan, (ph.) all of us about two or three years apart, Alan, Levi. That's three are dead. Then Leslie who was here at the church, myself, Marcus, Lockley (ph.) who's dead and Garnett (ph.) is in Washington.
Speaker 1: So you're in the middle?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 15780
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your namesake. Did you parents ever tell you why they named you after Marcus Garvey?
Speaker 2: Well yes. There was a big argument when I was born.  My mother wanted Marcus Garvey, my father wanted Marcus General, for they saw in me or felt that it was there, and I would become a leader in some way. And I don't know how they were able to see this when I just came out of the womb, or they felt that they would like to have a leader in their family. So anyhow--my father won out on Marcus General for awhile. Then I discovered about Marcus Garvey, and people began to call me that. So I just took on that name.  And when I found out about it, I was glad when I went to Jamaica that I had the Marcus Garvey because I got all kinds of breaks (laughs) in Jamaica.  I just had to show them my card.
Story_ID: 15781
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about the community you grew up in. Tell us a little bit about Gloucester [Virginia] and can you kind of describe the community for us a little bit?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, the community in which I grew up in was a totally black community--away from the courthouse, down on the river, because that's the way we earned a living by fishing and crabbing and so on.  And everybody knew everybody.  Everybody felt that it was his responsibility to look after the children of the neighborhood, therefore anything you did at school--was reported to the home. And if you got--you were punished at school, you were punished at home.  If you did anything in the neighborhood, you were reported--you were punished sometime by the neighbor who would smack you and then you got--then that neighbor reported it at home--at your home as to what happened.  And then you got punished again.  So it was very tight knitted neighborhood where they--the old saying now it takes a village to raise a child. We were all raised by the village.
Speaker 1: And then did you live on the street or was it a rural route?
Speaker 2: No street and no route in those days.  It was just a road, Back Creek Road, [Ware Neck, Gloucester County, Virginia], that's all. They will tell you go down around at the Back Creek Road, go back in there. Somebody will tell you where Tucker Wood lived.
Speaker 1: And were there businesses there, or did you all have to go into the town of Gloucester?
Speaker 2: Well we went to the store because in the early days, you had no automobile or transportation.  You walked to the store.
Speaker 1: Was the store in your community?
Speaker 2: No, about two miles away. And--you walked there.  You got things on credit that your father got paid. He went to the store on Saturday nights to get groceries for the week and of course the store owner was white and he would get my father a cigar.  My father was so glad to get a free cigar in those days. And he would come home and cut it in half and he smoked half of it on Sunday, and the other half during the week, and he would take a stick and stick it in the stump of that cigar and suck on it until it would burn his mustache before he would throw it away.  He never bothered about smoking a pipe.
Speaker 1: Just that cigar?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was given to him. The merchant gave him that to encourage him to come back.  Because it was only two stores in the neighborhood by two different white families.
Speaker 1: And you said that you all--the community you lived in was a fishing community, so you all made your living fishing and crabbing?
Speaker 2: We didn't make a living that--my father made a living for us, but--we went down to the river and we fished, not for commercial use, just for the family to eat.
Story_ID: 15782
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit more about elementary school. Do you remember the name of the elementary school you attended?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was Wilmake (ph.) Elementary School, Grade School. That's what it was.  Two classes in one room.
Speaker 1: How many rooms in the school?
Speaker 2: It was four rooms in that school.  There's a potbelly stove in the middle of the floor. And I remember it so well because my last name begins with a "W" which meant I was always in the back of the room and I would have to raise my hand to ask the teacher if I could come forward and get warm on my feet because I had walked about two or three miles. We didn't have a car then.
Story_ID: 15783
Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up and remind you of your childhood.
Speaker 2: Well whenever I go in anyplace where I sense that they are boiling potatoes and cabbage, I feel at home.  Where they're frying chicken, it reminds me of home.  Whenever I come home and my wife is fixing apple pie, going to church, that reminds me of home.
Speaker 1: And what sounds remind you of home?
Speaker 2: The horns, automobiles. Because that was the same that frightened all of us when we were growing up. Because we didn't see automobiles, only when someone came from the city. So we got to know the different sounds of different automobiles. The sound of a Ford was different than the sound of a Chevrolet.
Speaker 1: And, what sights remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well whenever I'm out in the open like in a park, it carries my mind back to the days of open fields when we had to plow. And cut corn, shuck up corn and so on.  We didn't have any cotton in our day.
Story_ID: 15784
Speaker 1: What was life like growing up in a family with so many brothers?
Speaker 2: Well, we had to--accept the rearranged clothing from the brother that was older. And sometimes we were not able to--my mother was not able to find the kind of patch that could match the suit that the former brother had used and it worn a hole in it. So we had to--I would have to accept the patch in spite of whatever it was. And be satisfied with it and she would always say,"Some day son, you'll be able to buy your own clothes. But just wear these now because they're clean, and you have to go to school."
Story_ID: 15785
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of your teachers from elementary school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Mrs. Emma Travis was one.  Ms. Martha Lewis was the second one in elementary school.  I can't remember the others.
Speaker 1: And what type of student were you in elementary school at Levenwood?
Speaker 2: Well, I was mischevious. I got in a lot of trouble because of--I supposed the restlessness that's in me getting ahead and the fact that our books were marked up because of whites that used them. And just wondering what was up the road for black students and why we should go to school. There were no jobs in the city--in the county for blacks, other than on the farm.
Story_ID: 15786
Speaker 1: Did you interact with whites much growing up?
Speaker 2: No.  We were out in the area where there were no whites. Back Creek, it was no, no whites. They came in to bring food, like shellfish, things of that nature. But--they went out. We'd interact at the store when we went to buy molasses at ten cents a jar, and sometimes we had no food on the weekend and the stores were closed in those days, but they knew my father and so we could go to the kitchen door of the owner of the store and he would go in the store and get a loaf of bread for us to have for Sunday.
Story_ID: 15787
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about--during elementary school years, did you have dreams and aspirations? What did you want to be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Well, I wanted to be a minister or a leader of some kind.
Speaker 1: You did from a very early age?
Speaker 2: Yeah. But ministers in those days in the country, were not role models and that, as my father used to say, you won't make any money.  You won't make a good living if you want to be a preacher here because these pastors here, you get five dollars a week and some of them have two churches and some of them have four churches and some have five.  And it wasn't much of an inspiration to me.  But I didn't want to be anything else except to be a lawyer and he told me, he said "Well you can't practice law here, can you?  We've got one lawyer here, T.C. [Thomas Calhoun] Walker, and he can't practice before the bar because he's black." So there was nothing left.  I mean we went to revert back to my desire to be a missionary, to go to Africa. But I got hold of Booker T. Washington's book on his life ['Up From Slavery'], a small book, and I took his life as a pattern.  He washed dishes at Hampton Institute [Hampton, Virginia], and so when I went to Richmond [Virginia], I got a job washing dishes.
Speaker 1: Why was it that you went to Richmond?
Speaker 2: Well I went Richmond to go to Virginia Union University [Richmond, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Oh, this was after high school.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 15788
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your family's experiences in church. What was the name of the church you all attended?
Speaker 2: Union Zion Baptist Church in Ware Neck [Gloucester County, Virginia].  In that community, there were two black churches. One was Republican, the other was Democrat.
Speaker 1: The churches were?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  One was the descendents of slaves who were dark skinned.  The other were descendents of slaves who were brown skinned.  And the way it used to be in those days in the South, the light skinned descendents of slaves would sit on one side of the church, the dark skinned on the other.  So in our community, the dark skinned descendents of slaves belonged to the Ware Neck Baptist Church and the other group belonged to the Union Zion Baptist Church.  Of course now, that is all past. Ware Neck Baptist has been torn down and brought and added onto Union Zion.
Speaker 1: Was there a lot of interaction between light skinned darks--(correcting) blacks and dark skinned blacks growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Oh yes, yes.
Speaker 1: But on Sundays, there was a separation?
Speaker 2: No, most of the week also.  We had no problem getting work or getting money because the people, the little bit of white people who knew were we came from. And say "that's Tucker Wood's son. He's all right.  You can trust him. He has a good background." All that stuff. And--so the man who wanted to hire you, he said "Oh yeah, I remember Tucker Wood.  He came from that family down on the river.  Yeah, he has good background, he has good sense--he'll do well. It was that kind of thing. Blacks, a dark skinned fellow might go and seek the same job, but he wouldn't get it.  They said well he belongs on the farm.  Don't bring him in the household.  And I remember even after I finished high school, I came to Washington [D.C.] to look for a job, and a man told me, he said "You go down to the employment office, and you'll get a job today." I said "That's impossible, I just got here." He said "Do what I tell you."  I went down there and I sat and the group of boys, most of them were darker than I am. And the man called me and sent me down to the government building as a cafeteria worker.  So the man who told me to go said it's right there, employing only light skinned fellows in the cafeteria down there. And I worked there. There was discrimination.
Speaker 1: Did it create tension between light skinned blacks and dark skinned blacks?
Speaker 2: Yes.  People would say--the kids would say to us you're going to make it because you're brown skinned.  And--we have to step back.  And that has followed me all through life.
Speaker 1: How much of your success do you think is attributed to the fact that you're a light skinned African American?
Speaker 2: Well I was able to get into places--particularly when I started traveling.  They could not detect who I was.  And so I was never thought of as being a black.
Speaker 1: And growing up Reverend Wood, did you ever hear stories of blacks passing?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  I have relatives who passed.  I had a girlfriend who passed.  I don't know where she is now, but--she was part of a family out in Ware Neck, a second generation or maybe third generation. But anyhow, she's somewhere in New York City [New York] or somewhere if she's not dead.  She passed. And people would come from the city back to the black community who had passed. In the city?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And what was the attitude about passing?
Speaker 1: Well if we knew who it was, we would sort of frown on them because we couldn't change our complexion, neither the texture of our hair.  But some of them were born that way.  At Canal Elementary School, I had a student--I mean a classmate, a girl. She was sent to the country to live with her relatives. In those days if a woman had a baby out of wedlock in the city--excuse me--they were sent down to the country to grow up.  And--it was a couple of them, a girl and a boy that they sent down there to grow up. They all had curly hair and we used to envy them because we wondered why we didn't have curly hair and we found out that they had curly hair because their parents, their father was a Jew or Italian or something of that nature, and--he was--the children were light complected. We called them 'Jew boys' and--a lot of things. We'd go home and ask our parents, why are we like this and she's like that?
Speaker 2: And what do you think it was like for the dark skinned children? What was it like for them?
Speaker 1: Oh it was worse then. And it wasn't until someone like Booker T. Washington, Robert Russa Moten, who became president of Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskeegee, Alabama] came to our community and began to travel around the churches there and he had the broad nose and big head. He was black, to say to us, it does not matter what color you are, it's what's in your head.
Speaker 2: And even your namesake is dark-skinned.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Did you still admire him in the same way even though he was dark-skinned?
Speaker 1: Who?
Speaker 2: Marcus Garvey.
Speaker 1: Oh, no.  Well, it was a long time before I knew who he was, that he was a Jamaican and he's trying to solve the racial problem after slavery, they say.  Well, it's best to get back to Africa.
Speaker 2: Were you disappointed when you found out he was dark skinned, like when you saw a picture of him for the first time?
Speaker 1: No.  I said I knew that--well I always thought Jamaicans were dark skinned until I went there.
Story_ID: 15789
Speaker 1: What was the name of the high school you attended?
Speaker 2: --Gloucester High School [Gloucester, Virginia]
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like? What was the white high school called?
Speaker 2: Botetourt [High School, Gloucester,Virginia]
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like at Gloucester High School?
Speaker 2: Well, we were in private classrooms by that time.  And--but we had to ride a private bus thirteen miles to school.  The state had not taken over the transportation for the blacks.
Speaker 1: How did your parents afford the bus?
Speaker 2: Well, my father being a carpenter and his wife was the bus owner's sister and the bus owner had a narrow bus and he wanted to widen it out. So my father, a carpenter, and a couple of others cut the bus in half and opened it up and put another seat down the middle, row down the middle.  My father did that and asked whatever it cost for the owner to take it out to let his children ride until they rode out the amount of the cost.  So we were paid as a result of my father's skill and time in building the bus and widening out the bus.
Speaker 1: Were there some kids who couldn't go to high school because their parents--did they have to walk the thirteen miles?
Speaker 2: No. They could--wanted to go if their parents had money. But when the bus broke down, we walked the thirteen miles. Everybody who wanted to go to school walked the thirteen miles.
Speaker 1: But there were some kids who walked regardless because they couldn't afford the bus?
Speaker 2: If they lived near there, maybe five miles away, they walked--and then some just dropped out because they can't get a job here. But if we had--if the family had people in Baltimore [Maryland] or Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] or Washington [D.C.] where they could come and stay with, they would--leave and come to those cities and finish their school, although they may have to take a cut in grade, but they would finish school.
Speaker 1: And let's talk a little bit about your high school years. What were some of the activities you were involved in as a teenager in high school?
Speaker 2: Well I was always involved in some kind of dramatic club.  I loved playing somebody else's part and--I loved dramatics.  And debating.  I loved the arguments.
Story_ID: 15790
Speaker 1: During your high school years [Gloucester High School, Gloucester, Virginia], what were your dreams and aspirations? Were you still aspiring to become a minister?
Speaker 2: Yes in spite of the--the future which was not bright at all for someone in getting the ministry.  But I would certainly do it and was there during my high school days that I--or my last year in high school that I asked the local church to permit me to preach for my license.
Speaker 1: This was at Mount Zion?
Speaker 2: Not Mount Zion.  Union Zion.
Speaker 1: Union Zion. So you're senior year in high school, do you like preach your trial sermon? How did that go?
Speaker 2: Well, such as it was, the congregation accepted it and then thought that they saw in me certain skills that I could use as a leader and a minister.  I had been president of the Hi-Y Club in high school and the 4-H Club in the community.  So I had--demonstrated skills.
Speaker 1: What did your father [Frank Tucker Wood] think when you preached your trial sermon?
Speaker 2: Oh he was very delighted and my mother--because in those days, if you had a child who had felt the Lord had called to preach, that was an honor. Plus the fact that my grandfather he said was a local preacher, and they thought that his spirit had fallen on me.
Story_ID: 15791
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from Gloucester [High School, Gloucester, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: 1937.
Speaker 1: And so when you were in high school, what were some of your thoughts about college?
Speaker 2: Well, if I were going to become a minister, I had to think about Virginia Union University or Virginia Seminary College. There was no thought of going to a white school--.
Speaker 1: Did you know you were going to college though?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did you want to go to college?
Speaker 2: I wanted to go, but there were no funds.  My father [Frank Tucker Wood]--by this time, we had entered into a Depression. This was back in the 30s [1930s] that entered into a Depression where my father did not work every day. And the fact that they--WPA was hiring veterans and the man who my father worked with--Que Willis (ph.) went up with his papers to the courthouse to say "I'm a veteran fully discharged and I want a job."  But there were no jobs for black veterans.  And we were wondering why my father was not a veteran, but when he came along, they were not drafting.
Story_ID: 15792
Speaker 1: When you graduated from high school, you left Gloucester and went to Richmond to go to Virginia Union [University, Richmond, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Well I left Gloucester. I asked my father for two dollars and I told him that I was going to Richmond [Virginia], I needed bus fare, sixty five cents. So I got someone in the neighborhood to take me to the courthouse to catch the bus and I gave him a quarter, give him a gallon of gas.  I rode the bus and got off in Richmond and I walked from the bus station up to the college. It was on a Saturday afternoon. I went to the back door of the president's house after I found out where he lived.  And I found out he was a white president and I knocked at his back door.  He came, and I told him who I was and where I was from, and I wanted an education. I wanted to become a minister.  But I didn't want to be a jack-leg  minister, I wanted an education. And my parents did not have the funds. So he says well this school isn't for a type of boy like you. I can't do anything right now but you go over to the dormitory and sleep tonight in the big chair over there in the back lounge.  So in those days, everything's open.  You could sleep anywhere.  Nobody bothered you.  So I went over and I slept that night, and--I went to Mr. Davis's office the next day where he told me to go. Mr. Davis told me the only job he had available was a boy to help in the boarding house, a white boarding house. He said now, "You'll get your meals."  And when I got there, the lady said "Well, you'll have to stay downstairs in the basement by the furnace.  I put you a cot down there, because I can't let you sleep upstairs where the white boys are. They're going to the University of Virginia, so you can't sleep up there. And I want you to wait on the tables so you have to be up early in the morning and serve these boys breakfast.  You can go on to school, but you've got to be back here by 4:00 [p.m.] to set the tables for dinner.  So with that, I went to Virginia Union for a semester.  And that job closed down and the boys went home. So next semester they sent me over on Chayman (ph.) Avenue to take care of the lawn and all of those chores around another lady's house. And here again, I had to sleep in the basement.  The coal--the gas from the coal burning was getting in my nose and my throat and everything. And I'm sleeping by the furnace.  So, the day after I had worked a week, she said I don't have any money for you because I'm selling cassettes to women and they don't have any money, but they promised to pay me next week, and if you work another week.  Well food was important and shelter, so I stayed there another week. Then I met a fellow who was an Arab who sold products in his wagon, and he asked me to join him.
Speaker 1: He set up fruits and vegetables?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So I went around with him one day and it wasn't a good day so I didn't get very much.  And then I went to the streets.  I slept in railroad stations.  I had no money, didn't know anybody to borrow anything from. Scared to write home, I knew it wasn't nothing there. And--once in awhile, while I was going through this, my mother sent me a jar of fruit and put a dime--two dimes in there, and said "You can buy some bread with this."  And bread and fruit together makes a good meal. Then you pour water in the jar after you eat halfway down.  You pour water in the jar and you bring it back up, and then you get another dime, you get a loaf of bread for a nickel, so you could survive. And I slept on the streets, in the Broadway Street station, that was one of my nights.  Then the police would chase the fellows out. And then the President of the United States said to the railroads let the homeless ride if they think they can get a job in the next town.
Speaker 1: So how long were you in Richmond?
Speaker 2: About a year or more.  And I went to a Greek restaurant, and he told me I could work there, but he had no money for me.  He said he'd get your meals, but you'd have to work.  He said why don't you wash the dishes, because the Greeks were trying to get on their feet. Anyhow, they paid me two dollars a week, and I was sleeping in different railroad stations and bus stations until the fellows would put paste around the shoe and set it on fire and run.  And you would have a hot foot when you wake up. So I stopped going to the bus station. They were segregated anyhow.  So anyhow I took the two dollars and bought a white suit of clothes, gabardine suit and dressed up and went back home as if nothing had ever happened.  And I was looking sharp with the white shoes.  And this white gabardine suit. And I had lost hope.
Speaker 1: And then what happened when you got home?
Speaker 2: Well everybody was glad to see me. They said boy, you went away from home, but you're back.  I said yes, but I don't know what I'm going to do from here.
Speaker 1: And so what--how did it come about that you came to Baltimore [Maryland] ?  You met with your aunt--you came to visit an aunt in Baltimore?
Speaker 2: No.  I--I went to my aunt's and uncle's that I had never met came to Virginia, and one of them was near my age who had just married, and I asked him if he would take me to Baltimore--I mean to Philadelphia. And --on our way to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], I got robbed. All of my clothes were taken out of his car. He stopped in Baltimore overnight.  In those days, you couldn't drive straight through.
Story_ID: 15793
Speaker 1: You were on your way to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and--you get robbed in Baltimore [Maryland]. So you go back home to Gloucester [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I continued to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and my aunt and uncles are--stay close because they felt that they were responsible. In those days you had a trunk on the back of the car, not like they have today.  It just hung on the back, and they--stole my clothes.
Speaker 1: So you were in Philadelphia.  And how do you get back to Gloucester from there?
Speaker 2: Well, my aunt gave me some money to get a bus ticket back to Gloucester. I went to Philadelphia under the assumption that I was going to Gammon [Theological] Seminary in Atlanta [Georgia].  And I had not applied, I didn't know where it was, I didn't never--I had heard of it, but everywhere people would ask "Are you going to be a minister?  Where are you going for training?"  I said "I'm on my way to Georgia, Gammon Seminary."  Okay.  But finally I had to tell them that I had to go back home.  I had nothing.
Speaker 1: And so what happened when you got back to Gloucester?
Speaker 2: I never did get there.  I got as far as Baltimore here and the bus broke down. And I came up to my aunt's house over across the street here.  And she said now, I don't have nobody here with me.  And I take in a lot of borders from the "Y" [YMCA] because whites--because blacks could not stay in hotels in Baltimore. So they would go to the Y and the Y would send them up to her house, the YMCA.  I [sic, She] said now if you would help me, there is a college out here called Morgan College [now Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland]. It's a Methodist school, and if you would help to clean the house, wash the clothes, wash the steps and all that, then I think you can make it here.  So when she took me to Enon [Baptist] Church [Baltimore, Maryland] where I had heard the pastor speak down at my home during the revival time, and he said to me, "I don't have anybody with me, and I would like to have you here.  Maybe to teach Sunday school or something."  I said because I have one year at [Virginia] Union, one time at Union.  So then I met some people from my home, and they told of my background and my parents and so on.  And I--decided I would do it day by day. I had no money, and he took me--he took me to Morgan to register there. And he forgot me. In those days, you only had one car in the family, so the wife--his wife had gotten him to take her somewhere, and he forgot all about me.  So I had to walk from Morgan College back in the city asking people as I traveled, walked along, "How do I get to Moses Street, how do I get to here?"  Because I didn't know anything about the city. And I found myself in Druid Hill Park and inquire how do I got out of this park to Druid Hill Avenue. Then I registered at the school for ten dollars and applied for a scholarship for ten dollars a month. And the school granted me permission to register on the grounds that I would get a scholarship under the [sic] NRA program.
Speaker 1: What was the NRA program?
Speaker 2: National Youth Administration--(correcting) NYA. Well they found out that I was from Virginia and the scholarship was for students at Morgan--Maryland. I was cleaning the Holmes [Hall] building after school.  I had no books so I became friendly with the librarian and she permitted me to put the books in the stacks that the professors were using. So I would go back there in my spare time and study. And then the custodian who was very much concerned about my welfare, he would bring me part the way in town after I helped him clean the library. And then I walked the rest of the way, sometimes stopping at my cousin's and they would give me dinner. And I did that for two weeks--two years at Morgan. In 1939 to 1940-1941. Something like that.  Then I was drafted in the Army and they found out I was a minister, and they wouldn't have a black chaplain in the Army.  So they exempted me from the Army.
Speaker 1: They exempted you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 15794
Speaker 1: Can you kind of tell us a little bit about what Baltimore [Maryland] was like in the 1940s?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was just like Virginia.  Practically segregated.
Speaker 1: But was it as segregated as Virginia and as segregated as the Virginia that you knew?
Speaker 2: Because you couldn't go in the stores here and buy what you wanted to. A few stores would let you go in the basement.  Or if you had a chauffeur's cap on, you could go in the stores if you were buying something for your boss.
Speaker 1: Were you--was it one of the first times you were introduced to some more prominent African Americans, or how did you experience that in Virginia because Baltimore at that time was home to some very prominent African Americans who were professors and doctors and that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't introduced to them at that time, other than the ministers around and the staff at Morgan [College, now Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland]. But when I came back here, I was called to the church. Then I begin to--which Baltimore was segregated then when I came back in 1952.
Story_ID: 15795
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about, I think 1946, when you went to West Virginia, right? You were serving as the pastor of Wainwright Baptist Church and Zion Baptist Church [Charlestown, West Virginia].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So tell us a little about how that opportunity came about.
Speaker 2: Well I was--eating dinner with a lady and her family, and one of the persons who came in and said--I was introduced as Reverend, said we haven't had a pastor in our town in West Virginia for several months, maybe a couple of years.  Will you come over and preach for us?  I had never heard of West Virginia and didn't know how to get there.  But--I jumped at it and I said I'll get over there some way or another. So I drove over there, and she said you come to Hagerstown [West Virginia] and my husband is pastor there and I want to introduce you to the congregation. So I drove to Hagerstown.  Picked her up and went on to Charlestown, which is just across the mountain.  And it was exciting to me.  And I preached there and I came back and I--they invited me to come back and preach.  And to my surprise, in January 1946, they called me pastor.
Speaker 1: And so that was your first official job as head pastor of a church?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And did you feel like finally, 'this is all--everything that I've been through has been worth it'.  Did you feel like it at that point?
Speaker 2: Well yes, and I felt as though God has led me through the other experiences to bring me up to this.  As--and I have been here with Dr. Payne at Enon Baptist Church [Baltimore, Maryland] while I was going to Morgan, so I had some background.  And they didn't have anything, they just needed leadership.  And they told me that I had to also serve a church out in the country which was Mt. Zion Baptist.
Speaker 1: Did that remind you of home?
Speaker 2: Yes. And I discovered the culture there was very much like the culture at--where I grew up except for the fact that there was--Charlestown was a city, town.  Paved streets--whereas my home did not have paved streets.
Speaker 1: And Reverend Wood, had you found that--churches in other areas were as segregated as--the churches that you had grown up in Gloucester [Virginia] , in terms of the black community?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What--you were finding that in other places as well, but there was segregation among African Americans like darks on one side, lights on the other.
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't very much that way in West Virginia--because the population had shifted. I found thirteen members in the church out in Johnstown.  They came to church at night or in the afternoon because after they fed the cattle, and the sharecropping community.  And I discovered that in Charlestown, West Virginia, the church's goodest attendance was at night.  Whereas in Baltimore [Maryland], it was in the morning, and a few people at night. But it was strange to me that that church was filled at night, and I found out because those people were sharecroppers.
Speaker 1: But were they still as segregated as your home town?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: They were, in terms of not white and black but segregation among the African Americans?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You mean in Baltimore?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So there were churches during that time in Baltimore where only dark-skinned African Americans attended?
Speaker 2: Well yes.  Not distinctly as was in the early days.  We're talking about twenty-five or thirty years later. And where Baltimore was a melting pot of all the groups--racial groups, and color groups and so on. As in your local community, these people were fixed, too. They stayed there until they died, see?  But when you came to the cities, you were sort of mixed up and when you went to New York, you were mixed up even more, because it was New York.
Story_ID: 15796
Speaker 1: While you were in West Virginia, you met your wife?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little about how you all met?
Speaker 2: Well we met when she came to the service, and we met that way.
Speaker 1: And you were also going to school too at Storer Hall?
Speaker 2: Storer College [Harpers Ferry, West Virginia].
Speaker 1: And--earned your degree.  Finished your degree there.
Speaker 2: Yes.  My AB degree.
Speaker 1: Or your BA degree.  Your Bachelor of Arts.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 15797
Speaker 1: You get another teaching--another opportunity as a pastor in New Jersey in 1949. Can you tell us a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: Well when I graduated from Storer College [Harpers Ferry, West Virginia], I wanted to teach in the school system in West Virginia.  But at that time, they had raised the standard to you could not teach with two years of college. You had to have four years of college.  Well now I had four years of college, but there were no openings. The man who took my job graduated a year ahead of me, and there was only one position open in the town for a history teacher.
Speaker 1: So did you get your degree in history?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So he--he took my job.
Speaker 1: So how did the opportunity come about in New Jersey to pastor the Bethlehem Baptist Church in [Woodbury] New Jersey?
Speaker 2: Well, let me go back a point.  When I graduated from Storer, I wanted this job as to teach so that I could stay in West Virginia and I was hoping I'd get the job as head of Department of Personal Education at Storer, see.  But I went to a conference in--Maryland. We went to Maryland that summer, and I met a long-lost cousin, and he said "What are you doing?" And I said "I just graduated from Storer College."  He says "I've got two jobs that pay three thousand dollars a year at two colleges, but you must have a seminary degree." And I said to him, his name was Sam Proctor. I said, "I haven't been to seminary and I applied for seminary in Washington [D.C.], but they're not taking blacks." He said I can get you a seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania. I said well, but I don't have anything and I have nomoney--two small churches.  So he said what do you have?  I said I have a car.  He said go home and sell it.  And ride the train to Pennsylvania. So I went home and told my wife about it.  And I sold my car.  I applied to Crozer [Theological Seminary, Chester, Pennsylvania].  He went on to Crozer and he--told Crozer about me. Well the man wrote and said we need so many black students this year to make up our student body and we will accept you if you have a B average from college.  So I did.  I sold my car and began to ride the train to the seminary, to see what it was all about. And I discovered eleven of us black students.  And among the eleven black students was [Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] from Atlanta [Georgia]. And [Walter R.] McCall from Atlanta.  And the rest of then were white. So we were elated over the fact that we had come out of segregation into what was the kingdom of--a sample of the kingdom of God, where you had white maids, a German cook and all white professors.  And this took place overnight.
Speaker 1: This was in 1951 [sic, autumn of 1948.].
Speaker 2: Yes. [sic] Took place overnight and King was excited.  McCall was excited.  I was excited although West Virginia was a little more open then Georgia. And then I contacted the dean of the seminary to ask if there were churches vacant in that are. And one of the black students who had been there longer than I had, he showed me a list of churches that were vacant, and he gave me the ones that he wanted me to have. And I memorized the ones that he didn't give me, and I discovered later why.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: The ones that he wanted me to have were small churches.  And the ones he didn't want me to have were larger churches. So I decided to go to Woodbury [New Jersey] and see what that church was like and I found it was larger than what I had in West Virginia. And the members asked me to come back to preach. And so I got the students to drive.  King and the rest of them, we drove over to New Jersey to hear me preach at this church. Anyhow, this church call me after they sent an investigating team down to Charlestown, and therefore I moved from there to New Jersey.
Speaker 1: And you were still going to school at the same time?
Speaker 2: Still going to the seminary.
Story_ID: 15798
Speaker 1: One of the things I want to ask you about is your experience with Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] at seminary [Crozer Theological Seminary, Chester, Pennsylvania].  Tell us a little bit about his relationship with the German cook's daughter.
Speaker 2: Well, King was in heaven as far as you say. Leaving Georgia one day, and sitting at a table with whites that evening.  Whites who were from Georgia. King and [Walter R.] McCall was from Georgia, but he was black.  But Hall was  from Georgia and he was white. He was a red faced fellow. I was nine years older than King and some of the others. So we were all rejoicing over where God had brought us to the North, and we were going to study liberal theology and we were going to become socialists.  So one night, King went into town and when he came back, all of his bed clothes were taken and put somewhere in the building.  They did that in college, they did it there. They do it everywhere. That's what they call 'stacking rooms'. Anyhow, McCall called this white fellow, and asked if King had did this or had taken part in it.
Speaker 1: Who's clothes were missing?  Hall's clothes?
Speaker 2: Hall's clothes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a white majority.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They just carried them down in the basement.  They had done--they put a bucket of water over my door and when I opened it, it just came down on me.  But I didn't pay that any mind. But anyhow, he'd asked King did it.  So he went to King's room with a pistol.
Speaker 1: This was in seminary school?
Speaker 2: Yeah. He went to King's room with a pistol.  I had went to King's room for something because King lived on the second floor and I lived on the third, my wife and I lived up there.  And when I opened the door, I saw Hall facing King. And when I looked around, he had the gun in King's chest and said, "I'm going to kill you."  And I got between them and being older then both of them, I sort of mellowed them down. "No, you can't do this, this is not the thing."  Well Hall went back upstairs. Then it was reported to the Dean who called the student body together and said there will be no more stacking of rooms because one of our students was about to be killed if an older student had not intervened.
Speaker 1: So how did Dr. King become involved with the cook's daughter?
Speaker 2: Because she was white.  She lived across the street in the house, across the campus.  And for the first time in his life, he could go over to a white person's house, I suppose, and sit down and talk with his daughter.
Speaker 1: Was it a serious relationship?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was serious.  And we all told him to get away. That if you marry this girl, you can not go back South. They'll hang you on the highest hill. And drop the relationship. But he paid us no mind. He was just carried away.  His father had money, sent him a check. He came with a checkbook because I seen him write checks.  And--
Speaker 1: So he didn't have to work but--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I had to wait tables and pastor church. So he was --fascinated with this white girl. She was pretty as pretty could be. So then a senior pastor there, Reverend Barber, in Chester [Pennsylvania], he was--he knew King's father [Martin Luther King Sr.]. He got after King about going with this girl.  And King paid him no mind. So finally two or three of the other students got on him and sat down and talked with him. "You cannot afford to marry this girl, because you will never be able to go back home." And in those days, if you rode down the highway with a white girl, you were subject to be lynched.  And then--well this was before the civil rights struggle. But King continued until finally when he graduated, he decided to break off. And he went to Boston [Massachusetts] and I was later [in 1952] called to the church in Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 1: And was it a very serious relationship and was it known throughout the campus?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was known.  Because the girl lived with the mother right across the campus. She was a German.
Speaker 1: Was she younger or was she about his age?
Speaker 2: She was his age.
Speaker 1: And how did her parents receive it?
Speaker 2: I don't know whether--because I was never over there. Whether it was her mother and father, I don't know. But the seminary provided a place for the summer staff so they would be there to prepare food for us in the morning.  And so King went over.  One night King went into town with a white student, I forget his name, to an Italian restaurant and when they brought the plates, the two student plates, they had put sand in the food. And when they started eating, they knew it wasn't salt. What they found was sand, because King and this white student there. This was in Pennsylvania where we were.
Speaker 1: How was the group received by the white student on campus?
Speaker 2: --Some of them were sort of cold towards us because the school took in eleven black students at one time. They'd always have one for several years.  But now they had several, eleven.  And some of them did not like it.  You see the school had said well, we're going to try to round up to build our student body. The president wanted to build a student body to satisfy the trustees and so on and so on, and so he reached out and got eleven of us.
Speaker 1: Were there specific racial incidents you can remember?
Speaker 2: At the school?
Speaker 1: -hmm.
Speaker 2: No.  Other than this one.
Speaker 1: Just the one--
Speaker 2: Just, you weren't well received by some of the white students?
Speaker 1: Yes. And some of the white students had churches, so we went out on weekends like myself.  I rode the train back from West Virginia. And there was a white lady in our class who rode the train all the way to Charleston because her husband died, she took over the church.  But we had no other problems in there.
Story_ID: 15799
Speaker 1: While at Crozer [Theological Seminary, Chester, Pennsylvania], was Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], emerging as the leader that he eventually would become in the African American community?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We saw--we black students saw the issue at hand, and we made him the president of the student council, which was objected to by some of the white students. They never had a black man to be president of the student body.  But there were eleven of us there so they went along with King.  And he presided over the body very well.
Speaker 1: And--did he talk a lot about--civil rights and what he'd like to do about it--to make change, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, he thought of himself to someday become a martyr.
Speaker 1: He did?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And he was going back South, and was going to change the South. Of course we who were from the South would say man, you'll never do that. They'll hang you as soon as you get back.
Speaker 1: And--you know, we had talked a little bit earlier. You said that he didn't have to work, his father [Martin Luther King Sr.] sent him money. He had a checkbook. Was some of the other black students ever resentful of that?
Speaker 2: McCall was, from Georgia.  He knew King.
Speaker 1: Before they came to the seminary?
Speaker 2: Yeah. And--he served as a barber who cut hair at the campus.  King didn't have to do anything but read.  Anytime you entered his room, he was reading books, mainly books of people who had tried to change the system in which they lived.
Speaker 1: People like [Mohandas K.] Gandhi?
Speaker 2: Yes. And because after the seminary, he went to India.  But we read about Gandhi, they sell books that they put on the read list.  Amos, Israel.
Speaker 1: You were going to mention an incident with McCall?  You said he served as the barber?
Speaker 2: He served as a barber, naturally.  Here is King writing checks and he has to cut hair. And he also had arthritis, and that colored his personality.  And here's King over here from Georgia, going to see a white girl, he didn't have that privilege. So he and King did not get along well.  He thought, even after the civil rights movement started, he thought that King was not the person to do all that he was going to do and he was going to fail.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about--just in terms of Dr. King.  What was he like as--you know, a young man, because we really don't know a lot about him before that time.  Was he very studious? Did he spend a lot of his time studying?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  He was very--and he had skipped some classes down south before coming. And then his father was a Baptist preacher.  King grew up in that culture. But then he wanted to do just the opposite. So where his father was a fundamentalist in theology, he came to Crozer to be a liberal. And the major difference is the fact that a fundamentalist takes every dot and 'T' of the Bible for reality.  The liberal applies the scientific approach and say that you have to allow for time, changes, the stages in which the Bible passed and so on.  And you have to be willing to accept the fact that the values are still there, but the interpretation may be different.
Speaker 1: And that's the method that you all were taught at Crozer?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And you all--called Dr. King 'Mike'?
Speaker 2: Yes. He came out of Georgia with that title. [Both King and his father were originally named "Michael " and later changed to "Martin Luther"] Because we didn't know each other, the eleven students didn't know each other until we got to the campus.  And--that's what McCall and all them called him. And see on weekends, because his father knew so many preachers, he would go out and preach at different churches. Well McCall didn't have that privilege and I had to go back to my two churches in West Virginia. One was paying me six dollars every month, and the other one was paying me fifty dollars a week. I had to go back and serve them until I could find a church in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: And when Dr. King came out and preached on the weekends, he'd--come back sometimes with pocket change.
Speaker 2: A pocket full of change. Because in those days, they didn't pay you in checks. Dollar bills were not plentiful in churches, see (laughs).  People would drop a quarter in the plate and so on and you may come back with ten dollars or twenty dollars or something like that. And he was always the man who had some change in his pocket on Monday morning.
Speaker 1: And what did change in your pocket represent back in those days?
Speaker 2: Rich.  You had money.  You could go somewhere.  You could buy something.  Because a lot of people didn't have change.
Story_ID: 15800
Speaker 1: You received your degree [from Crozer Theological Seminary, Chester, Pennsylvania]--your divinity degree in 1951, and in 1952, you ended up back in Baltimore [Maryland], kind of where it all started.
Speaker 2: It all started, yes.
Speaker 1: How did you end up back in Baltimore?
Speaker 2: Well, I learned that--Providence Baptist Church was  looking for a pastor because their pastor, Reverend White, had entered the senile category they called it at that time.  And the church was hearing pastors and my aunt turned in my name.
Speaker 1: Your same aunt who you lived with?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And lived with--turned in my name. So they invited me to preach, and there were several that they invited to preach.  I went back to New Jersey because in all of these relationships from the Baptist church, you've got to keep things secret.  So I paid no mind about it, and--I got another letter from them, saying will you come back and preach? So I came back and I preached that Sunday. And then I got a call--they had a meeting, and they selected me as pastor. Well then I couldn't keep it any longer.  I had to come back here and get the key to the church so I would feel that I had the job.  Then I had to go back and inform the church that after three years and had built the parsonage, and I was to come to Baltimore.
Speaker 1: But this was a good opportunity for you because it was a bigger church?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: A bigger city.
Speaker 2: And then after being there five years, I resigned.
Speaker 1: And why did you resign?  You had gotten another opportunity. Why? What was that opportunity?
Speaker 2: --National Church Secretary for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].
Speaker 1: And why did you think--I know that it was a difficult decision, but--how did you make the decision that you thought you would take the job at the NAACP?
Speaker 2: Well, we had then--by that time, we had entered the civil rights--phase of the civil rights.  And there was a rift between [Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and the president of [the NAACP]--Roy Wilkins.  The NAACP was going by the way of the courts and King was going by the way of non violence.  And it seems as though he was making more headway than the NAACP was. So the man who was in charge of the churches of the NAACP, resigned.  And they discovered that King and I were classmates, so they thought that I could bridge that gap between them.  Now I was going to take that job just for about four or five years, and to land in a church somewhere in California or New York or anywhere.  I hadn't planned to stay here.
Speaker 1: And how were you convinced otherwise--you had tendered a letter of resignation--you had written a letter of resignation. And why did you decide to stay here at Providence Baptist Church [Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Well I was pressured on all sides.  My family, my mother [Julia Fances Wood], my father [Frank Tucker Wood].  And people who knew me as the years had gone by and whatnot. I was pressured to stay. And the fact that the glory around being a national president, you see--they said it would not last forever.  Some of the older people.  And they said you shouldn't give up your church.  Well I couldn't see that.  I was going to another church, bigger church. So finally I decided to call a meeting to get my resignation through, but they said nothing in the meeting.  And I couldn't get a vote. And I called another meeting to see if I could get a vote. And I decided myself if I can not get a vote, then whatever I do--feel to do before I adjourn the meeting, that's what I'll do. And the feeling came over me to tear up my resignation.  And that's why I only have a small piece of it in the frame on my desk.
Speaker 1: And--but nonetheless, you were still very involved in civil rights and civil right issues?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You continued to be involved in it just from your church?
Speaker 2: Yes.

Speaker 1: When Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated in 1968, he was actually scheduled to come to your church to preach--a couple of months after he was assassinated. Can you just tell us a little bit about that and what your reaction was when you had gotten word?
Speaker 2: Well I was shocked to hear that although I had been expecting it as long--along with a lot of other people. Because you all had even talked about that in seminary school, when you talked about some of the changes he wanted to make.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Being a martyr.  Someday he's going to be a martyr to course like Gandhi and the others--some of the others who became martyrs in the Old Testament times and so on. And --I did not bother him while he was raging because I wanted him to stay out on the scene.  I knew my position. I had the position of the church.  But then I thought that by now, he's been out there long enough now.  I was inviting him to preach, of which he decided to come.  But his life was taken. And then when the fires broke out in the city here, I then went out to try to bring some peace to the people who were burning down businesses.
Speaker 2: Do you remember what that was like?
Speaker 1: It was awful.
Speaker 2: The riot.
Speaker 1: I was living at a--Sutton Place down the street here [Baltimore, Maryland], high rise building, and I could stand up on the 6th floor and go up to the 16th floor and watch the fires all over. And I went to the city taking pictures, making slides of the burning and so forth. It was an awful experience.
Speaker 2: How did you help to send calm to the city?
Speaker 1: Well, a group of us ministers went on a walk to say don't do it this way.  Don't do it this way.  The man is dead now.  Settle everything after it's over, but don't destroy your livelihood.
Speaker 2: And did you have a sense of personal loss because you all were friends, and what was that personal loss like for you?
Speaker 1: Well, how much can I now invest in the movement?  Or what will the attitude of the people be in the movement?  Will they say, "I told you he was going to fail?"  And whether or not we should salvage what we could and then keep his dream alive.
Story_ID: 15802
Speaker 1: How well do you think we've done in terms of keeping his [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s] dream alive?
Speaker 2: Well, not as much as we should.  I've gone to many schools, and I find that some of the students won't even sit still to listen to me.  They can never understand why he was killed. No.  Somewhere in 'Look' magazine, you will find near the end of his life, there was a little regret on his part I'd say, that he had not accomplished what he thought he should have accomplished. You had little pockets of--for instance that the Deacons for Defense came up, saying everybody should arm himself, that non-violence is not the way. You've got to kill these people off.  And Martin sensed that the movement was failing and the people were losing interest in it. That's why he went to Memphis [Tennessee]. Excuse me. This was his last hope to say non-violence--a non-violent march is the answer.  So I knew that something was going to happen, but I didn't know what it was.  And of course now when you tell people about that, the young generation--and that's twenty-five or thirty years from that.  And the fact that I was a classmate of his.  I can tell you about him.  But they're not interested in him.  And that's what I can't understand.  I can tell you how his life was before his death and what legislation was passed, but that is not interesting to them. And that's why I bought a Karmann Ghia Volkswagen that's thirty years old to try to stimulate interest in this--in the march for his birthday.  And I will drive that--oh, I've been driving that for three year.  And the kids along the sidewalk, my sign shining on the side, Marcus Wood, classmate of Dr. King.  They are not impressed with that.  They want to know what kind of car is that?  They've never seen a Karmann Ghia Volkswagen.
Speaker 1: Is that disappointing for you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I wonder what they're teaching in the schools.  I mean yet when I would receive invitations to come to the schools, I would get a poor reception from the students.  I mean there's only two of us left of those eleven, eleven students [at Crozer Theological Seminary] and that's Reverend Whittaker in Virginia, in Norfolk and myself. The rest of them are dead.  So I thought it would be something of interest to them to say here comes a man who knew him, who sat in the classroom with him. Who slept in the same building.  You don't have that privilege though in every case, because there's only two of us left. But--that's the way it is.

Speaker 1: Why do you think that history is important?
Speaker 2: It's brought on because you need a record of what transpired in this world, and people who made a difference in some way or the other. I didn't have that to go on when I--there was one book called 'Negro History', Carter G.Woodson. That's all we had. And we developed Negro History Week somewhere in my travels from the first grade up.  Negro History wasn't included and we had some clippings. Well there was no newspapers back in the early days. My father subscribed to a good paper called 'Grit'. It came out once a week for five cents, and he could hardly take care of that.  And then at our school we had a weekly reader which was--we paid ten cents for that, and when I did get ten cents from working in the summer, I had a dollar a day for a man who lived across the road from us.  I would invest it in getting newspapers so I could really find out what's happening in the world.  There was no television or no radio back in those days.  Nothing.  We had nothing.
Story_ID: 15804
Speaker 1: When you look back at your life, what stands out the most to you and why?
Speaker 2: Well I--being a minister, and my beliefs in divine intervention, I believe that God led me through these experiences that you're speaking of so that someday when I become a pastor, I'll understand what homeless means.  I wouldn't turn my nose up at people who come here and want carfare, or come here and want food and now we run the food station. We also have a day care building which is next door that was built since I've been here.  And I believe that God was leading me through all these experiences to bring me up to where I'm at now, and I have built five buildings in my--in this phase.  But it all goes back to that beginning.  I sometimes sit down and think of the fact that when I was sleeping at a railroad station and washing dishes just for a meal in a Greek restaurant, and would not go back home because I was too proud. I didn't want the community to know that I had met with hard times.
Story_ID: 15805
Speaker 1: You published a book in 1998, 'And Grace Will Lead Me Home,' like a collection of your sermons and your life too. Why did you want to publish that book?
Speaker 2: Well, I wanted to leave something on record that people will see and people--the young people particularly,  that they do not come up by themselves.  You have to depend on other people and I wanted them to see the number of persons who are a part of me now, like Proctor and Harrison and Summerville, Lillie [Carroll] Jackson who's headed NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People][in Baltimore, Maryland], and others I've referred to as I could--remember I wanted to do it while I had my memory to do it.  And I wanted to leave some outlines for ministers, young ministers to jump off from, not to use, but to see how it's done.  I wanted to do some sermons that had history in them, like when I spoke to the nations, I spent a great deal of time researching the Masons, and I wanted to leave them an interpretation of [Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] that was delivered in one of my sermons. And then I wanted to share that at the beginning of my life, I was mashing up corn silk to put in my grandmother's pipe to smoke. And I learned the songs of the faith from her. She would sit in the house and rock and sing and I would pick up the words, see.  And then I wanted them to see that God leads you along the line that you don't know anything about. And sometimes when you're caught in situations, you don't quite understand why.  But one experience comes to lead you to another experience.
Story_ID: 15806
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, as a person who had much variety of experiences in life.  But still continues to go until the end to the extent that he stayed fifty years--fifty two years in one church [Providence Baptist Church, Baltimore, Maryland] with all of the hardships. I was sued twice here for a hundred thousand dollars, because there's some people who didn't want to see this building go up [Providence Baptist's new church building]. And I lived through that.  I moved the congregation to another church while I was rebuilding. And as a result, some people didn't go and they organized another church.
