Story_ID: 227836
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five People magazine-ish type questions that they ask me to ask and--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --they only take a few minutes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They're kind of a warm up.  First one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I love steaks.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Black.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Summer.
Speaker 1: Your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: The Caribbean.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No.  Not really.  I guess if I'm stroking my chin like this and looking like that that must mean I don't have one.  No I don't think so.  No, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Let's mull over this for a minute.  Because I would just guess that a radio personality would have a famous saying that they you know with all their fans will know them by.  It must be something and I'm searching my mind for something that you might have said that.  There's gotta be some kind of trademark expression or something.  If we can't think of it we can't but--
Speaker 2: I can't really think.  You know what I had--I mean I've had many over the years but not any one particular one stands out.  Nothing, there's not one particular that stands out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 227837
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We'll ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Calvin Douglas Banks, Sr.] side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Kathrine, K-A-T-H-R-I-N-E, White.  That was her maiden name.
Speaker 1: All right and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She--February 14, 1929.  I wanna say--wait a minute hold on I gotta--Demopolis, Demopolis, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do you spell Demopolis?
Speaker 2: I couldn't even begin to tell you.
Speaker 1: It's like the Greek.  Okay Demopolis, Alabama?
Speaker 2: Demopolis, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Now you know where Demopolis is near (unclear).
Speaker 2: I believe if I'm not mistaken it is--let's see I think that--I, I'm, I'm going back in, in time now and I'm trying to think.  I believe, I think it's near Birmingham [Alabama].  I, I believe it's near--yeah because my, my aunts and uncles had a store in Birmingham so yeah I think it was Birmingham.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And well, what do you know about your ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back first of all can you trace your ancestors on your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well I know that my grandmother [Colatta Satkins (ph.)] for instance was the youngest of nine, nine sisters, all sisters, one brother.  They all--my entire family came from Alabama, sharecroppers in Alabama.  My grandfather, my grandmother's husband, first husband which would be my mother's father, I don't know a lot about.  His name was Collier [ph.] and he died when I was very, very young when I was a baby so I don't know a lot about him.  But my, my grandmother moved my mother and her half-sister and a couple of cousins to Detroit [Michigan] in the '40s [1940s] and that's where my mother grew up until she went away to school and then that's where, where I grew up.  I was born in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], but raised in Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is almost fits a you know a pattern when we talk about migration, a lot of people from Alabama in Detroit.
Speaker 2: Oh sure.
Speaker 1: And Ohio period.  You know northern Ohio.
Speaker 2: And Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Cleveland [Ohio] and Detroit.
Speaker 2: Chicago yeah.
Speaker 1: Chicago's more Mississippi you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So it tends to be anyway.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But it's funny on the East Coast you have Georgia then you go up to New York [New York] and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And the Carolinas but that's, that's you can make sense of Alabama and Detroit.--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --But are there any stories in your family that are passed down from the 19th century, stories about slavery or Reconstruction or annals [ph.] or, or any of that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Not, not that I can remember.  It was--you know what I find that it was very interesting in my family growing up because my, my grandfather, we all called him granddaddy, he was actually not my grandfather but he was a cousin of mine's grandfather, we just call him granddaddy and he used to tell us some pretty incredible stories about when he was a boy growing up in Alabama and the kind of things he would have to do and you know being out in the, in the you know out in the field picking cotton and things like that and maybe one day out of the week a big treat was to come out of that field at an earlier part of the day and be able to take maybe not a half day or whole day off but just maybe a couple of hours.  But in those days a couple of hours of not having to be out there picking that cotton every day, having your fingers bleed, that two hours felt like a day you know what I mean.  So I learned at an early age about my heritage in terms of what my family had gone through in the early struggles, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 227838
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Kathrine White] talk about growing up in--I guess she grew up in both [Demopolis] Alabama and Detroit [Michigan], right?
Speaker 2: She basically grew up in Alabama.  Yeah, she, she would talk about it being a young girl and going to my, going to my cousin's store and getting penny candy and things like that with other kids and other friends, but basically she moved to Detroit--or I should say my mother was in her teens when she moved to Detroit and pretty, pretty--almost maybe a year or so after moving there went off to college.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay so she didn't spend a lot of time?
Speaker 2: No.  Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: She had a decent education in Alabama I suppose then?
Speaker 2: Yes she did.  Yeah, yeah, she, she, she did--had a very good education and of course went on to college and went to business school and things like that to further education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she graduated high school in Alabama?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And where did she go to college?
Speaker 2: It was a business college in Philadelphia [sic. Detroit, Michigan] and the name escapes.  I think it's Lewis Business College [Lewis College of Business]. I believe but I'm not sure.  I think it is Lewis though.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did she pursue business as a career?
Speaker 2: She worked for the Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan] for thirty years.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did she do like clerical work or something?
Speaker 2: She did.  She was actually the assistant.  In those days it was secretaries but she was the assistant to the general manager of the planning and development division for the Ford Mustang, for the Ford Terrano [sic.] and I can't think of the other car, the [Ford] Maverick, the Maverick, yeah.  So she was, she was the assistant to the director for that division--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at Ford headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, the Glass House as they call it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did she have any stories of growing up that she shared with you at all?
Speaker 2: Not really unh-uh.  I mean everything--you know what I guess when you look at today when you think about what our kids or the stories our kids have today compared to what those--those stories were always, those stories were always so positive, so filled with love and things like that but nothing that ever really stood out.  I mean you just knew that it was a good family.  A good solid family well provided for.  You know maybe you didn't have a whole lot but whatever they had they shared with all the other kids with their family.
Story_ID: 227839
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother [Kathrine White] and father [Calvin Douglas Banks, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: Well my mother and father met.  My mother was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and my father at the time was one of the directors for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] on the East Coast and that's where they met.  They met at the convention.  They met in 1956.  They were married in '57 [1957].  I was born in '58 [1958].
Story_ID: 227840
Speaker 1: Now can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Calvin C-A-L-V-I-N, Douglas, D-O-U-G-L-A-S, Banks, B-A-N-K-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So are you a junior officially?--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --I guess.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Officially anyway.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  Now what's your father's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of, oh my goodness, August 19, August 19, 1920--I'm a say 1924.
Speaker 1: Okay that'd make him eighty now--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --I guess around--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Just turned eighty.
Speaker 2: He's eighty.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And was he born in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Born and raised in Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well actually I take that back, born in Philadelphia; raised in Camden, New Jersey, which is just across the bridge so yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now what do you know about your father's side of the family, about the ancestors on that side?
Speaker 2: Well my father, my father is a historian.  I mean my father can sit you down and tell you everything that's ever happened, not only in his family but maybe the neighbor's family and other things like that.  My father grew up and he had five brothers.  Two of them actually became mayors, one in Camden, Camden, New Jersey and the other in Lyndhurst, New Jersey.  They were all hard workers.  His youngest brother is Billy [ph.].  There's my dad.  There's my dad, my dad's father Aldeen [ph.] uncle Aldeen [ph.].  He just recently died.  He was a postal worker in the City of Philadelphia.  So it was my, my father's brothers it was Aldeen [ph.], then there was my father Calvin.  My dad taught at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and he also was under the undersecretary of transportation for the [President Richard Milhous] Nixon administration.
Speaker 1: Okay, did he teach history at Howard?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He taught economics.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And he was in the Nixon administration?
Speaker 2: In the Nixon administration.
Speaker 1: Undersecretary of transportation?
Speaker 2: Yes yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A rarity but yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then there's my uncle Aaron [ph.].  And Uncle Aaron was a police officer.  Then my uncle Edwin [ph.] who also was a retired police officer and my uncle Billy, who is the youngest of them all, and he still is a sheriff in Camden in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Trooper.  Trooper.
Speaker 1: Well, that's quite a family in terms of what they were all able to do.
Speaker 2: All boys, no sisters and my nana, her name was Helen Blythe [ph.] she was just, I mean she was an anchor, she was a rock.  As I think you find most grandmothers normally are.  She was an amazing woman.  I mean she raised five boys virtually by herself and she was just the salt of the earth, she was a wonderful woman.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She's, so did she live with you all or does she live?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: No my parents were divorced when I was eight months old and she basically, she just took my mother [Kathrine White] in until my mother decided that Philadelphia was not where she wanted to stay, she wanted to move back to Detroit [Michigan]  where she could be with her family and raise me.  But every year I would go spend time with my grandmother in Camden because she was just, she was a joy.  She really was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Did your father talk about growing up at all?
Speaker 2: Not a lot.  My father and I have a rather strange relationship.  So we didn't see each other a lot.  And most times to be honest with you when we saw each other, the conversation was not a whole--it was not a lot of conversation at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the information what you know basically about that side of the family comes from your grandmother right?
Speaker 2: My grandmother, my uncles, my mother.
Story_ID: 227841
Speaker 1: Now you said before we started this conversation that you--that Hoyt [W.] Fuller is related to you right--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the late Hoyt Fuller?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: He was the editor of Black World [Negro Digest] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Editor of Black World magazine of the Johnson Publication [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois] family.  Yeah my Uncle Hoyt was--he and my mother [Kathrine White] grew up together and he just became when my mother moved back to Detroit [Michigan] my Uncle Hoyt at the time was in Detroit doing theater and they just became extremely close and wonderful and then of course he moved on to Chicago [Illinois] to start his journalism career.  And he was just a big--he was a pretty big influence in my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now he's like one of the primary figures in Black Arts Movement of the late '60s [1960s] early '70s [1970s]--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --I mean the fact some would argue the primary figure--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --in terms of pulling in all the poets and writers and you know in Detroit they had Broadside Press with the poet, the great poet there.  Gee why can't I think of his name right at this moment [Dudley Randall]?  Yeah the founder of Broadside Press--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --in Detroit and what's his name Ron Milner; you got [HistoryMaker] Woodie King [Jr.] coming out of Detroit--
Speaker 2: Yelp.
Speaker 1: --and they're all in the same generation I think.  Yeah yeah, I'll think of it before we finish this but I don't know why I can't think--Dudley Randall.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay all right.
Speaker 1: Dudley Randall knows a close friend of Hoyt Fuller's.  He helped [HistoryMaker] Haki Madhubuti in Chicago start their little press [Third World Press, Chicago, Illinois], you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So the whole black, I mean [Amiri] Baraka [LeRoi Jones], [HistoryMaker] Sonia Sanchez you talking about [HistoryMaker] Nikki Giovanni, all these artists are evolving around you know Black World and--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --Broadside Press in those days.  Anyway I just thought I'd drop that.  Were you aware of all of that when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Really.
Speaker 2: All I, all I know is my--when I would go over and visit my Uncle Hoyt it was just amazing to me because he was you know his apartment was just filled I mean from the minute you walk in the door it was just books, books everywhere, books and pictures.  So I knew that he was--I, I knew he was not just your average okay run of the mill "okay go get me a beer," go--something like that.  I knew he was a, he was something very special.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was.
Story_ID: 227842
Speaker 1: Any other stories about your relatives?  Or any stories in the family that come down that'd be of interest to us?
Speaker 2: You know what my family was rather big and like I said a good deal of them lived in Detroit [Michigan].  My family is somewhat dwindled now you know with age and passing of time and things like that but when I was a young boy growing up in Detroit, it was always great because the family was so big and it was just you know it was just a lot of love and food, food man, just food.  I remember that oh so well.  This--I was telling somebody the other day it was interesting now when you have to sit there and I watch my wife Wendy [Banks], who is a great cook, but yeah you measure things out and things like that and I can remember waking up on a Sunday morning at my grandmother's house and just with the smell of, the smells of the kitchen of breakfast which turned into lunch which turned into dinner.  I mean my grandmother would get in the kitchen at six a.m. in the morning and not come out until seven or eight o'clock at night you know on a Sunday.  That was her day.  That was her day to go ahead and feed the family.  I mean just everybody.  When I watch the first time I ever watched the movie and the TV show 'Soul Food' it reminded me so much of that because that's what my grandmother's house was like.  All the family members or whoever was going to come by would come by on Sunday and my grandmother made everything.  My grandmother had glaucoma.  But it was amazing to me because my grandmother did, she cooked by pretty much by sight--not by sight but you know, a measuring cup?  Oh please.
Speaker 1: Just a pinch of this, or a dash of that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  That's how she cooked.  And everything was excellent.  You know it's just like any, any kid you talk to.  But my grandmother made the best fried chicken.  She made the best string beans.  She made the best cornbread, made the best biscuits.  My grandmother used to make these rolls.  They were called clover rolls, clover leaf rolls.  Now to this day my dad [Calvin Douglas Banks, Sr.] gave me the recipe for these rolls.  We've got it written down okay.  We follow it but they never taste the same way they did like when my grandmother made them you know.  But that's, that's what it was, her, her thing was to on Sundays would be to get up, you'd have a huge breakfast and by the time you got done with the breakfast it was just about time to have lunch you know and then you have this great fabulous dinner that was always topped off on a Sunday by homemade ice cream.  And she might bake two maybe three pies and that was your Sunday.  So, I have great memories of growing up as a child with my, with my grandmother.  Her name was Lot, Colatta Satkins [ph.] and she was just wonderful.  I mean she was really, really great.  So my childhood was really, really wonderful.  It was something special.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now that's your father's mother [Helen Blythe (ph.)] right?
Speaker 2: No that's my mother's [Kathrine Banks] mother.
Speaker 1: Oh your mother's mother.  Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 227843
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Several, yeah.  My grandmother [Colatta Satkins (ph.)], my mom's [Kathrine White] mother, my grandmother lived in the Jefferson projects in downtown Detroit [Michigan], Booster projects [sic. Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects, Detroit, Michigan], yeah Booster projects I'm sorry, downtown Detroit.  And one of my earliest memories was it was several buildings and they would surround a courtyard and one day it started to rain and thunder pretty bad.  So my grandmother called me in the house and I remember sitting in the house and all of a sudden I realize it felt like a sauna in there.  Granny what is wrong?  You know nothing goes on when it's thundering and lightning.  What?  Telephone was unplugged.  The fan was unplugged.  The television was unplugged everything.  And that was one of my earliest memories because I always remember my grandmother she was just that way.  You couldn't have anything on in the house.  You couldn't be on the phone when it thundered and lightning.  My grandmother, she'd tell me all the time that was God's time to talk to you.  So quite obviously you didn't do anything that would distract you from that conversation, but that was, that was God talking to you so you everything else had to wait.  That's a good early memory I had.  Just basically growing up where I spent most of my summers, of course my mother working at Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan] I remember the very first day I ever took the bus because my mom couldn't drop me off and you know do work too.  And I remember the very first day I took public transportation I would spend my summers in a little area just outside of Detroit called Highland Park [Michigan].  And my mother when she finally decided okay I'm gonna let you take the bus over to your cousin's house.  And we took the bus and we did the route and my mother took me on the whole route.  She drove it then we came back we actually got on the bus together and went over there.  And the first Monday morning I went to go get on the bus and she was like okay I'm off to work you're gonna be fine.  I'll drop you off at the bus stop.  And she dropped me off right at--we were living at LaSalle [Boulevard] and Davison [Street] on the west side of Detroit.  And I was probably maybe, maybe eleven, maybe twelve years old and I'll always remember this because I, I--for some reason I was--my mother had left me there at the bus stop and she went on about her business on to work or so I thought because about fifteen minutes after I got on the bus I remember sitting towards the back of the bus and looking out and about two cars back there was my mother just to make sure that I you know got to where I was so that was a great memory too.  She was a wonderful woman.  My mother was very special.  I used to say all the time my mother was both a mother and father to me.  She was a wonderful woman.
Story_ID: 227844
Speaker 1: This may sound redundant, but what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?  What was your neighborhood like?  What did it look like?
Speaker 2: It was interesting.  We lived like I said on the west side a big apartment building on the west side of Detroit [Michigan].  The great sights just the people in the neighborhood, Mr. Pearson [ph.] on the block who started the first block club party for my kids in the neighborhood.  Why we never ever got killed or hit by cars I don't know.  We used to set up--we had an alley that ran through our, an alley that ran through the back of our apartment building and we'd ride our bikes across the busy street, jumping up over the ramps 'cause things we had seen on TV, things like that, playing dodge ball in the middle of the street and running the bases in the street and cars actually stopping--I'm tearing up a little bit now I apologize, cars actually stopping in the middle of the street while we would go ahead and run those bases you know.  It was--I, I grew up in a really, really wonderful time I think.
Story_ID: 227845
Speaker 1: You know, while there was all the strife and turmoil I lived through 1967 which is probably one of the most difficult years ever because you had the in '65 [1965] you had the Los Angeles [California] Watts riots which I knew nothing about but June of '67 [1967] I certainly knew about the riots in Detroit [Michigan], sleeping on the floor with tanks right underneath our windows and not being able to go outside, having curfew and buildings all up and down Linwood [Street] which was a street maybe about four or five blocks again on the west side (throat clearing) --excuse me--.  When buildings up and down that street just being burned out you know gutted.  Stores on Dexter Avenue burned and then you have whole streets where houses were burned down and maybe one house standing on the block you know and you have the infamous words "Soul Brother" written across that way.  That was to let you know that you don't touch that house or you don't touch that business, you don't burn that business.  That's, that's either owned by somebody black which was rare or it's somebody who's been good to black people.  So that summer between Detroit, Cleveland [Ohio], Chicago [Illinois] you know that was a very, a very scary time but it was, it was intense, it was interesting though.
Speaker 2: So you're like nine years old when that was going on?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, nine, ten years old.  But I remember so well my mom [Kathrine White] taking mattresses, taking a mattress and putting it on the floor and so it wouldn't scare me she would say you know we're gonna have a little campout tonight.  That was her way of, of easing my fears about sleeping on the floor because of the snipers and the [Michigan] National Guard and the tanks that were just outside.
Speaker 2: And of course that set in motion like a kind of a--one of the worse I guess of urban situations in America you know the burning of Detroit in '67 [1967]--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: --I don't think the city's gotten over it yet.
Speaker 1: No.  No.
Speaker 2: I don't think.
Speaker 1: And that's you know two, two generations ago and, and they're still dealing with it today.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 227846
Speaker 1: When you were growing up, now what did you like to do when you were coming along?  I mean.
Speaker 2: I loved to play.  Playing was a very important part of my day.  I, I was always, I was always fascinated by cars.  Of course with my mother [Kathrine White] working in the automobile industry [at Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan], just being a kid you know just simplest things.  I, I tell my kids today, my, my kids from the oldest to the youngest, they're twenty-four to seven and I tell my kids today you know it's so funny 'cause you know how you always say you know you're sounding oh my God I must be getting older 'cause I'm sounding exactly the same way my mother did or father [Calvin Douglas Banks, Sr.] did or whatever, but I find myself today telling my kids a lot of things that my--you know that my mother would tell me.  But it was a simpler time too.  You know how people say when they grow up in the '50s [1950s], the '40s [1940s] it was a simpler time, well even the '60s [1960s] for a young child for a kid my age nine, ten years old, it was pretty simple, it was pretty carefree you didn't have any--you didn't have too many things to worry about.  I, I certainly think that today it's much easier--much tougher for kids to be brought up today than it was in our time for instance.
Speaker 1: Did you have like gangs in Detroit [Michigan] and that sort of thing when you were coming along?
Speaker 2: Had gangs but I was never really exposed to them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your neighborhood was would you describe it as a middle class neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Middle class um-hm.
Speaker 1: 'Cause everybody had a house or that type of thing?
Speaker 2: House.  Typical west side Detroit situation the block.  One end of the block big apartment buildings, then down the street LaSalle [Boulevard] was my street and down the street there's houses, nice little row houses.  Some two family flats, things like that.
Story_ID: 227847
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a young man growing up in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Adventurous.  Used to love to get out and explore things, curious I suppose.  Somewhat sheltered.  My mother [Kathrine White]--I was an only child so it was just me and my Mom and she was very, she's very protective which is something that I you know think all kids at some point try to gravitate away from but I don't know if you always make it 'cause I really don't know if--I don't if I ever really always made it almost made it you know but yeah a good childhood.  My mother did everything she could possibly do to make sure I had all the essentials in terms of you know schooling and things like that.  She was--yeah it was a good childhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you went to--you started off at a Catholic school?
Speaker 2: Lutheran.
Speaker 1: Lutheran, Lutheran yeah right.
Speaker 2: Lutheran--St. John's Lutheran School [Detroit, Michigan] over by [David] Mackenzie High School [Detroit, Michigan].  Went there from kindergarten through sixth grade I think, yeah.  And then we moved to downtown Detroit and I went to the Friends School [Detroit, Michigan] and I was there until the ninth grade and then we moved out to Southfield, Michigan when I went to junior high school and graduated from high school.
Speaker 1: Did you like school?  Were you a good student?
Speaker 2: I was an average student I think.  I probably could have been a lot better.  I'm sure my mother would have wished I was a lot better.  But I was, I was good enough to do what I had to do.  I mean I didn't--sometimes I would slack off but you know she would always go ahead and say, "Look, you know, you're slacking you need to go ahead and pick it up."  And I would do it.  So I guess I was an average student.
Story_ID: 227848
Speaker 1: Now were you involved in sports or that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I got involved in--with doing radio at a very young age.  I was--when I was in high school my high school radio station in Southfield [Michigan], they had two big high schools; Southfield High School [Southfield, Michigan], Southfield-Lathrup High School [Lathrup Village, Michigan].  Southfield-Lathrup had the TV set up; Southfield High School had the radio station.  And I was taking driver's ed [education] at Southfield High one summer and I happen to walk by the high school radio station and the doors were open.  So I went in to see what was going on in there.  And that began the rest is history I guess as they say 'cause it began a love affair that I've had for twenty-eight years.
Speaker 1: Now were you--I mean did you listen to a lot of radio--
Speaker 2: Tons--
Speaker 1: --when you were coming along?
Speaker 2: --of radio--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah.  Growing up in Detroit [Michigan] we had two black stations.  They were WCHB[-AM, Detroit, Michigan] and WJLB[-FM, Detroit, Michigan].  And CHB [WCHB-AM] was out in Inkster, Michigan, out in Inkster.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's a traditionally black--
Speaker 2: Definitely.
Speaker 1: --town you know created by I think Henry Ford yeah.
Speaker 2: Correct, correct.  For his black workers and who worked at the Rouge plant [Ford River Rouge Complex, Dearborn, Michigan].  So CHB was your prototypical black station.  JLB [WJLB-FM, Detroit, Michigan] was black but maybe a little bit more hipper.  CHB was a little more conservative.  Not conservative in the terms of what they did, just in the way they did radio.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I would listen to CHB and JLB but not as much as I would listen say CKLW[-AM] and what used to be a Top 40 station in Detroit, there were three of them.  There was CKLW which was in Windsor [Ontario, Canada].  Then there was WJBK [WLQV-AM, Detroit, Michigan] which later became a country station and then there was WKNR [-AM; WDTW-AM, Dearborn, Michigan].  And so I yeah, I listened to a lot of radio and then as I began to get more and more into radio, I would sit there at night in the summertime like we spoke about earlier and would just get to an AM radio and just see what stations I could pick up.  Listen to stations all over the country.  So yeah radio once I got into it and even growing up as a kid I mean I can remember actually saying to my mother [Kathrine White] I couldn't figure out because everybody on the radio sounded the same to me.  And I actually thought people were inside of the radio.  I thought they were (laughter) actually in there you know.  So yeah radio was a big part of my, of growing up um-hm.
Story_ID: 227849
Speaker 1: Okay now did you spend a lot of time by yourself when you were growing up as an only child?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I'll tell you a funny story.  My mother [Kathrine White] used to tell this story so great.  I got bored one day and I decided that I was gonna make an imaginary friend except I was gonna actually build a man.  So I--
Speaker 1: That's ambitious.
Speaker 2: --took a pair, I took a pair of pants and a pullover turtle neck and I stuffed him with pillows and everything and it was a guy, it was a man you know.  He had no feet, he had no head, but he was a man.  So my mother goes out to a party or something and comes home and you know I had been, I'd been playing with the imaginary man but let's be honest after a while he got heavy.  So I think I left him in the hallway, laying in the hallway near the bathroom.  And my mother came into the house like one, two o'clock in the morning and went walking to the bathroom, stumbled over him and turned the light and saw this headless body laying there on the floor.  You could hear her scream all the way up to Davison [Street] 'cause she was just like, "What in the world," you know.  But yeah, so yeah I think as a kid I, I did--I spent hours of you know just within what I used to call my own world.
Story_ID: 227850
Speaker 1: Now did you watch television a lot?  This is the age of television (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, a big television watcher.  Yeah liked watching television.  Probably if my mother [Kathrine White] were to tell you it would have been too much television.  But yeah lots of times that was my entertainment, television and radio.
Speaker 1: Okay and making things and I guess?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  Yeah tuning into radio stations from far away--
Story_ID: 227851
Speaker 1: Well now when you were in grade school, were there any teachers or mentors in grade school that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Had a great--yeah my first grade teacher.  Her name was Mrs. Feola [ph.] and she was the most--one of the most delightful people I've ever met.  She used to have this thing she used to do.  You know how kids when you're in first grade you know kids are almost like little ants, they're just everywhere, they run, they do everything, and kids would always run up to her desk Ms. Feola, Ms. Feola and she used to do this thing to where she would say, "Ah, that's it, there's too many people up here.  I am now invisible."  I guess at the time we thought it was kind of cruel because she's not invisible she's standing here just like I'm looking at you.  But she would say she was invisible.  She wouldn't answer the kid.  She wouldn't answer any of us.  She wouldn't do anything.  She wouldn't answer, she would close her eyes and she just kept saying I'm invisible, I'm invisible until everybody sits down.  Everybody sat down and she answered questions.  But I was (unclear), she was a delightful lady, young teacher too as I remember it correctly.
Speaker 1: How do you spell her name?
Speaker 2: Again, you got me, Larry [Crowe].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I can't tell you that.
Speaker 1: Okay so now this is at the Lutheran school [St. John's Lutheran School, Detroit, Michigan] right?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --St. John's.
Speaker 1: And what was Friends School [Detroit, Michigan] like?
Speaker 2: Friends School was a great school.  It was a Quaker school, great experiences there because you had before, before multicultural came into being, you had it at this school.  My goodness I, I, I went to school with kids from Israel, from Africa, from the Far East.  I went to--ironically enough I went to school with a kid, his name was Azar [ph.] and he was from--he was an American Eskimo.  His father had been sent to Detroit [Michigan].  He worked in automotive and his father had been sent to Detroit and Azar went to our school for one year.  But the stories, the things he had, that's where I first learned about you know the whole thing, the midnight sun and no light and things like that and the cold and the igloos and all this stuff was from him and this was you know in the, in the--this was early '70s [1970s] so the school as really, really a wonderful place.  First place I ever worked on a lathe--wooden you know making a wooden whatever walking stick or bat was at Friends School.  First place I ever learned about doing pottery and using a, a, a kiln to fire it up and actually go ahead and bake the pottery after you made it was at Friends School.  It was a good school.
Speaker 1: They had a lot of hands on--
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: --activities.
Speaker 2: Great teachers, friendly teachers.  First place I ever went to school where all the teachers were known by their first names.  You didn't call them by their last names.  It wasn't Mr. So and So.  They were all Don, Steve, Chuck, Mike you know.  So it was an interesting learning experience.
Story_ID: 227852
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so for high school you went on to Southfield [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Southfield High School [Southfield, Michigan] where my radio career started.  I started doing high school radio at fifteen and when I turned sixteen I actually got called by a station in Detroit [Michigan], ironically enough by a guy who I'm now on about four or five of his stations.
Speaker 1: Okay. So did you--now you're a sophomore you say you kind of stumbled up on a radio station you know?
Speaker 2: I did.  I was studying.  I was taking driver's training one summer and I saw the callers of the station were WSHJ[-FM, Southfield, Michigan], Southfield High Blue Jays that's what it stood for.  And we--I was on my way to class one morning and I heard this noise coming out of there.  So I thought well let me go in here and see what this is all about.  I walked in there and it was a guy in there by the name of Bob Sneddon [Robert J. Sneddon].  He was the teacher but he was also a jockey.  He had come from a station up in Flint [Michigan] called WTAC[-AM] and he was putting together the jingle package that the school board had actually given him money to go and buy.  This radio station that he ran was probably one of the neatest radio stations you ever seen.  Most high school radio stations are ten watts and you may be able to hear 'em in the cafeteria at lunch time.  Our station was 250 watts.  It was stereo.  It had a contest budget.  We even had a van that would drive around Southfield.  I mean he was, he was really a great, great teacher.  I, I give him all the credit in the world for my early days in radio.  He really was an amazing man.  He taught radio as if that's what you were doing in school.  He taught it like you were there on a real radio station.  It was not a high school radio station.  It had jingles, network nude from a- excuse me network news from ABC.  I mean it was amazing you know.  It was, it was, it was a wonderful experience, it really was. And it gave me the foundation for what I eventually went on to do.
Story_ID: 227853
Speaker 1: With that kind of setup in high school [Southfield High School, Southfield, Michigan], with that kind of station and that kind of mentorship, were there other students that went on to you know professional radio--
Speaker 2: Very few.
Speaker 1: --careers?
Speaker 2: Very few.  Couple of guys who stayed, a couple of radio guys who went around but they basically stayed in the state.  They stayed in Michigan.  Two or three of them actually went to stations in Detroit [Michigan] like I did except you know when I was eighteen I left.  I was gone.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So did you--when you started out, did you pattern yourself or mold yourself after any personalities you already knew of on the radio?
Speaker 2: Oh many yeah, gee whiz, there was, there was a guy in Detroit who I used to answer his phones in the morning when I worked at the station WDRQ[-FM, Detroit, Michigan].  His name is Bill Bailey and he was just--I was fascinated by Bill Baily because DRQ was a Top 40 station and Bill Bailey was black and he was a morning man.  And this was unheard of because in the '70s [1970s] and the '80s [1980s], if you were an African American and you worked on a pop station, you did one or two shifts all nights or ten to two at night.  Very rarely would you find a black man doing afternoons, middays, you certainly didn't find him doing mornings.  And here was Bill Bailey.  But Bill Bailey had an incredible career.  Bill Bailey worked at WLS[-AM, Chicago, Illinois].  Bill Bailey worked at KYS [WKYS-FM] in Washington, D.C. when it was still owned by NBC.  I mean he had a, a story career and to me he was just, he was the best.  He was a great, great guy.  To who this day I still correspond with.  He works at a station in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  He does afternoons up there and he runs it.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: So yeah I pattern myself after Bill Bailey, several of Detroit disk jockeys who I grew up listening to over the years, CKLW[-AM, Windsor, Ontario, Canada], guys--a guy by the name of Bill Gable who now is down in Orlando [Florida].  I see him I'm on the station in Orlando.  As a matter of fact I'm on his sister station so every time I'm in there I see him.  There was a great guy on the radio in Detroit by the name of Ted Richards and he was really good.  And a guy, a guy there by the name of China Jones who was this white guy from Louisiana but you just knew he was black you know.  So yeah there were a lot of guys that I grew up listening to in Detroit that I pattern myself after.
Speaker 1: Okay now did you now--what show did you have on at high school?
Speaker 2: My high school show was on SHJ [WSHJ-FM, Southfield, Michigan] that was--I did afternoons.  I was on from three to six.  We actually had set pattern.  Station came on at five a.m. and went on to midnight.  And on the weekends from Friday night--from Friday morning at five a.m. until Sunday night at midnight, it was twenty-four hours in high school.
Speaker 1: And the high school students were there?
Speaker 2: In high school yeah.  Everybody--and they all had you know we all had three hour shifts.  So I got started--actually I wasn't--I, I--the guy--[Bob] Sneddon [Robert J. Sneddon] actually said to me "Sign up for this."  Okay whatever.  And so I did it for my first year, my sophomore year because actually this is really sad.  I would go in there after lunch and I'd sit there for two hours and at two o'clock I was gone.  And one day the way I got about--this how I got on the radio, one day the guy who was supposed to show up to be on the three o'clock shift was not there.  And Bob Sneddon came to me and he goes "Okay you're going on".  And I say going on what?  He said I'm gonna put you on the radio.  Don't worry about a thing just go in there and just--I was like I don't even know what to do.  Just go in there and do it.  About thirty minutes into it, I was like man this is a blast.  You guys get paid to do this you know?  Right then and there that's when I knew, I knew I was gonna do it.  At least then I knew I was gonna do it.  I think at time--at that time I had aspirations of going on to be an attorney but for that moment I like oh this is great, I love this.
Speaker 1: Hmmm so you derailed your aspirations to become an attorney?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So three to six sounds like a pretty good time to be on, on the radio (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it's the afternoon drive.
Speaker 1: --and yeah or the afternoon stroll home at least--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for the kids.
Speaker 2: And the station, the station got into Detroit.  Oh yeah we had request lines and everything.  So it was great.  I was known, you're gonna love this.  I was known as [HistoryMaker] Dynamite Doug [Banks], the explosive man from boogey land.
Story_ID: 227854
Speaker 1: So what was the--now music is a--we're talking about the mid-'70s [1970s]--
Speaker 2: Mid-'70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: --we're talking about Sly and--
Speaker 2: The station [WSHJ-FM, Southfield, Michigan] was Top 40.
Speaker 1: --Sly and the Family Stone maybe.
Speaker 2: Yeah some Sly and the Family Stone--
Speaker 1: The Top 40 yeah.
Speaker 2: --Yeah some Sly and Family Stone, Grand Funk [Railroad], just you know Rolling Stones, Steve Miller Band, yeah it was pop, it was a pop station.
Speaker 1: Okay so you played a little bit of everything that was popular?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Right.  It went all the way back to music.  I remember this we had this on the format clock, you had news at fifteen past the hour and the news would come on.  After the news they'd have a block--a oldies block.  The guy--I tell you [Bob] Sneddon [Robert J. Sneddon] he covered it all.  We played music from the '50s [1950s] you know like the oldies and things like that and then you get back in the regular program.
Speaker 1: Hmmm.
Speaker 2: News headlines at fifteen minutes to the hour.  It was great.
Speaker 1: Okay now, now did you do this for the entire time that you were in high school [Southfield High School, Southfield, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Completely.  When I was sixteen I got the call to go to the station [WDRQ-FM] in Detroit [Michigan] where the guy worked who I had been answering phones for.  And the first, the first shift I ever did on that station was three to five in the morning and it was horrible.  I was so nervous and--
Speaker 1: So you're still in high school but you're going to you know.
Speaker 2: --my mother [Kathrine White] would take me.  My mother would take me up to the radio station.  She would knit for two hours while I did radio.
Speaker 1: So yeah that must have kind of disrupted your sleep I guess, what, what working from three to five?
Speaker 2: Well yeah but you know that's so exciting I was sixteen years old I didn't care about sleep.  You know all I knew was that you know I was gonna go to sleep at like ten o'clock and wake up at two and be on the air at three in the morning, three to five.  And so it was really, it was a lot of fun and the first weekend like I said it was a disaster.  And what happened was I did that weekend shift--I did that first shift so I could--that was basically say good morning to all the equipment, learn the board.  The next weekend I did two shifts.  I did six to ten on Saturday night, six to ten on Sunday night.  I got home Monday afternoon from school.  My grandmother [Colatta Satkins (ph.)] said to me, "Somebody called you from that radio station you're on."  I was like what.  And they said yeah.  So I called and my boss at the time said, "I need to see you as soon as possible."  I just knew I'd been fired.  And I went in there and the guy who did nights, his name is Jim Ryan end up owning a bunch of radio stations up in central Michigan.  He quit and the program director went to the general manager in the afternoon he said, "You know what, I got an idea."  He said, "I'm gonna put this kid on the radio; let's see what happens."  And the general manager was like, "Are you out of your mind?  (Unclear) sixteen years old."  And what he thought was if you take somebody who had some skills and who knew enough to get by and knew how to talk to kids 'cause in the '60 [1960]--'70s [1970s] that's who you cater to the teens, you got teen numbers you were up through the roof.  And sure enough that's what happened.  They put me on from six to ten at night and I did it all the way through school.  So I would go to school all day and then go to the radio station do six to ten.  It was great.  Put high school--put my friends on the air.  My friends from other schools around the city and all the kids could relate to me 'cause I was a kid, you know.  And that's how, that's my first--so my first professional job was at sixteen in Detroit.
Story_ID: 227855
Speaker 1: So what kind of--now I see what kind of, what kind of a routine did you have? I mean what kind of things would you do on the air that the kids could identify with?
Speaker 2: Oh man I did long before shout-outs were popular, we did you know with high schools like battle of the high schools.  You'd call in at night and vote for your favorite song.  One high school a night would be the featured high school of the night and all those kids from that school would you know be calling into the radio station and what basically happened was because the station was like really hip station in Detroit [Michigan], all the high schools would get involved in at night.  You know we did like a Top Five countdown stuff like that.  And the kids would introduce the songs.  Lots, lots of the same things I did almost thirty years ago guys are doing it still today.  'Cause it's just a cycle.  I think I told you long ago when we first started this ain't brain surgery you know.  My job is to entertain.  I entertain people.  My job is to entertain and perhaps hopefully by the time we get off the radio you thought about something we said that morning that made you think.
Speaker 1: Okay now did you--were you thinking that way as a high school--
Speaker 2: No, no I was just on the radio, turn on the mic, playing my favorite songs, yelling and screaming and people were responding.  No I think as this business is such that the changes it's made over the years, you have to really be focused and understanding this is about entertainment but it's also about informing too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I think the more years I did this, the more I became in tune with what it you know with what it entails.  But really this is, this is a privilege.  It's a privilege for me to be in your home, your car with your family at your breakfast table every morning.  It's a privilege.  You don't have to, you don't have me there.  It's very easy for you to push the button and I'm noting but a memory.  Maybe for the rest of that day, maybe for an hour or maybe five, ten minutes 'cause I'm playing commercials, but it's a, it's a, it's a privilege for me to be able to, to come into your home so you know you have to, you have to really understand that yes we have a great time, I have a great time doing this job, a wonderful time.  But you can never lose sight of the fact that it is really, it's a business.  And you're, you're here to make money to you know make money for whatever company you're working for.  But again your listeners are very--they're the backbone of whatever you're doing.
Story_ID: 227856
Speaker 1: Okay now how did your high school studies [at Southfield High School, Southfield, Michigan] and so forth fare as you're on the air [at WDRQ-FM, Detroit, Michigan] so much?  You didn't have a lot of time for studying I would guess?
Speaker 2: My mother [Kathrine White] again was very strict about that.  My mother was like, "Look if you're gonna do this you're gonna study and your grade point average better not drop below a certain point or you will come off."  I'm telling you she ran it, she was like you know.  So what I would do is I would get out of school every day at two o'clock and before I would go to work at five and get on at six, I would study you know I would study and do what I had to do.
Speaker 1: So you had time to do your homework and all that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  Now how did it affect your social life?  Because you're talking about a high school you know.
Speaker 2: You kidding, it's great.  I had no complaints.
Speaker 1: Well it does kind of cut down on the time you can actually be in pursuing a personal relationship if you're on the air all the time.
Speaker 2: Nah, you kidding me.  I had girlfriends coming up to see me at the station.  They'd bring me food.  We'd hang out, we do whatever you know and I think like on Saturdays I worked.  If I'm not mistaken I did afternoons on Saturday two to six so by six o'clock I was done with work, dating, whatever never gotten a problem--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --never was a problem.
Speaker 1: So this is heaven then on?
Speaker 2: On completely (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In teenage heaven, right?
Speaker 2: Believe me when I tell you.  Yeah it was great, it was wonderful.
Story_ID: 227857
Speaker 1: Okay so well when you graduated from [Southfield] High School [Southfield, Michigan], did you--I suppose you probably knew you already had a career in radio on some level.  You had already started one.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Did you think you would stay with that?
Speaker 2: --no.  I was, I was--I planned on going to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] to study law.  And I did it for a little while longer, did part time at DRQ [WDRQ-FM, Detroit, Michigan] but it really wasn't you know, I was in Ann Arbor [Michigan] on campus and I was like okay.  I certainly wasn't feeling making that drive on the weekend back to Detroit [Michigan] just to work for eight hours a weekend you know.  So basically I gave it up and one day it was like February maybe March it was cold and sleeting and snowing in Ann Arbor and I came home and on my answering machine there was a call from a guy by the name of J.J. Johanson [sic. J.J. Johnson], who ran a station in Los Angeles [California] called KDAY[-AM; KDAY-FM] the biggest black station in Los Angeles.  I'd never done black radio.  I knew nothing about it.  And I figured you know what, now is not the time to start.  I was you know.  Nah, nah.  But he was very persistent and he said to me he said look--I said, I mean I gave every excuse.  I said, "Man, I'm in school."  "You can enroll in school out here."  Okay, okay.  I--basically I just didn't wanna do black radio because I'd never done it and I wasn't really familiar with it.  So he said, "When does--when is your semester over?"  (Throat clearing) Excuse me.  And I said it'd be over in May.  He said, "Okay that's a month and a half."  He said, "I tell you what I want you to do."  He said, "Come work for me for six weeks.  If you don't like it, you're free to go.  You will have made a bunch of money and you can go back."  Hmmm, nineteen years old, six weeks in L.A.  Okay, all right.  Went out there and the first night I got there they were doing the screening or they were having the world premiere of the Muhammad Ali movie, 'The Greatest.'
Speaker 1: This 1977?
Speaker 2: Seventy-seven [1977].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I will never forget this.  As J.J., J.J. picked me up at the airport he goes, "Hey man great to meet you," blah, blah, blah.  He said, "I got a little surprise for you."  What?  And on the radio, there was Muhammad Ali on the radio talking about "Can't wait for tonight, looking forward to it, gonna see Steve Woods, gonna see bah, bah, gonna see dah, dah and this new kid who right now he's in the car right now."  This was all happening on the radio and he was like, "[HistoryMaker] Doug Banks is in L.A.  Welcome to L.A. Doug, I'll see you at the movie tonight."  I was speechless.  I mean it was incredible.  It was Muhammad Ali.  He was a world heavyweight champion and he was on the radio in L.A. for that moment talking to me.  So that was my first experience being in Los Angeles and it was great and I went and did the premiere that night and it was cool and so then I started working at KDAY and I went ahead and did the six weeks.  Well about two weeks into it, about two weeks into it I told J.J. I was like, "You know what, I think I wanna stay."  And he was like, "No, no, no you got another four weeks to go." I said, "No, no, no I think I'm gonna stay."  And that, that's what happened.  I then worked in Los Angeles for a couple of years and then it started the ever odyssey of anybody's who's ever done radio moving around the country.  Los Angeles, San Francisco [California], St. Louis [Missouri], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Story_ID: 227858
Speaker 1: What prompted the first move?  You must remember that.
Speaker 2: Oh the initial move to go to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] or--
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: --leaving L.A.?
Speaker 1: Yeah, leaving L.A.
Speaker 2: More money.
Speaker 1: Take more money, okay.
Speaker 2: I left KDAY[-AM; KDAY-FM, Los Angeles, California] and there was a station in Los Angeles called KHJ[-AM, Los Angeles, California] and its sister station was a station I grew up listening to in Detroit [Michigan] that was in Windsor [Ontario, Canada] CKLW[-AM].  Well KHJ was run by a guy by the name of John Sebastian.  He had come out there and we were neighbors in my apartment complex.  And he said to me he said man he said you know what when I listen to you, you are great.  He said but you know what he said have you ever done pop radio?  And I was like well that's what I started doing.  And he said to me he said well why don't you come work for me at KHJ?  He said I can't give you a full time shift.  He said but what I can do is give you part time and in Los Angeles it was the union AFTRA, American Federation of TV and Radio Art Sciences [sic. American Federation of Television and Radio Artists].  And at KDAY I was making about $50,000 a year doing that six to ten, yeah six to ten at night.  Well these guys--this guy said to me, he says, "Well you know I can't give you a full time job," but he said, "you know what, I can give you $40,000 a year; just work Saturdays and Sundays."  What, unheard of.  And I said, "Well you know what let me think about it."  And he said, "Okay."  He called me back later on that night and he said, "I tell you what, I'll sweeten it a little bit more."  He said, "I just got off the phone with our program director of our station in San Francisco [California] and he said we worked out a deal to where you can Fridays--I mean Saturdays and Sundays here and you'll do swing shift and relief, vacation relief and stuff like that for him which was like another $35-$40,000."  So working the two stations back and forth, it was a forty-five minute flight from Los Angeles to San Francisco, working at two stations back and forth, I was making almost $80,000 at twenty.

Speaker 1: What was the difference?  Was there--did you notice a difference between the all-black station format station and the Top 40 station?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a noticeable difference, night and day.  Black radio in those days was it was just very raw and you know the equipment was somewhat you know inferior to what the, the pop stations; the white stations had things like that.  Black radio was not taken as a serious entity, except in the community unfortunately.  Since--I mean obviously times have changed since then.  But yeah in the '70s [1970s] black radio '60s [1960s], '70s [1970s] a black radio station was ooh wow I don't wanna go work for one you know.  It was almost like a circuit you know.  You worked--if you worked you know you had black great black radio stations W--WWRL[-AM] in New York [New York], CHB [WCHB-AM] and JLB [WJLB-FM] in Detroit [Michigan], WAMO in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], JMO [WJMO-AM] in Cleveland [Ohio], [W]JPC and VON [WVON-AM] in Chicago [Illinois] and then you know you had them scattered around the country a good deal of them in the south you know in Atlanta [Georgia] and Birmingham [Alabama] and so on and so forth Jackson, Mississippi.  But black radio then was not to the caliber of where it is now, not at all.  I'll tell you a funny story.  There's a guy who did mornings in Mobile, Alabama for years and I was at a convention one year and I was up on the panel with him and I was working at this time I was in Chicago at [W]GCI [Chicago, Illinois] and my morning show on GCI consisted of about maybe six or seven people, it was a lot of people.   Excuse me.  Somebody in the audience actually said to me, said how many people do you have on your show?  And I said I have seven.  And this guy, his name is Madd Hatta.  He turned to me and he said you got seven people on your show?  I said yeah.  He said that's amazing.  He said I went in to my general manager and asked him for a partner and he gave me a cart machine.  (Laughter)  You know so I mean it was just that way.  You know radio you know you didn't have a whole lot of money to spend on having extra people on the air and things like that, but that's how it was in the early days you know.  And man he, he was a funny, funny guy.  He did radio for years.  One of my biggest heroes in radio wow was the late E. Rodney Jones who to me was just--that whole crew, E. Rodney, in Chicago now, E. Rodney, [HistoryMaker] Lucky Cordell, [HistoryMaker] Herb Kent.  I mean these guys to me were just, they were amazing to me.  They were just amazing.  And Rodney had probably the smoothest delivery I have ever heard in my life and the most unique thing about E. Rodney Jones, I bet a lot of people don't even know this, but E. Rodney Jones used to be on the radio and we had this great smooth, WVON and would always have a cigarette dangling from his lip as he went ahead and did the radio show.  He was just so incredibly smooth but he was great so.
Speaker 1: So you never knew it though?
Speaker 2: Never knew it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You never knew it.
Speaker 1: But those guys to me were true pioneers.  Black radio has had many, many, many pioneers.  Jocks that were just you know just dependent on what region of the country you were in you know.  Just incredible guys.  You know Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] with DAS [WDAS-AM] and Georgie Woods you know just great, great Ernie Durham in Detroit, Ernie D., Al Perkins, I mean just guys who were, they were, they were names--they were household names in the black community.  I, I, I believe strongly that that's what make black radio so unique is because if you take a hundred black people and put 'em in a room and take a hundred white people and put 'em in another room and you ask the black people, tell me everything you can tell me about your radio station that you listen to?  They know times you're on, your name, what you drive, where you live, if you got kids, and the kids names.  They know everything there is to know about their radio station because they claim it, it's theirs.  Nine times out of ten if you do that in a room full of a hundred white people that listen to say their favorite [W]CHR station or something like that, they're not gonna know all that information.  It's because black radio, its roots are in the community.
Speaker 2: And people keep the radio on all day?
Speaker 1: Twenty-four hours a day.
Speaker 2: Twenty-four hours a day.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Some people never turn it off.
Speaker 1: And depending--
Speaker 2: Even if television is on the radio still on.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, by all means yeah.  Depending on certain--depending on where you are in the country I mean like I, I've know people that you know they're forty, forty-five years old.  Well you know I started listening to this station when I was twelve, never left it.  You know the--your, your core audience is what it's called in the business.  But it's amazing because they you know the person never left it.  So black radio, it's, it's very, very, it's a tight knit group and they're very, very conscious of their community.  So to answer your question, yeah there were vast differences.  And because I had grown up learning radio a certain way and started doing pop radio first, I didn't really have a desire to go to black radio station until I went to KDAY[-AM; KDAY-FM, Los Angeles, California].  It was just, it was so well run so it was great, it was a great experience.
Story_ID: 227860
Speaker 1: Did you miss it when you left?
Speaker 2: When I left?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Pop radio?
Speaker 1: KDAY[-AM; KDAY-FM, Los Angeles, California].  No.
Speaker 2: KDAY?
Speaker 1: Yeah and went to--
Speaker 2: Yeah I did KDAY was a great station, it really, really was.  I mean I can't remem--I can't tell you how many times I'd walk in the building and there was you know sitting downstairs in a knit cap doing an interview, there's Barry White and he'd come walking over and sit down with me for twenty minutes or so and you know just all the stars of the day you know.  The Whispers would come by the radio station just be there.  I'd be going out some place having lunch you know, "Hey [HistoryMaker] Doug [Banks] how you doing?"  I look up there's [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy.  I mean in, in Los Angeles [California] when you did the radio, black radio, the black artists knew who were on the radio station as well as the listeners.  So yeah I did miss KDAY.  But I--this was such a great opportunity to do this thing between L.A. and San Francisco [California].  I was like wow so I went in and I did it for like a year and a half.  It was great.
Speaker 1: Okay now at KDAY was this your first exposure to the black recording artists?  I mean recording (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not really.
Speaker 1: Did you have that in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Because the station I was on in Detroit played a pretty good amount of black music but being up close and personal with them, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You really didn't get a chance to meet 'em in Detroit, huh?
Speaker 2: No, not a lot, you know.  Sitting down having lunch or eating at one of my favorite places in L.A. to eat when I was working there and still is today, Roscoe's Waffles and Chicken [sic. Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles, Los Angeles, California] and walk in there and you know there's [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson or there's New Edition or you know, they're just there.  They're just right there you know.
Story_ID: 227861
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So you did the pop thing and you know in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] with the part time in--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --San Francisco [California]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and then what would happen next?
Speaker 2: After that I went to Chicago [Illinois] for the first time.  I went to BMX [WBMX-FM; WVAZ-FM, Oak Park, Illinois] for the first time.  Did afternoons there for a while and [W]GCI [Chicago, Illinois] had such a strong hold on the city I was like man this is kind of yeah, and so I got a call to go back to San Francisco and do afternoons at KDIA[-AM; KMKY-AM, Oakland, California] and I went back to San Francisco.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is 1979, '80 [1980]?
Speaker 2: Un-un, this is let's see '79 [1979], 1980 I went to Chicago, didn't stay there long, left, did a brief stop in Las Vegas [Nevada] I forgot.  Stopped in Las Vegas for a hot second and then got the call to go to San Francisco.  So late 1980 I was in San Francisco.  Stayed in San Francisco til I left and went to Chicago again in '82 [1982].
Story_ID: 227862
Speaker 1: Okay.  The second time you stayed [in Chicago, Illinois] for a long time.
Speaker 2: Twelve years.
Speaker 1: All right.  The second time you went to was it [W]GCI [Chicago, Illinois] the second time or--?
Speaker 2: The second time yeah, I came into and worked at BMX [WBMX-FM; WVAZ-FM, Oak Park, Illinois] out in Oak Park, Michigan--Oak Park, Illinois and I came there in '82 [1982] and I worked there until '85 [1985] and January of '86 [1986] I went to GCI and I started doing nights and that was just--it was fabulous because you had the station was just on fire.  I mean it was unbelievable.  Because you had Bob Wall in the morning, you had Yvonne Daniels doing mid-days, Tom Joyner did afternoons and I did nights.  And it was such a powerful superstar line up.  I remember one radio magazine asking us we were on a conference call and it was all of us together and the--they ask the numbers had just come out and GCI between the AM and the FM had a ten share in Chicago [Illinois].  Unprecedented at ten share.  And the guy on the phone said what do you attribute this to?  What is it--what makes this staff so great?  And Tom said it, he said, he said the thing about this staff is that everybody from six a.m. in the morning til ten o'clock at night, all four of us, are morning personalities, involved in mornings.  And it just stretched out throughout the day.  I was just--it was unbelievable.  And that's of course when Tom was flying back and forth, which in itself was you know incredible.  So it was, it was a great run and I did nights at GCI from seven until ten at night.  It was wonderful.  I, I did that for a year and then they put me on the mornings in January, in January of '97 [1997] I took over the morning show.
Speaker 1: The morning is a place that most stations put their liveliest personality right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Somebody that's really gonna you know stimulate people and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --keep 'em interested you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you said before you came on the morning guy was?
Speaker 2: Bob Wall.
Speaker 1: Bob Wall, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  And he got into some trouble and it was a, it was a--it probably was a first time I actually really experienced any kind of "hatred" on the radio and I was kind of shocked by it.  Because the night the story broke about Bob, my boss called me and he said listen tomorrow morning I'm gonna take Bob off.  Tomorrow morning I'm gonna have you come in and do the show.  I said okay.  And I got in there and the same people who I would listen to calling Bob in the morning, oh Bob you're so funny, oh Bob you're great was the same people who were calling me the next morning after he'd been put in jail and they were saying I can't believe that Bob, oh it was horrible.  It was so bad that I actually just put the phones on hold.  I didn't even want to answer them any more 'cause all of a sudden these people who forty-eight hours before would call in and laugh.  He had this one lady in particular her name was Rosie.  She'd call him every day.  He'd have her on the air every day.  And she just absolutely loved him.  And it wasn't like when she talked to me that morning it wasn't like you know she--in her mind she already had him tried and convicted and she was just, it was vicious the things she was saying about him you know.  And that's when I really learned that you know what nobody, I don't care how much money you make, I don't care how popular you are, you are never ever bigger than the radio station you're on.  Everybody is replaceable.
Speaker 1: Now Bob Wall he was interesting in that he was the first I knew of, he wasn't the first white disc jockey on black radio--
Speaker 2: No, but he was the first one to do it in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And have that kind of notoriety and popularity.
Speaker 1: He was the most popular disk jockey in, in town.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Yeah.  He came to Chicago from Little Rock [Arkansas] and just 'cause there was really nothing else there.  BMX was at the time they were floundering not doing anything great.  Bob just came in and GCI was a hot station you know.  But you know he had his detractors too, but for the most part Bob Wall was a star in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Yeah he was a--
Speaker 2: A big time star.
Story_ID: 227863
Speaker 1: You take over this slot [at WGCI, Chicago, Illinois], this popular personality, you know; did your audience dip any, you know, when you took over?  Did the audience dip?
Speaker 2: From--you mean the audience from Bob [Wall]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Not really.  (Yawning) Excuse me, I'm sorry.  Not really, it, it, it continued to grow.  I, I--the first day I was on I knew I was gonna have to have something to bridge between what Bob had left behind and what I was trying to create so I went to Bob's producer who was Harold Lee Rush and I said you know what it really, really would be wonderful if you'd stay on.  And he was like you want me to stay?  And I was like yeah.  I want you to stay.  And he stayed and we had a great six years together.  We had a wonderful, wonderful run.  He was, he was Harold Lee Rush and everybody knew him you know.--
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2: And he was funny and we had Harold and we had what I consider one of the best personalities in the country Shirley Clark, she's now Shirley Strawberry.  She works with Steve Harvey in the morning in Los Angeles [California].  So it was Harold, it was Shirley; Bonnie did our traffic, Bonnie Dushone [ph.].  My news guy--oh no I'm sorry, Shirley did the news, Bonnie did the traffic, had a guy by the name of Reggie Preasley [ph.] who did news--sports and we just had a ball.  I mean we had a ball.  Everybody in Chicago at one time or another was listening to 'The Doug Banks Morning Show' then it was called 'Banks and Company,' I think.
Speaker 1: Right, it was, it was a big deal.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --we, we had a great run though.
Speaker 1: And Harold Rush was very popular you know.
Speaker 2: Extremely popular.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Everybody knew.  I mean it was like once again as you said it's like family.  People--
Speaker 2: That's exactly what it was.--
Speaker 1: --that knew--
Speaker 2: That's exactly what it was.  You'd turn on the radio in the morning and that's how I always pattern all of the jobs I've had.  Even with my crew that I have now, you know it's I call, I call us the most dysfunctional family on the radio in America because we all have our issues, and we all do this, you know you got two people in the room that are married, two people that are single.  We all have kids except for Dee Dee [McGuire] you know.  So it's, it's you know when you turn on the radio you get family you know we don't, we don't talk at you we talk to you.
Speaker 1: I think people appreciate that or actually are looking for that really--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Sure.
Speaker 1: --in black radio.
Speaker 2: Un-huh.  Sure.
Speaker 1: Looking for that.
Story_ID: 227864
Speaker 1: What are some of the highlights of your stint in Chicago [Illinois] those six years?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness.  Oh man.  There's so many.  I think one of the, one of the greatest things ever is when Harold Washington was running for mayor the very first time, we were talking about you know the election and so on and so forth and my boss [HistoryMaker] Marv Dyson at the time called me he said, "Listen we're gonna invite Harold over for breakfast tomorrow morning."  And we had him over for breakfast and we had a breakfast on the air.  He was talking about his issues and what he, his vision for Chicago and so on and so forth.  And it was a wonderful time.  And of course he went on to win.  And then by the same token on the other hand one of the saddest days ever for me was the day that Harold Washington died because he would come on the radio with us.  He had the number into the studio and you know in those days it was the, what they call it the council wars you know.  Harold, Harold Washington had the foresight.  He got all the black general managers together, Marv Dyson, oh geeze I forgot the guys' name who was running BMX [WBMX-FM; WVAZ-FM, Oak Park, Illinois] at the time, but he got all the general managers together, VON [WVON-AM, Berwyn, Illinois], BMX, [W]GCI [Chicago, Illinois] and because the city council was so volatile because of the, the thought of obviously you know as well as I know, the thought of having a black mayor of Chicago was so, so far out of the realm of thought that when Harold won and they knew you know okay we're gonna have to deal with this.  But the [Edward] Vrdolyaks, the Ed Burkes, the [Burton] Nataruses, they all knew we're gonna do things our way.  Harold wasn't gonna have that.  So he very--a great--a stroke of genius came to all the general managers and said, "You know what I need, I need to have a microphone and a mixer and a way to get on the air  (Finger snap) like that on the black stations because these people with all the things that are going on and all the people that are against me something's gonna happen and black folks in this town are gonna tear this city up if they think something's gone wrong with me."  And they put that, they put that line in his office so I don't think he ever had to use it except one time.  Basically when he came on the air one time because there'd been some [city] council problems, he was like, "Hey look I just wanna let you all know I'm all right, everything is fine."  I mean it was that kind of power he had, especially with African Americans.
Speaker 1: Yeah he did.  I mean it's really to be in Chicago in those days I mean those were really some powerful days.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean the community--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --came together in a way that it never had before.
Speaker 2: But I remember so well him saying he said to me one day on the air I said, "You know what, I have never in my life endorsed anybody openly, endorsed them on the radio."  I said, "You are the first, but I believe that you are what the city needs."  And he told me that morning on the air, he said, "[HistoryMaker] Doug [Banks], I thank you very much for that," he said, "But let me tell you something.  I will be the mayor of this city for twenty years."  And the following Monday morning because he died that Thanksgiving weekend.  I remember that Monday morning coming on and I played that piece of tape back and I did, I said, "You know what," I said, "what I just want everybody in the city to know that we have been cheated, we've been cheated out of twelve years" 'cause he was on his second term you know.  But he was a remarkable man.  So that, that's, that's a great memory for me in Chicago.
Story_ID: 227865
Speaker 1: Another great memory for me is one night when I first came to [W]GCI [Chicago, Illinois], we were on the air and I was going to request lines and on request lines I said, "Hey who is this?"  "It's Mike."  "Hey Mike, what's going on?"  "Not too much man, just checking you out.  What y'all doing?"  I said, "Well Mike hey man congratulations, you're caller number ten.  You got tickets to go see" something he was going to see.  He goes "I won tickets?"  "Yeah, yeah, man you got the tickets and now you qualify--we were giving away a car or something."  He was like, "Man a car too?"  "Yeah man you qualify, where you calling from?"  "I'm calling from Northbrook [Illinois]."  All right Mike, baa, baa, baa, baa, baa, baa, baa, baa.  So I, I put him on hold.  I go play the call back on the air and the guy who was answering the phones for me came back in the room, he was pale as a ghost.  "Man you're not gonna believe who you just had on the air fool."  I said, "Who is this guy?"  He said, "Michael Jordan."  Michael Jordan?  Michael Jordan got excited about winning a pair of tickets?  I don't know was it Six Flags or something.  He goes, "Yeah man, that's Michael Jordan."  I said, "Ain't no Michael Jordan, man, shut up."  He says, "He's still on the phone."  So I got him back on the phone and had him on the air.  I said this is not--he said, "Man, yeah, it's me, it's Mike."  Man please.  I said, "Man where you at right now if this is you?"  "I'm just coming from practice."  Um-hm.  I said, "Okay I'll tell you what, you know what we're on 'til ten o'clock.  If this is you, come on by here."  "Man you know what I'm all the way up in Northbrook, in Deerfield [Illinois]," bubba.  Yeah okay whatever man.  He goes, "All right, man, what's your address?"  And we were at 6 North Michigan [Avenue].  I'll be damn if about an hour and a half later he didn't come walking through the door.  (Laughter) And it was a--there was a club down the street from GCI, it was called the Charlie Club [Chicago, Illinois] and it was a fitness center but it was also a dance club.  So we went down there to have a couple of drinks after the show 'cause I, I just couldn't believe it.  I mean he got me so good I just couldn't believe it.  And we went down there man and had a basketball court in there.  And I said, I said, "Mike come on let's go ahead and shoot a little ball."  Why?  Why did I do that?  We did that for a couple of minutes, he said to me, he said, he said you wanna play.  Man please on the way to be the greatest basketball player in the world, yeah I wanna play sure.  He said, "Okay I tell you what.  I'll give you twenty points and we'll play to twenty one."  He beat me 21 to 20.  (Laughter) I never got my hand on the ball.  That's embarrassing.  I shouldn't tell that story.  My kids are gonna hear that one day and go dang Dad.
Speaker 2: Well he got the ball first right?
Speaker 1: Yes, he never got--he never, ever missed, swoosh, swoosh, swoosh, swoosh, swoosh okay.  All right come on let's go get a burger now.  But yeah I have many, many great memories in Chicago [Illinois] I think.
Speaker 2: And they all kind of coincide when you were when you know Harold Washington's election in '83 [1983]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --Michael Jordan arrives in '84 [1984] I believe right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 227866
Speaker 1: Then one morning Chaka Khan and Jody Watley came by to see me and I was so frustrated, not frustrated just so nervous I actually locked myself out of the studio.  So it was dead air for about four or five minutes.  (Laughter)  That was one of the less that was one of the less things that happen that I really wanna remember but yeah there were a lot of great memories.  I think then one of the most intense ones was my last day on the air in Chicago [Illinois].  It was so emotional and just I remember so well leaving out of the building in tears and the police had to come and direct the traffic because there were so many people in their cars who had just stopped in front of [W]GCI [Chicago, Illinois] when I walked out of the building.  It was just, it was, it was just an amazing, it was an unbelievable day.  I took like the last thirty minutes of that show that day just to thank everybody, because people in Chicago [Illinois] had been through so much with me.  When my mother [Kathrine White] was ill they were right there with me, right there with me.  The day I buried my mother, we're trying to figure out what in the world all these cars coming from for her funeral.  These people just got in their car and driven to Detroit [Michigan] because they felt they had to be there for me.  So I was very blessed.  The years I had in Chicago were absolutely wonderful like nothing can ever replace that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that takes the family aspect of black radio full circle--
Speaker 1: Again.
Speaker 2: --I guess.  People--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --really do feel like they're (unclear).
Speaker 1: I mean it was just, it was amazing.  I mean because I was on a just such a stressful, strenuous schedule.  I would work my shift from six to ten.  I would get off the radio at ten o'clock, catch an eleven o'clock flight to Detroit, spend the entire day with my mother in the hospital, catch an eight o'clock flight back to Chicago every night and would go to work the next day and I would do this five days a week, every day.  I went to Detroit every day.  My boss was like just take time off.  No I can't do that because idle time, I didn't wanna you know.  I knew, I knew, I knew it was happening, I knew it was inevitable she was gonna die, I didn't wanna, I didn't dwell on it, didn't wanna think on it so I kept working and it was you know very difficult because you know Mother's Day would come around and like my mother for as long as I could remember had always been on my show talking about something and like the last year she couldn't come on, it was very tough, very difficult, but again, the people of Chicago, the city, it was amazing.  I mean literally the day, the day my mother died and the day I buried my mother, we probably had, probably maybe as many as two hundred people show up from Chicago, they didn't even know her.  They just knew me.
Story_ID: 227867
Speaker 1: You were talking earlier about you know when you started doing radio, a kid, and you were just really having fun--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but then you finally--you started having a sense of social consciousness--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in terms of what you did on the radio and who you were talking to.  I mean when did this kick in?  Do you have a conscious memory of when you really started thinking that way?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  It was actually kind of funny.  I tell people all the time you know a lot of young people who I speak to about radio and they look at me and they look at my life and my lifestyle and think oh man, I wanna be where you are, live where you live, drive what you drive you know vacation like you do whatever.  And I have to tell them let me tell you something.  Out of twenty-eight years maybe the last ten to twelve have afforded me the luxuries I have now in this business.  It wasn't always like this.  You know it, it wasn't.  I--in my mind I keep in my mind the fact that I worked in Las Vegas [Nevada] when I told you I was working in Las Vegas, in Las Vegas I made $900 a month, brought home $346 every two weeks.
Speaker 1: So it was up and down?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Your career was up and down, it wasn't like you--
Speaker 2: Yeah very much so.  I remember going into the store--
Speaker 1: 'Cause you were making eighty something grand [dollars] in Los Angeles [California] and San Francisco [California], you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, just a couple of years before.
Speaker 2: But the thing about this business is like anything else, it has its peaks and its valleys.  Hopefully more good times than bad but that shows the true test of a person whose in any business because when you go through ups and downs, if you're able to get through the down part and get back on the up side, then obviously you're in the right business, you're in the right business.  But I remember very well going into the store you know you buy a ten pound bag of potatoes--man I, I can tell you everywhere in the world there is to prepare a potato, baked, broiled, whatever, 'cause I lived that you know.  But I never lose sight of that because this is a very, very, volatile business and it can change and you can be right back to that spot tomorrow.  You don't--you hope that you don't go back to that but it's a very real possibility.

Speaker 1: We were discussing off camera the fortunes of--well, we just ended talking about your ups and downs--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know the time in Las Vegas [Nevada] you were eating a lot of potatoes--
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: --and so forth and you know so you had the big times and the, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you had success early.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.  I had success early but you know like a lot of unfortunately like a lot of young people, or like people in general you know you run through money and you just you know perhaps you're not as smart with it as you should have been.  And I was like that.  I mean but you know it's interesting, as I'm, as I'm now in my forties, soon to be approaching fifty, I look back on things I did in my twenties and I'm like Jesus Christ you know.  Well I think, I think, I think a lot of people did that.  I think that obviously, I think the same things you did when you were twenty years old you don't do when you're thirty and you damn sure don't do them when you're forty or fifty so you know it's like anything else, you live and you learn.
Story_ID: 227869
Speaker 1: Well, I was talking about social consciousness as a disc jockey and that sort of thing when you came to Chicago [Illinois], I know all the stations are playing the 'Lu's Notebook' in the morning.  Did you all play that, Lu Palmer [HistoryMaker Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, II], was he on when you got there?
Speaker 2: On the AM.
Speaker 1: The AM okay.
Speaker 2: On [W]GCI-AM not the [WGCI-]FM.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were other you know talk radio started growing I think around the time that you arrived at VON [WVON-AM, Chicago, Illinosi] switched to a talk format--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --I think and that was proved to be a political factor--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the election of Harold Washington.
Speaker 2: You know with Lu Palmer and [HistoryMaker] Wesley South and yeah, the, the, the political black activists found a home there and being able to go ahead and  put the message out to the black community.
Speaker 1: That's right and that was like the--I know people talked about that as being like an X factor that they--that the white heart of the Democratic Party hadn't even thought about.
Speaker 2: No they hadn't anticipated nor expected that at all.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 227870
Speaker 1: Moreover I guess in your show ['Doug Banks Morning Show'] I know you had a lot of public service stuff on and a lot of people come on your show and talk about what they were doing in the community that was good.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  That was largely attributed to Harold, Harold [Lee] Rush.  Harold was, he was an absolute fiend about community activism and about things going on in the community and the importance of getting the community story on the air to where not just the black community could hear it, all communities could hear it.  That's, that was a great thing about Harold Rush.  He was very, very committed to making sure that people understood what was going on in the black community.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was present at most of the events, at political rallies--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --for [Mayor] Harold Washington, meetings of the Task Force for Black Political Empowerment.  Different other lectures around town if you see Harold Rush at ETA Creative Arts Foundation [Chicago, Illinois], the Kuumba Theatre [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I mean he was always around these areas.  And I think sometimes people really didn't understand what he did.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: He said he was a producer for 'Doug Banks Show.'  I think people really didn't understand the significance of it you know.  He--
Speaker 2: Right, right.  He was much more than a producer.  Harold was a very intricate part of what I did every morning.  And even though we laughed and joked and had fun you know when we had to get down to business and be serious about something, he, he knew exactly how to go ahead and make the transition.  He was very good at what he did.
Speaker 1: And you were telling me off camera something I hadn't realize, he's the author of this book called 'The Policy Kings in Chicago' ['Kings: The True Story of Chicago's Policy Kings and Numbers Racketeers, An Informal History,' Nathan Thompson and Harold Lee Rush].
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: A very popular book, a book that more than likely is about to be made into a movie.
Speaker 1: Right.  It's selling out in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: People are looking--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you can't get it.
Speaker 1: --for the book, they're talking about it.
Speaker 2: Can't get it.
Speaker 1: I don't think they even printed enough of them or something.
Speaker 2: Right.  I'm, I'm his friend and it took me like three, four weeks to get it you know so yeah it's a great book though.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's really good.
Story_ID: 227871
Speaker 1: Were you resented--when you were young, were you resented by the older disc jockeys as being so young you know and being on the air or did they, did they embrace you or, how did they (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, not really.  I think they were just really in awe.  Most of them were just like I can't believe this is a sixteen year old kid or a twenty year old kid or twenty-one, they were all like you know to have this kind of foresight to be doing what you're doing and to be able to have the, to have the vision of doing this.  They were amazed by that.  I really didn't experience a lot of jealousy things like that.  You know what to be honest with you Larry, if it was, if it was there, I really never knew it.  It never reared its ugly head as they say.
Story_ID: 227872
Speaker 1: Okay.  So a lot of those guys it started off like we talk about the VON [WVON-AM, Chicago, Illinois] good guys, [HistoryMaker] Lucky Cordell and [HistoryMaker] Herb Kent and some of them, they started in another era, they started really in an era before rock and roll.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you know what the amazing thing about this.  I've sat down and had conversations with Herb, who by the way is--Herb Kent's a fascinating guy.  And used to talk to E. Rodney [Jones] about these things too and [HistoryMaker] Pervis Spann.  I mean you know these guys in their day had just money like you would not believe.  I mean I've heard stories of you know shoe boxes, just shoe boxes stuffed with money 'cause they made so much money doing outside appearances and their money was made outside of the radio station more than inside.  And these guys would just go ahead and, and they had blocks and blocks and blocks of real estate.  That was one of E. Rodney's things.  He had many buildings on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois], apartment buildings and things like that.  And these guys like I said their money was basically made outside, outside of the radio station, but because of their names and who they were, they were able to go ahead and make it you know well worth their while.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We were talking about the money that some of these guys were making off the air.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean they made you know big, big money and they were able to do you know with whatever, but I mean you know what again that was the power of black radio, especially in the black community.  You know the name alone you know.  Herb, Herb's told me stories about you know sometimes at night doing three and four, you know maybe two, three, four different dances and having six, seven thousand people at each one of those dances.  And you'd do a couple of those a night you know, and in the '60s [1960s] you're walking around with 15, 16, 17 thousand dollars in your pocket, that's, that's amazing.
Story_ID: 227873
Speaker 1: What did you do after you left Chicago [Illinois]?  And this was like '89 [1989] I guess or so?
Speaker 2: No I left Chicago in '95 [1995].  The end of '95 [1995].  My last day on the air was in November of '95 [1995].
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah and then I came and moved got situated and moved down here [Dallas, Texas] and we started the national show ['Doug Banks Morning Show'] January of '96 [1996].
Speaker 1: Okay now you were on the air when the huge transition in black music I guess from I guess '90 [1990], '91 [1991] I guess through a lot of stations who've gone through a lot of changes because the youngest population was now listening to rap.  So it seemed like--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --there's like a kind of a splitting of the audience.
Speaker 2: There basically was.  The youngin went--radio suddenly became from urban mainstream which is a little bit of everything to basically hip hop.  Hip hop and they tried to go ahead and camouflage it by saying well you know we're hip hop and R&B.  But hip hop is hip hop and R&B straight R&B is R&B.  So basically what you have now was the hip hop format and you have what's known as an urban AC [urban adult contemporary] format which is music that's geared 25 to 54 but now they're bringing in hybrid format maybe 25 to 40.  Because it really began to find out not every 40 year old listens to or wants to hear you know traditional black music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So now what they're doing is you know you might have--I think you're gonna find some stations now that are not gonna--that certainly not gonna be hard core rap and hip hop but they're gonna have a hint of it.  But the music will be geared a little bit older.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it would be maybe your R. Kellys and people like that having--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --more.
Speaker 2: Yeah, R. Kelly and you know right now we're having a resurgence of great soul singers.  Anthony Hamilton is just this guy is unbelievable.  I mean he is so good.  Usher is a soul singer.  There's a guy who I just saw this past weekend I was out and up and coming artist, he's nineteen years old, he's from Ft. Lauderdale [Florida], his name is Urban Mystic, soul singer.  I mean really gut wrenching soul like we used to hear almost you know--I, I equate it to like the Al Greens, Wilson Picketts you know what I mean.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's soul.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you bet.
Story_ID: 227874
Speaker 1: So in '95 [1995] when you left [Chicago, Illinois] in '95 [1995] you started now--what does your show ['Doug Banks Morning Show'] consist of now.  I mean who's on your show?
Speaker 2: Well now it's my partner is Dee Dee McGuire.  She came from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  We have another person in the morning a guy that handles my sports youngin hip hoppish, hip hoppish if that's a word.  His name is Cocoa Butter and then it's produced by a friend of mine by the name of Gary Saunders so it's four of us actively on the air.  And occasionally we have a comedian by the name of Rudy Rush who used to host 'Showtime at the Apollo.'  He comes in and does it too.  So it's four of us sometimes five.
Speaker 1: And how many stations are you reaching?
Speaker 2: Fifty.
Speaker 1: Fifty yeah okay.
Speaker 2: Fifty stations yeah.
Speaker 1: These are I guess there'd be like fifty of the top I guess the blackest populated cities I guess.
Speaker 2: Well yeah in their prospective markets we have a lot of stations that we're on in the Southeast and Southwest.  You know not a lot in the Southwest but the Southeast, the Midwest and Northeast.  The central you know, the mid--you know the central area.  Tennessee, Alabama, the Carolinas, Virginia you know up the East Coast and through the Midwest, Dallas [Texas], Southeast.
Speaker 1: Okay, you're one of I guess maybe a few black radio personalities who are like nationally known you know, you got Tom Joyner, of course who used to be on the air with you guys.
Speaker 2: Tom Joyner, Russ Parr doing music wise--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --Tom, Russ, myself, Donnie Simpson did it for a while but he doesn't do it anymore.  Then there's what we like to call the new up and coming guy.  There's a guy, there's a team out of New York while this soon will be in New York, Star and Bucwild and their brand of radio I mean Star's openly said you know I'm like a black Howard Stern, that's where I grew up on that's how I do radio.
Speaker 1: So that's kind of like black shock radio or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They talk about most things that people don't talk about not on the radio.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But whatever you know it works.  It, it again, it works.  It's just the changing of the times you know it's just changes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We see some of the relaxation of FCC [Federal Communications Commission] regulations in terms of what you can say and can't say any more.
Speaker 2: Well I don't know if they're really that, really that relaxed because we've seen what happened with Howard Stern and of course his way to go ahead and bypass that was to turn around and sign a deal with satellite radio.  Now satellite radio I think it's gonna be very interesting.  I think satellite radio is right now where cable was thirty years ago.
Speaker 1: Unchartered territory.
Speaker 2: You got it.  I mean I remember back to 1980 when I turn on my television set and watch one of the first times watching ESPN.  I'm like what is this?  Look at it now.  I remember the very first night I watched CNN and had been reading about it.  Hype was so big.  'Cause here was coming a twenty-four hour a day news channel.  Who would have ever?  What is that twenty-four hours a day of news?  And in those days they didn't have a whole lot of news.  They were covering stuff from every little part of the world.  Well now here it is you know thirty years later and guess what when something major happens in this country, you turn to CNN.
Speaker 1: Right if we wanna see what people that are looking at and all they're saying about it.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Because when the networks and other news stations go away because they feel they've covered as much as they could, CNN will stick with it forever.  And you might think it's the smallest minute story ever but to somebody it's news and the place where you go is CNN.  Who would have thought that when it came on in 1980.  When Ted Turner had that vision you know most people in his organization told him he was a fool.  "What are you nuts?  That's not gonna work."  Yeah, well.
Story_ID: 227875
Speaker 1: Well if you could do whatever you wanted to do on radio or, what would be your dream for radio?
Speaker 2: I think the competitiveness of radio is there but it's not as strong as it used to be.  'Cause I think in a lot of ways radio has become almost too much of a business.  Whereas you used to have guys run radio stations and run radio networks who grew up and did radio.  Now they're run by bankers, attorneys and, and that's not to say that they do a bad job, I mean you know a guy who at one time had one of the largest radio chains in this country is a guy by the name of Tom Hicks.  He and his brother started a little radio company and it grew to be huge.  But Tom Hicks was a banker.  He didn't know anything about radio.  I very well remember a story there was a guy in Chicago [Illinois] who ran a station in Chicago called The Loop [WLUP-FM].   And the owner of that station was Scott Ginsburg it was one of his first stations.  And his company was called Evergreen [Media Corporation].  And when Evergreen was bought up by then Chancellor Broadcasting [Chancellor Media Corporation] which is what Tom Hicks owned.  One of the first decisions Tom Hicks made was to go ahead and sell some of the properties.  One of the first stations he decided to sell was The Loop.  Well, Scott Ginsburg who still sat on the board at that time was like no you can't sell that.  And, and, and Hicks was like why not?  He said because this is the first station I ever bought.  This station is my heart.  This is it.  And Tom Hicks told him he said if somebody gives me my price, that's what I'm looking for.  You see that's somebody who does not have the passionate roots of radio.  A lot of those people are gone now.  I wish I could kind of get back more of that.  It's a wonderful business.  Radio is--TV is great, but TV is visual.  Radio makes you use your imagination.  Radio is theater of the mind you know.  When we get on here and we act out a skit on the air, we've gotta work extra hard to make you understand the skit because all you can do is visualize.  Think about it, listen to it through a pair or speakers or a pair of headphones.  Television you turn on and visual all day.  Radio is, it's really it's, it's, it's theater of the mind you know and I would--lots of guys today who run these companies that own broadcasting companies or radio stations, they're just guys who are in there just doing that.  They're running the station.  You know when Disney bought ABC, I'll give you a classic example.  I was doing the after--I was doing afternoons on the network and the chairman of Disney, Michael Eisner, came through to visit.  He never even been here before.  Michael Eisner sat in this studio with me for twenty-five minutes and I had to explain to him what was going on, what this meant, what that meant, what's a stop set, what it means when you're talking up a record.  'Cause he didn't know.  He never you know he was like oh yeah I got a radio network.  Oh yeah that's right, let me go see this, I got a toy, you know.  But that's just the nature of the business right now.  That's how, that's how it's changed.
Story_ID: 227876
Speaker 1: As more radio personalities go national are we gonna have like less choices?  Or do you think, what do you think about that?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.  I think you'll--you know I think because you know lots of stations, lots of companies are looking to cut costs and save money so they're gonna do whatever is going to allow them to do that.  Getting back to satellite radio, I think this is just the forefront.  I think Howard--what Howard Stern is about to do right now is be a it's a frontier, it's a wide open frontier.  There are no rules, no regulations.  Do I think you'll see more people going towards that?  Yeah probably, which is not--doesn't say a whole lot for the talent pool that's being taught now.  You would like to think that they would go ahead (yawning), excuse me you'd like to think they'd go ahead and pursue careers on a local level but you know it's like anything else.  The big lights.  The big lights are beckoning to you so you're gonna take your shot at that.  I think a lot of guys will do that.  A lot of men and women in radio will do that.
Story_ID: 227877
Speaker 1: Now what do you see right now as you're--what are your future plans?  What are you gonna (unclear) for the future (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think realistically I'll do radio probably for it depends.  I've often said the format that I'm doing now is the younger end format.  So I think my natural progression is probably to go to something a little older which is kind of what I really wanna do.  This has been very good for me for all these years but you know at some point you gotta turn it over to somebody else who's younger you know.  My kids, my older kids, my twenty-four year old, my twenty year old, they're amazed at what their father does.  They're you know, they just, they can't even, they can't even fathom.  They're like Dad, Dad you know.  My two youngest kids, they're just you know if anything happened before 1994 they think you're ancient.  (Laughter) So I remember a couple of weeks ago I was doing something and my daughter, my nine year old said to me they had that when you were a child?  Kennede [Banks] come on yeah.  But I mean to them you know she was born in '94 [1994].  My youngest was born in '97 [1997] I mean they you know they have absolutely virtually no, they cannot conceive things happening in the '80s [1980s], '70s [1970s].  Oh God the '60s [1960s] you're ancient.  Talk about anything before 1968 you're blowing dust (laughter).
Story_ID: 227878
Speaker 1: Does doing radio do you think it keeps you, I mean, doing the format you've been doing for so long and does it keep you younger than most people your age?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well yeah. Because you know it's you know you're constantly trying to go ahead and make sure that the audience understands.  You don't want the audience to know that you know I mean nobody in my audience knows my real age.  They might guess, but they don't know it.  But see if I go to an older audience now, that's in my age bracket, you know.  I can't come on, I can't come on the show I do right now and talk about my twenty-three year old--my twenty-four year old that plays in the NFL [National Football League].  I can't do that.  They know nothing.  My listeners know nothing about my son, they know nothing about my daughter who's twenty at UCLA [University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], they know nothing about that.  They know about my nine year old and my seven year old.  But now if I kick this up and go suddenly to a format where I've got people who are listening to me from the ages of say twenty-five to fifty-five, all right then it's cool.  And that probably is a natural progression next.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because that's a little bit more of my speed of music, that's my music.  That's the music I grew up on.
Story_ID: 227879
Speaker 1: Now we always ask this question.  Now what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I would hope that as African Americans we can perhaps come together a little bit more than where we are right now.  I, I have a, I talk about this all the time.  I really believe that African Americans--we as African Americans we have that it's called the crab in the barrel mentality, which drives me crazy.  One African American who's trying to get up, pull themselves up by the bootstraps constantly pull him down, you're hating on them.  Or you don't like this or you're jealous of what they got.  Well you know what, if the person who's got whatever worked hard to get it, it's just as easy for you to do it.  I really believe that if we as African Americans spent a quarter of the time working towards a goal, being focused on something that I've seen a whole lot of young black men and young black women spend time on scamming and doing this to get paid and trying to get over, if we took all those energies that we take to do things like that scam people and try to get over and rob, if we took those energies and put them into something positive oh my God, sky is the limit.  But don't, don't get mad at me or don't blame me because I worked hard to get to where I am.  You can do the same thing.  You can do the same thing.  It's all about your drive.  And if you got goals and if you got a vision, if you don't have any of those things, then yeah, you just, you just gonna be lounging around, lying around trying to get over.  I ain't trying to do that.  I would like to see that stop in our community.  I'd like to see our young African American men understand that women are just that, women.  They're not bitches.  They're not hoes.  And I feel really bad because a good deal of the music that I play, the artist who do it refer to women like that, I hate that.  So that's why a couple of months ago I took a strong stand if you bring that in here I'm not playing it.  Now you might be a huge big time artist and the fifty stations but let me tell you something, the fifty stations I'm on they're gonna hurt you some way at some time.  I, I just think that's, that's disrespectful.  I was brought up by a woman [Banks' mother, Kathrine White] solely.  And when she wasn't doing it, I was brought up by another woman, my grandmother [Colatta Satkins (ph.)].  I would never think of saying something like that.  That ain't old fashion that's just straight up respect.  So I would like to see young men stop doing that you know.  I just, I just think that we have a lot of, lot of learning to do, a lot of growing up.  As a--as what I consider myself to be a black role model to young people to people of young kids who listen to me, I want them to understand the education is very important.  You know Stedman Graham's got a book out right now that is so good because it talks about how young black men in school right now almost 80 percent of them if they got a little bit of game, basketball, football, they're studies all of a sudden go to the wayside.  I'm concentrating completely and solely on this so I can get millions and millions of dollars in the NBA [National Basketball Association].  Well you know what 15 percent of the kids that play basketball in this country or less make it to the NBA.   When my son got drafted into the NFL, my son said to me the day he got drafted he said, "Dad, you know what I'm nervous, I'm scared."  I said, "Let me tell you something son, always remember this you are the part of a very elite fraternity.  We have 365 of you that got drafted into this fraternity but you got there."  The greatest day of my life is when my son called me on the phone, scouts were out looking at him.  He's an offensive tackle for the San Diego Chargers by the way, but he had scouts looking at him and you know we can do this and agents trying to get to him.  My son said to me he said, "Dad you know what, I'm not gonna come out of school until I finish my education."  Thank goodness.  'Cause the average life of a professional athlete you know it, the average is three to five years.  Then what?  Then what are you gonna do?  So he's got his diploma, he's got his degrees and for that I'm very proud because the education progress--process in this country is such that you know if you can play basketball or play football or if you a player and you got some game, you can get over.  But that's not gonna carry you all the way through life.
Story_ID: 227880
Speaker 1: Now when you look back at what you've done you're still young.  But when you look back at what you've done so far, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I wish I'd, I wish I'd finish school.  I didn't finish school.  I wish I would have finished it.  I would have made my mother [Kathrine White] real happy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She, she was very proud of my success but she also always wished that I'd gone back and unfortunately I was always one of these people, I don't have time, I'll do it here, I'll do it there.  I'm guilty of that.  That's why I'm--I stress so strongly that you know what hey, stay in school.  That's why in a lot of ways sometimes I really, I'm somewhat angry at these pro-teams that come out and take these kids out of high school.  Throw millions of dollars out.  I'm a make you a ball player.  I believe that four, four years of college and if you choose to go on after that and do undergrad work or whatever, I think that's some of the greatest times of your life.  I'm in the fall I'm on campuses every weekend black college campuses for homecomings.  There is nothing like college, the college atmosphere.  (Coughing)  Excuse me.  College life and the college atmosphere is great.  It's at a whole another level at a black college.  You know this weekend coming up we're at Savannah State University [Savannah, Georgia] for their homecoming. We go in there on Thursday night; we do a show from there on Friday.  I don't stop running in Savannah until I get on a plane Sunday.  But it's such a great time.
Story_ID: 227881
Speaker 1: Likewise I guess as we look at your life up to this point, what would you consider and once again we realize you're still very young by most standards of our interviews anyway.  We interview a lot of people that are like eighty years old (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --ninety years old, but what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Probably the fact that I'm, I, I try really hard to--I guess it's I keep saying I think I made reference to this three or four times about how things go in a circle, in a cycle and I remember how protective my mother [Kathrine White] was of me, I'm probably the same way with my girls [Kennede Banks and Kelli Banks] because I think that this the world we live in today is a very dangerous world and you have to be very conscious of the fact that all of your surroundings, things about you and even at their young age, my youngest, my nine, my nine and seven year old are--I'm very proud of all my children.  My kids are from my son who told me as I tell you that day, Dad I'm gonna stay and get my education.  My twenty year old who is in school right now and doing an intern program at a TV station in Los Angeles [California].  My nine year old who's a great, she's turning into being a fabulous tennis player and a dancer.  My seven year old who is as smart as a whip, I swear I think she's gonna be a journalist.  My youngest daughter will sit down and ask you a million questions.  You'll think you're on '60 Minutes.'  So I guess my legacy would be my kids.

Speaker 1: Yeah they're really, I put--my wife [Wendy Banks] and I put a lot of pride and, and a lot of hard work.  My wife is, she's a, she's a taskmaster but in a good way you know.  I don't like to be too strict on my children but still I don't have a problem with if they get out of line, they will feel the ram of this hand on their backside.  I think you have to do that.  I, I don't believe in time out and all this stuff.  I believe in taking care of business.  If you do something, if I tell you to do something one time you don't do it okay, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, maybe you didn't hear me.  But if it happens a second time, there is no third time.  I believe in discipline.  I believe in disciplining your children.
Speaker 2: You're not a new age person in terms of that?
Speaker 1: Nope.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My mother [Kathrine White] wasn't new age of me.  I tell the story all the time.  You know we had her as a question one morning on the morning show, what's the worst beating you ever got?  Worse one I can remember is actually being tied to the bed beat with an ironing cord bringing home a bad grade.  But by the same token after she beat me, then she cried 'cause I would welt up like crazy.  Man and then she'd be like I can't believe I did that.  But I mean my mother was a very strict disciplinarian.  She was strict and discipline into my twenties.  I came out okay.  I want my kids to do the same.

Speaker 1: Now did you father [Calvin Douglas Banks, Sr.], did you ever kind of reconnect with him after you?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  My father and I--I called my father when I--when my wife [Wendy Banks] had my nine year old when because my other children had different mothers.  So when Kennede [Banks], that's my nine year old, when she was born, I picked up the phone, I called my father.  I said, "Listen I'm calling you just because I believe you need to understand, you need to know that you are now a grandfather."  And I will admit things have gotten better but I don't think they'll ever be you know, we're never gonna be "dad and son let's go catch a baseball game, let's go drink a beer."  No, that's not us.  Let's watch a football game, no, no.  That's not my dad.  My dad isn't built like that.  He's not--he's very stern and very strict.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And our last question is similar to legacy but, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a guy, a good man, a good father, good husband.  A man who, whose job entailed letting masses of people know not only informing them on news of the day but trying to make their burden a little lighter.  One of the greatest compliments I can ever get is when somebody says to me, "You know what, man I was having a bad day today.  My wife and I got into a fight, kids not doing good in school, or I've got problems at work but I can only listen to you this morning for fifteen minutes.  For that fifteen minutes you made me forget about all my problems.  You made me laugh, you made me think."  That's the greatest compliment anybody ever give me.  If I can make a difference in somebody's day, then I've done my job.

Speaker 1: Well, I know I said that's the last question, but one thing.  I just thought about this as I'm talking to you now.  I heard you in Chicago [Illinois].  We talk about the family nature of black radio you know my sister listens to you or used to listen to you in Dayton [Ohio]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know and she asked me you heard of [HistoryMaker] Doug Banks, he used to be in Chicago.  I said yeah.  So it's a way to connect up with something in Chicago that's going on now in Dayton--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --as you go around the country now and people--I mean how does it--how does it feel to be known in a lot more places than one market now you know?
Speaker 2: It's cool, it's great.  But I, I again I try very hard to you know--I keep it very humbled, keep it in perspective.  I think the one thing people can always say about me is it's just a regular guy.  That's really what I am.  I mean my job is just a little bit off--it's just a little bit off the beaten path.  I put my pants on like everybody else the same way.  I curse when I have to.  I get made when I have to.  I cry when I have to.  I shoulder--I mean I shower my kids with things.  I get mad at 'em when they, when they don't do right.  I think most people will say that I'm just a regular guy you know.  I don't really put on, I don't really get all hung up on that star trip that kind of thing.  I don't have time for that you know.  I'm just trying to get to the next juncture.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well I hope you get there.  You certainly--it certainly seems like you will.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much for this interview.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Larry [Crowe].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Thank you, appreciate it.
