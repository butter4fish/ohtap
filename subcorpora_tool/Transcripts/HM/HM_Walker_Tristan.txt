Story_ID: 666911
Speaker 1: So, let's look at your family history.  Let's start with your father.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What's your father's name and where is he from?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so my father's name is Roger Vassar, he is--
Speaker 1: Spell the last name.
Speaker 2: V-A-S-S-A-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He, he was murdered when I was three years old.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So, I don't know too much about my father.  But, he's originally from New York [New York].
Speaker 1: And did you know his family?
Speaker 2: I did not know his family at all.  I mean most of my memory of all of my childhood is from my mother [Bettie Walker Harris], my brother [Sean McMillon], my sister [Racquita McMillon] and my grandmother [Hattie Walker].
Story_ID: 666912
Speaker 1: And is your father [Roger Vassar], father to your other siblings?
Speaker 2: No, each of my siblings, Sean [Sean McMillon] and Racquita [Racquita McMillon], that's my brother and my sister respectably, respectively we've all had different fathers.
Speaker 1: Okay, and are you the eldest?
Speaker 2: I am the youngest.
Speaker 1: You're the youngest?
Speaker 2: I am the baby (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, who's first, who's first?
Speaker 2: Sean, he's first, he was born in 1970.  My sister is born in '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: Okay and just so we say about them.  Tell me what does Sean do now?
Speaker 2: No problem, so Sean works as a security guard at a hospital out in Queens, New York.  And my sister works at a bank in New York [New York] as well.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell Sean and Racquita (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) S-E-A-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And R-A-C-Q-U-I-T-A.
Story_ID: 666913
Speaker 1: Unfortunately your, your father [Roger Vassar] was murdered when you were three.
Speaker 2: That's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you know the circumstances?
Speaker 2: You know it's funny I, I asked my mom [Bettie Walker Harris], you know, the one thing I do remember about my father is kind of the love I did have for him, despite kind of you know, not being able to acknowledge the day by day interaction that I had for him.  And I always had these rumblings that like you know, it's probably something nefarious (laughter) that kind of went on at the time.  And I remember kind of asking my mother, she's like, "Do you really want to know?"  And I said no at the time 'cause it, I didn't really want anything to really taint, kind of my perception of him.  And I'm still trying to kind of map out that time when I'm actually gonna ask definitively what actually happened.  And I hadn't been ready for that at least until now.  And most likely that'll happen as sooner rather than later.
Speaker 1: So, because she asked, do you really want to know, you were able to say not now?
Speaker 2: Correct, correct.
Speaker 1: So, do you, do you have memories of him, when you were little?
Speaker 2: Not at all.  I mean I actually had one photo of him, he had this like, you know, beautiful, hoary white beard.  What I remember of him, is incredible charismatic, made everyone laugh, that sort of thing.  But, like my memory and visuals I just can't remember outside of that one photo.  And I actually lost that photo my senior year in college [Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York].  And it's very frustrating and I remember this very, very vividly you know, I was going to wash and dry my own clothing.  And my wallet happened to be in one of my pant pockets.  And you know you go and dry your clothes you have to wait an hour and a half and it's a communal dryer, that sort of thing.  And my wallet was gone.  I took my clothing, took back to the room folded it up.  Went back in search of my wallet, my wallet was there and the weird part is everything was there, with the exception of my father's photo, which is very strange, (laughter) very, very strange.  But, that was the last memory that I have of my father.
Story_ID: 666914
Speaker 1: Tell me about your mother what's her name?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: When or where was she born?
Speaker 2: Yeah so, her first name is Bettie [Bettie Walker Harris], B-E-T-T-I-E.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: She was born in Aliceville, Alabama.  Moved to (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Allensville?
Speaker 2: Aliceville.
Speaker 1: Aliceville?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Moved to New York [New York], when she was about eighteen, when she had my brother [Sean McMillon].  But, she's originally from, from Alabama and has lived in New York ever since she was eighteen.
Speaker 1: And what's her last name?
Speaker 2: So, right now Harris.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Maiden name Walker.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she you, you get Walker from her?
Speaker 2: That's right, I do (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so Aliceville, Alabama.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is that where her family's from?
Speaker 2: Yes, so you know, most of my family is from Aliceville, Alabama.  It's about an hour or so from Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  We used to yeah, I used to go there in the summers.  And I remember taking the Amtrak train from New York twenty-four hours to Tuscaloosa.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And then we'd drive to visit my grandmother, who is now deceased (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Hattie.
Speaker 1: And Hattie?
Speaker 2: H-A-T-T-I-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, and is she Walker [Hattie Walker] as well?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: So, what did the family do in Alabama?  What was the work that different family members did there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so my, my, my grandmother was a kind of house help to you know, a lot of local residents out there.  So, every kind of menial task work.  And that was really the larger part of my entire family's work back then.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And then you know, now we have my great-grandmother Mary [ph.], who you know obviously predated my grandmother but similar types of work.  And they really never got out of this kind of day by day menial task kind of work, offering and labor.  It really wasn't until, you know, I grew up and went to college [Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York], that you know, my, my family started to really break a lot of that cycle.
Speaker 1: And your mother what was her work?
Speaker 2: Yeah so, for some twenty to twenty-five years she worked for the New York City Housing Authority.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As an administrative assistant, she's now retired.  Living in both Queens [New York] and Illinois (unclear).
Speaker 1: Illinois, how--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so she's married to a gentleman who lives in Illinois right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, she goes back and forth between New York where my brother and my sister [Racquita McMillon] are and Illinois as well.
Speaker 1: So, she moved to New York at eighteen?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And, and she already had one child, you said?
Speaker 2: No, so she moved to New York and then she had my brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah so he was the first of, of all of us.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And then five years later she had my sister.
Story_ID: 666915
Speaker 1: Tell me when you think about yourself as a little boy.
Speaker 2: Yeah?
Speaker 1: What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah, earliest childhood memory.  My earliest childhood memory I think was when we moved from Jamaica, Queens [New York] to Flushing, Queens.  So you know, I grew up, you know projects Jamaica, Queens, 40 Project [South Jamaica Houses] specifically.  And around the time of six years old when I was about to go to first grade we moved up to Flushing, Queens.  And the reason I kind of remember it, 'cause I was really the first time I got introduced to the Boys' Club of New York, which you know, we'll probably talk about.  But, it fundamentally changed my life, and after school program there.  Got to participate in sports kind of after school work et cetera and built some really, really strong relationships there.  But, you know it wasn't until we got to Flushing, where I really started to feel like there's a community around me.  You know, I remember growing up in Jamaica, Queens, hardly ever leaving my home, really without my mother [Bettie Walker Harris] and my brother [Sean McMillon].  Of course, because I was young but also it's pretty dangerous.
Speaker 1: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right, to be out playing all the time, doing that sort of thing.  And my mother really wanted to kind of hold the reins down and discipline me in that regard, right?  Make sure I was down with the studies and the books, et cetera.  And when we moved to Flushing I got to get outside and play and make friends and that sort of thing.
Story_ID: 666916
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the difference in those neighborhoods, some (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: Because you say in Jamaica [Queens, New York], which Jamaica is a large--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah--yeah.
Speaker 1: --neighborhood that has lots of different elements.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah that's right.
Speaker 1: There some standalone homes, that--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Some projects, you were in the projects [South Jamaica Houses, Queens, New York].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: You know, over time we've talked to people who grew up in the projects when they were first built.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Which is very different from how they are now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I'm sure.
Speaker 1: And there was a time when they weren't dangerous, you know.
Speaker 2: Sure, yeah.
Speaker 1: But, you're describing that they was at that time, so.  What--describe living in the projects, and just the in and out?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And who are your neighbors and all that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I mean first of all it comes with a whole bunch of things.  Right, not only kind of the danger encircling us, but like on welfare, right?  Like the ability of thrive just wasn't something that I saw, or was able to understand, right?  Or saw any semblance of, kind of comparison.  You know, I think a lot of folks who kind of live in that environment tend to you know, and, and justly so perceive that that's what's there, right?  And it's hard to really aspire to something greater, if you don't really perceive it to be.  That said I think you know, when you're in an environment like that, a lot of folks really stick close to each other.  And I think that's, that's really why I'm really much closer to like a lot of my immediate family.  And when I think about my mother [Bettie Walker Harris], my brother [Sean McMillon], and my sister [Racquita McMillon] and even my grandmother [Hattie Walker], before she had passed.  Relative to my kind of more extended family, right?  'Cause you just had to be in the home, right?  You had to communicate with each other, you couldn't get out too much.  And again most of our family was in Alabama at the time, so we had to be tight knit.  So, that's why when I think about my experience in Jamaica, Queens, you know really the only thing that I do remember is venturing to like Baisley housing projects [Baisley Park Houses, Queens, New York] with my mother, where she used to work, as a New York City Housing Authority administrative assistant.  So, whenever I was off at school I'd go and visit with her.  But, I don't remember any times on the playground.  I don't remember any times with like groups of friends that I had.  I couldn't name any friends that I would have had, even if I did in Jamaica, Queens.  And it wasn't until I got to Flushing [Queens, New York] where some of that changed.  And we still lived in the projects there too.  But, you know, I was growing older I was able to handle myself a little bit better.  And I was just able to make a little bit more friends.
Story_ID: 666917
Speaker 1: So, was it lonely for you then, when in Jamaica, Queens [New York]?  Did you feel that or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --was it because you're with family, you didn't have that?
Speaker 2: No, I mean, I've, I've been I've always--look, I mean I've never really had this very extensive kind of friendship network, all right.  And I've, I've always have been very, very discerning, about being around folks, that you know, tend to well--well this super precocious like six year old.  But, folks who share my values, folks I enjoy being around, right?  And I try to an exhaust all of my time around that.  And I even recognize that a young age.  And really understood the value of things like loyalty, right?  I mean you can't really be as deeply loyal to everyone as you can be to a few, right?  So, that really did sustain me and really prevented my having to be lonely.  Additionally, I just loved reading.  I loved studying.  I loved educating myself and at an early age even if I couldn't go outside I had to find ways to entertain myself and those are some ways I was able to do it.
Speaker 1: And so you loved reading, were you going to the library to get books? Where were books coming from?
Speaker 2: Yeah so, either from school itself and kind of bringing things back.  Making things up in my own head, right, whether it came from designing my own art drawing.  Like writing my own things, right, that didn't make any sense.  Having conversations in my head, about things I just wanted to learn more about.  And whenever I could pick up a book I could, right?  I remember one of the first, one of the first words I learned to spell and kind of recite out loud was encyclopedia (laughter), right?
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: And the thing that was really the reason why is 'cause we had all these like volumes, encyclopedia volumes in our home.
Speaker 1: Britannica [Encyclopedia Britannica] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, exactly right?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And you know, I remember, you know, you'd go and look things up, but you know, it was really one of the few things that we had in our home even as exhaustive as it was, to kind of learn from.  And that was really my starting point.
Speaker 1: Was your mother [Bettie Walker Harris] educated?
Speaker 2: Well, through high school.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: I was the first college graduating person in my entire family.
Speaker 1: And you have two older siblings. What, what age was she when she had you?
Speaker 2: My mother, well she was born in '51 [1951] so she was thirty-three.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When she had me.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.  And what about your first--what--how old was she had her first child?
Speaker 2: When she had Sean [Sean McMillon] she was nineteen.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And then Racquita [Racquita McMillon] twenty-four.
Story_ID: 666918
Speaker 1: So she went to work right away?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: To take care of the kids (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah--yeah no she, she definitely, at least as she's articulated to me.  You know, you go from Aliceville [Alabama] to New York [New York] for opportunity, right?  And you know, now that she had children, my mother's [Bettie Walker Harris] always been, her work ethic is second to none.  And that's really where I get a lot of that from.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I could see not only why she made that move, but I respect not only that move but her sustaining and kind of raising us throughout that.  It's, it's really a feat and yeah I've, I've got a lot to thank her for.
Speaker 1: Were your other siblings' fathers ever around when you were going up?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know anything about their fathers.  I've never met their fathers.  I have no knowledge or understanding about them at all.  And that goes a little bit back to what I was saying little earlier about just us being kind of tighter, than kind of this more extended family.  My brother [Sean McMillon] actually his father had passed as well.  I think prior to my being born actually.  So, I never even had the chance to meet him (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was he also murdered?
Speaker 2: No, actually from what, I don't know the reason for his passing, but I do know that he was an alcoholic too.  And I, I, believe that there may be some kind of connection to that as well.  But, again like at some point now that I'm kind of at the age that I am at now, like I can talk about this stuff, thoughtfully.  And, you know, that's the big reason why I wanted to kind of pause in it so I can actually have some semblance of perception.
Story_ID: 666919
Speaker 1: In terms of male role models--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when you were growing up were there men in either of the projects where you grew up who were people you looked up to?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, it's funny you know, growing up and being raised where I was, you know, I think a lot about kind of my path to where I am now.  And who inspired me, and kind of where I got my excitement.  And you know, I tell folks I really only had one goal in life when I was younger.  And that's changed over time.  But my, my one goal in life when I was younger is to get as wealthy as possible as quickly as possible.  I realized that you know, that was a life that I didn't want to lead.  I didn't want my family to live in that life.  So, I tended to aspire to those folks that had that, right?  And really understood like what it took to get them there.  And my earliest years I realized that there are three ways to get there.  The first was be an actor or an athlete, right so you know I played basketball my entire life.  You know, I aspired to the Michael Jordans, the Magic Johnsons that sort of thing.  And I, I really did give it a shot, right?  Then you know, the folks on Wall Street, which I also had the good fortune to do.  And now, entrepreneurship, right?  So, I was always inspired by the folks who had.  And as I grew older I started to get more and more inspired by the folks who taught me something.  That have carried with me for my entire life.  So, there's been a marked transition.  And like the types of folks now kind of respect and feel mentored by, relative to when I was growing up early ages.
Speaker 1: But, sticking with the early ages, for now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: --are there any particular people you remember, men in particular who you know, not necessarily?
Speaker 2: My brother [Sean McMillon].
Speaker 1: You brother?
Speaker 2: My brother, yeah.  Just because not only were we so close at the time he was the only reference point that I had, right?  And look I mean he didn't graduate college and didn't work on Wall Street.  Didn't do any of that stuff, but you know, he certainly did teach what like manhood could look like.  And look I mean my family is very matriarchal, right?  My mother [Bettie Walker Harris], my sister [Racquita McMillon] you know you have all your aunts, who are also you know, single.  A lot of cousins who are woman, there aren't that many men in my family.  And my brother was really kind of the, the closest representative for me.  And he always treated me so damn well, and was protective of me.  And taught me the right things to do.  Even as like learning how to shave and stuff like that.  Like he was the guy who taught me all the rites of passages that I needed to learn.
Speaker 1: How many years is he your senior?
Speaker 2: He is thirteen years my senior.
Speaker 1: Ah, so he really was old enough (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, fourteen years, yeah.
Speaker 1: --to have perspective.
Speaker 2: Yeah, especially by the time I could understand what he was saying (laughter) yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I mean he's, he's been through the school of hard knocks himself, right?  When, he's had to kind of preserve throughout that too.  So, kind of any advice he's supplied with, it was real, right?  It couldn't be fluff, 'cause I lived with him (laughter).
Speaker 1: And did he stay in the home?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I mean he's still with my mom now.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean helps support her and you know, as she's getting older and that sort of thing.  So, he's still in Flushing, Queens [New York] plugging away.
Story_ID: 666920
Speaker 1: So let's talk about you, you as a student. You say you loved school.
Speaker 2: Loved school, still love school (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where, where did you go, where did you go to elementary and junior high?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I went to school in Flushing, P.S. 214 [Cadwallader Colden School] that was in Flushing, Queens [New York].  Junior high school, Junior High School 185 [J.H.S. 185, Edward Bleeker School], also in Flushing, Queens.  And then I went to the Hotchkiss School [Lakeville, Connecticut] for high school.
Speaker 1: So in your, but before you get to private school.  What is the racial dynamic, in, in your public- en--
Speaker 2: It was very different from Palo Alto [California] (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Predominantly black, Latino.  And in Flushing, you know, as I was growing up probably by the time I got to my senior and junior high school, eighth grade or so, Asian, right?  So, Black, Latino, Asian for sure in Flushing specifically (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In Qu- okay in Flushing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, and what about West Indian?
Speaker 2: Less so.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it really wasn't until I got into high school that I really understood really in the beauty and the breadth of blackness, right?  And you know, it wasn't American black, which was what I just primarily used to.  And even like you know, my West Indian counterparts, who were born in the U.S., I was just never around that, right?  I was just never around that right, I don't if that's unique to that school that I went to or just my realizing it, when I got older.  Longest way of saying maybe, (laughter) but I hadn't noticed it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, 'cause Jamaica, Queens also at one point--
Speaker 2: Yeah, for sure.
Speaker 1: --it was largely Jamaican.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah and I think it still very much is.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: But, by the time I went Flushing, completely different.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Completely different, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 666921
Speaker 1: I just want to talk a little bit more about living and growing up in the projects.  So, because many people don't know what that life is like.  So, there's every kind of apartment from small ones to larger (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean give me a, a picture of how did you live.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What, what was your home like?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no I mean I'll show you one of the photos that I have.  So, in Flushing [Queens, New York] is a ten story apartment and apartment building.  There are four buildings, right?  So, you know you have your building one, two, three, four.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: So, it's like kids my age always rep the building that they were in.  And each building had a personality which was crazy and funny and kind of awesome at the time too.  You know, you buzz yourself in, like, "Who is it?"   Right?  You're either tricking someone to get in or you say who it is, it buzzes you in this loud thing.  Open the elevator you know, if there's gonna be pee in the elevator today, or not, right?  I, I still remember that foul, foul, like it's the worse, right?  Even today when I go and visit back home, it's just, it's like how hasn't this improved?  This is ridiculous.  And then you go to your home, you have a small home, a two bedroom home.  You know, my room, my mom's [Bettie Walker Harris] room, the bathroom all nooked in this corner, like right together.  And it's a lot of want, right, the only thing that was really in the town was the, the corner store, right across the street from us.  A Pathmark grocery store about three or four blocks away.  A bowling alley and some Chinese food restaurants (laughter), right?  And maybe a McDonald's.  And of course you know, we had the playground in the backyard with the basketball court, and that sort of thing.  But, you know, look I mean daytime it felt like any other place that you can go to, it you're unsuspecting and you didn't have to go inside, you're just walking through the facilities, et cetera.  I mean nighttime that could change, right?  And you know, certain times during the day that could change too.
Speaker 1: Well, and change, so I mean I live in Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Before, before it was whatever Harlem is considered today.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Regularly, gun shots.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In, not in the projects, just in Harlem.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was that a regular?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I remember that.  I mean there's a, it's probably of all the sounds that I remember at like when I hear it, I know it.  And it's not only that I know it.  Something kind of gets conjured up in me it's that gun shots, you just like--it's a frequent thing (laughter).  It was a frequent thing.  I don't know how it is still now in Flushing in where I'm back home. Like, yeah man, like you know, lying down 10:30 at night and just hearing it and have it wake you up, right?  And hearing all the screams that happened after.  And we were on like the top floor too.  So now you start to hear these sounds gun shots, the screams, and you can't see it, it's chaos.  What's gonna happen next, right?  And it was always the, there wasn't the necessarily the sound of the gun shot that, scares me at all, at all it's not necessarily like the all the kind of screams that happen immediate--it's but like what happens after that, right?  Is it gonna come back?  Is the person okay, right?  Then you hear the ambulances, et cetera.  That's stuff terrifies me.  Not only me, but the folks who have to experience that in person, which is also something that is like terrifying (laughter).
Story_ID: 666922
Speaker 1: Well, we always want to know about the sights, sounds and smells of when you're growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you've told me one smell.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: That was unpleasant, one sound that's pretty unpleasant.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's awesome.
Speaker 1: What are some other sights, sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: No, I mean, I remember, even you (unclear) living where I do now [Palo Alto, California], you start to lose appreciation for even public transportation, right?  You know, you always live so close to train tracks that (imitates train sound).  And because it is public transportation in Queens [New York], you hear it all the time right.  You start to get immune to it.  So, now when I go back to New York [New York] and hear it, it's like whoa, like everything's just so new to me, right?  Even, you know, you think about, you know, crossing the street, in New York, you cross the street whenever you know, right?  Out here, no, people will call you out for it.  You gotta wait like.  So, even the sounds of cars passing you by and skirting through those things is something that here I don't really get as much of.  And I remember that vividly.   Even going on the buses, right?  We had the Q25, Q34 in Jamaica [Queens, New York], it's the 112, 113 or something like that, I remember.  And I remember I don't know how it is on buses now but having like press the button for the buzzer thing to go off.  Ding for your next stop, the pop up light.  Like, I remember these things very vividly.  And if you missed your stop, you missed, you missed your stop, right?  And but these sounds that you hear that I'm talking about like that's the city.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And like there's really nowhere else on the planet that you get all of that potentially in the same minute.
Story_ID: 666923
Speaker 1: Your mom [Bettie Walker Harris] worked for NYCHA.  So, were you all also on welfare?
Speaker 2: Yeah--yeah I was, or my family was, after some time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, how did that work, 'cause you know--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: So, here's an opportunity to bust a stereotype which is always a great thing to do?
Speaker 1: Uh-oh (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, because a lot of times people think.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: People say, many people say, people on welfare don't work?  Don't want to work.  You know I mean there, there is a tremendous stereotype that goes along with having government assistance.  Can you, can you talk about that?
Speaker 1: My mother worked three jobs at the same time, all right.  In hindsight I think about, I'm like, how is that even possible.  She worked for the New York City Housing Authority from eight to four [o'clock], right?  Now, this was in Jamaica, Queens [New York], we lived in Flushing [Queens, New York].  We get on the bus and then get on another bus and that commutes probably about an hour or so back home.  Then she had to start working at Time Warner [Time Warner, Inc.] I believe it was, from six until nine.  Now, this is when I'm in the after school program.  This is during the weekday, so literally from eight to nine.  Now on the weekend she worked at Caldor [Caldor, Inc.].  Three jobs just to get by, and to ensure that we as children had everything that we needed, and she could pay the rent, et cetera.  So, look I mean anyone that says that kind of folks on welfare, you know, don't work.   You know, I have the complete rebuttal to that argument.
Speaker 2: And so there was whatever support was given from welfare and also just to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 2: For perspective on that.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: It's not like you get a check and you can do anything you want with it?
Speaker 1: Oh no, no, no, it's for grocery and--
Speaker 2: Can you talk what do you get?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean like if you just need groceries here and there you can use it for that.  I mean it's not being paid for rent, right?  We're not buying clothes, right?  Not buying video games on our welfare stamps, that sort of thing.  No, I mean look there's also I think the folks on welfare don't want to be on welfare.  It's not like something that we aspire to.  It's there for a reason all right.  'Cause folks sometimes need that sustenance and it's just the right thing to do.
Speaker 2: Is it knowing--as you were growing up, knowing that you did have that support from welfare--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --was that ever a stigma for you?
Speaker 1: It wasn't a stigma, I mean look, I mean I'm not embarrassed by necessity.  And it's a necessity my mother had to survive.  She had three children she had to take care of.  I will forever respect her for that fact.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.   But, I mean less about your mom than (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Like, I mean I made the same decision.
Speaker 2: --when you're in school, kids tease people about everything?
Speaker 1: No, no I mean there's nothing to tease us for because I was going to school with the same people in the same building that I lived in.  (Laughter) Right, I mean that's the kind of wonder of like the city.  In my upbringing that despite the hardship the camaraderie was there, right?  The loyalty was there.  The understanding was there.  These are all things completely, completely critical I think to my eventual success.  But, also making that work, right?  Not have to worry about semblance of stigma.
Speaker 2: How (pause) was it that you were able to avoid some of the other stereotypes?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That, drugs.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Selling drugs, because that has become, a way for many people to get out of circumstances (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sure.
Speaker 2: I mean it's a business.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Though illegal.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Alcohol, you know the kind, the things that people often do when they are not happy in their circumstances?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, the first thing I say is there are other ways, right?  And look there are things that I enjoy doing, right?  Educating myself, you know, this thing about kind of folks in the projects becoming drug dealers.  It's not causation, that's correlation sometimes, right?  I think people really need to understand that difference, right?  Like they're very different things, correlation and causation.  But, I thoroughly enjoyed educating myself.  And I enjoyed sports, like there are other ways to do it.  And I think you know, one of the great things about, you know, my mother, my family that sort of thing.  You think about alcoholism like so- something that my family has seen.  We think about potential kind of drug dealing that sort of thing.  It's potentially some of the things my family has seen, right?  So, my family knew what to shield me from, which I'm very, very, thankful for.  And I think I'm particularly thankful for it because my mother had my brother [Sean McMillon] and my sister [Racquita McMillon] to help kind of grow up before me.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, I even got the benefit of those learnings too, which I'm whole heartedly appreciative of.  And it just worked out for us differently.
Story_ID: 666924
Speaker 1: Earlier you mentioned the boys club.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Which for so many people has been just a beacon of light.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: When did you get involved and tell me that--how did that happen (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I really started in earnest at with the Boys' Club of New York when I was eleven, twelve years old.  So, that's sixth, seventh grade [at J.H.S. 185, Edward Bleeker School, Queens, New York].  And today I still say it's the greatest return on investment in the history of investing.  You know, we spend seventy-five cents for my membership.  And I think about the return we got on that seventy-five cents.  Not only with things like Hotchkiss [Hotchkiss School, Lakeville, Connecticut] and beyond which you know, we'll talk about.  It's in terms--like it is huge and infinite.  And I'm very, very thankful for the boys clubs has done for me.  So, I started when I was about twelve years old, 'cause my mom [Bettie Walker Harris] was working all those jobs, I needed a place to stay.  And then I go meet her and we'd go home.  So, I'd go and I always had these great grades and then I'd play basketball.  So, I played for the basketball team they had.  The basketball team did pretty well, we won championship, you know, that sort of thing.  And then year later the boys club organized this thing called the Academic All-Stars.  And it was the first year that they were doing this.  Where there are four boys club houses.  There was Flushing [Queens, New York], there was Lower East Side [New York, New York] and I believe two in Harlem [New York, New York].  And the folks who played basketball kind of like really vied for a spot on this special basketball team, Academic All-Stars, where they would travel to all of these you know, preparatory schools in New England, right?  And compete against their basketball teams not only show their talent but also introduce kids into you know this new type of educational experience, right?  So, some folks got recruited to the teams there, et cetera.  So, I tried out, you know, I was the youngest kid to try out. And the tryouts were in Harlem actually.  And you know there's three tryouts, I made it to third but I couldn't go to the third one because my mom and me realized you know, twelve, thirteen year old wasn't gonna take the train from Flushing to Harlem every night, come back home just to train for a basketball game and the coach he also advised that we don't do it his name was Anthony Blake.  Now he was in my wedding actually.  And Anthony said, "Tristan [HistoryMaker Tristan Walker] what are your grades?"  I was like, "Yeah, I've been getting like at 97, 98 [percent] average that sort of thing."  He was like, "All right.  You know, we have this education program that we just really started it like either a year ago, or a couple of years back.  We're coming to Flushing, there's this test called the SSAT [Secondary School Admission Test], I think you should take it, just take it, right."  I was like, "All right, I'll take it."
Speaker 1: So, you didn't study for the SSAT, you just took it?
Speaker 2: No, I just took it.  Yeah, I didn't know what it was at the time, right?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But, also wasn't really that great a test taker either.  So, I took it and Anthony was administering it.  And then I remember giving it in.  And he asked me again he was like, "What were your grades?"  And I was like 97, 98.  He was like, "You're gonna have no problem.  We'll get you this school."  That's literally how it happened.  About I don't even re- remember the grade I got out of the SSAT, to be honest.  And I don't remember I never applied personally to any of the boarding schools.  There were two schools that accepted me.  One was called the Cate School in Santa Barbara, California [sic. Carpinteria, California].  And the other was Hotchkiss. And at the time I had to visit both of those schools in the same week.  And I really wanted to go to Cate because the basketball was hyping me up.  He was talking about like video games, and PlayStation all that stuff.  And look I'm like this thirteen, fourteen year old like of course I wanna go and it's California.  But, Hotchkiss said, "Actually we need to hear from you in two days.  So, if you could come up tomorrow and just visit the school--."  And it was like at spring break there.  Come visit the school let us know what you want to do.  So, I went and visited.  I was like it's a pretty nice school and I toured there with one of the trustees of not only Hotchkiss but also the boys club.  And then the following day when I had to make my decision both the boys club, the trustee and everybody else was like, "Tristan you have to, you have to say yes to Hotchkiss," kind of thing.  Full scholarship all that stuff.  And I accepted, and completely changed my life.  Literally how it happened (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, you do know that that's not how it usually happens right (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, I mean I, I, I am so blessed.  In all the experiences that I've had and like I'm fortunate.  'Cause look, who would have ever envisioned you know, you just ra- moved from Jamaica [Queens, New York] to Flushing.  Then my mom knew the head of the boys club athletic program, 'cause they went to high school together.  And then he said bring him to the boys club, and I joined the boys club.  I happened to play basketball and then I tried out.  And I got a full ride to one of the top schools, high schools in the world, on the full ride.
Speaker 1: So, now you (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's a blessing.
Story_ID: 666925
Speaker 1: You leave Flushing [Queens, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And go to Connecticut?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Lakeville, Connecticut (laughter).
Speaker 1: Lakeville, Connecticut, which is as much of a polar opposite as you could get.
Speaker 2: That's when I understood what New England was (Laughter) versus New York [New York], so yes.
Speaker 1: How did you get there? Did your mom [Bettie Walker Harris] take you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so my mom, so my mom and the trustee took me there the first time.  And then my mom and her friend would always take me up every time we'd drive up there.  It's about a two to two and a half hour ride depending on which route you took.  So, every time.
Speaker 1: And so tell me about arriving?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: When, when, when you are now enrolled and you're, you're moving in?
Speaker 2: I was thrilled.  In fact you know one of my colleagues, is you know, one of my best friends he works here now.  Which is like this wonderful kind of full circle thing.  The thing that I was so excited about, about Hotchkiss [Hotchkiss School, Lakeville, Connecticut] is I got to be independent.  You know, I've been living away from home since I was thirteen, right, which is, look I mean there's good things in that and bad.  Fortunately for me there is a hell of a lot more good than there was bad in that.  But this idea of independence especially growing up where I did, where I couldn't go outside as often as I'd like to.  Where I couldn't do the things that I wanted to all the time.  And that was the right choice, right?  But, now I have that freedom, that ability to express myself a little bit more broadly.  The ability to communicate in ways that I probably wouldn't have communicated before.  The ability to build relationships that weren't just with my immediate family.  It's freeing for me, right?  And I got to learn, right?  At scale, that to me is nirvana, right?  And I was perhaps weird in that way.  But I wanted to soak all that in.  You know, I got to Hotchkiss not knowing what a verb was.  I kid you not, right?  You know, I left that first freshman year knowing all about predicate nominatives, right?  'Cause I devoured it.  And I wanted it.
Speaker 1: And so your 97, 98 [percent] in public school [J.H.S. 185, Edward Bleeker School], in Queens [New York]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what did that translate into first semester Hotchkiss?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember I made the honor roll every s- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You did?
Speaker 2: --single semester at Hotchkiss.  We had two honor rolls. It was like the A and beyond and there was like the B plus and beyond.  I always made the B plus and beyond I think, maybe two semesters or so I made the A and beyond it was like average across all things.  But, every semester I ensured I got that honor roll.  It wasn't tied to my scholarship or anything but I just did it.
Speaker 1: And so, did, did you see a difference in the rigor?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, 100 percent.  I mean way more difficult, way more difficult, right?  I mean having to know what a verb was I mean that's really like really telling.  Like the fact that I went thirteen years of my life really not understanding that very basic concept.  Whereas a lot of my kind of classmates, and mind you these are classes, the Socratic Method, right?  Round oval table twelve to thirteen kids on a class you had to participate, right?  There's this very intense work, we're taking Emerson [Ralph Waldo Emerson] and Thoreau [Henry David Thoreau] and, you know, all types of American history stuff, calculus, all, all this jazz, right?  Things that you just don't necessarily--you're not privy to.  You know I was particularly good on all the math science stuff, right?  'Cause I've always, you know, that's one thing about like growing up where you do, you really got to understand your number very, very quick, right, necessarily really well.  But, it wasn't, I got into like the English philosophy where, I started to learn things I'd never even heard about before.  And that was challenging at first, but I learned how to figure it out.
Story_ID: 666926
Speaker 1: Talk about the social dynamics.
Speaker 2: Yeah--yeah so school of about five hundred.
Speaker 1: For all four years?
Speaker 2: All four years.  In my freshman class probably about 100, 125, which is small, right and your living with the of all majority of them in some way.  In your dorm rooms, other dorm rooms, you know.  Everyone was required to be on the team, every single semester or quarter that we have.  Where you got to build a relationship that way, you have the ten, twelve people in your class.  And then you have these lunch and dinner and everybody has their tables, right?  You have the athlete table, you have the kids that like really loved and appreciated kind of drama.  You have the black table (laughter), right?  We had these tables and look I mean in my class of 125 people was probably fewer than 10 percent of each class were black, Latino, which is small.  I mean we're talking ten, twelve folks, right?  So, you're immediately, in the sense of belonging, kind of gravitate to this community.  And that kind of persisted all for four years.
Speaker 1: So, even though you were an athlete you sat with the black people?
Speaker 2: Well so, all of us were athletes, by definition we had to be.  I wasn't in Hotchkiss [Hotchkiss School, Lakeville, Connecticut] because my ability to play basketball. Hotchkiss had no idea I played basketball.  I got in purely on the merits (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Academics.
Speaker 2: --of kind of the, kind of academic stuff.  But, the athletics gave me another way to communicate with folks outside of the obvious kind of black, Latino, kind of group that made me feel very comfortable.  And thank goodness for that group to make me comfortable, 'cause it's a hard transition for a lot of people.  It's the first time we got to see how the other half lived, right?  And it's an eye opening thing for me.  But, you need that comfort, you need that camaraderie, you need that loyalty.  You immediately gravitate to it.  Not only the students but also the teachers and the professors, right?  And they were really, really great for us.  But, the way Hotchkiss set it up made it a lot easier.  Like everyone had study hall certain period a time.  Everybody had athletics at a certain period of time.  The small classes forced you to kind of collaborate and communicate with folks all little bit more deeply.  But, look we're fourteen to seventeen years old trying to figure out ourselves, right?  So, you learn in that.  But, living away from home from thirteen you learn that very quick.
Speaker 1: And being part of the other half, you know, which is even less that half.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (laughter).
Speaker 1: Even less than half, even less than half.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: I mean you call the other half but it's the 1 percent perhaps--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Got to specify that.
Speaker 1: --the other 1 percent (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Was that intimidating at first?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean it's a, it was a, I went to school with Rockefellers and Fords and that sort of thing.  And you see their names on the wall, et cetera.  And to me it was mesmerizing, right?  It was the first time I understood what wealth meant.  You know, you, you grow up, it's like yeah I wanna get rich.  But, I didn't really realize what wealth was, generational wealth, you know.  And you look at these names on the wall and you know, Rockefellers you start to realize okay maybe your last name isn't Rockefeller but you're a Rockefeller, that sort of stuff.  It's like wow, like this stuff can sustain.  And for me it was really, really an interesting thing because you know, you think about my genealogy and like you know, outside of my [maternal] grandmother [Hattie Walker] and kind of my great-grandmother but extended family.  There's not too much kind of like knowledge that I have about that.  But, to see like the generation of these families and to see them coming to campus and supporting each other at the scale that they had in terms of their own wealth, was interesting.  And from that moment I was like all right, this is possible.  Especially, being in the same classes with those kids, right?  That really showed me that it was possible.  And I could compete at as equally a level as they.
Speaker 1: And did you feel welcome by them?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did, I mean I, I think of all of my comrades and kind of friends at Hotchkiss.  It was easier, easy for me, easier I would say than most to, right?  Because I was ready like I wanted it, right?  I wanted to soak it all in and I wanted to learn.  Now, it wasn't easy by any stretch of the imagination but I think it was a little bit easier, right?  Just because look, the things that I cared about at the time were, look, my academics, which a lot of them cared about.  My sports you know, I had teammates, right, that cared about me and cared about what we had.  But, then it wasn't until probably I get you know, junior year, senior year as well all grow up.  That like more and more of the implicit bias stuff, starts to creep in.  And you start to realize that, that's a thing, you know.  But, I didn't realize it at least my first year.
Story_ID: 666927
Speaker 1: How did it show its face?
Speaker 2: So--the, the bias stuff you mean?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, you know, one of the great things about boarding school, Hotchkiss [Hotchkiss School, Lakeville, Connecticut] specifically, I can't really speak to other boarding schools.  Remember we always had like this free speech board kind of thing so you have auditorium.  Somebody you just wanted to say anything about anything, right?  Like you just write, write it out, right, and put it down.  I remember there was this, this one episode of sorts where you know, in the cafeteria you got professors who go to a lot of athletes to take the hat off, right, take it off, take it off, take it off.  Just out of respect whatever, but then.  (Background noise) You want me to go tell 'em, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry (laughter) I'm really sorry.
Speaker 1: See if they're.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you know in the cafeteria there are professors that go to athlete and say take off your hat that has an H on it whenever you're at dinner.  And I remember one student being so frustrated about that because, like a lot of folks at the tables that I sat at, et cetera had do-rags on their head, right?  I'll never forget there's this like really strong debate like the merits of like wearing do-rags versus hats and how it's unfair that certain folks can wear that and other folks can't.  I remember even in that free speech that like folks didn't even spell do-rag right.  Like there was like all of this like, like just an interesting like first experience that I had of perceived unfairness.  When, usually we were the folks saying what was unfair.  Does make sense?  And that was an interesting moment for me to explore.  And look it's a rightful debate to have.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: And I appreciated it.  But, it was the first time I recognized it.
Speaker 1: Well, so it is kind of the flip of, of what, we're normally thinking about as discriminatory let's say.
Speaker 2: Right, that's right.
Speaker 1: What el- what ultimately happened?  Did they have to take off the do-rags?
Speaker 2: No (laughter), not at all, not at all.  I think some people just took it out, just out, decided just to leave it alone kind of thing.  But, I think it was more about just the debate elicited as opposed to creating a rule for it, right?  Even look I mean taking your hat isn't necessarily a rule, it's, it's subjective of things that older folks ask younger folks to do.  Or at least it was perceived to be that way at the time.  So, look again like I'm not chastising the person for writing the speech, look it's that person's First Amendment right (laughter) in free speech.  But, the great thing about Hotchkiss is that it provided that forum.  And made it possible and that was something that I had never experience before in any other school that I had been a part.
Speaker 1: Did you have, during your time there, experiences of racism?
Speaker 2: Not explicit personally that I had to experience at all.  If anything it was just the implicit stuff, right, the unfairness.  I've been very, very fortunate to not have to deal with much explicit racism in my time, knock on wood.
Speaker 1: So while you were there, in, in part it's an all boys school, correct?
Speaker 2: No, it's boys and girls (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No? Hotchkiss is boy and girls, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah it switched to coed.
Speaker 1: By the time you were there it was.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was I think it was coed probably right before the '50s [1950s] or something like that.
Speaker 1: Was it, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah sometime, maybe later, but it had some time.
Speaker 1: I think of it as a boys school.  But, okay its coed.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, are you dating while you're there?
Speaker 2: Oh no, I mean first, my first girlfriend was my wife [Amoy Toyloy Walker] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Whom you met when?
Speaker 2: After--my last semester in college [Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so I was not dating.  I had, I had folks I was courting for sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, the thing about like boarding schools, no one has any time.  There's no time, between like the homework that you have to do.  The studying you have to do.  The athletics stuff that you have to do.  I mean we had three hour practices.  We had two hour study halls.  We had five hours' worth of homework every night, right?  Like it was intense, so even if I wanted to there was no time.  And we had school six days a week.  So, where's there even time to do that stuff.
Speaker 1: So, this is total college prep?
Speaker 2: I mean I was, I came into college having the ability to skip a year, which I did.  It, it prepared me for college in ways that I, I don't think I would have ever been remotely close to hadn't I gone there.
Story_ID: 666928
Speaker 1: At what point while you're at Hotchkiss [Hotchkiss School, Lakeville, Connecticut] do you officially start thinking about college and get support from the school that--to start navigating that?  'Cause usually it starts early in private schools (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah it's sophomore year they had me start thinking about it.  And then they give you a guidance counselor I think in junior year.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And then you're kind of on your own your senior year, the rest is history.
Speaker 1: So, you had said as a young kid you were thinking about building wealth.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, we're, we're getting rich.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then it turned to building wealth.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: When you're at Hotchkiss.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: How were you thinking you were going to do that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I realized that there are only three ways to do that.  I, I had this very clear view from a young age.  You know, there's athlete, right and look I was even still playing in college [Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York] as varsity captain all that stuff.  But, really if I wanted a shot I was probably gonna be Division III, not Division I.  And even if, and even if it were Division I or Division III, the amount of work that has to go into and that trumps my studies, that sort of thing.  And then even from there what percentage of people actually make, right like to the pros.  I was good at math, right, play my numbers on that, you know, push that to the side.  Then I realize Wall Street only because you know I saw other families having parents that worked on Wall Street came in beautiful suits, beautiful cars all of that stuff, seemed easy enough.  They always purported this idea of meritocracy.  And just being exposed to people who were exposed to it, made that a potential option, right?  And the last one was entrepreneurship.  But, at least I had exhausted the sports thing by the time I got to college.  In college, I started to experiment with the Wall Street thing, a little bit after it too.  And then after Wall Street now I'm pure entrepreneurship.
Story_ID: 666929
Speaker 1: So, where'd you go to college?
Speaker 2: I went to Stony Brook University [Stony Brook, New York] in New York City or in Long Island, New York.
Speaker 1: And what made you choose Stony Brook?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so close to home for sure.  And again as I said at the time I graduated there in like three years.  So, I was able to kind of skip a year.  And it worked for me kind of (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, going from Hotchkiss [Hotchkiss School, Lakeville, Connecticut] to Stony Brook.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Stony Brook is a public.
Speaker 2: It's a public university.
Speaker 1: College, right university.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah totally.
Speaker 1: Large.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What's, what's the transition like for you?
Speaker 2: Not at all, 'cause it--remember like I've been living away from home since I was thirteen.  So, you know I can do that anywhere, right?  And while--
Speaker 1: But, the size didn't matter so much?
Speaker 2: No, didn't matter at all, right.  Because and I've always been the case where even at Hotchkiss you know, I wasn't befriending five hundred people in a really serious way.  It was like five or six, right you can take that anywhere.  Large schools, small schools, et cetera.  And I had large schools before Hotchkiss, right?
Speaker 1: Right, right?
Speaker 2: So it's not something that was really kind of foreign to me, so to speak.  And by that time I was mature enough, right, to you know, prepare for it.
Speaker 1: What year did you enter Stony Brook?
Speaker 2: Two thousand and five [2005].
Speaker 1: Two thousand and five [2005].
Speaker 2: Yeah I entered 2002.
Speaker 1: And you, what were your years at Hotchkiss?
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-eight [1998] to 2002.
Story_ID: 666930
Speaker 1: So you were at Hotchkiss [Hotchkiss School, Lakeville, Connecticut] at the time of 9/11 [September 11, 2001]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember that day (laughter).
Speaker 1: Tell me?
Speaker 2: I was in calculus class.  And, and my teacher there was a knock on the door.  And I remember this specifically, yeah it was senior year, I was just starting senior year, in calculus class it was AP cal [advanced placement].  Someone knocked on the door it was one of the math, the head math teacher, his name is Mr. Bolmer [David Bolmer], Professor Bolmer.  Knocked on the door, my math teacher walked outside and talked to him, we didn't know what was going on 'cause we were in class.  And she came back in I'll never forget her face, she was distraught, right?  And she started to talk and, and her voice started to waver a little bit.  And she said, "Yeah, I have some bad news. A plane flew into the World Trade Center [New York, New York]," right?  And at the time I was like oh that's odd, right?  And I didn't put two and two together that like my mom [Bettie Walker Harris] worked right near there.  So, with her speech she also said, "We're gonna kind of stop class right now," so folks kind of speak to their family that sort of thing.  I was like okay what's going on here?  So, we went downstairs there's a student and activity center where everybody congregated.  There were some rumblings.  And I was pretty close with like the deans and all that stuff.  So, I walked in and there's a TV of what happened.  So, you see the smoke come out of the buildings, it's like, whoa!  Then I realize that my mom worked nearby.  So, I was calling; busy.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I was calling; busy.  So, I'm like and I remember the second time or third time I called and it was busy.  I saw the second plane fly into the World Trade Ce- like on TV.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It was one of the most surreal moments.  So, I'm like oh crap, like busy, right?  So, can't hear from her.  And then they fall.  It's like, whoa!  What's going on here?  And I ran back to my dorm room.  And fortunately I called and she picked up.  And she said that she had gotten away and that sort of thing, which is great.  But, there was this moment of like terror, literally, right, like in my kind of being.  Like, what if.  I'll never forget that day.
Speaker 1: And there any parents of students at Hotchkiss affected.
Speaker 2: (Nods head) I don't remember specifically to whom.  But I remember there being a couple.  For sure.
Speaker 1: 'Cause there are a lot of people from that world.
Speaker 2: That's right.  I mean especially like New York [New York] centered type families (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: One hundred percent.
Story_ID: 666931
Speaker 1: So, you're at Stony Brook [Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York]. What are you studying?
Speaker 2: Economics as my major and yeah, and that was when I was thinking, all right Wall Street, Wall Street, Wall Street.  I mean learn about finance and econ, and that sort of time.  So, I devoured it.  And had a basis in math which I really appreciated.
Speaker 1: And while at Stony Brook, did you have internships?
Speaker 2: I did, so, every single internship that I had was all Wall Street.  So, that first summer I got into this internship program INROADS [INROADS, Inc.] and they got me a back office job with Lehman Brothers [Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.] in New Jersey.  Halfway through the summer I met with the few folks in the front office, like investment bankers, traders.  They liked me and they gave me a chance to come and work the rest of the summer on the trading floor, right?
Speaker 1: And tell me about INROADS, what is that program?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so INROADS is a program for black, Latino undergraduate students that you know, want to secure high quality internships during the summer.  They work with some Wall Street firms they work with some kind of Fortune 500 companies across all verticals, right, from HR [human resources] to finance to operations, et cetera.  So, that first one I had expressed interest on Wall Street and they gave me the Lehman Brothers internship.
Speaker 1: And so, you're, you're in the back office.
Speaker 2: Back office.
Speaker 1: Then same summer you're in the front office?
Speaker 2: Same summer, yeah so, yeah I told them I had a passion for kind of front stuff, investment banking, kind of like trading that sort of thing.  So, they gave me a taste.  So, I did like you know, like a day or two in the front office and then remaining days in the back office.  'Cause I still had projects that I needed to complete.  It wasn't until the next summer, when you know, well I got a job offer from them.  But, I also got a job offer for the front office for trading.  I was really proud of that.  And that second summer I did a trading internship with them with SEO, that's Sponsors for Educational Opportunity, similar type of program to INROADS.  But, focus primarily on investment banking and trading.  So, I did that got an offer to come back and I worked for Lehman Brothers in London [England] my last semester at university.
Speaker 1: So, you were with Lehman Brothers the whole, the whole time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Whole time, whole time, whole time.  And then I worked for them full time for about a year and half after, after college too.
Story_ID: 666932
Speaker 1: Let's stick with London [England].  A lot of students go overseas before they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --finish college.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Was this part of that dream that you had when you were a kid? Did--?
Speaker 2: Not at all, not at all.  I mean I got by the time I was approaching my final semester in university [Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York] and this is you know I graduated three years.  I only had ten credits left.  I'm either gonna stay here and be bored in my dorm room or just take a shot and a chance.  And really the impetus behind my going was Lehman Brothers [Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.] was willing to give me an internship there, which is gonna help me for my full time bank and pay me, right.  So, there's a program in State University of New York [State University of New York System] where folks can go to London and they put you in kind of these flats.  And for other folks they help potentially find jobs, well I already had one, fortunately.  So, it was an easy excuse for me to get to Europe getting paid, learning at the same time, without having to take classes.  Seemed like a pretty good trade.
Speaker 1: And what was your experience like in London (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was awesome, it was awesome.  Pretty lonely though.  Specifically because I didn't know anybody and it's a hard place for you to be if you really don't know anyone and you can't communicate and I was working full time too.  So, it's like how are you gonna meet folks, right?  Unfortunately the cohort that I went to, or went with other SUNY students we all lived in the same kind of vicinity with each other.  And we had to go to one E class on Friday.  And we like toured places together.  You know I got to go to Rome [Italy] and Paris [France] and you know Budapest [Hungary] and all these places on my own or with some of my kind of colleagues in the cohort.  So, that was helpful but I didn't have any kind of direct friends.  But, it wasn't until I went there that I kind of started communicating with my wife [Amoy Toyloy Walker].  And then she became my best friend while I was there.
Story_ID: 666933
Speaker 1: She was part of that trip?
Speaker 2: No, she wasn't.  So, this was the first semester.  So, Facebook had come out in the fall of 2004.  And it didn't reach Stony Brook [Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York] until January of 2005, I believe or a little bit before that.  So, by the time I was in London [England] from January to June like Facebook was out.  And there's this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) London was in 2005?
Speaker 2: Correct January to June, when I graduated.  And as the story goes with my wife you know, if you kind of go on Facebook and run a search just of her name right.
Speaker 1: And what is her name?
Speaker 2: At the time it was Amoy A-M-O-Y, Toyloy [Amoy Toyloy Walker]. That's her last name.  When she ran a search I was right beneath her, right?  So, then running kind of joke was at the time, I don't know if they still have, Facebook had this feature like poking feature, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: So, she poked me (laughter), right, literally.  And I was like, who is the person?  And then you look and you see that we had the same exact mutual friends for all three years.  And we just never met each other.  So, you just started to communicate and connect over that just as friends, right?  What's going on at Stony Brook?
Speaker 1: While you were in London?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause while I was in London you know, the time is ahead or whatever so I get in the office [Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.] and as a trader you're there at five in the morning, right?  So, that, that time was able to pass.  So, Facebook had an email inbox so we'd communication over that email inbox.  And, even when I had like Internet cafes back then.  Oh god I'm--it's crazy, Internet cafes.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: You'd go and go and it's a messenger that sort of thing when you could--.  So, we built a pretty kind of tight bond over that.  Like what's happening back home?  What's happening in London?  I've never been?  And, that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: How do you spell her maiden name?
Speaker 2: T-O-Y-L-O-Y.  So, her whole name rhymes (laughter).
Speaker 1: Where is, where is she from?
Speaker 2: Jamaica.
Story_ID: 666934
Speaker 1: So your courtship begins--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --overseas, through Facebook, new media.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's right, now.  She [Walker's wife, Amoy Toyloy Walker], thank goodness for her, man, she's the, she's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I'm so grateful for that.  You talk about blessing, like and timing.  And what if she hadn't poked me, right?  It's, you know, I try not to think about that 'cause I get fast depressed.  I'm, I'm very, very thankful.  So, became best friends. By the time I got back it was May of 2005.  Graduating three weeks later.  And the, the thing that's interesting about this whole thing, I always told myself even in college [Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York], that like I really wanted to find the person I wanted to marry, before I graduated.  And here I am meeting her two weeks before I graduated (laughter).  You talk about like the blessings, it's amazing.  So, we weren't even together at the time.  We both graduate fast friends.
Speaker 1: Oh she graduates the same year?
Speaker 2: Same year, right?  And probably the reason why we hadn't hung out together is 'cause she had been there all four years, I graduated three years.  But, I was still a bit quiet and in the cuts, right?  I wasn't really out there all the time.  So, we both graduate together.  You know, I love her family.  She loves me vice versa, that sort of thing.  She met my grandmother [Hattie Walker] literally the first day we met.  My grandmother visited from Aliceville [Alabama] to Queens [New York].  And I remember she walked in, my grandmother was there with my mother [Bettie Walker Harris].  And the whole family just loved her right away, and kind of vice versa. It was pretty cool.  So, my grandmother got to meet her and be around her before she passed, which is a great, great thing for me.  So, we said you know what--we graduated about to go to work.  At the time she was thinking about going to Teachers College, in Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] for her master's [degree].  Really let's just do something.  So, we booked a trip with friends to the Bahamas and at the end of that trip we were together.  A year later we got engaged.
Story_ID: 666935
Speaker 1: So, you're working at Lehman Brothers [Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.], which at the time is one of the largest--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --financial services companies (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's the best bank on the street.
Speaker 1: --right, in the world.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Things are beginning to change, are you noticing any of the changes while you're there?
Speaker 2: No, so the thing that's interesting is I didn't leave Lehman Brothers until spring, or summer 2007.  So, that is when I got married [to Amoy Toyloy Walker].  And the crash really didn't happen until the fall and 2008, right?
Speaker 1: After?
Speaker 2: So, they're still flying high, and in fact during my summer internships I was on the mortgage trading desk.  And from what I remember it was the most profitable trading desk on the all of Wall Street.  Like I was on that desk with like eight people on it, which was a fascinating, fascinating time.  But, when I went to work full time you know, I started on the mortgage desk that I was on, for about two weeks.  And the head of the whole floor said, "Hey Tristan [HistoryMaker Tristan Walker] we're starting this new department called energy trading we want you to join in, are you willing to?"  I'm like, "All right, sure, like, why not?"  So, I was one of the first kind of like analysts on that desk.  Started two weeks before Hurricane Katrina, right?  And there's an oil trader, right?  I got to see that whole crazy market kind of go through what it did.  I left Lehman about a year, year and half after I started.  And joined JPMorgan [JPMorgan Chase and Co.].
Story_ID: 666936
Speaker 1: What are you doing as an energy trader [at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.]? What--
Speaker 2: Yeah yeah.
Speaker 1: --describe that job?
Speaker 2: Sure.  So, so there--so there's physical barrels of oil that go from one place to another, right?  And that oil is worth something, right, wholesale.  But, that price fluctuates each day as a commodity, right?  So, in order to kind of trade on those, right based on information that comes in the market every day or every week, or every month.  There are financial instruments that are pegged to that barrel, right?  So, it's similar to how we have, you know stock prices for you know, physical stocks and those--or physical companies that sell products.  You have futures or derivatives that are sold on top of this commodity.  So, it is my job to help buy and sell those derivatives for the financial gain of the company, right, based on new information that comes in, geopolitical risk and all of that stuff.  So, it's really like fascinating kind of learning experience, not only for this, what will be one of the more important themes politically, geopolitically for the globe, but also at a time when the market was just growing so fast.  So again, like I've just been so blessed to be like at right place, right time at these various moments.  Even with the peaks and troughs of like kind of like my career and my life.  But, I've always been there.
Speaker 1: And so Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] happens?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you know, the Gulf is devastated.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: How does that affect the market and how does that affect you and your work?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so when I started the price of oil was forty dollars. About a year later it was a hundred.  Primarily and that was really a catalyst for that.  'Cause you remember it was Rita [Hurricane Rita] and then Katrina.  Or, maybe it was Katrina, Rita, I forget which one came first or second.  But, like that same month or couple months back to back.  And that was really the trigger for the entire energy market from oil to natural gas to power to really, really kick off.  And it was a time when you know, I had folks in like, you know, the OPEC [Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries] countries really like tightening the kind of access inventory that's out there.  'Cause they also have their financial interest, right?  So, there's this squeeze on the market, which is a bit unfortunate and drove up everybody's prices.  So, man all this high dollar gasoline, but it really started back then.
Speaker 1: And for you as a trader this is a good thing?
Speaker 2: Depending on what side of the market that you're on (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) 'Cause they kind of ebb and flow, and what your timing is.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: But yeah.  I mean naturally you want to be on the buy side of that equation for sure.
Story_ID: 666937
Speaker 1: And why did you leave Lehman [Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.]?
Speaker 2: I--well so, it's probably indicative of why I left Wall Street, period over time.  I realized very quickly that I hated it.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You know I was a victim of bad culture.  I realized I wanted to create great ones.  And working full time on Wall Street is very different from being an intern on Wall Street, right?  Naturally, look, you don't have the license to like do the trading, right?  So you have to support like all these great traders who'll take care of you, that sort of thing.  Once you're in the hot seat, you in the hot seat.  And like there's a culture at least on the trading floor, that wasn't one that I was willing to persist with my entire life.
Speaker 1: Describe the culture?
Speaker 2: A very type A, men, men, men, white men, white men, white men, so, not very diverse at all.  And when you have a non-diverse incredibly type A culture, as in when you really think about what the job actually is it's make mo- like to make money with other people's money.  To hopefully at the end of the, end of the year make money for yourself.  It's really devoid of purpose for me, right?  So, the combination of type A, non-diverse, lacking purpose was really the catalyst of my leaving.
Story_ID: 666938
Speaker 1: But, before you left you went to JPMorgan Chase [JPMorgan Chase and Co.] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and were you trading there?  What were you doing?
Speaker 2: I was, so it was a hallelujah moment for me, specifically because the boss that I'd be working for is one of the folks I got most close with.  He worked at JPMorgan, he was one of the most senior black traders in the company's history.  And he'd be the only person that I have to work with and for.  Well respected on the floor, et cetera.  Worked with him for about six months and you know, I remember exactly when this happened it was June 2017, I believe because the next month I was getting married.  And he told me this beforehand and--
Speaker 1: June of '17 [2017]?
Speaker 2: Of, oh sorry, 2007.
Speaker 1: Seven [2007].
Speaker 2: Yeah, 2007.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he said, "You know Tristan [HistoryMaker Tristan Walker], I got let go," right?  And at that moment I was thinking all right we got new management in and they tap him on the shoulder.  And I was like you've been working here fifteen years, as managing director that's well, very respected, they get new management and all of a sudden they decide that they didn't want you there anymore.  I was like I'm never gonna let that happen to me.  Never gonna let that happen to me.  So, he got let go, I was all by myself for about six months.  And I got let go, in January early January, actually it was early January and two weeks later I got into Stanford [Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford, California] (laughter) and completely you know changed everything.
Speaker 1: So, obviously you had already applied, and you were waiting?
Speaker 2: I had, so I had 'cause I, right when he had gotten fired, or let go, I said already like entrepreneurship is it for me now.  I want to get as far away from Wall Street literally and figuratively as possible.  I heard about this Stanford school, it's well known for entrepreneurship, period.  And I was like I'm gonna apply there.  I didn't apply anywhere else.  And then J- mid-January I got the call and it was a special call for me specifically because I had already gotten let go from JPMorgan.  But, I was really worried because my wife [Amoy Toyloy Walker] and I had bought an apartment and we were renovating it and all that stuff.  And like how we gonna pay for all this stuff.  And (unclear) on Wall Street.
Speaker 1: Was she in school?
Speaker 2: She was in school at that time.  And on Wall Street you get like--actually no, she was working at the time, but she was out of school at the time.  On Wall Street you get your bonuses in February so I'm like, wow am I even gonna get a bonus, right?  I was very, very concerned about that.  So, in mid-January I get a call and it's probably six in the morning and my temporary boss at the time was based in London [England], right?  So, I thought it was a call really talking about the bonus.  So, I'm having a conversation for about a minute, minute and half with this gentleman, right?  I'm just waiting like when is he gonna say am I gonna get a bonus or not.  And then the other gentleman on the call says, "Tristan, you do know this is Derrick Bolton, right?"  And Derrick Bolton was the head of admissions for Stanford business school.  And he's like, "I'm calling to congratulate you that you're getting into Stanford business school."  'Cause you're not--that same day, the London boss, 'cause I was expecting to speak to him, he called me about two hours after that and told me I was getting my bonus, blessings.  And not only a bonus, nine months of severance.  Yeah, I'm, I'm like so blessed (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so then you being let go was why, what, what?
Speaker 2: Well, I had nothing to do at the time, 'cause I had no one to--like the one boss who brought me in wasn't around anymore, so I was hanging out, just playing around, right?  Trying to do the best work that I could, but by then I was already resigned, like folks saw me bringing the GMAT [Graduate Management Admission Test] books to school--or to, to the office to study and that sort of thing.  So, the writing was a bit on the wall anyway.  I just didn't think that I would get terminated before I got like a bonus or something like that.  And by then I thought I would have gotten into Stanford or not.  And figure out another situation from there.
Story_ID: 666939
Speaker 1: So Stanford [Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford, California], did, did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --did you get an academic scholarship for that?  Do they give that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I, I did get aid, yeah they don't give academic scholarships; it's need based.
Speaker 1: Yeah, not for business, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so you, you have loans again?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so gosh, yeah.  I mean fortunately going to public university was pretty good on that.  I mean Stanford cost like 150 K [$150,000], or something like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly?
Speaker 2: Fortunately they gave me like, half.  And then there was another--I got a, another kind of bounty from Boston Consulting Group 'cause I'd secured an internship for my summer that was gonna come up after my first year.  And for it they were willing to give kind of ten thousand dollars or fifteen something like that, if you made the commitment to join them for their internship next summer.  So, I just took it.  So, I had a good chunk of my kind of business school paid off.  And I don't have loans anymore, which is great.
Speaker 1: That's pretty quick too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you move across country?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we drove.
Speaker 1: To come, you come to California.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What is the Stanford experience like for you?
Speaker 2: Oh, I love it.  It's yeah I've been living here almost a third of my life now, which is kind of crazy and surreal to think about.  I mean we moved out here in 2008.  And by then we were married for a year, right?  We were ready for a change.  You know, we moved out and I'll never forget, we forget--we went to the dorm and my wife [Amoy Toyloy Walker] cried.  She wasn't expecting like the like small stove and then like this purple couch that was like default there.  It was just awful, especially after having like renovated an apartment [in New York, New York], which we hadn't moved into yet.  So, we were still just like trying to sell, 'cause like we had gotten in and we were, it had just finished.  So, it was all this anxiety and it's like this new place with no friends, right?  Two weeks later we were like we're not moving, all right.  We just very quickly adapted to it.  Some of that's kind of changing now specifically because we kind of miss family, and kind of our upbringing and that sort of thing.  But, we've loved it ever since, ever since.
Story_ID: 666940
Speaker 1: While you were there, you participated in a class [at Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford, California] called Acting with Power.
Speaker 2: Yep, best class I've ever taken.
Speaker 1: Tell me what--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --why that was so good for you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: So, so the second semester or second year of the two year program I took this Acting with Power elective.  And Acting with Power professor Deb Gruenfeld [Deborah H. Gruenfeld], she's one of my favorite professors I still communicate with her, she's wonderful.  It's an acting class.  And really the theme is power can be taught, right?  Power is a set of gestures of like playing high and playing low, right?  And there is a psychology behind it.  Literally the class is Deb, who has you know, all this wonderful research about just power in the workplace, that sort of thing.  And then three or four actors, right, that teach drama and that sort of thing.  They have you go and act out certain plays, certain pieces with your kind of colleagues and students.  And you know, they would make me and another student act out a certain scene, three different ways.  So they say now try this, and then try this.  And you see how the character morphs every time.  And the thing that was really uniquely interesting is not how it impacts you, but how you start discern how it impacts the other person, right?  So perfect example they would teach like psychology suggests this thing where you know, if you really want to be combative with some person in a debate and that person's leaning forward you wanna lean forward, right?  But, if you want to be conciliatory, if that person leaning forward you're gonna lean back and that kind of thing.  And look, I mean it's twenty-eight days to make a habit.  So you start to kind of practice this stuff with people that I know.  I go out to dinner with my wife [Amoy Toyloy Walker] and see if she notices or like seeing this sort of thing, you start to notice that some of this stuff starts working, right?  So, even in my relationship with my wife, right?  Like ensuring if she's leaning back just to make sure that there's no perceived animosity, right.  You start to lose sight of the--how, like how body language impacts other people's feelings.  And for me as a CEO and founder now that needs to motivate, educate, excite this stuff is important, right?  Like body language is 90 percent of this thing.  And I've had to learn that very, very seriously.  And Acting with Power prepared me for that.  Well, let me--it put me in a position where I can be uniquely prepared for it, in ways that other classes did not.  And it made it tangible.
Speaker 1: And so, this is putting into action the learning that you're getting (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm. Um-hm.

Speaker 1: What's around that, what are the kinds of classes that you're taking (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, so that's a great question.  So, yeah Acting with Power, then that same semester I was taking negotiation, right, which is perfect, right?  You're having these kinds of negotiation things.  And there's tactics in negotiation.  There's tactics in like acting it out, that sort of thing.  And you combine the two it's powerful. You know one elective that I took that I loved was Women and Men in Management, right?  Now, of all the classes that I took, probably sixty people in each class, this is the one that's only like ten, twelve, right?  Now, that's pretty telling in the obvious ways.  And now, I go back and speak at Stanford [Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford, California] all the time, this class is packed.  There were people on the waitlist.  And it's like wow that's wonderful, right?  And it's fascinating to see how things change in such a short period of time.  But, just getting that perspective I think, you know you look at our team, we're a majority minority, majority woman, right?  Lots--my number two, my COO [Joanne Hsieh], a woman of color, that sort of thing.  Most of my senior leadership, women of color.  You know, that's not a function of taking that class, but it's a function of reinforcing minority existing perspective and supplementing with fact and theory.  So, I can put them into practice in a compelling way.  Also took that same semester public speaking, right?  And look I'm a guy, go out and give speeches all the time, right?  But, I'm a big proponent of and I love theory.  Ever since I was a young kid, right, like reading the science and reading the theory behind things.  'Cause only with that, that sets the foundation for you to practice, right?  And when you don't have folks teaching you every day, that foundation holds you accountable.  So, I find myself practicing where it can, when I can.  And then it becomes a habit.  The thing about all those classes Acting with Power, Women and Men in Management, negotiations and public speaking, I use all of them every day.  And none of those are finance, economics, none of them, right?  Like the soft skill, tangible things are the things that I really valued about Stanford.  And I, I tell you this, even most importantly about Stanford, I loved Stanford, I had said I'll do anything for Stanford.  I think Stanford loves me, like there's a mutual just love that, I'm so appreciative of everything they've done.  The beauty in the business school isn't necessarily their business school it's Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California].  At Stanford you have the top business school, the top medical school [Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California], top engineering school [Stanford University School of Engineering, Stanford, California], top law School [Stanford Law School, Stanford, California], right?  And they're all across the street from each other.  The ability to collaborate and get new ideas from some of the most innovative minds in the planet.  It's a formative time for me.  And in 2008, to be in the technology industry when it was really starting to take off, timing, right, and blessings.  Like I've just been so, so fortunate.
Speaker 1: Well, and so you're in the technology space--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when financial space is falling apart (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, crazy, literal- like I, I got to Stanford August, September of 2008, the collapse was October.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Two thousand eight [2008].
Speaker 1: So you were protected in a sense?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean I, I had severance and a bonus at that time.  So, I wasn't thinking about, and when the crash happened I had two years to, you know, learn, right?  Which and then I also had an internship for the next summer just in case I needed one.  So, the goal at the time is to figure out what I wanted to do in that first year.  And go back to folks like BCG [Boston Consulting Group] and suggest hey maybe I either didn't want to do that internship or I wanted to supplement it with another one, which actually ended up happening.
Story_ID: 666942
Speaker 1: So, networking, this is something that you, I think you describe having exposure to at Hotchkiss [Hotchkiss School, Lakeville, Connecticut]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: At Stanford [Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford, California] the networking is at a different level.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You're talking about all these different schools.  Who are some of the people that you're interacting with while you're there?
Speaker 2: Totally.  So, my first year I think was markedly different from my second year.  Because by the time I got to my second year, I was also working full time at a start up that started to take off.  So, I started to show myself a little more.  And I didn't have to kind of network in, in such a frenzied way.  But, that first year in business school you know, I started with the realization I was twenty-four and I said man, there are other twenty-four year olds not only making millions of dollars for fundamentally changing the world why haven't I heard about this place?  This is crazy to me.  Like this is nirvana, right?  Like this is cool.  I'm gonna do everything that I can to ensure that I get a seat at the table, there.  So, I really explain it through my first internship that I was able to acquire so I got an internship at Twitter [Twitter Inc.] before anybody started to care about that service.  The way I got it and there are two people I wanna speak to you about.  One was a gentleman whose name is David Hornik and I reached out to some twenty different people who were connected.  And David Hornik was number twenty.  David Hornik is a professor, well he's a venture capital partner at August Capital [August Capital Master Management Company, LLC], but, also professor of law at both Stanford [Stanford Law School, Stanford, California] and Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], so genius.  But, he's a great friend of Evan Williams who's one of the founders of Twitter.  So, I met with them, he was willing to take a meeting with me.  'Cause I was a Stanford student I used the Stanford address for- fortunately.  And I said I really want to learn this thing and I want to be a part of it.  And I want to be a part of Twitter.
Story_ID: 666943
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And it was at the beginning of Twitter [Twitter Inc.]?
Speaker 2: So, Twitter at the--they were founded 2006, so this was 2008 at the time I think they had like you know, just in the millions of users.  But, it wasn't what it is today.  People were still like why to do you use Twitter.  It's just one of those things.  It's crazy to me and mind boggling.  But I told David, I said "I wanna work at Twitter" and he [Evan Williams] asks me two questions, "Are you willing to work for free."  I said, "Yes."  He said, "Two, do you have ideas for them?"  And I said, "Yes," right?  'Cause I was a user I loved it.  I saw that there was an opportunity for business for them that was a bit untapped.  He was like, "All right.  Let me get back to you."  The following day CEO [Jack Dorsey] reached out to me saying come in for an interview.  And a couple days later they were like we have an internship.  I got to lead a team of two to three other Stanford folks that wanted to be a part of it, to help them get a sense for like how they can monetize the platform and that sort of thing.  So, it was wonderful. I got to do that for about six months or so.
Speaker 1: And this is now the, its two years in and still the beginning of this platform?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And one of the challenges that all these companies had in the beginning was how to make money.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: You know, the- they're aggregating users.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: But, turning that into something that could make a dollar--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --was really tough.  That's right.  But, what were you, what was this idea that you had?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so they first of all they didn't care too much like making the dollar at the time.  But, you know coming in that way it allowed me to do something for them that they didn't have the resources or desire to do.  So, that was like my way to kind of wedge in a little bit.  So, number one getting businesses on the platform period the great- the greatness of Twitter that I saw that it is fundamentally changing the way that communication happened, period.  You know I remember being in accounting class at Stanford and there's this rumbling going around and someone said, "MC Hammer's gonna come speak to the Stanford Graduate School of Business [Stanford, California]," right?  And I'm, I'm like, "Is that true?"  And there was all these rumblings and I remember turning around saying, "Yeah he's coming," because in those five minutes that like they were waiting, I'd had tweeted him, he tweeted me back, saying that he was coming.  (Snaps fingers) And I knew the moment, like I knew at that moment that Twitter's gonna be a very, very special thing.  It's like MC Hammer just hit me back, like in this quick period of time.  If businesses had this ability to touch their customers in the way that was unique and special and on time.  That was one of the greatest ec- economic opportunities period, right?  Let alone what the platform could do for the world, right.  And so I was hungry to get in.  So, what we wanted to offer was a set of case studies about like how certain businesses were using Twitter and what they could be doing better for it.  So, we were speaking to Etsy [Etsy, Inc.], we were speaking to the local coffee shop in Austin, Texas, right?  And we get all these multiple use cases of different companies' sizes and what those use cases could be.  You know, fast forward three, four, five years later.  They launch these promoted products for businesses that like really speak to and really touted a lot well not necessarily the early work that we did, but the themes that came out of this which I think were pretty cool and special for us.
Speaker 1: And so this was an internship.
Speaker 2: Yeah, an unpaid, no stock, none of that (laughter), I didn't want it.  Like I, I did it because I love the platform I think it needed to exist.  In fact, I wasn't supposed to work at all.  'Cause your first semester at Stanford 'cause they had a new curriculum they prevented us from doing that.  So, I kind of broke the rules and worked there anyway (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, and how long did you work there?
Speaker 2: About six months.
Story_ID: 666944
Speaker 1: And what was next for you?
Speaker 2: So, now the summer came.  And so, I did the BCG [Boston Consulting Group] internship.  But, also--
Speaker 1: And what did you do there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That, those these are the folks that gave you the ten thousand dollar?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  So, I was able to work in their Los Angeles [California] office.  So, pretty close to home for the summer.  My wife [Amoy Toyloy Walker] and I lived in Los Feliz in L.A. for about six weeks.  It's supposed to be an eight week program, but I got it in six weeks.  'Cause I finished the program early and I had another thing that I wanted to do.  So, at the time I was put on a case.  And they don't like saying who the client is but it was in Seattle [Washington], for a very large coffee retailer [Starbucks Corporation] (laughter), right?  And we did some (laughter) could be anybody (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Oh, hm.
Speaker 2: And you know, we did some really, really great work and it was fun and I got to experience and understand retail, which was really interesting for me.  With an iconic brand which was pretty cool in Seattle.  My wife and I got to explore that place a little bit better.  So, I did that for about six weeks.  And you know, I got an offer to come back, but I knew I wasn't come back to corporate.  Like, I was already no, no way.  In the midst of, of that internship I heard about this company called Foursquare [Foursquare Labs, Inc.]; it's a location based service.  At the time I was, 'cause they would tell you your user number.  I was user number eighteen thousand or something like that, right?  So, nobody cared about this service.  But, just like Twitter [Twitter Inc.], it changed my behavior, it changed the way I thought about the world.  It changed who I interacted with, places around me.  Like fundamentally it got me out of bed to do things I wouldn't have done previously.  And that behavior change was special to me.  And I said I'm gonna be a part of this, I've gotta figure it out.  I found the two founders' emails on the Internet somewhere both Dennis and Naveen [Naveen Selvadurai].  And the story goes I emailed them eight times.  The eighth time, Dennis replied back, I'll never forget this verbatim, he said in, in this kind of agony 'cause he was annoyed at like all these emails probably.  He said, "You know what, comma, I just may take you up on some of this, period.  Are you ever in New York [New York]? Dens," (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And this is Dennis Crowley?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Who, right, okay?
Speaker 2: And his nickname was Dens, D-E-N-S.  And that's like his social handle, it's autographed that way.  I was like I remember I was in L.A. with my wife at the time.  And we were watching 'Lost' on Hulu.  And I was like wow he emailed me back.  I looked at it I was like what should I do?  Five minutes later I reply back and said, "Actually yeah I was planning on being in New York tomorrow."  I booked my flight that night, flew out the following morning, hung out with him for a week.  And a month later I was running business development for Foursquare.  Literally how it worked.
Speaker 1: And this company, they just founded it, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they hadn't even raised money yet.  So, they had founded it in March 2009.  And I was--started sending those emails in May and I met Dennis in August.  And they raised their first round of funding in September, Labor Day.
Speaker 1: Now what was your role?
Speaker 2: So, I ran all business development for the company.  So, when I got there, so when I got there the first day, or when I met them that first time it was on the fifth floor in a Cooper Square building in New York.  I opened the door and I know what Dennis looks like, he had no idea what I look like probably.  He turns around he's like who--like they weren't even expecting me to come.  They were like who's this guy, there's no ways he's coming.  I put my stuff on the table, I was like, "Let me get to work."  And he said, he said, "Tristan [HistoryMaker Tristan Walker] all right, if you can sign up thirty kind of businesses on our platform," 'cause we're just starting to learn, just like at Twitter, it's crazy like how businesses can use kind of our platform in innovative ways, "you can work with us."  And this is hot off the Twitter project that I did.  And I already had relationships with the Etsys [Etsy, Inc.] and the coffee shop and that sort of thing.  So, I immediately knew I could get thirty. At the end of that week, I had three hundred, right?  So, immediately they're like okay.  This guy's it, right (laughter) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so--
Story_ID: 666945
Speaker 1: Just for context.
Speaker 2: Sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) These are businesses you are signing up to be a part of Foursquare [Foursquare Labs, Inc.] because the way Foursquare--describe the way Foursquare works?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so Foursquare we like to say we make cities easier to use.  So we provided tools to allow people to know a little bit more about place they were, right?  So, if you went to you know, a local coffee shop.  And you wanted to say what's the best type of coffee I should get?  And you get these little tidbits of tips that folks have left.  These bread crumbs, right?  Unlike, Yelp [Yelp Inc.], where you get three paragraphs about, like, the table cloths and all that stuff.  On Foursquare it's like, you know, get the Venezuelan coffee period, right?  Like that sort of thing, it's little nuggets.  And as you walk around and explore your city they pop up, right?  So, they get you to potentially divert into a place that you wouldn't have done previous.  Initially we provide all these kind of interesting incentives to get people to do thing they wouldn't have done previously.  So, we had a famous gym rat badge, right.  So, if you check in at a gym ten times you get to unlock this badge.  So, we've had people waking up on rainy days super lazy going to the gym just to get this badge.  It's crazy, so you think about the opportunities for business, and engaging with their customers, not only in the easy promo sense, right?  Hey, 25 percent off, right here come in, but, also in the incentives.  So, I would negotiate these kind of, these deals with larger brands later on.  Where it's like I do all these things and your local city, unlock this badge, which gives you potential perks for our brands, that sort of thing.  It became a very, very cool thing and something that they hadn't realized the potential for before.  And then I helped shape a lot of that kind of vision for the company.  By the time I left the company we had over a million merchants on the platform.  We had tens of thousands of brands on the platform, too.
Story_ID: 666946
Speaker 1: When, when you describe Foursquare [Foursquare Labs, Inc.], which I remember when it started.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What I remember thinking of it as is like the Zagat of the Internet.
Speaker 2: Better than most, that's a great, great, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, people thought very differently (laughter). We had a lot of work to do in messaging.  And that, that works.
Speaker 1: But, what I mean in, in the, that was the chunks of information--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --sort of curated editorial experience--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and it was free, was it not?
Speaker 2: It was free, and it still is.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: And like the, the power in Foursquare, I think a lot of people think about, all right, yeah the restaurant thing, there are all these other cool nuggets, right?  Like make sure when you go to this bathroom use this stall, 'cause these ones just are disgusting.  Right, like, they're really (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Or, you know here's the bathroom in this station right that like no one knew about.  There's these things about place that people wouldn't even realize, right?  That made the place a little bit more human, right?  When you think about this connection to not only people, which things like Twitter [Twitter Inc.] and Facebook [Facebook, Inc.] provide, but what's our connection to place?  I think that was really the power we really wanted a lot.
Speaker 1: And, and as the company in using technology of GPS [global positioning system] to?
Speaker 2: Yep, yep.
Speaker 1: This was in the beginning.
Speaker 2: Purely location based.  It was one of earliest and there were kind of companies that did it before, but I think Foursquare did it the best.  And in a way that was cool.  Like it started in New York [New York], it was very much a New York product at the time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, it was built for that use case.  And if you can build it for the New York use case you can build it anywhere, right?  And I think that's the thing that was missed.  Like a lot of folks would build these platforms and they just let anybody use it.  But, it's not fun if no one else is on it.  It's not fun if there's no businesses on it.  Like so, by isolating it city by city and then unlocking it, that was really the formula for success.
Speaker 1: And--so they began in 2009?
Speaker 2: So, they yeah, South by Southwest 2009.  Yeah that's when they launched but they had started building it a few months before that.
Speaker 1: And you were there for year of your second year of business school [Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford, California]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I started in August that's when I met them for the first time then I started my second year of business school that September.  So, I worked full time that whole second year from Palo Alto [California].  I would travel probably once a month back and forth.  And then I also had a full time educational experience too (laughter), yeah.
Story_ID: 666947
Speaker 1: How did you balance all that?
Speaker 2: I didn't.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I mean, I, I think the thing I realized about business school--and it really served me well--there're only three things you can do at business school or focus on.  It's academics, your social life and your professional life.  And I have this belief you can only do two well at any one time.  I think the people who fail try to do all three successfully.  For me it's academic and professional.  I was willing to sacrifice my social for that.
Speaker 1: Well and you were married.
Speaker 2: Yeah exactly, exactly.  But, look I mean people still want to build a relationship so you know feel a connection.  But, I was okay, I mean I lived my life up until that point without needing that, right?  And it served me pretty well.  You know, I was there to learn, right?  Like I was there to get educated, I was there to have a breakthrough experience, and it worked out.
Speaker 1: And at this point what is your wife [Amoy Toyloy Walker] doing?
Speaker 2: So, she's a teacher so she already secured a job before we got there.  She's still working at the same job that she did when she started.  She's teaching at a middle school in Palo Alto [California].  A private girls middle school.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 666948
Speaker 1: You are you know, hedging your bets with this, the new frontier is really what it is at that point.  And people are not sure if money is going to be made--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) through Twitter [Twitter Inc.], through Foursquare [Foursquare Labs, Inc.], through any of these things I mean.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Even traditional media outlets trying to be online--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --are not yet making money, the advertising model--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --doesn't work yet.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: The, the frame for making money doesn't work yet?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: All right, so have you by the time you leave, Foursquare figured out--you, you talk about all these businesses that have signed on, have you figured out a way for them to make money?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were monetizing, I mean that is important for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean I, I, it's, I know numbers and I know what it takes to kind of build the business.  You know, the thing that's interesting you mentioned hedging kind of bets.  I've never hedged anything in my life (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: I've always been very, very singularly focused on anything that I've ever wanted.  And it's like it's personally that's really the only way to have any semblance of success.  So, even when I went into Foursquare I was like all right I'm doing this because I believe that there's a business here.  I'm not doing this for fun to help you kind of have press--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --articles.  I built a business out of it, you know Foursquare is making money now.  And that's not to say that like I helped them make all the money that they've made since I've left.  But, like now they're making money because of some of that early ground work stuff that we did.  And look, you think about Foursquare is only eight years old, right?  It's really not that old and we were starting to make money even when I was there.  In fact, you know, probably in my first year we had good amount of revenue, right, from all the brand deals that I did.  Yeah, I did a quarter million dollar deal for the company probably three to four months into my starting with them.  So, that is very important to me.  Important to show that like making money didn't have to be mutually exclusive to like detracting from the user experience which is this view.  And I think they respected me for that, and allowed me to do more of it.
Speaker 1: Did you help to figure out what the, what the pricing would be for these deals?
Speaker 2: Yeah, for, for the early deals, yes and no I just made 'em up.  I mean 'cause it's, look I mean the thing to really keep in mind is nobody had done what we had done before.  And the, the wonderful part about the role at Foursquare is I was able to out compete people twenty years my senior.  Because, they weren't any more expert about this stuff than I was.  And if they said that they were, they were lying and full of it, right?  So, we were able to be super nimble but we were able to be more nimble than everybody else 'cause we let the market.  We knew exactly what it was and what it needed to be.  And like folks tend, at least in our case, the brands we worked with, to work with the number one player not the number two.  And we worked, I mean we had a team that on the product side made us the number one player.  So they made it much easier for me to do my job, right?  And it just worked out.
Speaker 1: Who were the competitors at that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so at the time, there was us and there was Gowalla [Gowalla, Inc.], a small company who raised more money than we did.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Facebook [Facebook, Inc.] came in and decided to do their thing, right?  Which is a bit intimidating. I remember that day that that news came out.  But, we ended up doing just fine, right?  You know, Gowalla doesn't exist anymore.  Facebook Places is something wholly different from how they started.  And Foursquare's still around.
Speaker 1: Why didn't you stay with them after you graduated?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I did stay with them after I graduated.
Speaker 1: You did?
Speaker 2: So, I worked at Foursquare for three years.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: It's just my first year I was in school at the same time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were there for three years?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So that was long enough to see it.
Speaker 2: Yeah I mean that's when we had the--million merchants, tens of thousands and then I was one of the first like two employees, by that time we were a hundred and fifty.  Most of the folks were in New York [New York].  I was still in the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California], just starting to get big.  I felt that I had done everything that I could do for the company at the time, right.  And I wanted to go out and build something ambitious myself.  It just felt like the right time.
Speaker 1: So this was the, the third option entrepreneurial?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, I wanted to, I mean the great thing about the role at Foursquare was I felt like I could--I wasn't a founder but like, I felt like I was close enough to the founders [Naveen Selvadurai and Dennis Crowley] as early as I was to know what that experience could feel like, right.  And being such a contributor that I was and like felt the stresses that they did even while I was in school.  Because I loved it that much and I gave it my all.  See yeah like while I wasn't a founder CEO at the time I was experiencing entrepreneurship.  And in fact, I always said I wasn't gonna leave Stanford [Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford, California] without my own company.  I was okay with that for Foursquare 'cause it felt like it was a part of my company.
Story_ID: 666949
Speaker 1: So, when it's time to go, that you're three years in, what's your plan?
Speaker 2: Yeah I didn't have one (laughter).
Speaker 1: No (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In fact, I said I just need time.  And you know, fortunately one of our investors Andreessen Horowitz.  You know, when I announced my kind of resigning Ben Horowitz of Andreessen and Horowitz called me into his home.  He said, "Tristan [HistoryMaker Tristan Walker], what's going on?"  And I was like, "Yeah, I just want to try something new."  I got all these offers for other venture capital firms to be an entrepreneur in residence at their venture capital firm, where you get six to nine months to figure out what you wanna do.  So, Ben said you know, "Just come do it with us," right?  He actually tried, advised me not be an entrepreneur in residence.  But, he said, "If you make this decision just come do it with us, right?  We'll take care of you," and that sort of thing.  That's what I did.  So, you know, I worked there for nine months just thinking of ideas all day.  And fortunately I got paid to do it.  And at the end of nine months (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So is this essentially like an incubator?
Speaker 2: Kind of.
Speaker 1: Or is this just for you?
Speaker 2: I mean I just got an office space.  It's, it's a method for the partners of the firm to know the things that I'm working on to potentially get early access to the deal.  So, if I was working on something that was particularly exciting then they get early access and I can potentially raise money from them faster.  There's no kind of guarantee of that both ways.  But, I was already close to them 'cause like they were investors in Twitter [Twitter Inc.] they were on the board of Foursquare [Foursquare Labs, Inc.] they saw all my work.  So, I've had a strong relationship with Andreessen Horowitz for a while.  And it was just good timing for me.  So, you know, nine months later I figured out the company I wanted to start and here we are (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, and, and just speaking about them for a minute because they were major players in the, the development of this, this new frontier.  In 2011, they invested $80 million in Twitter.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah that's a lot of money.
Speaker 1: I mean this's a lot of money (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) That's a lot of money.
Speaker 1: And that was just one.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They invested in Foursquare.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right, Airbnb [Airbnb, Inc.].
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Facebook [Facebook, Inc.], Groupon [Groupon, Inc.], I mean they were they put their money where.
Speaker 2: It's a $4 billion firm.  I think they're maybe 5 or 6 now though.  Like they raise a lot of money and they're investing and putting their money where their mouths are for sure.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They're one of the, well, at least in my opinion one of the very best players in the venture capital period.  They've been doing this, you know, they were founded a year before I joined them.  So this is still pretty early, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so, they saw you were to go and they saw some potential in you and gave you this?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause I mean I already proved myself with all the work I did at Foursquare for about three years.  So, they knew that I was gonna work hard for them.  They knew that, you know, look, I had some semblance of humility to, you know, even come to them and say, you know what, like I don't know what I want to do but I want to--.  And I had other offers, right.  And you know, they wanted to look out for me and I'm thankful for that.
Speaker 1: And what year was that?
Speaker 2: That was 2012.
Speaker 1: So, and it was a yearlong kind of residence.
Speaker 2: So, I did it for nine months.
Speaker 1: Nine months?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I was thinking of ideas. A lot I thought were good, they really weren't, and then after seven months I had a click in my mind for this company.  And then two months after that raised my first round of funding.  And by then it was well so nine months into it was April and I raised my first dollars in May of 2013.
Story_ID: 666950
Speaker 1: Let's start with the idea, what was the idea for the company that you've created?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so you know I had a vision--well actually let me start with the idea that crept up which had implications for what I wanted to do for the company.  So, it's January of I think it was 2013 at the time.  And I got frustrated for fifteen years I couldn't shave.  And this goes back to my kind of Hotchkiss [Hotchkiss School, Lakeville, Connecticut] days.  I didn't have a father to teach me how to shave the right way.  And you start to grow hair in your face and you want to have your rite of passage.  And the joke is a CVS [CVS Health] locally in downtown.  So, you go in ready to--and you get these whiskers on your face, and you know, peach fuzz, you go you get the multi blade razor.  You get the shave gel, all right?  You take it home and I remember you know you have study hall and after that you have check in at night and I would kind of shower at the end of that, Calvin Klein robe, right?  You go with your little thing with your, you know with your little loofahs and all those, your stuff in it.  You go (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your shower caddy (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Exactly, and then you shave like I shave for the first time.  I say, "All right done, awesome," right?  And wake up the following morning completely broken out, I had no idea what happened, right?  No idea until fifteen years later.  But, after that moment my brother [Sean McMillon] remembered, he reached out and he is like, "Don't ever put razors on your face.  For black men they're the worst thing ever."  You use this thing called a depilatory cream on your face.
Speaker 1: Magic Shave, was that what you used?
Speaker 2: I did that for fifteen years.
Speaker 1: The smell, Magic Shave in the gold box?
Speaker 2: Smelly, burns your face.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Stinks up the bathroom, my wife [Amoy Toyloy Walker] hated it.  Like it came to a head in January.  I was like this is ridiculous.  The fact that we're relegated to this experience.  That like even you look read the back of the package and it says things like, "Don't use two days in a row."  Like what does that even mean?  Are you kidding, right (laughter)?  Like what do you mean?  What does it mean?  But, we had nothing else, right.  So, it forced me to want to learn, right.  I had no idea I wanted to start a company in this. I was frustrated.  Its, two things that happened to me. The first, I spoke to an old retired consumer packaged goods executive.  And I said, "Listen I've had to deal with this problem my entire life, irritation, razor bumps that sort of thing.  Why hasn't this been fixed?"  And he said, "Tristan [HistoryMaker Tristan Walker] look at photos of black men a hundred years ago, none of them had razor bumps on their faces."  I thought he was being facetious.  So, I went to flickr.com and I entered this generic search terms like Harlem Renaissance, black in the 1920s, that sort of thing.  I went through twelve hundred photos. I didn't find one photo of a black man with razor bumps on his face.  Which is interesting but I'll kind of get back for the reason for that in a second.  The second thing that I did I would go to The Art of Shaving [The Art of Shaving, LLC] which a lot of people don't know is owned by like a Procter and Gamble [Procter and Gamble Company], which also owns Gillette [The Gillette Company] and that sort of thing.  And I walk in and I ask the sales rep, you know, "I have to deal with this my entire life what should I use?"  Now, you'd think that, they'd always take me to the three hundred dollar beautiful handled multi blade razors that they have in store.  They've never done that.  I do this in cities that I go to all the time, just to see.  They've always taken me to single blade double edge off brand safety razors.  And at that point I combined the two things together.  I was like, what's going on here, right?  Like there's clear incentive to not do that.  But, why are they doing it.  And I just learned about the history of shaving, some hundred years ago or so.  There's a gentlemen his name was King Gillette [King C. Gillette] he has this amazing insight.  He said for hundreds of years barbers have been using this thing straight razor, to great advocacy, it cuts the hair level with the skin not beneath like some multi blade razors today do, which cause the issue.  It's one clean cut so there's no pulling like multi, multi blade razor, most multi blade razors today, or some any way.  But, it's actually pretty hard for you to use the straight razor yourself at home if you're not trained you might cut yourself, et cetera.  So, he had this amazing insight he said but if you can take a single blade, house it within a safe head, attach a handle to it and take it home and shave.  And that started the mass market shaving industry as we know it.  Fast forward twenty years later, he loses the patent on it.  And many would argue that the only reason we have two, three, four, five, six, thirty-two blade razors today, is purely due to patent protection.  It's fascinating.  And it's like the thing that's really, really fascinating about it is what are they gonna sell folks in twenty, thirty years when most of this country has curly hair in their faces, right?  And therein lie the opportunity for me.  So, I decided to kind of found Walker and Company [Walker and Company Brands, Inc.], really, on this principle to make health and beauty simple for people of color, right?  How do I solve acute health, br- beauty problems for what is the majority of the world right now.  And will be the majority of the country in twenty, thirty years.  A consumer group that is the greatest consumer demographic on the planet, that spends more money in health and beauty products, more orders in magnitude greater than any other demographic group and deserves to be treated like a first class citizen.  It felt obvious to me.  And how do I leverage all that I've learned in Silicon Valley and tech to build the next generation legacy CPG company from the ground up?  Just like you have Procter and Gamble, just like you have wa- Johnson and Johnson [Johnson and Johnson Products; Johnson and Johnson Services, Inc.].  A hundred seventy-five years, hundred twenty-five years I want Walker and Company to be the exact same.
Speaker 1: And so, there was singularly Magic Shave?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Between Magic Shave and Bevel, correct?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There've been some other things like Barc [Barc Skincare], was one that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep, yep.
Speaker 1: I mean there've been some companies creating--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --not the razor so much, but product?
Speaker 2: That's a problem most companies will create the product to fix the issue after the fact.
Story_ID: 666951
Speaker 1: Tell me what is unique about--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --your company [Walker and Company Brands, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah so, at least with Bevel anyway we have two brands now Bevel and Form [Form Beauty].  Bevel is the first and only in tandem shaving system designed to help reduce, prevent razor bumps, irritation et cetera.  It's clinically proven to work, we have clinical trials that sort of thing.  You see roughly a 40 plus percent reduction in irritation in four short weeks, right, with the razor that we use so for us it's not about you know the fixing.  It's about the prevention in the first place.
Speaker 1: So, that's the big difference?
Speaker 2: Now, we'll, we'll help fix, yeah I mean, I mean people still have to shave with something, right?  And in addition even when you think about a lot of the aftershave products that exist out there, they're alcohol based.  Which dry up our skin, which also isn't good for us either, right?  So, the thing I learned from this experience is that there wasn't, that my brother [Sean McMillon] was wrong.  Well, actually when my brother told me don't put razors on his face, I got why he said that, but he was wrong.  It wasn't that all razors are bad it's just certain ones were, right?  For folks who have curly hair.  For now our job with Bevel is not only do we sell products to people, we educate right?  And I tell a lot of folks in health and beauty, one of the hardest things that you can do is convince a black man to put a razor on his face.  We've done it, we've done it.  And it's hard to like really articulate and make people believe out here.  But, we've done that.  But, not only that, look we have customers in twenty different countries.  You know, roughly 60 percent of our customers offline are white men, right?  But, a significant number of black men rely on our products for this issue (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who developed this, this technology?
Speaker 2: We did.  So the technology, so for the razor itself.
Speaker 1: But like scientists, what (unclear)?
Speaker 2: So, the razor itself already existed.  Like this single blade you go back to the 1920s, they were using. That's why they didn't have razor bumps on their faces, right?
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: But it's not sold really at scale today because it's no patent protection and you can't get margin on it.  But, if you actually travel internationally it's way more popular because they can sell it more cheaply and get their margins, fascinating kind of business story.  But, for us we sell it as a system.  So much of the same way that you think about how Neutrogena, right, could eliminate acne, but then you have Proactive, that gives you a whole system of products to not only prevent it but help eliminate it too.  And it's a regimen based approach.  That's what we're trying to bring to bear.  Where it's about, not only the razor itself but the combination of formulations and ingredients to help mitigate this issue for both men and women.
Speaker 1: So, you're working with scientists to do this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, so we have, we have--
Speaker 1: --or chemists or?
Speaker 2: --in house kind of product development team.  And then also our manufacturers that we work with have in house kind of very knowledgeable chemists as well.
Speaker 1: Where are the products made?
Speaker 2: Where are they not made?  So most of our kind of hard good, electric good things and even bottles, packaging, out of Asia.  So China, Japan, that sort of thing.  You know, we have some products made out of Pakistan, we have some, Germany, all of our oils and creams are domestic, right?  So, we have some in, I think New Jersey, California.  We're bringing on another manufacturer soon out in California as well.  And then we have fulfillment partners in the middle of the country.
Story_ID: 666952
Speaker 1: It's interesting that you started with products for men.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know the beauty industry--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --is often considered a female driven industry.  And you have a system because it's a system, it's expensive?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How are you marketing to men?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so a couple of things I'd. I'd (unclear) our system is not expensive on like a dollar value basis.  But, I'd also say like what is one willing to pay for confidence.  And here's what I mean by that.  You know my first internship on Wall Street [with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.], we'd go out on the floor and I remember this gentleman, and I had hair on my face, 'cause I couldn't shave.  And he said, you walked up or stood up and excuse my language but he said, "Hey you," like, "take that shit off your face."  All right, now I'm mortified right?  Like I had just walked through the door (laughter) like what is this?  And remember it's like a type A personality kind of.  And I remember not only being mortified that like but also you're just realizing he's a jerk but also thinking, what am I gonna use?  Like now I'm gonna have to put this multi blade thing on my face and completely be broken out.  Like, it saps confidence.  You think about even men in the [U.S.] Army, right.  Like there's research that suggests--'cause there you have to shave every day.  The razor bumps they get potentially saps confidence and effects their performance on the field.  Like we have our men in uniform like providing a much needed service, an honorable service to like our country that have to worry about their performance because of the tools they use to shave, that's crazy to me.  All right, so why did I start. Well number one, Walker and Company [Walker and Company Brands, Inc.] is only gonna make these to solve acute problems.  We're not about making nail polish, just to make nail polish.  We start problem first, whether it's razor bumps, Vitamin D deficiency, early onset diabetes, hyperpigmentation that sort of thing.  Then we make efficacious products to fix those problems.  And then we build beautiful brands around it to tell our story.  So, when I think about Bevel.  Bevel as much as Walker and Company started as my own.  Walker and Company, my name's on the company, right?  I thought it was important, in fact, I wanted to start in hair care, which we eventually got into.  But, then I thought it was really important to show my authenticity.  I think out of that authenticity it got us the kind of fame that the brand has been able to acquire, and has served us well.  So, now when folks see that we've made such high quality beautiful products with a brand that's relevant to the community today, we're proving that we can get people to retail doors to buy it.  Now we come out with like hair care brand.  We were able to launch that at Sephora [Sephora USA, Inc.], which never happens.  We were able to do it with excellence and there's an expectation--
Speaker 1: And what is that brand?
Speaker 2: It's called Form Beauty.
Speaker 1: Is that for women?
Speaker 2: It's so much, like for Bevel, we market it to men. We have women who use Bevel too.  Form Beauty is marketed to woman but we have a lot of male customers as well.  And really put us behind kind of Form Beauty to completely take out the guess work in hair care.  So, we kind of take a lot of lifestyle inputs that you have humidity in the zip code where you live, how often you exercise, whether you're pregnant or had chemo [chemotherapy] treatments and stuff like that.  All of these impact your hair health.  And we'll recommend a suite of products that we've made for you.  And a custom usage regimen for you based on your lifestyle, never been done before.
Speaker 1: So, Bevel began in what year?
Speaker 2: So, Walker and Company raised its first round of funding in June of 2013.  Bevel we started taking preorders in December of 2013.  And we started shipping them in February of 2014, very quick.
Speaker 1: So, now you're looking at three years in.
Story_ID: 666953
Speaker 1: What are your sales like today?
Speaker 2: So, we don't announce sales outside the company [Walker and Company Brands, Inc.].  But we're an eight figure business right now (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: And, growing each year.  In a way that like we're super, super proud of.  Form [Form Beauty] just launched four months ago.  So, early days but like it's already kind of scaling in a way that we're very proud of too.
Speaker 1: And because there're so many different hair textures and--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and, and challenges 'cause you just described so a range of--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) concerns that people face.  How many products are in these regiment?
Speaker 2: Ten, well so we have ten SKUs [stock keeping unit] in our whole line.  And in each regimen has either five or six products.  So it comes with and each regimen has a clarifying shampoo and a gentle kind of daily cleansing shampoo.  We have the specialist item everyone gets, the three in one leave in lotion.  And then the stylers and finishers we offer different combinations based on your hair needs and styling preference as well.  And in addition to that there are a large number of custom usage regimens.  And what I mean by that is you know, I live in Palo Alto [California]; let's say a family in Orlando [Florida] and they have a pool in the back and I run a lot out there, right?  I should either be using the same products differently or different products the same way, right?  And we can kind of help people kind of navigate between that depending on that lifestyle change.
Speaker 1: You mentioned Vitamin D deficiency.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: What are, what are, what are you developing around that, 'cause that's a huge issue--
Speaker 2: Yeah, no I know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) particularly for black people.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so we haven't developed anything yet, right?
Speaker 1: But, it's on the list?
Speaker 2: Well, it's on the list of problems we could solve.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, in, in the community there's, look I'm, and it's a shame like no one's even thought to solve that, right?  You think about hyperpigmentation.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Everybody has like the skin lightening stuff, but like is there more interesting way to do it?  I mean the thing that we care mostly about is not only identifying the problem.  But, come in with a novel way to actually solve it, right?  So, you know Vitamin D deficiency, yes like we can do things like give people more Vitamin D, right?  But that's obvious and everybody else does it.  And then how do actually measure the efficacy of it, right?  So, for us we want to make being super thoughtful about like how we are gonna change those behaviors and show people the results of that changed behavior.  But, it's definitely one of those things on the list that we'd like to consider in the future.
Story_ID: 666954
Speaker 1: Given how important marketing is and you obviously know that.  Wh- and you are of the generation that certainly can tap into the hip hop generation, how have you leveraged relationships--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in that world, especially 'cause you're here in Silicon Valley which is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 1: --which, doesn't look like you, which is not, not talking this, not having this same conversation.  How--who are you engaging in order to reach your audience?
Speaker 2: Yeah so, you know funny enough I haven't engaged people enough but you know, I'm kind of mention what I mean by that in a second.  Look this company [Walker and Company Brands, Inc.] started three and half years ago in Palo Alto [California] and the brand is what it is, right?  No one knows the wiser, right?  So, I think our, our location is really not indicative of our ability and understanding.  I think the second thing is you know the diversity of our employee base needs to reflect the diversity of our consumer base, for that reason, right?  We need to make sure we have perspective, right?  A lot of my employees come from New York [New York], right?  And they've flown out here for this opportunity, right?  I'm from New York, I'm from Queens [New York], right?  A lot of this is about not forgetting where you came from.  You know, we hire to that.  Like we hire people to their values, right?  You know at this company we have six: courage, inspiration, respect, judgment, wellness and loyalty, right?  And when you really hone in on like where this person's been courageous, how they've demonstrated loyalty, have they shown respect and judgment, those are things that folks where I came from respect, right.  I think we're able to be held honest and to a high standard in that regard.  And as long as like I'm running this business, I'm very, very particular about that.  'Cause I want to make sure that that authenticity is cored in who we are.  Again why we started Bevel, versus Form [Form Beauty] that sort of thing.  So, how have we tapped into hip hop culture?  It's interesting like I'm thirty-three years old now.  And when I started this I was thirty.  My very first investor in the business was Nas, which is special to me.  In Queens, I looked up to him, I had a half moon part on my head for a long period of time.  Nas is endorsing our trimmer right now, right?  There's a quote right behind me from one of this songs.  He says, "Signature fade with the Bevel blade that's the major key" ['Nas Album Done'], and one of the best songs of last year where he talks about supporting black business and then we're right in the chorus line.  And you know I'll never forget you know, like I get to text with Nas now.  It's crazy, it's surreal to me.  We came up with the trimmer and I showed him the packaging he's like, "You know Tristan [HistoryMaker Tristan Walker], despite having all this wonderful career, one thing I've always dreamed is like the ability not only to be a part of a trimmer product that I can believe in but seeing myself on the packaging is like a special thing to me."  And to hear that is kind of crazy and surreal to me.  So, the reason I kind of mentioned it that way is because you don't see us promoting Nas all the time, right?  Like he's in a video that we had maybe a couple of ad campaigns, but like he's not always out there.  John Legend is an investor in my company.  Magic Johnson, is an investor in my company. Gentleman Ryan Leslie, hip hop artist, is an investor in my company.  You know, I have some really just wonderful folks and we've never even done anything with those people, right.  Because I think the reason for their investment is because they're shopping at the same place we are.  And they believe in it.  And they respect the fact that we care most about authenticity, we're not gonna work with the Magic Johnson and John Legend if it doesn't make any sense, right?  Like it's gotta make sense for our community.  So because we have the brand visuals we have.  Because we have the tone of voice that we have.  Because we have someone like Nas who's so timeless across all generations, people expect a cultural relevance that's not fleeting from us, right?  We don't follow the trends, right?  Like the trends follow everything that we hope to do.  And as long as we stay core to that I think we'll be fine.
Story_ID: 666955
Speaker 1: I wanna talk about the product a little bit more because when you, I'm talking about Bevel.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, when I was growing up my job to, to pick the hair bumps--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --on my father's [Harry Augustus Cole] face (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You're not the only one (laughter).
Speaker 1: 'Cause it was just part of, part of the daily routine almost.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, yeah it's frustrating.  It's just the lacking education.  And you start to really think, why is there lacking education.  And I've started to peel back the layers, well no one taught me, right.  You start to think how pervasive that is in our culture in our community.  People aren't teaching this.  You know when I spoke to Sean [Sean McMillon], my brother, about the company [Walker and Company Brands, Inc.], he's like, "Wow great," like, "awesome that you're starting your own company." He's like, "What is it?"  I'm like, "When our first brand is called Bevel, you know it's a shaving brand."  He was like a, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm not using that," right?  And the thing that was like really interesting is Sean, he has a bald heard, right.  And he uses Magic Shave on his face that sort of thing.  And he goes to the barbershop and gets a shave, razor shave on his head all the time.  And he wasn't able to map that like a straight razor is exactly the same as like our single blade. Theoretically, in terms of advocates, he uses Bevel, now, but, like that gives you a sense and it took me two years to convince him to do that.  It's a very hard thing for people to get over, right.  Because, you've been trained your entire life to not do it.  And, not only that reinforced by the people older than you, friends from you, warning you not to do it.  So, it's not hard for us to retain our customers.  We have an incredibly loyal base.  Getting them is another story.  Which is why we have to strategically think about clever ways, whether it's working with Target [Target Corporation].  Or working with Nas or (laughter), whomever else, to really get the word out and convert.
Story_ID: 666956
Speaker 1: And so, you, you've spoken about the international--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) base that you have, how--what, what's your strategy to reaching out to the world?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so we, we didn't have and still don't have one.  We actually just launched in UK [United Kingdom] last week with Amazon [Amazon.com, Inc.]; they're one of our partners.  Before that we had customers, it's not a crazy large number, but customers in twenty different countries.  And it's like we don't even sell outside of the U.S.  And that's because people need this product so much that they're willing to buy it in the U.S., use a forwarding address, pay fifty dollars in shipping to get our products every three months.  It's insane.  They'll have friends who come to the U.S. to buy it for them, so they can bring back for them.  So that just shows us now we need to go to where they are.  And the big reason why we're starting in the UK is 'cause a lot of customers came, Europe (gestures), (unclear).  We see 'em in Brazil we see 'em in India, right?  And it starts map to oh yeah, duh there's curly people everywhere--curly haired people everywhere.
Speaker 1: 'Cause so setting up the business model to do, to deal directly with countries that's a whole other level of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Its, a, it's a lot of infrastructure.
Speaker 1: --involv- , yeah.
Speaker 2: Which is why we had to and we're only twenty-three people this company [Walker and Company Brands, Inc.].  So, we worked with the Amazon 'cause they're already partners with us here in the U.S.  And look we haven't even remotely cracked the code in the U.S. yet.  There's so many people don't know we exist.  All right so, we've got a lot of work to do which is exciting all right?  And tons of upside there.
Story_ID: 666957
Speaker 1: As you look to the future because this is, this company is in its infancy--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --what do you see when you look ten years out?  What, what is Walker and Company [Walker and Company Brands, Inc.] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I don't know what I see.  But, I know what hope.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my hope comes from kind of one experience I had with my son actually.  The first time he had ever been in a retail store, like a big box retail store was at Target.  The first aisle that he had ever been in was shaving aisle and I'll never forget this moment we turned as he was sitting down.
Speaker 1: And how old was he?
Speaker 2: He was about turning, just turning two I think.  We put him into the cart you're going around shopping kind of thing.  We have beautiful packaging at Target, stark white packaging et cetera.  But, I'm on the back of one of our razor boxes.  So it was somebody like turned it around accidently and I remember going by it 'cause I was looking for it 'cause I had never seen our products in Target yet.  And I was like all right finally now I have time to go, let me take Avery [Avery Walker], like I have other stuff I have to get.  So, I turn and our products are really at like the beginning of the aisle.  And Avery looks and he's like, "Dada," (points), right?  In that moment, to me was like really interesting, right?  'Cause like the first experience he ever has in retail isn't in the ethnic aisle, right?  The first experience he sees is with me on the box, right?  So, he gets a sense for like what ownership means and that sort of thing.  And I always said I just wanna live in a world where my son, this is--default state is number one not being treated like a second class citizen consumer and secondly in a world where he can believe, matter of factly, that he can produce at the highest level just like everyone else, right?  So, his production and consumption are very important for me.  And if that happens I've done everything I could do for, for this, right?  Whether, or not this company is around 150 years from now.  Whether it's wildly successful or whether it's not, right.  I think what we're creating is way better than the names on the wall.
Speaker 1: When, when you talked about your raising capital and the first line of capital was when did you say?
Speaker 2: June of 2013.
Speaker 1: And so, where are you now in, in raising capital.  'Cause often there, there're different levels?
Speaker 2: Yes we raised three rounds of funding.  We've raised over $30 million to date.  And hopefully never have to raise again (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) It's not the easiest thing to do (unclear).
Speaker 2: It's the worst, I hate it (laughter); it's the worst.
Speaker 1: Who's managing the financials for your business?
Speaker 2: Me, have to, and then we have a head of finance and she's really, really great, came from Procter and Gamble [Procter and Gamble Company], Walmart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.].
Story_ID: 666958
Speaker 1: And in terms of, you talked about your diverse staff--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --whom you've hired--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and how Silicon Valley is looking for the, the Ivy League grads?  Who are you looking for?
Speaker 2: I'm looking for people who share my values.  I mean we have the six values that I mentioned earlier but they're my personal values too.  I wrote them down, it's not enough, like you can go to the website and you see how we define each one.  And that's where companies stop. That's where we start.  For me, before I even started a company [Walker and Company Brands, Inc.], I wrote them down.
Speaker 1: Say them again please?
Speaker 2: Courage, inspiration, respect, judgment, wellness and loyalty.  For me it was important to entrench it in every single thing that we do, right?  So, when we have, have interviews with people we ask you leading questions to get at your loyalty, your respect, and your judgment.  When you have semi-annual annual reviews you're rated against your role attainment but also you're adherence to the values that we have.  So, when I'm in the room or I'm outside of it, we still operate in the same way, objectively, right?  Then eliminate anything related to culture fit bias, right?  Where like a lot of folks will hire people because they like basketball too, or they make them laugh, and I think that, that's stupid, right?  We only, I only have time to be around people who share my values.  And I had this rude awakening in the past couple of years where it's like look, I care about my faith, my family, my work in that order.  And I'm exhausting time with people around me.  And I just want to make sure for each of those things that folks fit my value set.  I don't want to work with anybody that doesn't share my values.  I don't want to hang out with anybody that doesn't (laughter) share my values.  I had to really recalibrate what that really meant, right?  And look, I mean a lot of people aren't okay with that.  That's fine, they don't have to work with me anyway (laughter), right?  But, those are all values that I think are good, right?  And meaningful, especially for our community.  And I've always told folks if I had to make a choice, and this isn't an ideal choice, but if I had to make a choice between hiring a jerk who shares my values and a nice person who doesn't, I'll take the former, because I could always manage that jerk to you know, really respecting people a little bit better in the workplace, right?  Or there's some biases, implicit biases that they might not recognize that I can educate them about, right?  To help them be better people.  But it really starts with this foundation, right?  I mean the best way to think about it is almost how can you be a re- a jerk if we hired you for your respect, right?  So, you're not really a jerk, there's something about that, that like we can help you change and work on together, right?  And I believe that pretty strongly.
Story_ID: 666959
Speaker 1: You're in the beginning of, of creating your brand or brands you know under your umbrella [Walker and Company Brands, Inc.], but, as you look back at the things that you've done thus far do you have any regrets?
Speaker 2: No, I mean I've no regrets because, look, I mean this is, it goes back to my belief in my faith.  Like I've--my life is not in all of this but it all aligned toward something, right?  Like something meaningful and I have a voice that people are willing to listen to and be inspired by and there's a truth that comes in my story that I think is refreshing for people.  Like how did I get from here to here (gesture)?  And like I'm not even really here yet, I'm kind of still like here trying to figure it all out.  So, I've no regrets, in fact there's nothing that I would change because changing anything, even the thing that I put on this morning, might change my outcome in ten years.  I have no idea and I'm not one to question that.  My season will come, there will be good ones, they'll be bad ones, but, I just have a trust and faith that like it will work out because, it has and I don't know another other way to live my life.
Story_ID: 666960
Speaker 1: What advice would you give to young African American males in particular (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who may have started out like you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, you know living the projects, wherever, U.S.A.?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And want to make a difference?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, Tyler Perry gave me the best advice I've ever heard.  And I kind of talked about this a bit in the beginning of the interview.  I got the good fortune to interview him on behalf of American Express [American Express Company], right when I was leaving Foursquare [Foursquare Labs, Inc.] at the time.  I got to interview him one on one fireside chat, in three different cities. L.A. [Los Angeles, California], Atlanta [Georgia], Chicago [Illinois].  You know, as a small business owner it's 'cause, you know, his business career and his success, it's pretty impressive.
Speaker 1: Amazing.
Speaker 2: So, you know he by that time I'd already done I think Chicago and Atlanta.  So, I think the last one was in L.A.  So, I'm interviewing him and in the, in the Q and A session, there's one woman who raises her hand and she's sitting on the right side and she stood up and she said, "Mr. Perry, Mr. Perry you have to go through all these different trials and tribulations (unclear).  What do you do to get back at 'em," (gesture)?  And what he said next changed my life, completely changed my life.  So much so that like when he answered it, it must have been really awkward 'cause there was a pause that I had for fifteen seconds 'cause I was thinking about what he said.  And then everybody was like, "Tristan [HistoryMaker Tristan Walker]" (laughter) I had to start again.  He said, and you know Tyler Perry was homeless for a bit, like now he's one of the highest paid guys in Hollywood.  He said he realized his potential as an entrepreneur and a human when he understood the trials you go through and the blessings you receive are the exact same things.  I thought about that, I was like that's a pretty profound thing.  And what he meant was those trials are just lessons.  Out of those lessons is your blessing.  And I kid you not this was a Thursday or Friday.  My wife [Amoy Toyloy Walker] and I went to church on a Sunday in L.A.  And the pastor was quoting from Romans chapter five I think verses two to four, something like that.  And it goes something like this, I--not the King James [King James Version] exactly but it goes something like this: revel in the tribulations because those tribulations begat patience, patience experience, and experience hope [Romans 5:3-4].  And we just talked about that a few days earlier, right?  So, when it comes down to like really being steeped in this faith that I have and wondering why was that message reinforced in me.  That message has freed me, all right, to take risk.  To, you know, give it all up, right.  And just like hope that like it's a great season and take advantage of those lessons in the bad seasons, right?  Ensure that like you just don't repeat bad seasons, right?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You're always gonna have the bad seasons.  But like, they shouldn't duplicate.  And that has at least not only in my business, but also in my life.  One thing a lot of people ask me is like, "Tristan why aren't you stressed, like you're running a company [Walker and Company Brands, Inc.], like it's a start up, it's hard to raise money.  You have this new three year old [Avery Walker], right here kind of.  And then you have a not-for-profit [Code2040] you're chairman of, all this stuff, are you stressed?"  I'm like, "No, why should I be 'cause that's selfish, right?  Like I'm doing what I believe I'm ready to do right now.  And what I've been prepared to do.  So, I just gotta step out on that faith and run."
Story_ID: 666961
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well and speaking of the non-profit, Code2040, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: You started that before Walker and Company [Walker and Company Brands, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (laughter) around the same time.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah so we started, we just celebrated our five year anniversary.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah which was a lot of fun, 2012, yeah so right before (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me what that is?
Speaker 2: Yeah so, yeah I mentioned earlier you know I got out here when I was twenty-four and I realized this place existed.  That is a travesty, right?  The fact that we don't understand you know I thought wealth was Wall Street.  That's no wealth. Is this, like you know I've known people who've sold their company for $10 billion, right?  Like that's wealth.  You know I've known people who've sold north of a billion dollars who aren't even thirty yet, right?  That's crazy wealth.  And, to be deprived of that access.  I felt was a huge problem.  Secondly I read a book that changed my life from an MIT professor. It's called 'Race Against the Machine' [Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson], and the thesis is kind of as follows. It goes, the gap between the rich and the poor is as dark as it's as ever been, and that gap is widening, there is no middle class, never will be.  I believe that, right?  Now it's contentious depending who you're speaking to.  But I believe it right?  And he says the reason that gap is so exacerbated is 'cause at the top are leveraging technology in the ways to make them a hell of a lot more productive while the folks at the bottom, the 99 percent or so, aren't, right?  So, the thing about that 99 percent that especially in an increasing world where the demographic is becoming what it is.  Most of these folks, the greatest consumer demographic on the planet, so in my opinion, I felt that the greatest economic opportunity of my life time, whether it be for profit or not for profit let's help the greatest consumer demographic in the world.  Be the best producer demographic in the world.  I don't think there's any greater like opportunity at all.  So, these things like what am I, what I've been prepared for like I've done some of it.  I haven't gotten wealthy be any stretch of the imagination but I'm showing people there's a path to it.  So, Code2040 is really built on those two things.  So, where we wanted to bring the highest performing and it has to be highest performing black, Latino engineering undergraduate out here.  Get them the internships they need and provide them with all the supplementary tools they need to be incredibly successful.  Whether they be the fireside chats with Ben Horowitzs of the world and other tech luminaries.  Whether it's mock on air media training with Bloomberg studios [Bloomberg Media Studios], right?  And other networking events, we make it an intense summer.  And it was really built off my summer with Sponsors for Educational Opportunity on Wall Street.  Or pretty much replicating that model for the tech basis.  Specifically for engineers and hopefully it grows from there.  Our first summer we had five fellows.  This past summer 150, next year we want to do close to three hundred.  We have a 90 plus percent full time offer rate, which is greater than the standard full time offer rate in Silicon Valley.  We're getting folks not only from not only the Stanfords [Stanford University, Stanford, California] and MITs [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] but also the University of Maryland, Baltimore County [Baltimore, Maryland], Stony Brook [Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York], stuff like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's UMBC is one of the biggest tech schools.
Speaker 2: But, none of these folks either don't have the resources or the desire to go recruit there, right?  But even at MIT, you know, one of our, our very first cohort, young man 4.7 out of 5 GPA [grade point average], co-president of his school, varsity athlete, computer scientist, had no idea about Silicon Valley.  So, even these companies and say we find the best and brightest at those schools, you know I call their bluff, because even at those schools we're helping find and supporting those folks throughout.  Now, he's started his own company, which is wonderful.
Speaker 1: And how do you raise money for Code2040?
Speaker 2: Yeah so, you know there's some kind of great human spirits who gave us the seed capital that we needed.  The very first bit of capital we got from the Kauffman Foundation [Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, Kansas City, Missouri], which is wonderful.  And now ambition in our budgets are higher and I think we have over thirty employees. There're more employees at Code2040 (laughter) then at Walker and Company, which is awesome.
Speaker 1: Where is it located?
Speaker 2: San Francisco [California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we have a cohort this past summer, it was the first time we had it in two places, San Francisco and then in Portland [Oregon] as well.  And we're looking to expand probably New York [New York] at some point too.
Speaker 1: And so, do you house these students and?
Speaker 2: No, so they--we help them find housing.  So, we partner with kind of providers and then, you know.  'Cause some folks work in San Francisco, some work in San Jose [California], some in Palo Alto [California], so we want to give them a choice (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, it's kind of local.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And if you're in Portland, then yeah you can find your own way.  But, we get them internships where they're getting paid pretty well.  In fact, the stat they're running, they're getting paid salaries which are greater than their entire like household income now, before they got it, right?  Which is amazing, right?  Like the salaries that they're getting is greater than the household average income of black and Latino households combined.  So, you think about this whole idea, a lot of people talk about access, access, access, access a lot of people talk about that in context of Code2040, for me it's about the awareness.  If we knew that this place existed we'd not only take it over, we'll do our thing as consumers becoming producers.  Much in the same way we've done it in sports.  We've done it in entertainment.  You know we've done it on Wall Street, we're doing it on Wall Street, right?  Tech is kind of that last frontier and I think the most important one.
Story_ID: 666962
Speaker 1: What is your vision for Code3040 [sic. Code2040] in the future?  I mean it's grown exponentially in five years.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean my, our goal is that by the year 2040 we don't need to exist anymore.  I mean that's the (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's why the name?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause that's when the majority-minority flip happens in the country, right?  So, in an ideal world we shut this down next year 'cause we don't, it's no need for us, right?  Big thing is kind of inspired a need for diversity and profitable option for companies (background noise)--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah (unclear) wow, sorry.
Speaker 1: You didn't do it.
Speaker 2: First time I've heard that in a while out here (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: So, just teaching technology companies how like this initiative is not charity, it's, it leads to better bottom line for your companies, right.  This is the greatest consumer demographic that will be the majority of this country.  You know, if Facebook [Facebook, Inc.] was built in the year 2040 would it be Spanish language or English first?  Would it be on Android first or iPhone first?  There are fundamental problems that like they don't even have to question now, but they will.  So, some of it is us preparing them for that, for those who are unwilling to prepare for it.  That's their loss, they can come work for me, or they can go out and start their own companies and I will fully support them in that initiative.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So obviously you're, you're you know, you're, you're on a like a launchpad, this is.
Speaker 2: I, I you know, I.
Speaker 1: Or does it feel like that?
Speaker 2: I don't know. I mean I, I know what we're doing means a lot to a lot of people.  But, also I want people to know that this isn't like intrigue, right?  Like I, I care deeply about it, I want everybody to succeed.  I hope that there is no, like, forcing mechanism that like our company has to succeed to the standard that everybody wants to in order to see some of this change, right?  And, I--that's why I'm out in the circuit all the time just talking about how this is possible.  How much it's necessary, right, reinforcing it.  'Cause I don't need to be the only champion talking about this stuff here.  I've just been fortunate with the platform out here greater than a lot of other folks who look like me.  But, it shouldn't end with me.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Nor should it start, or have started with me.
Story_ID: 666963
Speaker 1: You know we often ask people about what they think the future will be for African American--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --youth--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as we, as we look at the landscape, we look at what's the promise of 2040--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --in terms of the demographic, which doesn't necessarily mean what happens?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What, what do you envision for the future?
Speaker 2: I, I think I mean if this does happen.  I mean the, the, the, the thing about like the 2040 thing that's really interesting about this in the tech, tech world.  Sure, but don't hire, but numbers are not gonna work in your favor anyway.  So the winners here are going to be the patient ones, right?  'Cause the numbers will work out.  And, if we're doing everything that we can to turn like the--again these consumers into producers, then not only is the number gonna work out.  But, the impact is gonna be compounding.  'Cause now we're producing the things, right?  With technology that already compounds everything, right?  So, if we're patient enough we have kind of the right folks and leaders in place across all verticals, understanding that fact and we work together which is like the really important thing that like we don't worry about crabs in a barrel, we're not kind of trying at the expense of other people.  We do this together, I think we're gonna be fine.  We're gonna have our short terms, ebbs and flows.  Like, I'm not very excited about the president [President Donald John Trump] that we have currently.  I'm not excited about the politics of this country.  But, I'm excited about the promise of it.  Always have been, always will be.  You know, we're gonna have aberrations, right?  But, we've persevered through a hell of a lot worse, right?  And we'll continue to, I believe that.  I'm dedicating my life to this cause.  I'm dedicating my entire life to this cause.  Imagine if we had a whole bunch of people that did that so publicly the numbers will work out in our favor.  I am optimistic, I'm as optimistic as I've ever been about our community.  About our culture, about the pervasiveness of it, about the lastingness of it.  We just need to be consistent in our rhetoric.  And steadfast, and the rest will work out.
Speaker 1: Is there anything you'd like to share that I have not asked?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think if people see this in like fifty years hear of what I went through they'll remember it (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I mean the only thing that I would say is like man like we're trying and we're trying our damnedest and the thing that you know, for folks to see this kind of near and far just don't let up, right?  I mean that's been the story of my life.  That's been the story of our history.  We just never let up, right?  And you gotta, you gotta punch above weight class when you can, right?  And try even if you don't get you can try and that's the one thing that I think has sustained me, my entire life.  There will always be bias, explicit and implicit, but there's no bias in trying, right?  And you never know, you might get a few hits, you know, get some home runs.  And hopefully, we'll get a lot more home runs than we've seen.  But, I think we will.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you that was fun.
