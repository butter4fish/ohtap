Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe. I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers, our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Earl Ofari Hutchinson, E-A-R-L, O-F-A-R-I, H-U-T-C-H-I-N-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story behind the, the name Ofari?
Speaker 2: Originally my given middle name was Laverne, and in 1968 at the height of the Black Power movement, black consciousness movement, as a student at California State University, Los Angeles [California State College at Los Angeles; California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], we formed the black student union.  In fact we were the second group to form a black student union on the Southern California campus.  And at that particular point in time the fad, the trend, the craze, an African name.  So there were Ghanaian students at Cal State L.A., so looking around, looking around what would be a suitable African name?  And so it wasn't just pulled from the air, so I consulted with some of the students from Ghana and actually from Kenya and a couple of other places.  But when the name Ofari came up, and it was suggested that this was an Ashanti name from the Ashanti tribe in Ghana, Northern Ghana, and that meaning was student, disciple, I said this fits, this fits in.  So, because I always felt and still feel deeply that life is a learning process.  Until they put the flowers on you, you're always learning, if you're attuned to it, new experiences and watching, accessing, analyzing.  Putting things together and essentially developing yourself as a person, Ofari fit and it stuck.  For a long period of time during my writing career, which is still there, I didn't use my last name Hutchinson.  It was always Earl Ofari, but in recent years, Earl Ofari Hutchinson now became my full name.  And there's a story behind that but, that's how Ofari came about.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well what's the story behind using (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well the story behind that is the identification with my father, I mean, he is Earl Hutchinson.  He doesn't have a middle name, Earl Hutchinson.  And so in thinking about it, as I got older, in my fifties now, I started thinking, and I'm resuming my writing again, Earl Ofari Hutchinson I mean that's my family name.  That was the given family name, that's my birth name, and given the respect and the appreciation that I had for my father, I said why not do this, why not have the best of both worlds?  That name that was there for so many years that was an adopted name, Ofari, and then my given family name.  So the three were welded together, Earl Ofari Hutchinson, and I felt that that was not just out of respect and appreciation, but also a tribute too.  When you understand what fathers, especially fathers like mine have done in terms of building the bridges and certainly paving the highway for us to move across that.  So I felt that was a fitting tribute, keep your family name.
Speaker 1: So you think it's like a testimony to continuity on some levels?
Speaker 2: It was a testimony to continuity and Hutchinson, there's nothing to be ashamed of, I mean we take great pride in it.  Because this is our family and part of our family legacy, so it's worked.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you for that.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: October 8th, 1945, Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, and sir what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: At this point in time? Writer, political analyst--author, political analyst.
Speaker 1: Is there another significant occupation that we're missing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's all we do.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Author, political analyst.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is September 19th--excuse me, September 20th, 2008.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: In Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: Okay, in your home.
Speaker 2: In my home.
Story_ID: 485864
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that management compels me to ask of everyone, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact I do, the favorite food is, since I love Mexican cuisine, tacos.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I don't have a favorite color, no.
Speaker 1: A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yes, the fall.
Speaker 1: Okay, favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Sedona, Arizona because we have property there.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the, the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Actually I have several of them, what's the most appropriate, the--(pause) honor your past.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now I'm gonna ask about your, your ancestors and your family, I'm gonna ask about your mother's [Nina Brown Hutchinson] side of the family first and then your father's [Earl Hutchinson] side.  So we'll start (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually can I, can I have one, one more saying?
Speaker 1: Oh sure.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Actually I have one more.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this, the saying that I've always, or least in recent times found to be very utilitarian and try to govern things by.  And it's an old Russian proverb, when you chase two hares, you catch neither, focus on one goal, one objective and do it well, instead of being scattered all over the place--that's always a prescription for failure.
Story_ID: 485865
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Earl Hutchinson] side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nina Mae Brown [Nina Brown Hutchinson].
Speaker 1: Okay, how do you spell--
Speaker 2: M-A, M-A-E Brown.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: With no E.
Speaker 1: Nida, N-I-D-A?
Speaker 2: No, Nina Mae.
Speaker 1: Nina, oh Nina.
Speaker 2: Nina Mae Brown.
Speaker 1: Okay M-A-E Brown, okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: This is gonna, it's not exact, (laughter) it's funny I'm laughing because for many years women of that era had this thing, you don't tell your age. A little funny little s- a little sideline on that.  We were coming back from downtown--this was many years ago, she passed in 1974.  And I always thought, I had a certain age in mind, 'cause I didn't know, I mean there was really no reason to know.  But she always looked extremely youthful, very, very youngish looking woman, and (laughter) and she's always told that.  So I guess I've must've been about nineteen or twenty, I never will forget we were downtown at the bus stop. And we didn't have a car, so we're at the bus stop and she pull out her wallet, and so I looked at the driver's license.  She had a license and I was stunned and I said, "Is that your--?" (Laughter) "How old are you?"  Because I'm thinking it was like ten, fifteen years younger, she died at sixty-two, and she died in 1974, so she w- she was born in 1912.  And I have to be honest with you, I cannot remember the month of her birth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father was born; I guess that's the next question?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Oh (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Next question is where was your mother born?
Speaker 2: Oh, she was born in Cedar Rapids, Idaho--Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
Speaker 1: Cedar Rapids, Iowa, okay.  Now what, how much do you know about your mother's side of the family, we'll get to your father's side.  But we do her side first.
Speaker 2: Quite a bit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was very close to my maternal grandmother, her mother, Althea Brown [ph.].  And I would spend from the age of about seven or eight, my summers with her. For, this went on for about seven or eight years in Quincy, Illinois, she lived, that family lived Iowa, Western Illinois, Northern Missouri.  That, that triangle along the Mississippi [Mississippi River], so they were from, they relocated in Quincy many, many years ago.  And so my grandmother was there, and every summer she'd put me on the train, the Illinois Central [Illinois Central Railroad] and I, you know back then you could actually put young children on a train.  By themselves (laughter) you know with the little name, and then you knew they would get there.  So I would spend summers with my grandmother in Quincy, Illinois, and I mean just tons of maternal relatives.  Aunts and uncles, because then in that part of Quin- Quincy, I mean Quincy was every bit as much as Missouri.  Every bit as segregated in the late '50s [1950s] and early si- late '50s [1950s] mid to late '50s [1950s] as Mississippi.  So the blacks lived on three blocks in, in Quincy and its funny, the whites lived you know how they did on the next block.  But it was like you might as well be on the far side of the moon (laughter) even though you're literally a few feet away.  So we had many relatives on those blocks that were my mother's either cousins or nieces or in this case her mother.  Uncles and aunts, so very close.
Speaker 1: Now is there a, a story about the family's origins, I mean did you know Iowa is a place that you know it doesn't have a large black population.  Is there a story how the family got out to Iowa?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  You mean my, my maternal side?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: My grandmother, Althea, I don't know, I never knew my grand- maternal grandfathers, never knew them.  They were long gone by then by the time I came along.  My grandmother, she was, is it possible for you to make one little shift with your hand to the right, there's a picture of her.  You see those pictures right there?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, we'll show them at the end of--
Speaker 2: Well I bring it for a reason.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Well this is her, and sitting on the front porch--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --with the elders in Quincy, Illinois, and that's you know the shotgun house back then where I spent the summers.  As you can see, she was almost a full-blooded Cherokee Indian [Native American]. I mean, we would call her, in fact in the family, the squaw.  Meaning that you know it's not politically correct these days but you know back then.
Story_ID: 485866
Speaker 1: And as the story was told, the migration from the South, the Cherokees, you know, the Trail of Tears out of North Carolina through different parts of the South.  And then that branch, I guess her grandpar- great-grandparents actually moved to the North, so by the time, the latter, she was born in 1888.  And the story is that from the mid eight- 19th century on that there was a tremendous Native American, Cherokee and some other tribes that had settled on the western banks of the western part of Iowa.  So right through there was Council Bluffs [Iowa], Cedar Rapids [Iowa], a number of the smaller cities had a significant Native American population.  My [maternal] grandmother's [Althea Brown (ph.)] one of them, so the family, the origins were in that part of Iowa--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --because of the, the migration of--
Speaker 2: Okay, so--
Speaker 1: --the tribes.
Speaker 2: So your family in Iowa's a mixture of African American and Cherokee?
Speaker 1: Considerably.
Speaker 2: Now what about the African American side, do you know where they came from or--?
Speaker 1: I have no, I have to be honest with you, one of the things that I was gonna give my daughter an assignment and she's deeply involved with that.  Through the whole genealogy and we'll put together, we'll fill in the blanks and connect the dots.  We haven't done that yet, so I don't know really about that side of the family, the African American side.  On the maternal side, we get to my father [Earl Hutchinson], quite a bit there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I know very little.
Speaker 2: So there's no story on your mother's [Nina Brown Hutchinson] side about the end of slavery and what it was like and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Shakes head) No.
Speaker 2: --migration and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: No, there all on the old man's side.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  Well did your mother grow up in Cedar Rapids, or?
Speaker 1: Council Bluffs, well Cedar Rapids, Council Bluffs and for a time Omaha, Nebraska because it's right there--
Speaker 2: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in close proximity.
Speaker 2: --is there a story as to why they moved around so much?
Speaker 1: There is a story, but I don't know it.
Speaker 2: Was it the ra- the railroad or jobs associated with the railroad or?
Speaker 1: I just have a dim recollection of one time being shown early on a picture of my maternal grandfather, and a very fair-skinned man.  Very fair--African American man, very fair-skinned, my get, but he had a suit and tie on.  So my guess is and this is only a guess, that it had nothing to do with the railroads, but probably whatever his occupation was they moved around.  Because I got a sense later on from her just bits and, gleaning bits and pieces from some of her stories that they did move quite a bit during those years.
Speaker 2: Yeah the reason why I mentioned the railroad 'cause blacks that worked on the railroad often would--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --change occupation from going out that way.  There was a big count outside of Omaha that was and, that's a big you know place where a lot of African Americans would congregate, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well North Omaha [Omaha, Nebraska]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know (unclear) the railroad.
Speaker 1: She never mentioned that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, but that could be a possibility.
Story_ID: 485867
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Nina Brown Hutchinson] say about growing up, did she have any stories about growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was one that always stuck with me.  In fact, I heard that story so many times, that she was a, a very smart woman.  And in that era, women and we're talking now you know 19- pre-world war--or actually just post World War I [WWI].  Girls of that era were not supposed to show intelligence, I mean, that was not part of the training, you were trained to do one of the, you know basically be a housewife, have babies, take care of the kids, I mean that was your role then, the maternal role, but she was always a step above.  She was really a woman not of her times; very forward looking, very intelligent, very well-read and very well-spoken.  So she, she was always being tracked to do one thing, a do- either a domestic or a seamstress, but that's not what she wanted.  She wanted to be a doctor, and so she wanted to go to medical school, but in that era, you didn't go to medical school if--.  And maybe at best a nurse, but not a doctor.  So there was, that was always a source of frustration, and she would talk about that over time how one of her greatest regret, regrets was that she never had the opportunity to go to medical school during that era.  I do not think--she did not go to college that I know of, I know that she went to trade schools for a while because she was an excellent seamstress.  But there was one story that always stuck with me, she could pass for white, and if you see the pictures, it would just look like an auburn haired Caucasian woman.  Maybe at best if you wanna be charitable of maybe (unclear) Spanish or the Italians, Mediterranean type.  But not really defined Negroid features or Africoid features.  Her teachers always told her growing up, because she did not live, they never lived in black communities.  I mean there they were too full--there were so few then African Americans in that part of I, Iowa during that era that it was always basically whites, whites, whites.  I mean there were no defined black neighborhoods, maybe in Omaha [Nebraska], but not in Iowa, the smallest towns.  So her teacher, teachers in school always pushed her to be white and pass for white because of the way she looked.  I mean it would have been easy, who would've known, but she took great pride down through the years.  And if I heard that once, I heard it twice, I heard it a thousand times, she said no, she did the Nancy Reagan thing, just say no. I am what I am and I'm proud of it and that's the way it is. She always defined--back then it was Negro.  She really defined, really identified with the, the Indian [Native American] ancestry, but it always Negro.  So she always said no, it was never an option of passing even though it could've been done easily, and who would've known, said no.  So she always, that was kind of her, her, her stand for (laughter) my identity of who I am and, we're not even gonna go there.
Story_ID: 485868
Speaker 1: Because she [Hutchinson's mother, Nina Brown Hutchinson] could easily move (gesture) in, across the lines, she had two jobs, one as a seamstress in a garment factory.  And this was in Ch- actually this was one in Chicago [Illinois] and then later on we came out here; we moved to Los Angeles [California] in 1964 from Chicago.  Her first job was working for an insurance company on Wilshire Boulevard [Los Angeles, California], and so, then this I remember.  And then of course she related it back to years earlier in Chicago working for a garment manufacturer, 'cause she was a seamstress.  She would always say--and she would come home sometimes in tears I mean 'cause she's very sensitive.  Because she not, did not tell anybody what she was, she wasn't trying to hide anything, but it just never came up.  So people just assumed that she was a white woman.  (Laughter) And, and of course when they assumed that, in her circle around her they would say things of course you know the kinds of things.  They would make any kind of remark any kind of racial anything 'cause they just assumed that she was white.  So she would sometimes come home in tears because of what she would hear them say.  In other words demeaning blacks, you know, all the, the terms and phrases and thinking so one day, she couldn't take it anymore, so someone made one remark one too many.  And she said, "Well that, that Negro," no, "that nigger that you're talking about is me; I'm one of them too."  And she said when she said that (laughter) literally you could, the pla- it was quiet as a church mouse in a sanctuary.  The tongues were, I mean like the mouths dropped, the eye- eyebrows raised it's like what?  We've been saying all these things around you?  So right there on the spot she knew she couldn't work there anymore, because it would've been a hostile environment because she was the only one.  Right there, that day, she turned in, she quit right on the spot, and this, this really hurt her because this was really getting into the workplace.  I mean as seen then in the pr- even though she was a clerk or, a typist, it was getting into the workplace in a professional, or semi-professional capacity.  And so that was kind of her way to kind of move up and of course she had to let it go because she knew, I cannot stay here.
Speaker 2: Okay so she had a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They would make life miserable for me.
Speaker 2: She had a glimpse into a hidden world.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: A world that's hidden from most black people.
Speaker 1: Ex- right.  How would you know, she saw the other face.
Speaker 2: There's always a suspicion that things are worse than you think they are, and then--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, but she saw the other face, maybe the true face.
Story_ID: 485869
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Earl Hutchinson.
Speaker 1: That's right, just, just two names.
Speaker 2: And I can tell you when he was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was born December 11th, 1903, in fact we wrapped the whole chapter around that, the year 1903 and 'The Souls of Black Folk' with Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois].
Speaker 1: Yeah the Wright brothers [Orville Wright and Wilbur Wright] and all that--I was looking at it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.  In fact we spent a whole--the great discoveries of that, that year and we tracked it back.
Speaker 1: Right, well just give, give us a little bit of that right now.  I mean it--
Speaker 2: Well you mentioned one--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: In fact we lead the book off with you know Du Bois' great line: "The problem of the 20th century is a problem with the color line."  And he was born that year when Du Bois, at least the book was published in 1903--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --first edition.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: The Wright brothers, he actually was born the either the week, I believe the week after the Wright brothers made the historic flight in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.  And there, there were some other things too some inventions, and some other very significant events that happened in 1903 that we can track back to him.  But we tied in Du Bois because Du Bois socio-political, I mean obviously there was a huge, huge defining observation for the 20th century into the 21st century.  But also the Wright brothers, a huge leap forward in terms of technology for this that certainly has had a monster influence on the 20th century.  So we thought that was important to draw the parallels and the significance of his birth date, birth year and even month to Du Bois and, and of the Wright brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay now for those who don't know, you helped your father write a memoir ['A Colored Man's Journey Through 20th Century Segregated America,' Earl Hutchinson with Earl Ofari Hutchinson] of his life, and we were flipping through it before we started the interview.  But it's quite a contribution to you know memory of your father and to you know our collective history.  Now where was your father born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Jackson, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Jackson, Tennessee, okay, now that's the home of Lane College, I think, C.M.E. [Christian Methodist Episcopal] school, right?
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So how far back can you trace your father's side of the family, and what do you know about their origins?
Speaker 2: Well actually quite a bit, because his father was James Hutchinson, his mother was Elizabeth, Elizabeth Barrett [Elizabeth Barrett Hutchinson (ph.)].  And of course Jackson, Tennessee, I mean that's the ance- the original home, the ancestral home.  But they lived in Jackson, Tennessee well he was born there in 1903, there were four other brothers, two sisters.  And to my knowledge all--because he was the oldest--all were born in Jackson, Tennessee.  So they lived there for four or five years after he was born, and then family moved to St. Louis [Missouri], so.  His father, James Hutchinson, got a job, I don't think it was the railroads, I think he was a cook, so he got a job with some restaurant as a cook.  Or actually I think between that, and he did catering back then.  So that was his profession, that was his trade, and so the family moved and relocated to St. Louis because, the guess is, obviously better opportunities in a bigger city than Jackson, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay di- so they were in Jackson for, well your, well your father was born in 1903, did, did they move in 1904?
Speaker 2: No I think they, they stayed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Jackson?
Speaker 2: --in Jackson--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --a few more years after that--
Speaker 1: Reason why I'm asking is that the World's Fair was in St. Louis [St. Louis World's Fair, Louisiana Purchase Exposition, St. Louis, Missouri] in 1904, drew so many people in, I just wondered if that had anything to do with it you know.
Speaker 2: You know actually that's in the book, but there wasn't a significant tie-in to him being there and then move--but he was there for the World's Fair, but they, they, they were still then, because I know the move came after that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So, so they moved to St. Louis and now was the family tradition that the family was always from Tennessee, I mean had been in Tennessee for generations before they moved to St. Louis?
Speaker 2: As far as I know, Tennessee was the roots, and I'm sure beyond my, the great-grandfa- the grandfather, the great-grandfather, I'm sure Tennessee was it.  I never heard any mention of Mississippi or Alabama or any further south.  So Tennessee seem to be the an- the genealogy of our family on that side, the paternal side.
Speaker 1: Yeah I just wanted; probably some migrated from de- Virginia or something like you know when you go back further, it's probably coming from the East.  You know rather than--
Speaker 2: No it's always been--
Speaker 1: But are, are there any stories about slavery or the end of slavery?
Speaker 2: Well, he, my grandfather was not a slave, and although I'm assuming his parents were, I mean they almost have to be in Tennessee then.  There are very few blacks, I mean they were there but you know most were slaves.  He never told any stories about that, but what he di- most of his stories were centered on, when we looked at the family origins, were centered on segregation, growing up in St. Louis.  So he spent a lot of time, and we learned a lot about that.
Story_ID: 485870
Speaker 1: Tell us about some of your father's [Earl Hutchinson] experiences in St. Louis [Missouri] growing up.
Speaker 2: There were many, let's see, he lived in St. Louis from, I think he was five years old when they got to St. Louis, 1908, maybe 1909.  He left St. Louis in 1927, so in his formative years were spent in St. Louis.  Went to Frederick Douglass High School [Webster Groves, Missouri], in fact elementary school and high school, St. Louis was a segregated city then, totally.  It was a southern city; every bit as segregated and every bit as southern as Jackson, Mississippi.  So schooling, segregated schools, neighborhood, segregated neighborhood.  They actually, as you know St. Louis is the home of Anheuser-Busch [Anheuser-Busch Companies], and there was an Anheuser-Busch, the big plant, a factory.  At least one of them, distillery, was, was right in back of the house where I spent the summers, when I would go back to St. Louis where he was born.  They, the family never moved, they lived in the same house for decades, but the stories were always one of A, trying to navigate in this very, very insular, very segregated environment, racially.  But also not just race, but also the mentality, even though St. Louis was a notable city, it was still a small town mentality, especially among African Americans then.  So he always talked about a very idyllic childhood, I mean, but one thing that he always talked about was that from day one the work ethic.  He worked, he worked it, at, starting at five and six years old doing little things.  Whether it was you know running errands, whether it was going to helping people with their groceries.  Because back then you walked to the grocery store, I mean didn't have cars, he always talked about that.  As a young, as a boy, just trying to earn money because his thing was he wanted to be independent, and so he understood the value of money and doing little chores, always either in the house or outside the house.  He was always very; he was a broader person in terms of interacting with just about anybody, especially older persons.  'Cause his thing was find somebody older and learn from them, and so you know he would always talk about that.  The schooling, he had a great interest in music because he was a musician, so early on he picked up the saxophone and the clarinet and his brother also played the clarinet.  So he played in the band, they had a marching band in high school.  He never, I never got the sense in talking about the years in St. Louis whether working, rather his chores as a boy and then high school that there was any kind of you know racial discord because my guess is the world that he lived in was such a racially segregated world, I mean rigidly, that you would have very little contact back then with anyone that was non-African American.  Ah, you know the police maybe, bill collectors, sales persons, but other than that, that's about it.  You might as well be on Pluto and Jupiter; I mean the worlds were totally separate then.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, very tight black community in St. Louis too (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Extremely tight.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, right.
Story_ID: 485871
Speaker 1: Did your father [Earl Hutchinson], now go to college, now he went to, I know you said--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No he never went to college.
Speaker 1: --Frederick Douglass [Frederick Douglass High School, Webster Groves, Missouri].
Speaker 2: Yeah, high school was it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Left high school, well--
Speaker 1: So what did he do when he left high school?
Speaker 2: Went to work (laughter) got a job, and what he did was I'm not sure what the transition was between that and the post office.  But his whole life was the post office, he worked in the post office for forty-three years, and he actually, he did actually it was a very tight window between the time he left high school.  And then probably took the postal exam and started his career in the post office. Because he had to have started in the post office in the late '20s [1920s].  Because he retired in 1963, and we soon as he retired came out here [Los Angeles, California], so it was, it was close to forty-three years in the post office.   Let's see--
Speaker 1: He started in 1920s, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A little bit less, actually thirty-three years, I'm sorry--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in the post office. And that pretty much defined his life, his working life, his quote unquote professional life in the post office, no college.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know a lot of people with college degrees got stuck in the post office and never got out.
Speaker 2: He told stuff, yeah he knew them, many of his friends, some of them had Ph.D.'s back in the '30s [1930s].  I mean that was a job.
Speaker 1: Yeah, law degrees--
Speaker 2: Law degrees, I mean some of the best educated black folk in the world worked in the post office because the barriers were so great in the professions.
Story_ID: 485872
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Nina Brown Hutchinson and Earl Hutchinson] met?
Speaker 2: Yes, there is a story, not so much how they met, but how they got married, that is the more intriguing story (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay well, well if you can just recap how they met, then we, we get them married too.
Speaker 2: Well I th- they met at a dance and of course it was in Chicago [Illinois], and 'cause my mother of course relocated then.  The family, the progression out of Iowa to Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they met at a church dance, and he was an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal], actually a lay deacon, a deacon and then a lay minister, but for many years a deacon in the A.M.E. church.  And I guess she attended some of the services too, so they would have, and it was a common thing back then on Friday night, the church socials.  And so that's how they met.  He was married twice before my mother came along, but they were very short-term marriages.  And so obviously I'm not sure if he was divorced or separated from his second wife when he met my mother.
Speaker 1: So about what year is this when they get together?
Speaker 2: Well let's see my sister [Earline Hutchinson], she was born in 1937 and, so we had to be looking at, she--when I of course tracks into how they got married, so probably 1936.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm almost sure on the '36 [1936] and you'll know why in a minute.
Speaker 1: Okay now tell us the story about how, how they got married.
Speaker 2: Well because when she was pregnant (laughter) she got pregnant and they were married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So she always would amuse us with this story about how my father, he was a musician, and he was with--actually was he was in the band?  Not sure what band, I mean later he was with the, the [U.S.] Army band--I mean, excuse me, National Guard band.  And I'm not sure he, if he was with the National Guard band, but he must've been because they were actually moving around.  So the story is that after she found out she was pregnant, she chased him all the way to another city.  Because back then, if you got somebody pregnant you had to marry them (laughter) you married back then.  I mean that--in the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s], that's what you did.  And so he was to be charitable, let's just say he was less than disposed toward marriage (laughter) but she was determined as she told the story.  You did it, we're getting married, and they did, so that's why I could fix the timeline (laughter) for '36 [1936], 1937.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's when they got married, in 1937.
Story_ID: 485873
Speaker 1: Tell us about your parents' [Nina Brown Hutchinson and Earl Hutchinson] personalities and talents and dispositions, and tell us who do you take the most after?
Speaker 2: I think it's a blend of the father and mother.  The father, always saw him as very authoritarian, very domineering, very, very single-minded and very suspicious.  Was always very, excuse me, cautious about people in his relationships with them.  And I'm told now that some of those qualities are there, especially the caution.  She was much more, and also very insolent, father was extremely insolent.  But my guess is a lot of black man of that era that's just, it just came with the turf.  She was always very outgoing, she was a personality, she was the one that made friends.  She was the one that was a joiner, she was the one that had the club, she was the one that had the friendship circles.  She was the one that was always involved in church this, church that, this event, that event.  She was the joiner, she was the social gadabout, where as he was much more into self.  So I guess if we could put it on a scale of personalities, one's a classic introvert, the others a classic extrovert.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And she was the one also that always struck me as being, and this will--I, I always thought was very unique, particularly coming out of that era.  Very attuned to the issues and things in the world, I mean very well-read.  Not that he wasn't, but very attuned with things, and could carry on these conversations, which I thought was very unique for women of that era.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now, now you have a sister [Earline Hutchinson] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And very sensitive to race.
Speaker 1: Okay, she had the inside track--
Speaker 2: Oh sh- yeah.
Speaker 1: --'cause she heard conversations from both sides.
Speaker 2: Exactly. You know it, it honed her into that early on.
Story_ID: 485874
Speaker 1: So you've got an older sister [Earline Hutchinson]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and how many other siblings?
Speaker 2: One brother.
Speaker 1: One brother.
Speaker 2: Now the brother's a half-brother because she [Hutchinson's mother, Nina Brown Hutchinson] was married before, she met my father [Earl Hutchinson].  And actually she lived in Detroit [Michigan] and I you know the marriage was there.  And I'm not sure how long that marriage was but I have a half-brother and then of course my sister.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So in your household growing up was it you and your sister and your mother and father?
Speaker 2: Actually my brother lived with us (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your brother too?
Speaker 2: --for a while.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I guess after the break-up he came and lived for a few years with us in Chicago [Illinois], but then he went into the [U.S.] military.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He went to, the, there was some and I could probably see why now, some personality things you know between his stepfather and him.  So he became, I don't wanna say problem child, but the rebellion thing.  So what they decided to do was what, you know, a lot of black parents did in that era, when they were having problems with children, put them in a military school.  You know straighten them out then later on, take them down and ship them off to the [U.S.] Army or the, you know Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] or the [U.S.] Navy.
Speaker 1: Okay so he actually went to military school and to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He went to military academy, and then of course went into the military--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for--
Speaker 1: Did that mean that his father really had some means you know to be able to send him to a military school in the--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --nineteen thirties [1930s]?
Speaker 2: His father in Detroit, I mean his biological father, actually did, he was a very prominent businessman in Detroit.  Had an insurance company there, so you know back then, well you--probably even now it was a very lucrative profession.  So he had means and then of course my father, I don't know how they contributed to it, but it was probably, it was primarily his fa- his father, his natural father's call.  And they probably bankrolled the academy.
Story_ID: 485875
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory of the family?
Speaker 2: We- the, one of the earliest memories was actually connected between Chicago [Illinois] and California, the most vivid memories.  Because remember most of my real, real childhood memories were not with my mother [Nina Brown Hutchinson] and father [Earl Hutchinson], with my grandmother, the maternal grandmother [Althea Brown (ph.)].  There some things with the paternal grandmother [Elizabeth Barrett Hutchinson (ph.)] in St. Louis [Missouri], but primarily with the maternal grandmother.  Because she really in a sense really took me under her wing, and really took the great interest in raising me.  Not that the, you know mom and father were, father were absent, but it's just the way it was.  It was kind the natural progression.
Speaker 1: Now the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The memory I have with my mother and father was the trips that we took, two of them, of cross country coming to Los Angeles, California.  In the 1950s, the first time we came out here was, I was eight years old, and this was 1953, '54 [1954].  And we had a 1953 Buick Roadmaster, never will forget it, big shinny car, big, big shinny cars.  You know it was all iron and steel back then (laughter) rims and tires and fins and all that stuff.  So they drove from Chicago with a, another man 'cause my father felt he needed help with that drive.  They had heard stories of the Promised Land, of this land out west where streets were paved with gold.  And sunshine, orange trees and no winter and it was just paradise, you know they heard all the stories filtering back to Chicago.  And so that began kind of that next migration from Chicago to the West, so they came out, they wanted to see what this Promised Land looked like.  And so my sister [Earline Hutchinson] and myself and the family and the other fellow, we drove across country.  Vivid memories of stops along the way, back then, my father corrected me later.  I thought it was a blue book, he said it was a green book when blacks traveled the country then pre-1960 they carried, he said blue, I thought it was a blue book.  He said green book, we have to check that, maybe it was a green and blue book.  This was a, these were places in each city where blacks could stay, spend the night, because as you know in many hotels and motels, motels were just taking off then, you couldn't stay there, African Americans could not stay in hotels and motels in many cases with one exception one that always had the great name was the Howard Johnson's chain going way back they were open.  But the rest of them were no.  So I remember each stop along the way, my father would have this book and they would consult this book, they'd always had it circled, where in each town they were gonna stop where you could stay.  And I got to tell you, some of the places I had very vivid memories of this and to say that they were dives was being charitable.  We're talking about dumps; I mean beat-up, rundown little places that were off the way, off the beaten path.  Where the rooms, where the mattresses were greasy, beat-up and everything, the floors, everything, nothing, you know, we're talking about flop houses, classic case.  And I do remember in staying in a couple of places where there were no doors, but we had bed sheets you know that was just partitions.  And that's just the way it was, and then of course sometimes they were private homes where they would take in boarders and you know you could have your meals there and spend the night and keep going, kick--keep you moving.
Story_ID: 485876
Speaker 1: But I remember that, and I also remember something else: Route 66, the classic Route 66 was the way you traveled from Chicago [Illinois] to St. Lou- to well, St. Louis, Missouri the rest, to California.  And what they would do they would take the northern route and they would take the southern route back, the 66 route.  And I remember 66 as you know took you through Texas and New Mexico, Arizona, but especially Texas.  And always there, earliest memories, I remember that he [Hutchinson's father, Earl Hutchinson] would send my mother [Nina Brown Hutchinson] in.  I often wondered, now why is she going in and coming out when we would stop you know with the little tray with the stuff.  Now why, why didn't he ever go in, I mean you know you're eight, nine years old, you don't put two and two together and connect the dots.  And of course later on you, you knew why she would go in, and she could walk through the front and he would kind of sneak around and hide you know the car in the back so they couldn't look out and see that he was sitting there in the car and she was getting--that might even create more problems back then.  But she would always go in and she was the designated getting the food person.  And so I remember it was always the food of record was hamburgers (laughter) and so she would come out with the hamburgers and the French fries, and we sit in the car eat them.  You go on about your business.  I never remember us getting out going into the back of these places, you know, he wasn't gonna do that.  So it was just easier send her in get the stuff and come out and, and when you really think about it, now, I'm thinking about it now in a sense, that kind of preserved--kind of did two things.  It kind of tweaked them a little bit 'cause they didn't know, and that was maybe perverse way of getting back (laughter) and then on the other hand, preserving a little bit of your dignity.  No, we're not going into the back, we, if we have to eat in the car, that's fine, but least we're eating somewhere that's ours.   And that you're not imposing upon us, I always remember that, those hotels, really motels, sometimes private homes and also those, those stops along the way, they were just diners.
Speaker 2: Now did your father explain the dynamics of these--
Speaker 1: Never.
Speaker 2: --things (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Never.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No, because that wasn't the way they did things then, you were always shielded as you know.
Speaker 2: Okay, later in life though you all were able to talk about those things?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: And, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well but he never explained--
Speaker 2: --write the book ['A Colored Man's Journey Through 20th Century Segregated America,' Earl Hutchinson with Earl Ofari Hutchinson], but, but in those days it wasn't--
Speaker 1: Oh no.
Speaker 2: --part of the discussion.
Speaker 1: No, no, you--it was the accepted course of things in as, 'cause you gotta remember this, there's, there's another dynamic here: how parents viewed children then, you gotta remember that literally you knew your place (laughter) children were seen but not heard.  And I mean you know old school folk you know that's pretty much the way kids were, so it wasn't a thing of talking to them about things, explaining things.  That's a modern concept that came much later, not in that era.
Story_ID: 485877
Speaker 1: At home when you, you know, when, when events would come on in new- in news on the radio or television or in the paper, would your family discuss--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You said your mother [Nina Brown Hutchinson] was very politically attuned--
Speaker 2: No, that came much later--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when we would talk about politics and issues and so forth, I, you know I was later years in high school and college by then.  But no, they never explained things and helped us along because one, they didn't feel they had to.  There was no pressure to do that, and the second thing is that parents didn't really talk to their children about political, social issues then, you just didn't do that then, you barely talked to, to them at all (laughter) but that wasn't on the table.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did, well on the subjects, since we're on the subject, now did you have access to black newspapers when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, well those were the only newspapers in Chicago [Illinois] at time as you know the paper of record, the national black paper of record was the Chicago Defender.  What I did--but this came a little bit later, I'm, twelve, thirteen years old now, I would sell Jet magazine, back then the way it started with Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson].  You know, they, they had an army of folk, kids mainly that were on the streets selling, so we would sell Jet magazine.  I actually delivered the Chicago Defender, but, you know, I'm not reading these publications, I'm not reading them you know it's just a little job to make money then.  So none of this was on my radar scope at twelve and thirteen years old, mainly race issues in America it was just simply not there.  With one exception, there was an experience I did have that has imprinted something early on and it stayed with me, it was a traumatic experience.  Chicago was a segregated city, every bit as segregated; we're talking again pre-1960, every bit, even today.  I mean rigidly segregated, residentially segregated.  Now, we lived on the South Side of Chicago, the South Side as you well know and of course the West Side.  The far South Side of Chicago and we moved from 63rd [Street] and Greenwood [Avenue], and then we moved out to 80th [Street] and Rhodes [Avenue], Chatham Fields [Chatham, Chicago, Illinois].  I remember riding my bike; actually we lived on, in the Green- Woodlawn area [Chicago, Illinois].  I remember riding my bike and then, one day I had a couple white friends, well they were some white guys, young white kids that I--.  I don't know how this came about, but we would play little games and so I rode out to one of the parks close by.  And I never will forget there were some older white teens, white guys, and so it was three of us, myself and these other two.  And so these guys got us together, surrounded us, and so they were gonna have fun with us.  I mean so they started you know kind of slapping us around a little bit, but didn't touch me, slapped the others around.  And then they said something, they said, "You can go, but you stay," me, "You stay" (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You stay.
Speaker 2: Right, so now I--you don't need to be a rocket scientist (laughter) to figure out something because these are brutal guys, you know what's going on?  So I start, I remember started screaming, hollering (laughter) everything hoping you know cars are going by (laughter) you know I mean just running around.  And they were trying you know grab me, and I said no, so finally they gave up you know and I got on my bike and got out of there, God knows what would've happen, that that was a lesson.
Speaker 1: Yeah well there are stories you know since, I came to Chicago in '77 [1977] there were stories since '77 [1977] of kids like beaten up or put in the hospital.  One kid, Lenard Clark, as late as 1997 was knocked senseless with a bat--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) now he's like a vegetable for going under the wrong viaduct in Chicago today I mean you know, you know in 1997.  So I mean it's--
Speaker 2: It can happen.
Speaker 1: --it was a serious--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --it's a serious issue, yeah serious issue--
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably still today.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, doesn't take much imagination to think circa 1958, circa 1959.
Story_ID: 485878
Speaker 1: Now did you remember the Emmett Till incident?
Speaker 2: Oh, very vividly.
Speaker 1: Okay this is '55 [1955] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That I do remember.
Speaker 1: --you would've been younger then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I was nine, ten years old, but I do remember it.  Because as you know that gripped black Chicago [Illinois], South Side Chicago, because that's where he was from.  My understanding--we talk about that in the book  ['A Colored Man's Journey Through 20th Century Segregated America,' Earl Hutchinson with Earl Ofari Hutchinson] too, the impact it had on blacks--I mean it was just like you know just boom, a bolt that just (laughter) that just jolted everybody.  It was a wakeup call, of course it was a wakeup call for America too, but that was, that was the defining moment.  The Emmett Till--when you know his mother Mae Mobley [sic. Mamie Till-Mobley]--Mae, was it Mae Mobley? I think brought him back to Chicago and then insisted, no, I want the world to see what they did to my boy.  The open casket and I mean (makes sound) and the pictures it was, you know decades later, half century later I mean it still sends those chills up when you see those pictures.  And of course there have been you know the films and the docudramas since then.
Story_ID: 485879
Speaker 1: Can you kind of give us a description of the neighborhood that you lived in, what it was like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now remember we lived in three--
Speaker 1: --what the housing was like--okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Okay which one now?
Speaker 1: Well let's--
Speaker 2: The original one?
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's kind of just walkway- you first were in, in Chicago [Illinois] then you--
Speaker 2: First we lived on 47th [Street] and Langley [Avenue]--
Speaker 1: Yeah okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, 47th Street as you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that, that was a mecca. Very little memory of that because when we left there, I was three years old.  We moved to 63rd [Street] and Greenwood [Avenue], which was all--if you can imagine as being from Chicago, we're talking 1948, '49 [1949]--it was all-white.  It, I tell people that now and go (makes sound) (laughter), oh yeah it was all white.  Here's the story on that.  And my father [Earl Hutchinson] has a little footnote in history, restrictive covenants, as you know the [U.S.] Supreme Court knocked it out [in Shelley v. Kraemer, 1948].  However, you couldn't enforce them, but they were still on the books and they were privately enforced, not legally enforceable but privately adhered to.
Speaker 1: I think wasn't there an ordinance in Chicago that forbid for sale signs or something--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) I think that was--sale sign.
Speaker 2: Where we bought, my father, the, the adventuresome side of him bought a house, three-story house, 6357 Greenwood, I still remember the phone number.  Stewart three--back then, remember names? Stewart, three, six, eight, two, nine.  When he bought the house, we, he bought it through what they called a proxy, as you know many of them were Jewish then, they were very sympathetic.  So they would proxy for blacks, they could not buy, they would buy it and then quick claim it over.  So what happened was, he had a proxy, who was sympathetic, and they bought the house, he bought it.  Paid, put a big down payment on it, you know, he was a very good saver, but he couldn't live in it.  One year he could not live in the house that he bought, but my mother [Nina Brown Hutchinson] and grandmother [Althea Brown (ph.)] did because remember, they could pass.  So what happened was, they lived in the house, and he, all he could do was come and visit after dark.  There were two police officers, for one year that were in the vestibule of that house.  And he kept--the only one and only time I ever saw a gun, they kept a gun there, and my mother used to say that she would use it if anybody got close (laughter).  And so she wasn't afraid because she was fearless, and, so yeah, these two women that were living there.  I could not live there, you know I, stay, they still, he still had his place on 47th Street. And so basically they carried this on for one year until--and they knew, the neighbors knew that this was owned by a black man.  And they tried everything they could under the sun to get him out of there, you know buy him off, scare him off, do anything they could, threats.  So the one time, well I shouldn't say one time, he stood firm, I mean visibly, although he wasn't a fool.  He knew he wasn't gonna stay there (laughter) you know until everything kind of settled down.  So after a period of time, you know he was able to finally live in his own home.  And then of course the progression of time, one black gets in and then of course then, as the trickle begin, begins, one, two, three, four and so of course, and then of course you know what happens with those neighborhoods, boom.  In three or four years, all-white to all-black, the stampede is out of there, it's an all-black neighborhood.  So that was, that was a defining moment because of that, so that imprinted the fact that we got a problem here.  I mean I couldn't put things together, but I knew that there was, there were problems on the racial front.  And, so they lived there from 1948 to 1957, and then of course they moved out to Chatham Fields [Chatham, Chicago, Illinois] and that was a transitional area then too.  But in any case--
Speaker 1: And Chatham Fields was like, where is that, that's like--
Speaker 2: That's 80th [Street], in that area, the 80th, 90th Street back then, before it was King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive] it was South Park [South Parkway].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And then--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --going south.  So, anyway they stayed there through the '50s [1950s], and so did I.
Story_ID: 485880
Speaker 1: Where did you start grade school?
Speaker 2: Let's see, Holy Cross [Holy Cross School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Holy Cross, 'cause the first nine years I went to Catholic school, Holy Cross in 1950, 1950.
Speaker 1: Now where's Holy Cross in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: It's on, Holy Cross on, well South Side, I wanna say, its two blo- (laughter) I'm being very precise now.  Because I went back to look at the school a few years ago, just to see if was still there, 'cause they've done so much on that part of South Side of Chicago. Right off then South Park [South Parkway; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive], yeah South Park, let's see Cottage Grove [Avenue], South Park, South Park, two blocks, let's see, was that, must've been four, 64th [Street], sixty--64th and Eberhart [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That sounds about right, okay, okay.  I couldn't picture it, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So all right, so--
Speaker 2: You know funny thing about that, this is one thing.  As a kid, now this is important, you know as a kid, the world is so much bigger everything is (unclear), everything is huge.  I hadn't been back to Chicago for a number of years, and when I went back, of course the first thing you wanna see, it's about twenty years, you wanna see the old neighborhood.  And of course you know then this was the, the early '90s [1990s] that part, it just look like you know Dresden [Germany] circa 1944 (laughter) you know after the bombs hit.  'Cause it was all, you know burned out and half of it and this I mean it was just, that part of Chicago, South Side looked bad, the Woodlawn area.  But the house, I went by it several times, the one I'm talking about, the one on, on--
Speaker 1: 63rd [Street] and--yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Greenwood [Avenue], I didn't re- I said where, I know it's here, but where is it?  And we kept driving back, then it hit me, 'cause I'm looking at this 6357 [6357 Greenwood Avenue] and it's still standing, but an image that you freeze in time as a five, six, seven year-old where the world is so much bigger.  And then as an adult looking at it would seem to me a gigantic house back then because that was imprinted.  There's this little tiny, then it hit me, I was looking at it through a child's lens, now I'm looking at it through an adult.  And when I saw it, it was just tiny, I said this was it (laughter) it looked gigantic.
Story_ID: 485881
Speaker 1: Did you like school for the most part?
Speaker 2: Catholic school I always felt gave me two things, one--even then, I felt a great education I always felt that, 'cause back then we were taught by the nuns.  Full regalia in that era, I mean full regalia, so they were very stern, very disciplined, disciplinarians, but they wanted you to be educated.  And so we, we always were very--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: School?
Speaker 2: Now, now, yeah did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 1: The favorite subject was hi--
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: My two favorite subjects were history and geography. I've always been a history buff, even going way back when, I'm just fascinated by people, events, dates, names and geography.  I've always been fascinated by places, even though many of them I haven't been to, but you know I love to look at maps.  I love to see where this city is, that state is, that country is and fanaticize, even now.  Let's see what would it be like to live there, what would it be like to be there, what would be like to travel there?  So those were always two of my favorite subjects.
Speaker 2: Okay, now were there any particular teachers in grade school that were--
Speaker 1: Oh I cannot remember any of them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) mentors?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) (Shakes head).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They're gone, those names, I remember teachers in, I remember teachers in high school, out here, but not in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well, with one exception, when I gradua- I actually went to two, three Catholic schools.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Holy Cross [Holy Cross School, Chicago, Illinois], then when we moved to 80th [Street] and Rhodes [Avenue] in 1957 I went to St. Dorothy's [St. Dorothy School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah I've heard of that, yeah, St. Dorothy's.
Speaker 1: St. Dorothy's and then when I left, graduated from St. Dorothy's, went to Mount Carmel [Mount Carmel High School, Chicago, Illinois] for the freshman year.
Speaker 2: That's over on Stony Island [Avenue] and 60th [sic.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And Stony Island, right, and remember several the, that, that was the Carmelite bro- the Carmelite fathers [Order of the Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel].  And I do remember some of the instructors there because they made you remember them because they were brutal.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Oh in that era you know I mean boom, the rod (laughter) I mean the belt, the razor strap, I mean they beat the crap out of you then, they were brutal.  So you do remember, I remember Father O'Neal [ph.] you know many of them were, were Irish.  Father Giles [ph.], Father Gillery [ph.], excuse me, Brother Giles, Brother Gillery, Brother O'Neal because they were always like Carmelite brothers--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: --so.
Speaker 2: So you were, so the family moved when you were in your last year of high school or--?
Speaker 1: No actually they moved my second year of high school.
Speaker 2: Second year okay, so you came out here and you finished high school at--?
Speaker 1: Dorsey High School [Susan Miller Dorsey High School, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Dorsey--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --okay.
Story_ID: 485882
Speaker 1: In Chicago [Illinois] now, did you, were there any other extra- extracurricular kind of activities you were involved in, the Y [Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)], or the Boys Club [Boys Clubs of America; Boys and Girls Clubs of America] or sports or anything?
Speaker 2: We always had the Boys Club back then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Boys Club was a major part of my life growing up, all the activity--'cause everything was centered around the Boys Club.  I mean this was before you had, really other activities and other places.  And it was always encouraged be part of the Boys Club and the parents were part of it too, the auxiliary and the events and these organizations that they had, supportive organizations.  But all the sports, basketball, football, flagged football, we played in--actually got involved with ice skating then.  Because back then you know you really had winters back in Chicago in that era, I mean where you actually had things that would actually freeze over.  Of course you know now it's not the same, but a lot of winter sports and the hockey.  We actually played ice hockey and field hockey, so I was involved always in sports.
Story_ID: 485883
Speaker 1: Now did you, I guess, miss Chicago [Illinois] when y- when the family moved to California?
Speaker 2: When we moved--let me back it up, remember I told you we took two trips, 1954 and again one, the second was in 1957 from Chicago to Los Angeles [California].  It was always in my father [Earl Hutchinson], it was always known and it was a plan, the second that he retired--I mean literally the second--selling, packing up and heading to Los Angeles.  You know at first they thought they were gonna relocate because we had, they did have some relatives in Oakland [California], Berkeley [California].  So the original plan was to, to live in the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California], I mean that was where we were gonna reloca- they were gonna relocate to, until they saw Los Angeles.  They say, that's all they talked about the sunshine and the orange trees, when they saw that, that did it (laughter) that was sold.  The deal was done on that one. So when he retired in the early '60s [1960s] and he decided we're moving to Los Angeles, my mother [Nina Brown Hutchinson] fell in love with the place.  Everybody fell in love with it, except me, because all my friends are here, school, this is the only thing I know was Chicago.  I have to tell you when, you know we always lived in nice houses, I mean by our standards.  You know by basically solid working class folk standards.  When we moved from Chicago to Los Angeles I--it would've been easier for me to get into a spaceship and go to the moon and live there.  I mean it was so alien and foreign, I mean you taking a fourteen year old you know I mean, I mean you know some things at fourteen.  And you're leaving a world that you were accustomed to, knew and love and just literally just pulled.  Because you have no say-so in it, you go with them, and so it just tore everything, the whole fabric of my being apart.  Then to live in a one-bedroom apartment after growing up in nice houses with a big circle of friends and family and knowing nobody in a strange alien environment, my world came to an end.  When I came out here the first few months, I mean and it--
Speaker 1: This is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) starting a strange school--
Speaker 1: Yeah 1959, right?
Speaker 2: No actually we came out in '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: Sixty-one [1961]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961].
Speaker 1: Okay so you're like sixteen then I guess right?
Speaker 2: Yeah actually I was sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.
Speaker 2: I--fifteen, going on sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it's totally strange environment, alien world, (laughter) and I have to tell you, if someone said here's a gun put it to your head (laughter).  And also too I was told much later that it wasn't my father's call; that he didn't want to come. 'Cause remember he lived in Chicago I mean decades.  He was well established there, he was a ward captain in Chicago knew a lot of the politicians, the black politicians, had a big circle of everything.  And it was kind of by those standards, you know a well-respected man in Chicago, you know in the neighborhoods that he lived in.  And the church you know I mean that was--he was a deacon and all of these things.  So I was told many, many years later when I went back to Chicago by the tenants that we had.  That the day that your father left, of course you know men never showed anything then, they didn't show their feelings.  I mean that wasn't--. Said that he set up here, came up here, he cried for three hours (laughter) said that he--the man didn't wanna leave.  What I didn't know until later, his world (laughter) had collapsed, but my mother was so insistent that she wanted to come to California.  So that was a vivid memory I always had, that you had two very unhappy men, a boy and a man (laughter) and a very happy woman.
Story_ID: 485884
Speaker 1: This in 1961, Dorsey High School [Susan Miller Dorsey High School, Los Angeles, California], now what was the racial mix at Dorsey?
Speaker 2: Dorsey at that time was I would say probably about 60 percent white, 15, 20 percent Japanese, big Japanese contingent at Dorsey, and then rest were black, African American.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Dorsey was beginning to transition then.
Speaker 1: Okay now what neighborhood did you live in, in in Los Angeles [California] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Leimert Park.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Leimert Park.
Speaker 1: Leimert Park, okay, yeah Leimert Park is like--
Speaker 2: We had an apartment that we you know we relocated out here from Chicago [Illinois] we lived in an apartment for probably the first six, seven months.  Because my father [Earl Hutchinson] was always a property owner, you know he was, he never lived in apartments, so he knew right away that he was gonna do one thing the first chance he got, buy a house, which he did.  Which we lived in for ten years, well, they lived in for ten years until I moved out--
Speaker 1: And that was in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) later on.
Speaker 1: --Leimert Park?
Speaker 2: In Leimert Park.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right is, there, Leimert Park I, from what I know of L.A. [Los Angeles, California], has, has historical kind of--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: People talk about it (unclear)--
Speaker 2: It's the place.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: It is the, and a lot of history there a lot of rich history (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What's the, what is the historical personality of Leimert Park, and why is it special here?
Speaker 2: Well, Leimert Park, two things that make it distinctive, one the layout, design of Leimert Park, it looks like a village.  The, the commercial part of it, it was designed by the way by Frederick Olmsted [Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.], the guy that laid out Central Park in New York [New York].  So when you go and look at Leimert Park, it looks like a mini Central Park, number one.  The second thing is it's probably now the last, in this place enclave for black folk, 'cause you know Los Angeles is a Latino city.  Probably the last area, this area, Windsor Hills [View Park-Windsor Hills, Los Angeles, California], Leimert Park, View Park [View Park-Windsor Hills, Los Angeles, California], Baldwin Hills [Los Angeles, California], historically, the black upper cla- black middle and upper class.  Historically black professionals, black business persons, black entertainers, I mean just a who's who of anybody down through the years.  Anybody who is anybody lived in that area around Leimert Park, and so it's had that tradition.  So really a historic, social, cultural tradition.
Story_ID: 485885
Speaker 1: Now one thing I wanna go back to too is your father's [Earl Hutchinson] involvement in politics, you said he was a--
Speaker 2: He was a ward captain.
Speaker 1: --ward captain, was a Democrat?
Speaker 2: Yeah oh, well it was, there was, there was nothing else (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well one time there were Republicans (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah well--
Speaker 1: --you know in--
Speaker 2: --yeah well yeah you're right--
Speaker 1: I know and--
Speaker 2: --actually--
Speaker 1: --I know that he was a critic of Dawson [William L. Dawson] so I don't know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, absolutely right.  Going way back Oscar De Priest [Oscar Stanton De Priest], but of course you know we're talking now post-FDR [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt], 1936, when the wholesale shift, at that point, yeah.  But we're, but the ward system came in much later--well it was there but it really involved as you know just with Dawson and Daley [Richard J. Daley] and the whole Daley machine.  So it's part of that when Daley came in it really I mean built it into a monster that's when--.  And it was, there was no Republicans in, there was not, you couldn't find a Republican on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois].  That was an alien force, I didn't even know there was a Republican Party until many years later, it's Democratic Party.  So they, they were the bosses, they ran the show, nothing got done as you well know, nothing got done unless--in that era unless you came through the ward captains.  I mean it was the boss system.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, if you wanted, you blew your nose, you had to get permission (laughter) if any, I mean anything in the neighborhood, I mean it had to go through them and get approval.
Speaker 1: And certainly you couldn't get your garbage picked up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: You couldn't get any--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --any services--
Speaker 2: You had to pay for it too.
Speaker 1: Special ser- yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: You had to pay for it. You know, they demanded loyal- iron-clad loyalty, you had to vote the right way and pay your dues.
Speaker 1: Now did, did he stay involved in politics like, like that when he moved to--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --Los Angeles [California]?  Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, that was another reason why he was, oh yeah, I mean he got, think about it he was a big guy, I mean (laughter), was a big man you know I mean a man of respect.  And coming out here, now he's a nobody. Well, who knows him? It's, it's a total different system out here.  What he did was, he got involved, he went in another direction, so okay I'm not gonna be a politician, and he had retired at that point.  So he got into real estate, and so he be- he was one of the, actually we talk a lot about that in you know his book ['A Colored Man's Journey Through 20th Century Segregated America,' Earl Hutchinson with Earl Ofari Hutchinson].  Played a big role in breaking down some of the housing barriers, discrimination 'cause L.A. [Los Angeles, California], same as anywhere else.  And with the national association of black real estate--out here it was CAREB [California Association of Real Estate Brokers], NAREB [National Association of Real Estate Brokers] is a national association. So he was--he got in on the ground floor and was really a mover and shaker in breaking down some of the ordinances.  And of course later on the Rumsfeld Fair Housing Act [sic. California Fair Housing Act of 1963], which of course outlawed housing discrimination in California in 1964.  But it was, it was the, the move, the push came from the black real estate, or the black realtists.  They couldn't, they didn't call themselves black realtors, they were black, the realtists, were the blacks.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So the big push to change the housing laws and to get fair housing legislation in the State of California came from them.  And he was an intimate part of that, so that's how he kind of found his calling here.
Story_ID: 485886
Speaker 1: Now what about you?  Now were you involved in high school clubs and activities and--when you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sports.
Speaker 1: Sports, okay.
Speaker 2: I have to tell you, Chicago [Illinois] you know I told you about the, the initial shock, but I have to tell you, I'll tell you when that ended.  Because unbeknownst to most people, I didn't look then like I look now.  Then I was much bigger.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know I was 6'3", 235, 40 [240] pounds, so--coming into the tenth grade at Dorsey High School [Susan Miller Dorsey High School, Los Angeles, California].  I remember the first week I was there when my mother [Nina Brown Hutchinson] brought me up you know to register and the football coach, the JV football coach stopped me, stopped my mother.  And he said, "I wanna talk with you." (Laughter) And so after that, that introduced me to a whole 'nother world the sports jock thing.  So I played football for three years and actually got scholarships and also track.  Back then what you had to do was football and what the coaches used to do is track as a conditioner.  So the running backs essentially you know they ran the sprints or the high jump or the long jump.  And the lineman basically, we didn't have a discus then that was before that, but the shot put.  So actually two years running, I was Southern League shot put champ at Dorsey High School.  And actually had the school record for almost twenty years at Dorsey, but that was my--so sports was I mean just sports crazy.
Speaker 1: At--were--the--that--who else was there with you, any other athletes we might know at Dorsey in those days?
Speaker 2: No, not the athletes, I mean you wouldn't, you wouldn't, the only one that ever really won, actually he didn't play for Dorsey.  The only one that ever actually two that went on to play pro ball Ray May played for L.A. High School [Los Angeles High School, Los Angeles, California] then.  And there were a couple others they, many of them in the Southern League then actually had good careers in college.  But it never transitioned into the NFL [National Football League] or the AFL [American Football League], but the unique thing, the interesting thing was not football.  Here's what the coaches used to do the whole dumb jock syndrome.  To keep us, to keep us moving and--'cause back then you had electives, you know before they started just slashing everything with budget cuts.  So one elective I chose, and they put all the football players in, was choir, 'cause you didn't have to do anything (laughter) except just come you know once a week and rehearse.  In my choir class, this was '63 [1963], '63 [1963], '64 [1964]--'62 [1962], '63 [1963], '64 [1964], in the choir class was Billy Preston.  I never will forget when I got there, they used to say you know there's this fella that plays the piano but you gotta see him.  I kept hearing about this guy, that you have to see him to believe him.  And the first day in choir class, because he would in kind of do a little accompaniments--accompany, accompanist us through some of the drills.  And I mean everybody would just watch this guy and it was just phenomenal and then of course it was Billy Preston.  And even then he was touring with Ray Charles; in the class we had Forest Hamilton [Forest Hamilton, Jr.], Chico Hamilton's son, of course who became quite a band leader unto himself.  We had two individuals that then we didn't pay much attention to, [HistoryMaker] Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis [HistoryMaker Billy Davis, Jr.]; they were also in the choir class.  We also had, he passed away a couple of years ago, remember the group Love, Arthur Lee?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Arthur Lee was in the choir class, we had a guy by the name of Ron Kirkland [ph.] who went on to make several big hits; he was in the choir class.  Do you know who cleaned up the class, the janitor, Ron-Ron [Ronald Townson], 5th Dimension [The 5th Dimension], that's how that's how 5th Dimension got started.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Ron, we used to call him the singing janitor, what was Ron's last name?
Speaker 1: I can't think of it, but I (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know who I'm talking about--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because he was the move, the older fella with the beard and goatee, actually Ron formed The 5th Dimension out of Dorsey High School.  And Marilyn McCoo and Bill Davis as you know were part of the original 5th Dimension, and that--they came out of the choir class.  What's Ron's last name, it will come to me.  But in the locker room we'd hear this guy singing, and we used to call him the singing janitor 'cause you know he would, and we just and he'd entertain us (laughter).  And then of course the rest is history.  We had s- some powerhouse folk at Dorsey High School then, went on to do a lot of different things, especially in the entertainment world.  And there were some others too, some of the names are escaping me now, but I'm told actually did other things later.  But it was some--when I bring my old yearbook out, I show people now, they say, "What--?" (Laughter) I say, "Yeah."
Story_ID: 485887
Speaker 1: Were you still like focused on history and geography then or--?
Speaker 2: No, there was only one thing I was focused on, sports.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Academics that went by the wayside, because you know when you're a football player, especially then, you were like kings of the, you were on a pedestal.
Speaker 1: Now could, could you write in those days?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Had you developed any facility for writing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Writing? Didn't do anything about that (laughter). There was only one thing we cared about, fun and games.
Speaker 1: Now what position did you play on, on--?
Speaker 2: Defensive end and offensive tackle.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So how, how did your team do?
Speaker 2: Well we won Southern League championship one, the fir- the second year in my junior ye- actually I was on the JV team the first year [at Susan Miller Dorsey High School, Los Angeles, California].  And then the last two years I played on the varsity, we won the Southern League championship in my junior year.  And then we lost out, we went on the playoffs, we lost the first playoff game, we never got to the playoffs in my senior year, the team fell apart 'cause we had some coaching changes.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But it--and then, you know, things well anyway it fell apart.
Speaker 1: So that gave you a, a niche then to fit--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --you kind of fit in as an athlete?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah we were--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --we were kings of the manor then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we proceeded to act like that.
Story_ID: 485888
Speaker 1: So did you get scholarship offers from--?
Speaker 2: To Oregon [University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon] and Oregon State [Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Didn't have the grades, because didn't do anything in school, basically all you had to do was just the bare minimum.  I mean that's was required there was no push, I never saw a counselor until literally the last week, the last week of graduation.  And by then it was too late, the grades were not there, I had to go to city- Los Angeles City College [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know junior, back then it was a junior college.
Speaker 1: Okay so this is like, you graduated in what sixty--
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 1: Sixty-four [1964] and went to L.A. junior college, now, now '64 [1964] was like a pivotal year in--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --American politics and race relations and--
Speaker 2: That was the first inkling and the first eye-opening to politics in America, Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] and Goldwater [Barry Goldwater].  At ci- on the City College campus, the first remembrances I have, well the early remembrances of really political engagement, I would see the tables.  'Cause we, this was the fall, and remember the election thing was heating up then, September, October, November.  So I would see all the little campus groups, the Young Republicans and this, the Young Democrats and blah, blah, blah.  So I would see the tables, so I, I went I was interested, well, what's this all about?  So that's, that was my first engagement in politics.
Story_ID: 485889
Speaker 1: So you went to Los Angeles Community College [sic. Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles, California], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Then it was called junior college you said?
Speaker 2: Back then JC [sic.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right, you played football and, so--
Speaker 2: And track.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so what were you thinking in terms of career then had you had any thoughts about--
Speaker 2: There was no thought of a career at that point, see I'm seventeen, actually I graduated at seventeen [from Susan Miller Dorsey High School, Los Angeles, California], football was the only thing--football and track and sports was the only thing I knew in socializing, so I was probably the most ill-prepared student, or one of the most ill-prepared students to go into a junior college, any college setting.  So there was absolutely no thought about, hm, what is my future gonna be?  We had the classic case of an individual was empty headed without absolutely nothing but blinders on about his future.  So first year I was there at City College, I was still a very mediocre student, taking the required courses and not much more.  The, I was interested though, the--be--getting, getting a little bit of inkling, a little bit of (makes sound) kind of an awakening so to speak about politics and social issues because of the election.  And the election itself, I would spend a lot of time at the Young Democrats to ask a lot of questions.  Trying to find out what this, what does this Barry Goldwater and this Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], what is this all about?  Because you know the Civil Rights Movement, Civil Rights Act [Civil Rights Act of 1964], I mean things are happening we're becoming aware of things; I'm becoming aware of things.  By second semester I was put on academic probation at City College, and the way it works if you're on academic probation for two semesters in a row, you're out.  Now I might've had the dubious distinction of being one of the few people to actually be bounced, I mean I got, that takes some doing now to be bounced from a junior college.  But the academics were not there, the interest was not there, very little was there.  Until I--it was a mandatory counseling session that I had to go to if you're on academic probation, so at the counseling session, never will forget this.  The counselor and back on the question about where you're, where you're going with your life, your career and so forth?  I said, "You know, I'm really interested in going to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California]." And the counselor said, "Well with these grades, you're lucky that you're here."  So, we talk a lot about epiphanies, turnaround, something that can happen, sometimes little things that can make, that can change your life.  So by him saying that, that was a challenge.  One thing I did understand from playing football in that I understood a challenge, and so it was like an implicit challenge.  In other words what he was saying you're so dumb and stupid, you're not gonna do anything with your life.  It's gonna be, you're gonna be a miserable failure.  So I said okay, I mean internally, I've got to get this together, I've gotta clean my act up, I'm not gonna be playing pro football, I know that.  Obviously back then it was no such thing as pro track, so what am I gonna do?  So at that point in time I had to seriously do an internal soul search, where are we going, where am I going, I would like--. Plus, you know I'm living at home, my mother [Nina Brown Hutchinson] who--and father [Earl Hutchinson] who were very, they're concerned you know like what's going on, what are you doing this?  So internal pressures, external pressures made me think even then I still didn't have a clear picture of what I wanted to do.  Now the way it works with junior college, you go to two, you go two years, three, four years, but if you're diligent and apply yourself, you can actually get your associate, associate of arts degree.  So actually it was a wake-up call, I got going, picked up the grades, got serious about school.  I actually got an associate of arts degree from Los Angeles City College, transferred over to Cal State L.A. [California State College at Los Angeles; California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], still didn't have any clear idea at that point what I wanted to do.  But my major was psychology of all things, and I guess I had some dim thought about maybe being a psychologist or social worker or something in that area, but still wasn't clearly formed.  So basically the next two years, and I graduated in four years, well two years there in at junior college, and two years at L.A. S- at Cal State L.A.
Story_ID: 485890
Speaker 1: Now Cal State L.A. [California State College at Los Angeles; California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] is not the same thing as UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --it's different.
Speaker 2: California State University--
Speaker 1: California State--
Speaker 2: --State University--
Speaker 1: University, yeah at Los--
Speaker 2: --at Los Angeles.  So graduated from there after two years and at that point, got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Did you meet your wife in college or--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No I met her, I met her, I was in college, but not in, I did not meet her in college.  So I got married at that point and my daughter was born, and then I got a job as a social worker.  So I worked as a social worker in Watts [Los Angeles, California] for one year and that was, that was quite an experience then.  This is right after, couple of years after the Watts riots.
Speaker 1: Now were there, let me go back a little bit and ask you this.  Now in '64 [1964] when you're in community college [Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles, California] did, were you aware of all--the row at the Democratic National Convention [1964 Democratic National Convention, Atlantic City, New Jersey] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: When the Mississippi Freedom--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --Democratic Party [Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]--
Speaker 2: Yes I was.
Speaker 1: --showed up, okay.
Speaker 2: I became well aware of it, and followed it very closely because it interested me.  And that, that again was a spur; that was a stimulus to think more about politics and social issues.  (Background noise) Now, the bigger thing that actually really blew, blew it off the charts although no pun intended was the Watts riots.  I lived in, we lived in a curfew zone, Leimert Park [Los Angeles, California] where we lived then was called the Watts curfew zone.  So that was the next thing, part of my awakening to America, you know watching you know the fires and the burning and the looting.  And I have to say this, many of my friends were involved with it, up to and including the statute of limitations has run out on that.  I'm nineteen years old, so I have a vivid memory of that at the height of the Watts riots one (laughter) one of my friends who was actively, actually played football.  So we were very close and he said come and go with me, I said where we going, he said I gotta go pickup something.  So we got in his little Opel.
Speaker 1: Keep going, keep going, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: We got in his Opel; we drove over to one of the liquor stores that had been burned down.  And so (laughter) in his car, I never will forget this actually not a liquor store; it was over to the Shrine Auditorium [Los Angeles, California].  Because the area for seven days you couldn't move, seven or eight days, 'cause the National Guard, the 82nd Airborne [82nd Airborne Division], I mean it was militarized city, it was locked down.  When they took back the city, and took back Watts and South L.A. [South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], so he had participated in some of the looting.  And I, I saw some of the liquor stores go up and he participated in that and stuffed his car with all kind of cigarettes and stuff and liquor and, but he couldn't move the car.  'Cause if you moved two inches out of a certain area, you know you gonna be stopped and of course who knows?  So the car sat in the parking lot for six days (laughter) so he asked me to come back but it got worse.  So we took the stuff back, he knew I had a little, we had well we had two garages.  He said, "I need a place for this." And I said, "Oh," (laughter) can't, "You mind if I leave it here?"  So we spent a night taking all this stuff out of his car you know all the looted stuff, put it in the garage.  And I'm thinking to myself that's all I need, that's all I need is for the old man [Hutchinson's father, Earl Hutchinson] come out and see this (laughter) and I'm dead in the water.  But you're nineteen years old you, you know I mean you don't think about things at that age, although I did even think about it then.  I said you know what after, cut, get this, get it out of here, get it out, get it out (laughter) go it's gotta go.  He took it down to the corner and it was one of the busy intersections, and I watched this guy for, for two days.  It was a fire sale right on the corner (laughter) you know saying buy, people are stopping, buying--I'm watching this, fascinated by it.  But also, I'm becoming aware, you know, of what's going on now you know race and how it's playing out and I mean this.
Story_ID: 485891
Speaker 1: I remember vividly, well actually even before the Watts riots, another incident that happened.  And actually part of my awakening, my father [Earl Hutchinson] was very civil rights oriented in the sense, not really a participant, but he had that consciousness about him.  So [HistoryMaker] the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth as you know one of the right-hand men of King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], he came (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) One of the great heroes yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --spoke at Trinity Baptist Church [Los Angeles, California] so we went to hear him. That very moment, that day as he was speaking somebody whispered to him on the podium and said, and he stopped.  And he said I just got word Malcolm X has been killed, right in the middle, I remember the whisper and then he stopped.  And of course you know the murder of Mal- the assassination of Malcolm X--
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-five [1965].
Speaker 1: (Unclear) was February 21, 19- so there was a hush there on that.  So at that point actually, I hadn't read 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X' [Malcom X and Alex Haley] because it hadn't been written, well I guess it had been, but it hadn't been published yet.  So the next year of course I read it and now the Black Power movement and of course now the consciousness is rising.  When we came back to City College [Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles, California] after the Watts thing that year, I never will forget, I mean the campus was abuzz, I mean everybody was fired up.  That's all people talked about everybody had a story about what happened, what they did, where they were, you know most of it was of course embellishment and lies.  But nonetheless as the story gets bigger and bigger, you know and I, it was just, it was just an exciting period, a very exciting period for someone nineteen, twenty, twenty-one years-old.  I mean it's, it's an awakening in America, you've seen a different America.  And you're seeing your role in it so, those were some of my, the experiences I can remember, I mean there were many others in college.  But in terms of the political and social consciousness awakening, then there was some talk, it wasn't a Black Student Union, but some of the black students were getting together then.  Said we have to have, I think it was a black culture club at that point.
Story_ID: 485892
Speaker 1: Then one of the first speakers that came to campus after we came back that fall was [HistoryMaker] Maulana Karenga.  And Karenga was just getting the US Organization [The Organization Us] off the ground, and so he came out.  The first time I saw a guy in African attire, it was like (laughter) what is this, you know he has his dashiki on, I mean it just (makes sound) it was like, wow.
Speaker 2: So this 1965 or sixty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is late '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: Sixty-five [1965] okay.
Speaker 1: I think it was No- December of '65 [1965] when he came to the campus and of course you know hard line, black nationalism, hard line, I mean firing everybody up.  So then I left City College [Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles, California], left City College in January '66 [1966] and then went to Cal State L.A. [California State College at Los Angeles; California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  And of course then that's when we formed the Black Student Union in the fall of 1966.  At that point in time, then the next big thing was of course the black studies department, or getting one going.  So there was a lot of activity, twice Muhammad Ali you know after he was defrocked by the, the draft board, he made his statement.  He came to Cal State, L.A., that was in the fall and he was doing his tour you know Vietnam a protest and the anti-Vietnam War and--.  In fact I still have my draft card when Ali came to campus, and I had him sign it, and he--that was a big thing, everybody was waving their draft cards and having Ali sign it; that was a status symbol.  Which is our way of saying, hell no, we're not going. But it was an exciting time to be on campus.  A lot of things that were happening and a lot of things politically, a lot of things socially and it was, and it was good to be a part of that.  I mean that is a part of history that has been just not only indelible in the American experience, but certainly deeply affected me and imprinted me, all of our generation it did.
Speaker 2: I know I, the first time I, well the first book of yours I bought was the book on Garnet ['Let Your Motto Be Resistance: The Life and Thought of Henry Highland Garnet,' Earl Ofari Hutchinson] I bought it at a black bookstore in Dayton [Ohio].  I know out here you had Aquarian--
Speaker 1: Book Shop [Aquarian Book Shop, Los Angeles, California] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) book center and I was, was that like a hangout for people that wanted to?
Speaker 1: The Aquarian Book Shop, Alfred [Alfred Ligon] and Bernice Ligon [Bernice Goodwin Ligon].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That was part of my awakening, I lived there, I mean I lived in that bookstore, that every day, I mean I could not get enough, 'cause that was it.  I mean we had, that was it then, this is long before the Borders [Borders Group, Inc.] and the Barnes and Nobles [Barnes and Noble Booksellers, Inc.] and certainly no other black bookstores, they were the pioneers.  And the Aquarian it was Aquarian Spiritual Center [Los Angeles, California] and bookstore. Spiritual center 'cause he was in, he was the Gnostic, Black Gnosticism.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He kind of, kind of mysterious, Mr. Ligon was had a very mysterious--
Speaker 2: Now he's talking about Atlantis and a lot of different things, he--yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was never into that, but I mean they were deeply you know involved with that with the lectures.  And he was one of the recognized experts, so they had the study courses and the lectures.  Dr. Karenga came and actually had the African American Cultural Association [sic. African American Cultural Center, Los Angeles, California], even that was the, the forerunner of US Organization.  So he would have his Sunday meetings there, and I would si- I would come to the meetings.  'Cause I always enjoyed hearing Dr. Karenga; I don't even think he was Dr. Karenga then.  I think he was still working on his master's degree at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  I enjoyed his lectures and they were always very eye-opening, there were guest speakers who would come in, it would you know different things about black history and so forth.  So, that was my second home, the Aquarian spiritual and cultural center.
Story_ID: 485893
Speaker 1: You were talking about the move for black studies at--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Cal State LA [California State College at Los Angeles; California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California]. Yeah, how, how did that turnout, I mean did you get black studies?
Speaker 2: Yeah we organized the BSU [Black Student Union] and then huge fight I mean it wasn't easy, a big fight with the administration.  I mean obviously it wasn't easy.  Many demands, demonstrations, went back and forth between the BSU, certain sympathetic faculty and the administration. But it was gonna happen because that was the trend at that time; I mean, schools were setting up black studies departments all over the place.  One of the things that I've always been mindful of, the pioneers that fight the fight don't always get the spoils.  It was funny, we were the ones that led the charge and never got one position, didn't get much thanks either.  And it was funny, and I learned another lesson about life, you can be on the frontline in some of these struggles, but it's those that come behind that actually get the benefits.  So we had those, the academics that were never involved in that struggle, the frontlines, they got the jobs, they got the position.  Didn't lift a finger to do anything, so I learned another lesson (laughter) about life, about who gets what and how.  Because they understood, they had a, their record was clean, they knew how to play the game, they said what had to be done and did what had to be done with the administration.  And they were acceptable, we weren't, but that's okay.
Speaker 1: So did you get the kind of department you had envisioned I mean?
Speaker 2: We got a department, it was a pan-African studies department [Department of Pan-African Studies], in fact yeah from the jump it was a pan-African studies department.  We were always disappointed that it wasn't a, well it was an inter- it was an interdisciplinary department, as most of them were.  It wasn't a full you know accredited standalone department.  So we knew at that point in time, by the way it wasn't Cal State University, before that it was Cal State College, Los Angeles; it became university later on.  It was in interdisciplinary program and we always felt that the professors with a couple of exceptions were basically very conservative sensuous professors.  I mean not in the militant spirit that we thought should've been there, they were academics, pure academics.  They were acceptable to the administration, they would go on to get their creden- tenureship and so they, that was it.  It wasn't in the cards for us to do that but that's history always shows things worked that way sometimes.
Story_ID: 485894
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduation then what were your plans (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From Cal State LA [California State College at Los Angeles; California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Well at that point, the degree was in psychology and I had a, a minor in sociology.
Speaker 1: Oh so, yeah, that's when you became a social worker--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in, in Watts [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Well I needed a job.
Speaker 1: Okay now how did the movement inform your activity as a social worker?
Speaker 2: Well, not as a social worker, but just outside of that, again the lecture series, the reading, conversations, going to just about every meeting I could think of.  Then remember the Black Panther Party you know they were just getting off the ground then, actually there was a Black Panther Party here in Los Angeles [California].  [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis at that point, she would come over to some of the, the meetings that they at, the Aquarian Cultural Center [sic. Aquarian Spiritual Center, Los Angeles, California].  She was just starting out then at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], the, matter of fact that's where I met her at the Aquarian spiritual and cultural center at some of the Sunday lectures.  Student Nonvi- Student--SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], she was involved with SNCC 'cause they had a chapter in Los Angeles then.  And they had an office where they would have SNCC meetings every Thursday night.  And occasionally I would go.  Then (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So this is when--when you were a social worker in Watts is what, what year is it now, this is?
Speaker 2: This was sixty--late '66 [1966], si- end of '67 [1967], through '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay, I'm sorry go, go ahead, I, I just had to get that date.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, no I'm sorry actually, got it wrong it wasn't correct.  It was late '67 [1967], end of '68 [1968]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --through '68 [1968] because at that point in time I was going to SNCC meetings, the Black Panther Party, I mean they were going strong, this was, you know after Huey [Huey P. Newton] came down and they organized a chapter here.  There actually was a black--many people don't know it, there was actually an original Black Panther Party.  Remember Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] in the South, the Lowndes County Freedom Organization, remember their emblem was the black panther, and they had a Black Panther Party and so actually some of the members that were affiliated with it formed the Black Panther Party, Los Angeles, separate and apart from the Newton, Eldridge Cleaver, that bunch up there.  And of course when they came in, they said get out of here, we're the Black Panther Party, they made them disband, I never will forget that.  But, so--
Speaker 1: Now did Stokely play a role in that--
Speaker 2: No Stokely (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the, the disband?
Speaker 2: No because SNCC had, you know they had gone; they were defunct at that point.  And you know Stokely had moved c- I mean really speedily to the left you know much more radical.  And when he did his world tour and came back and essentially remember they had that fusion between SNCC and the Black Panther Party?  Which was actually in Los Angeles at, they had a huge rally at Sports Arena [Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, Los Angeles, California] in February '68 [1968].  Lot of this is fresh in my mind because Howard Bingham, Ali's [Muhammad Ali] photographer, Bingham's doing a book on the Black Panther Party ['Howard L. Bingham's Black Panthers 1968'].  And we been talking and Bingham's been reminding me of a lot of things I'd forgotten because he has like thousands of pictures from that era of the Panthers because that's what he does, and then the narrative.  But anyway it was the, it was my involvement basically in the organizations that were here in the city, the black--I mean I didn't join, I wasn't a member.  But I guess you might say I was a fellow traveler, in the sense that I, I had a great interest in it and the influence by it.
Story_ID: 485895
Speaker 1: But I got to tell you something, let me go back to something I said way in the beginning when you asked that question about characteristics from--or who influences you, your father, your mother or where did you go?  Remember one of the things I said about my father [Earl Hutchinson], he was very cautious, do you remember when I said that?  Well something internally, a little bell and whistle always was there, danger (laughter), be careful.  It's nice to have a philosophy and it's nice to be influenced, and it's nice to have a heart, but sometimes it can be a little dangerous.  So my wife [Barbara Bramwell Hutchinson] always says, "That Hutchinson thing, boy I have to tell you, you guys are so cautious" (laughter). Put the fear of God in you about not making any too, too many steps out the box.  You know always playing it close to the vest.  But any case, so I saw all of the events unfold in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], you know the shootouts, all the stuff that went on at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] and over here on Central Avenue.  I saw all of that, I witnessed it.
Speaker 2: Okay so the, the shootout, you, now this is a disputed--
Speaker 1: Between US [The Organization Us] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) it's been written about--yeah, US Organization--
Speaker 1: --and the Panthers [Black Panther Party].
Speaker 2: Yeah Bunchy Carter I think was killed.
Speaker 1: The week before that happened at UCLA, I was a panel with John Huggins, and even the week before that at one of the black student meetings at Cal State LA [California State College at Los Angeles; California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  The other guy, Bunchy Carter came, had big entourage you know that, they kind of like to do that you know, everything was theater.  You know they got that from the old Nation of Islam you know that, that militaristic thing, the intimidating thing.  So they would come and they would do their thing, and I remember he gave a little talk and he was a poet too, and read a couple of poems.  Had just seen him the week before then I was on a panel with John, oh no, excuse me his wife, Ericka Huggins [Ericka Jenkins Huggins], and John was in the audience.  And then one week later, this thing at UCLA, Bunchy Carter, John Huggins gunned down, and I said, wow.  Now, that was another turning point in my life.  There's a, well I just saw it the, the other day this movie, 'Righteous Kill' with Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.  And there's a scene in there where Pacino, he's a serial cop killer, Pacino is killing people, taking the law, the whole Bronson [Charles Bronson] thing, you know, 'Death Wish.'  So in the end he's making this confession when they catch him, and he said something that reminded me of what I'm gonna say.  He said, "I started doing this because I lost my faith." When he saw his, De Niro, a role cop plant some things on somebody, planted a gun on him you know, New York PD [New York City Police Department], then get rid of this guy.  And so Pacino who had been playing it close to the vest said, "I lost my faith," he'd always played it for thirty years as a straight cop.  And then he saw this crooked cop, then he just went bananas, just start killing.  When that happened at UCLA, I lost my faith, by that I mean this: all my youthful idealism, all of my illusions about the black struggle being so simon-pure and this and that.  And was just gonna remake America and, and the oppression of us and that, I mean things I deeply believed in.  When that happened, that threw me off, blacks killing blacks, radical blacks killing--those that I knew on both sides, how could this happen?  Those that I believed in, went to the meetings, you know listened to them talk about black consciousness, black this, black unity, black this.  Believe in that; I eat it up, believe in all of that. So now at my, you know twenty-two, twenty-three, I'm trying to, I'm having cognitive dissonance.  Wait a minute, this is not the pl- you know you're used to white police gunning down bla- I mean you understand that, that's supposed to be the formula, you know?  But this is different, you got radical blacks, US Organization, the triggermen killing other--how did this happen?  So all of my illusions and delusions about--things all of a sudden, pardon the pun, didn't become so black and white anymore, now we got grey areas.  Now for the first time I saw that blacks can victimize other blacks; wasn't always whites victimizing blacks.  I began to see things aren't always what they seem in this world, so I began realizing and watching a little bit closer.  And, and rethinking some things. Not that you're going to go and become Clarence Thomas (laughter) you know.  But, but it, it just sent up a cautionary note to look and access and analyze a little bit differently, much more broader, than just seeing everything in just narrow, black and white, racial terms.
Story_ID: 485896
Speaker 1: Did you have any sense of the government's role and the, the COINTELPRO [Counterintelligence Program] that we all know happened (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I believe for long periods of time, the party line like everybody else if that Panther Party [Black Panther Party] and others, they were gunned down.  They were beaten, they were jailed, they were all the things that we later found out about COINTELPRO.  That obviously it was a hidden hand of FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], the government, this agency, all these mysterious agencies you know all the conspiracy stuff, always a hidden hand.  Until--and it took time, 'cause I bought into that for a long period.  But people were even then telling me, couple of Panthers I remember that were not well-known, but people I knew, well one guy I'm thinking of named Melvin X, he was a, a radical guy, he was in the Panthers and they found him dead out in the desert.  So everybody just assumed, the party line, the police killed him or the FBI.  But, but they didn't, because what we didn't know then, you had a thug incorporated, a gangster incorporated.  You had all that gangsterism, you know in the Panther Party and US Organization [The Organization Us], street thugs, gang members.  I mean every kind of lowlife and scumbag around had, had infiltrated, for their own reasons, these organizations.  They weren't the police, they weren't agents, they weren't agent provocateurs, they were thugs and gangsters.  And we found out later, many of these murders that we attribute to the FBI, the internal stuff, it was them, it was criminal stuff, thug stuff, the gangster stuff.  So when I began to realize, wait a minute, there is something else happening here that I can never dream and envision with the politically correct philosophy.  And that is this, that actually once again, blacks can be just as thuggish, gangsterish and murderous towards each other.  And oftentimes under the guise of it's them that made us do it. So once again, some other articles of faith were being stripped away (laughter).  I'm losing my faith. Maybe never recovered it, but anyway.
Speaker 1: So you're looking at a more complicated world now (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's much more.
Story_ID: 485897
Speaker 1: How long did you work as a social worker?
Speaker 2: I was there one year. Then after that I, this was late '69 [1969], I started putting out feelers, I wanted to get out of L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  Had been here now almost, well almost ten years, you know all my formative years were here, and I, I wanted to do something, the restless thing.  I wanted to go somewhere else, but I wanted to do things academically because now I'm getting involved in my first writings, scholarship, I'm beginning to look at that.  So at Cal State LA [California State College at Los Angeles; California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] one of the speakers that came out and we sponsored it, the Black Student Union, was James Turner.  Who then was a professor at Cornell University [Ithaca, New York], you know James Turner?
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay. James Turner then had come out, we picked him up at the airport, and by the way can I just give you a few other characters?
Speaker 1: Well sure, yeah, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Another quick walk through history.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I had the privilege of being the escort, I picked up Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] and we picked him up at the airport.  I was supposed to be his bodyguard (laughter) if you can believe that, spent a day with him, and that was an experience.  Ralph Abernathy, picked him up at the airport, because we were having these speakers come in, picked him up.  Of course we had Angela [HistoryMaker Angela Davis] come in you know I got to know her pretty, fairly well, because later on when I worked at the Free Press [Los Angeles Free Press] I interviewed, and I'll tell talk, I wanna talk a little bit about that too, my walk with history.  Let me back up a little but because when I mentioned my father [Earl Hutchinson] and his civil rights (unclear)--.  Well he, that same year that Shuttlesworth [HistoryMaker Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth], King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came to L.A. and they had a, no, the year before, I'm sorry.  Had a ministerial march in--march and something else--confab, non-denominational at the, at the Coliseum [Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Los Angeles, California].  And so actually this was the second time I saw King, we saw him once in, I saw him once at the armory in Chicago [Illinois].  And then--in '59 [1959]--and then in '63 [1963] when he came here for the ministerial conference and march, they had to march into the Coliseum, they had a track then.  And I remember sitting in the stands and thinking to myself, god this guy sure is short (laughter), but (gesture) short.
Story_ID: 485898
Speaker 1: So Jim Turner [James Turner] came, I was so impressed with this guy, I mean he was just a phenomenal speaker and just a breadth of knowledge and--.  So anyway I kind of filed him away, about six months later I just really wanted to get out of L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  So I'm thinking where can I go, where can I go, so actually I was thinking about Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] 'cause I wanted to go back, I wanted to live on the East Coast.  I just had this thing about the East Coast, I mean it just seemed like that's the place to be.  Plus a little L.A. burnout, and then also candidly admitting you know I'm married now, and I'm, I'm maybe trying to evade something (laughter).  Maybe trying to get out of something 'cause my daughter now she's maybe, I think she was six months old.  And I, I have to admit not really prepared to be a father and a husband, I still wanna do some things, I don't wanna be tied down.  So I, oh I know I wrote Jim Turner, so I remembered you know still remembered him, was impressed.  Thinking that if he could--if he knew somebody at Boston University and he can make a recommendation that I could write to perhaps if you know can make an entree in that could move from there and maybe work out something, that I could go there and attend Boston University, I, I done, you know I just, long heard about Boston University, and seemed like a place to be.  Turner wrote back and said, "We're starting--you might wanna think about Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York]. We're going to form, or start, a black studies, an African- an Africana studies department at Cornell University, first year."  And I said, Corn- what is Cornell? (Laughter) What is Cornell? I mean I you know it's a name but I knew nothing about it.  So one thing led to another, make a long story short, I decided to--the first group that came in of black students, I was among them.  I think it was eighteen or twenty, the first group that set-up the Afri- the first class in the Africana studies department [Africana Studies and Research Center].  So I went to Cornell for a year, and it was a great experience.
Speaker 2: This is 1969?
Speaker 1: This was '70 [1970].
Speaker 2: Okay '70 [1970], okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Seventy [1970], went there stayed for the '70 [1970] academic year and then unfortunately, and I often think about this, what would my life have been if I had gone on--because it was a, it was a master's/Ph.D. program.  Got my doctorate, would I've ever come back to L.A., would I be a, a New York (unclear) professor, academic, possibly.  However, life intervened in the form of a wife and a child, so I had, I came back and got a little, got I don't know.  And you know when you're ground in a certain place, I don't wanna say homesick, but you know the roots are here.  So I came back in the sp- in the spring of '71 [1971], back to L.A., and at that point in time, I think I mentioned before my father [Earl Hutchinson] was in real estate.  So we had bought a house and we moved to Inglewood [California] at that point.
Story_ID: 485899
Speaker 1: Now I didn't have a job, and I wasn't sure, with really with no master's degree, 'cause I didn't finish that at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York].  And I had the bachelor's degree which quite frankly in psychology is worthless, I mean unless you go on and get a master's and Ph.D. and get your professional certificate and training and become a psychologist, it's worthless.  Can't even analyze you know your way out of a paper bag.  So what I decided to do was and, it's really funny how things happen.  So during the summer and into the fall, I was, didn't have a job, so one day I pick up the paper and reading the paper and I see this, in the back just, oh no, I know what it was.  Picked up the paper, they were having some--they were having a management labor dispute at the L.A. Free Press [Los Angeles Free Press].  What happened was and I really wasn't that familiar, well actually I was familiar with the Free Press 'cause before I left they had a couple of pieces that I had written for them.  And then that they had actually fired the editor, had fired the assistant editor and two staff members quit in protest.  So I thought to myself, (unclear) Free Press. So I drove out to the Free Press and just, you know, on, on a whim, they hired me on the spot.  The ancient thing, right place, right time, because they had just had these firings and they needed (laughter) they needed a writer.  So I was there at the right time and followed up on it.  So for two years I stayed at the Free Press and I have to tell you that was another phase two of (laughter) my eye-opening experience.  In the course of those two years, I interviewed, let's see, in rapid succession, Dr. Benjamin Spock--because I was their chief interviewer--interviewed Dr. Spock.  Interviewed Cesar Chavez, interviewed [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond had just you know big to do about, well let's see this was after that.
Speaker 2: Running for the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, running for that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) legislature.
Speaker 1: You know he's big controversial figure.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Julian Bond came through, again, Ralph David Abernathy [Ralph Abernathy], interviewed him at the airport, Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton], interviewed him twice.  Interviewed Eldridge Cleaver, [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory, Bobby Seale, of course Karenga [HistoryMaker Maulana Karenga], what's the other one, the, was it, oh, Shirley Chisholm, interviewed her.  So I mean it was just like I mean, god, this history that's coming through here (laughter) I mean it was so exciting.  Just about everything that would happen, I would go cover on you know during, during the week and on the weekend.  Any of the movement activities, rallies, events, marches, demonstrations.  When they had the big blowout at Century City [Los Angeles, California] with the LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department], I became aware of the LAPD again.  That--so I always felt that I was really kind of an eyewitness to history.  And I've got a lot of the, the interviews we saved all of them, I have a storage place where I've kept all the archives and stuff in tons of boxes, the interviews.  One of these days I wanna have the grandkids go through them and archive them for me.
Story_ID: 485900
Speaker 1: I had one other experience, I began to do some, branch out into radio at that point at KPFK [KPFK Radio, North Hollywood, California] in the Pacifica Network [Pacifica Radio Network].  So I was doing some weekend programming for them, and I was doing a jazz show, a jazz and a sports show, but especially the jazz show.  And a lot of the top in rapid succession we had, in a three-month period, I had Barry White, I had [HistoryMaker] Isaac Hayes, I had [HistoryMaker] Herbie Hancock, almost got Miles [Miles Davis].  Being the flake that he is and you know about Miles, he, we had him slated for an interview, and of course he cancelled at the last minute.  And then one fella that came through one day, I never heard of him before, (laughter) and he came in and he was on tour the first time.  He got in the studio and you know I would usually back and forth you know kind of very light, just kind of you know I always kept it conversational.  This is one of the rare, one of the few times when I did interviews, I never got, I got one question in.  And so for the next thirty minutes, I'm sitting here listening to this guy go on and on and on, I got one question in in thirty minutes.  And I'm fascinated I, who is this, what is this lunatic, what is this guy--I'm looking at my watch.  Get this guy out of here. I'll give you a hint, he's going on talking about Rastafarians and, and you know Haile Selassie, what is he talking about?  I thought this guy was coming in to talk about his new CD, not CD, they didn't have CDs back then, his album.  You know who it was?
Speaker 2: It was Bob Marley.
Speaker 1: It's Bob Marley (laughter) and--first time I'd ever seen you know dreadlocks, I'm, I'm looking what, what is this?  He didn't talk one second about music, I mean it was all Haile Selassie, Rastafar- rasta this, rasta that, rasta.  I said wow, and I have to tell you, ever since then, of course you know now Bob Marley when they have the Bob Marley day and this.  After that when I, and years afterwards, when it got out, it was like he touched the Holy Grail; "you were actually in the same room with Bob Marley?"  When they do the huge thing here on Bob Marley day, I mean thousands come out; I get a call from several radio stations.  "Ah, can you tell us about Bob Marley, what was he like?" I mean you actually touched Jesus, (laughter) you touched him, you walked with him, and it's so funny.  Because I'm thinking to myself at the time, who is this clown, who is this nut, get rid of him, never know.
Speaker 2: So that so how, how long did you show last on Pacifica Radio?
Speaker 1: Actually I was in and out with Pacifica for over twenty-five years, begin in the early '70s [1970s] I had that show then I left the Free Press [Los Angeles Free Press] and actually went to work KPFK as their news and public affairs producer.  Stayed there for ten years from 1972, late '72 [1972] to 1980, and so then I left there and actually that started, at that point, my other life.
Story_ID: 485901
Speaker 1: I have a whole 'nother, there's another world that I inhabited for a quarter of a century that few people know about.
Speaker 2: Now what is that world?
Speaker 1: Well, I thought--we have to get the progression (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay all right, all right.
Speaker 1: If we've gotten there yet I don't want to get ahead of the story (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We haven't gotten there yet all right, okay.  All right let's--all right so you started your radio show [at KPFK Radio, North Hollywood, California], and you're, you're writing for LA Free Press [Los Angeles Free Press]?
Speaker 1: And other publications.
Speaker 2: Okay and--
Speaker 1: The Guardian, the L.A. Free Press and at that point in time actually most of the counter, back then the counterculture all of the alternative press.
Speaker 2: Now we're in the early '70s [1970s] now, now--
Speaker 1: Seventies [1970s] moving on.
Speaker 2: Yeah so at--in '71 [1971] well you published 'The Myth of Black Capitalism' [Earl Ofari Hutchinson]?
Speaker 1: 'The Myth of Black Capitalism.'
Speaker 2: Now how did that project come into being?
Speaker 1: Remember at that point Richard Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] had given his big thing about black capitalism, that's gonna be the, black capitalism was supposed to be the counter to the black power.  In other words not black power, black economic power, you know, blah, blah, blah.  So I got interested in it, him and started doing some research and reading about black economic development, black business, so one thing led to another, started my research; I thought it was a good research project.  And the book evolved from there.  Monthly Review Press, which was a left-wing press at that time, I think it, I'm, not sure I guess it's, not sure if they're still going or not.
Speaker 2: Yeah I think they're not.
Speaker 1: They're not, I didn't think so.  Anyway Monthly Review, I approach them wrote them a letter, back then you didn't need an agent.  Wrote them a letter and of course it was once again timing is everything, it's the right time, they were looking to--black books as, black books you know were just coming in.  I mean the hot to trot thing then and so my timing was right, so they published the book.  I thought it was an extremely, again this with, with the hindsight of a scholastic, much more involved mature and developed then, an extremely immature book, looking back on it.  And I look at it now in the light of the other big stuff since then and think, god, did I write this (laughter) did I do this, I can't believe it.  But so that, and then at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], when I was at Cornell, Dr. John Henrik Clar- Clarke [John Henrik Clarke] was one of my professors.  I lived with him by the way when I would go to Harlem [New York, New York], you know I would stay with Dr. Clarke and I actually lived at his house for two weeks.  Period, long periods of time when I would stay in Harlem, you know I would always stay with Clarke.  And he was very gracious, and I learned a lot from him, is a great influence on my life.  He was the one that encouraged me as part of my graduate project to pick a historical figure, one that was little known or had fallen off the historic chart.  So I was fascinated with Henry Highland Garnet, because you know the speech, "Let your motto be resistance" ['An Address To The Slaves Of The United States,' Henry Highland Garnet].  But I always thought here was a militant guy you know back then, I mean really militant black guy, so he fascinated me.  So he became my graduate research project and the book ['Let Your Motto Be Resistance: The Life and Thought of Henry Highland Garnet,' Earl Ofari Hutchinson] evolved from there.
Speaker 2: Well both of these books were you know popular items in black bookstores all over the country.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: And you know, people knew who [HistoryMaker] Earl Ofari Hutchinson was as a result or at least knew the name.  Somebody by this name is writing these books (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well that 'The Myth of Black Capitalism' did put me on the map because of the timing, but I took, if you, if you look at the Garnet book and 'The Myth of Black Capitalism,' it's like day and night, it's totally different.  Here I'm with the, with professional scholars, I mean now I'm working with them under their tutelage.  I have one of the top academic libraries in the, in the world, Cornell University, I'm able to get first-hand material.  Understanding the research process, getting primary sources, the interviews, getting primary documents, spent a lot of time.  'Cause Garnet was from as you know, Ith- Up- Utica, New York.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So it was very close, I, several times I took trips to Utica, collected some documents there, Syracuse University [Syracuse, New York], Cornell and--.  I, I was really proud of that book, and quite frankly still am.  I still think it's, as a research project, one of the better ones.
Story_ID: 485902
Speaker 1: Now did you get a, a decent critique you know as it ['Let Your Motto Be Resistance: The Life and Thought of Henry Highland Garnet,' Earl Ofari Hutchinson], it was in development, from James Turner and John Henrik Clarke (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was, they were all there, and others, 'cause we went before a committee. And then what Clarke did, he was what he called quote, unquote a scout for Beacon Press [Boston, Massachusetts].  So he was able to say we got this guy at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], he's a researcher he's you know he's writing, he's putting this together, let's publish the book.  So he was able to basically sell me to the publishing house.
Speaker 1: Yeah that was one of the things that he did best you know scout out and bring people to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was not selfish.
Speaker 1: --publishers, right.
Speaker 2: He was not selfish, you know I, I me, me just always thinking about me as some will do, he really, really was concerned about developing young talent.  I mean young scholars, young black scholars, that was his mission, and he took it seriously.
Speaker 1: Now Beacon Press around that same year, the year yours came out, or I think the year before, they published 'Martin Delany: The Beginnings of Black Nationalism' [Victor Ullman]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and they republish 'Blake' ['Blake or The Huts of America,' Martin R. Delany].
Speaker 2: Yes, because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know they were on a mission to--
Speaker 2: --but that was Clarke.
Speaker 1: Okay, John--
Speaker 2: But that was Clarke, he was the driving force, 'cause I mean that--you know Clarke I mean was the premiere pan-African, elder, legendary (laughter) historian, self-trained by the way.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Clarke did not, Clarke did not officially have a Ph.D., but who cares, he was still Dr. Clarke.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah even the name Africana studies is one of--
Speaker 2: Afri- yeah.
Speaker 1: --his pet names for that--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the study of Africa and African people.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, oh, by the way you know one of the reasons, one of the reasons why, I just thought on that, they got the Africana Studies Center [Africana Studies and Research Center] at Cornell.  Remember that came the year after, they had just freaked the university out when the black students took it over.  So (snaps fingers) that was the concession, we want a black study center here and that, that was kind of their concession from the takeover.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I guess you do lament in some ways or wonder what would happen if you stayed around there and earned a Ph.D. or--?
Speaker 2: I, I've always been curious about that, would I have been a New Yorker and how would that have taken my life in a different direction.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Another many of the what ifs that we all have.
Story_ID: 485903
Speaker 1: So well back in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], you're writing for L.A. Free Press [Los Angeles Free Press] and other publications and, well just pick us up from I guess the early '70s [1970s] (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So actually stayed at the L.A. Free Press for a year and half, then went over to KPFK [KPFK Radio, Los Angeles, California] as I said before, I stayed there for the next six or seven years doing documentaries.  That became, I became the official documentary producer, special programming for KPFK, the lot, a lot of things that we find we--they're still in the archives.  The Pacifica archives [Pacifica Radio Archives, North Hollywood, California], documentaries that I did, a lot of interview- tons of interviews with anybody and everybody, putting together special programming, that's what I did.  So basically my background is as much radio as writing.
Speaker 1: Yeah Pacifica [Pacifica Radio Network] does have quite an archive you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's a phenomenal archives (unclear).
Speaker 1: How does Pacifica work, now it's not National Public Radio [NPR]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It's--if it's--
Speaker 2: But it is public radio.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But it's not part of the National Public Radio or Minnesota Public Radio syndicate.  Pacifica has a long history, a radical history that came out of the, well, some of the early ones.  The, the early pioneers, the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union], the whole free speech, civil liberties, socialist thing back in the '40s [1940s].  Lou Hill [Lewis Hill] was one of the pioneer--big fighters, First Amendment guy, so that was; I mean that's been the evolution over time of Pacifica.  Started out with I believe the flagship station, I think it was KPFA [KPFA Radio] was the flagship station in Berkeley [California].  Then of course WBAI [WBAI Radio] in New York [New York], KPFK, WPFW [WPFW Radio] in Washington, D.C., KPFT [KPFT Radio] in Houston [Texas], and now what they have done is they affiliate, affiliate with--affiliated with a lot of the college stations. It's quite, quite a network.
Speaker 1: All right, okay. I, I never really understood how that worked, but I know that that some of the NPR stations carried Pacifica broadcast from time-to-time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, kind of loosely.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But basically it's a whole 'nother operation onto itself.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I didn't know that Mine- Minnesota provided--
Speaker 2: They're the radical public radio folk.
Speaker 1: Okay, well that's true, I know, I did know that but I didn't know how it really fit into the public radio--
Speaker 2: Totally different.
Speaker 1: --schematic, yeah.
Speaker 2: I'll tell you how loosely they get some money--I'm not sure how much when I was there--about 10 to 15 percent of their operating budget came from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  And as you know, NPR gets a considerable chunk of their money from CPB, although now they're so well-heeled now they got you know all the funders from the big philanthropists.  But for a period of time it was Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
Story_ID: 485904
Speaker 1: (Background noise) You're doing radio and come up with this archive and so, well just walk us through it.  Now what, what happens in the--we're, we're almost in the '80s [1980s] now--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so.
Speaker 2: Well I left Pacifica [Pacifica Radio Network], KPFK [KPFK Radio, Los Angeles, California] in 1980 and that started another phase in my life, phase that ran parallel with the, the writing, radio, broadcasting, media stuff.  And that was the family's developing, and the reason I left Pacifica, as often happens in the past, budget.  Periodically they run out of money, and so staff layoffs, cutbacks and so forth, I was reduced--my time--we never made a lot of money there anyway.  But at this point in time I have a son [Fanon Hutchinson] now, so and yet there was another one on the way.  So now I got to start thinking what am I'm gonna do, and it came at the absolute worst time for me, the worst time is basically I got laid off after all those years.  With many others, I wasn't the only one, and so I was out of a job for almost a year, and it was--. Now my wife then she was a school teacher.  So you know she was the principal breadwinner, you know I mean I collected unemployment, but that was the interim period.  So what happened was I'm thinking you're not gonna make money writing, the book thing had pretty much played out at that point.  You're not gonna make any money in radio, certainly not gonna make any money in public radio, NPR [National Public Radio] was not even on the charts then.  This is 1980, '81 [1981], so what I did was what most people do that need a job, look at the want ads (laughter) what could I do?  So one day I saw an ad for a test for a company called the State Compensation Insurance Fund, a workers' comp [workers' compensation] agency, and a state agency.  And I didn't know anything about insurance, I mean it was like the sun and the moon, I mean so far from my scope of anything.  But it's a job, so I went down and I took the test you know I had no expectations whatsoever 'cause I was looking at some other things, I was trying actually--KUSC [KUSC Radio, Los Angeles, California] was getting off the ground then.  I was really trying to lobby to get a, a production position over at KUSC, but they kept dragging their feet, dragging their feet, dragging their feet and time, time, time is passing, the meter's running.  So anyway to my surprise, which I knew nothing about insurance, knew nothing about anything, I passed the test.  Went in, had the interview and said okay, so I got hired as, you ready for this, an auditor.  I mean I, I can't, I can't put two and two together, an auditor, a payroll auditor.  But you know they, they have, you'll be trained and (laughter) so I said thanks, but no thanks.  I, I don't think so, I'll take my chances out there (laughter) out here in the world, so, so some months went by.
Story_ID: 485905
Speaker 1: And in the meantime, I separated from my wife, so you know we went through some things how to, how to work this thing.  So in any case when that happened, I'm still out of a job, my unemployment's running out, I got one month left and there's no extension, so what to do?  So fate intervened again as is often happened in the past, and this time it was on the week before Christmas.  What happened was I got a phone call--I'm in bed, snoring, half asleep.  I get this call from one of the managers at the state fund [State Compensation Insurance Fund], and he says, "Is Earl Hutchinson [HistoryMaker Earl Ofari Hutchinson] here," he says, "Earl Hutchinson?" I said, "Who is this?"  'Cause I had been getting some calls you know from phone solicitors selling this, selling that, I said, "No, he's not here," and I hung up.  And then he called back again and something told me, wait a minute, this is something different, and I said, "Yes, this is Earl Hutchinson."  He said, "Well I'm so and so from state fund." "Oh."  So anyway went over, he said, "Are you still interested?" Because you know they have the list, so I went in.  You know you're on the state list, went in they had an opening, so they hired me.  He said if it had gone--oh I know what it was, I'm sorry, I'm leaving out something--actually I called them to see if there was anything there.  Because you have one year and I knew that the year was up, if I had waited one more week before calling I would've been off the list.  Because they purge the list and start all over again, and then I would've never had that, I would've never worked there.  As it turned out it was a godsend, let me tell you why.  Got a job with the State Compensation Insurance Fund as a workers' compensation insurance consultant, stayed in sales for two years, and didn't do too bad.  Then after that, I went to engineering school, and this is a part of my life that most people don't know.  And I became a safety engineer for the State of California, so when I said a whole 'nother world which had nothing to do with anything that we're talking about now (laughter).  But it was a whole 'nother world. So I always had for twenty-six years from that period 'til I retired in January of this year from the state fund.  Few people knew, they always thought Earl Ofari Hutchinson, the author, writer, media person, very people knew that the guy had another hidden career.  I was a safety engineer for the State of California, and what I did was, of course you're familiar with fed OSHA [Occupational Safety and Health Administration] and Cal/OSHA [Division of Occupational Safety and Health], what I did was devise safety programs and advised and consulted businesses on a range of safety issues: machine safety, job safety, Cal/OSHA rules, accident investigation, deaths, death claims and investigations, a lot of that.  Had a lot of construction accounts, this account, that account; it was a whole 'nother world.  So that was from 1981 to 2007, January 1981 to January 30, 2007, my tenure with the State Compensation Insurance Fund.
Story_ID: 485906
Speaker 1: So for four years, from 1981 to 1984, the writing was out, I never lifted a pen, didn't do anything, lost interest in everything.  All the stuff from the past, just basically you know had the kids 'cause I was raising them, one of the--back then you know was kind of a pioneer.  A single father, basically, the children, they stayed with me, my son [Fanon Hutchinson] and daughter, and the other daughter with the, their mother.  So basically it was another experience in my life, actually raising children when, before it became fashionable for men to do it.  And I had so many interesting experiences there.  So I didn't do anything, no writing, nothing, nothing for four years, until yet another turn in my life.  Basically those were the lounging years and the parenting years until my present wife, I met her.  And then so you know we were together for a couple of years I mean, you know our relationship was developing.  Until one day she said, "You know you sure spend a lot of time with the headphones on listening to jazz and sitting there reading the paper.  What else are you doing?" And then she said something else, she didn't know about my past.  That I had written books, done that you know it was another phase in my life, she didn't know anything about that.  She didn't know who this Earl Ofari [HistoryMaker Earl Ofari Hutchinson] anything, anything she was just you know a relationship, 'til she said something.  Remember I told you about that counselor that gave me a spur (unclear)? We were talking about something one day and I always kid her about this, 'cause she said, "I--you remember what you said to me one day?"  I said that, "You know I have a book that I had." She said, "Well, you wrote a book?" I said, "Yeah I did write a book."  But the way she said it was like you (laughter) and then she said something else that made it even worse.  She said, "Well who would know about you?" But it wasn't said maliciously, and you know was said very innocently (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She just didn't know?
Speaker 1: Yeah, she just didn't know, and I said, you're right, who would know, all of these years, the last few years what have I been doing, nothing.  Well I mean I'm not saying nothing you know I mean I take great pride you know in the family thing.  But everything was on hold and so what happened after that went to Florida, my sister [Earline Hutchinson] lived in Jacksonville, Florida.  We took our first cruise together then my significant other, we went on a cruise, we stopped in Jacksonville on the way back.  And I, one day we were talking, my sister and, and Barbara [Barbara Bramwell Hutchinson], and she was doing some, some layout for a newspaper, because that's what she did back then, it was all cut and paste.  And I said hm, wouldn't it be nice, wouldn't it be nice to put together a little newsletter?  And so they suggested, "Well you used to write, you used to write, can you put together--?"  So when I got back to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] it was germinating an idea, I put together 'Ofari's Bi-monthly' [Earl Ofari Hutchinson].  I took a stab at a newsletter, you know my news and opinions and things, so one thing led to another and I started getting my columns back together.  Started writing again, started syndicating stuff, and so, boom, we move forward.  And then the books started coming again in rapid succession.
Speaker 2: That's quite a story, I mean, I, I never suspected that, that you just completely gotten out of it for a while.
Speaker 1: Didn't do anything.
Speaker 2: That's--hm.
Speaker 1: And what happened was I had the great fortune during all those years when I'm working for the state [at the State Compensation Insurance Fund], I had a manager who was a very conservative white guy, ex-Marine, Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan], Pat Buchanan, archconservative.  He was my manager, but an interesting thing about him, personally he was a great guy, I mean just don't talk politics now you know.  And, and do your job, do your, get your reports in, take care of your clients, and he let me alone, I was able to go on and get my master's degree [from California State University, Dominguez Hills, Carson, California].  Do some work toward a Ph.D. [at Pacific Western University, Los Angeles, California], write three books. And he always let me--and do all of my media stuff.
Story_ID: 485907
Speaker 1: Now you're writing again?
Speaker 2: Right, thank god (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you're, you're you know and you said your boss [at the State Compensation Insurance Fund] is giving you latitude to, to you know--
Speaker 2: I take my hat off to him. He, he actually helped my career along and he didn't know it (laughter) by doing one thing, leaving me alone.  So I had the flexibility anyway 'cause I was always in the field, it was a field job, you know taking care of your accounts, and consulting and advising and--.  So it would not have worked, my car- everything would've ended if I had, had a desk job.  You know I would not have been able to function.  So actually he was, he was very helpful, a lot of times when the TV start thing started coming in more and more and more.  Doing interviews and of course the big thing that hit and took another part of my life, but that's getting ahead of the story was the O.J. [O.J. Simpson] thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, 1995 are we there yet, should we, be, be there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Most of the '80s [1980s] basically was just developing the newsletters, writing, still doing news and public affairs, programming with Pacifica [Pacifica Radio Network], not as a staff person.
Speaker 1: Oh--
Story_ID: 485908
Speaker 1: You went--two, two pieces in the '90s [1990s] we need to talk about I guess one is, one is 'Black Fatherhood: The Guide to Male Parenting' [Earl Ofari Hutchinson].  I, I remember that coming out in '92 [1992] and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that was like when I, when I saw that on--people that knew your previous work say, where he's been all this time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You know, we're kind of like wondering, well, you know, yeah, that's [HistoryMaker] Earl Ofari Hutchinson, the same guy that wrote the Garnet book ['Let Your Motto Be Resistance: The Life and Thought of Henry Highland Garnet,' Earl Ofari Hutchinson]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know. We, we--
Speaker 2: What's he been doing?
Speaker 1: --knew it was you, yeah what's he been doing you know?
Speaker 2: Is he still around, in the land of the living and breathing?
Speaker 1: Well we, we just figured it was the coast you know.  You were out here doing stuff, we just never heard--knew what you were doing.
Speaker 2: Well partly he wasn't doing anything (laughter) wasn't anything to hear.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well not doing anything that was you know published and aware in terms of publishing.
Speaker 2: Well actually--
Speaker 1: That book, okay.
Speaker 2: --before we come back to (unclear) and Jawanza [Jawanza Kunjufu]. Jawanza actually got me going again with the, the book publishing.  Because it was 'The Mugging of Black America' [Earl Ofari Hutchinson], that was the book that came before 'Black Fatherhood'--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'The Guide to Male Parenting.'
Speaker 1: 'The Mugging of Black America.'
Speaker 2: 'The Mugging of Black America,' Jawanza published that with African American Images [African American Images, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So that came out in 1990, and at that point I was just wrapping up at Cal State, Dominguez [California State University, Dominguez Hills, Carson, California], they had an interdisciplinary humanities arts program, humanities, humanities program.  And I was able to get my master's degree through that program because I hadn't completed at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], I left.  So between that and then working on the book, because it came out of a series of articles that I worked on.  You know now I'm beginning to look at black on black crime, I mean now that's kind of, especially in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], we had the big--crack's thing here--
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) at that point in time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I mean it was taking also--(unclear) I'm doing--
Speaker 1: Right, the stories coming out of here were so--
Speaker 2: So, but that's, you know I'm paying attention to that, and actually writing about it in my articles and pieces.  So the book evolved out of that. Now the 'Black Fatherhood' book came out of actually my father [Earl Hutchinson], now we come to the old man.  At that point, I'm just appalled, enraged at the black male bashing, you know, remember women are getting [HistoryMaker] Terry McMillan, 'Waiting to--' ['Waiting to Exhale'] you know now that's the whole thing, beat up on black men.  Beat up on them, irresponsible, derelict, crime (unclear), yada, not in the home, I mean still there, even before Bill Cosby and the rest.  And I'm thinking wait a minute that was not experience, I had a father that was always there.  And I know many men that grew up with fathers in the home, in intact home. I, that wa- you know that was not my experience.  I'm not denying that other experience, you know, dysfunctional--I'm not denying that, obviously that's there.  But that's only part of the story, what about telling the other side, the positive experiences that we've had with loving, intact, very, very nurturing parents, fathers, men like my father, he was always there.  I mean obviously there were issues that went on, who I mean what family doesn't have, but he was there.  Could he have been a better nurturer? Of course, I mean in that era you know I mean the man thing.  But he was all--I never remember having no clothes on the back, I never remember not having any food on the table.  I never remember having a roof over, I never remember when things happened, him being, not being there, I never remember that.  So the book came out, so I wanted to interview men of different source in intact homes, father and mother, two parent household.  I wanted to interview men that were not in an intact, but of fathers, single fathers that for whatever reason were in there, but are still fathers.  I wanted to interview men that were fathers only in name only, and I wanted to get that experience, a composite of experiences, the whole spectrum of men trying to deal with fatherhood.  I, (unclear) with all the pressures in society on black men, so that's how that book evolved, basically it was just really interviews and commentary in between.
Story_ID: 485909
Speaker 1: And then, you know, the book that came out of that ['Black Fatherhood: The Guide to Male Parenting,' Earl Ofari Hutchinson], that actually put me back on the map again, 'The Assassination of the Black Male Image' [Earl Ofari Hutchinson].  That was the one we hit big with because it hit at the right time, you got Tyson [Mike Tyson], O.J. [O.J. Simpson], you know Ja- I mean all of them, boom.  So we had hit at the right time.  But I became deeply interested in now of course male studies, and the whole stereotypes and negative images of typecasting.  So the books basically were really an attack, an assault to show another side, another dimension of our life.
Speaker 2: Now in these, some of these cases we're talking about there were big in the early '90s [1990s] and mid-'90s [1990s] Mike Tyson's trial for raping a, a candidate, beauty contestant [Desiree Washington], right? In--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Indiana think it was, she you know went up to his room and, you know, he you know and--.  Did you have a, what was your take on that? On--
Speaker 1: Well with the Tyson thing in fact one of the chapters in the book, "Tyson," "Tyson," "Tyson, Thomas, Tall Tales" [sic. "Thomas, Tyson and Tall Tales"].  Because Clarence Thomas, remember that was hitting at the same time the--
Speaker 2: Right that he was sexually harassing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the hearings.  Exactly.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So they were all coming together, so it made for, hey, a great book, great subject at that time.  Well he did it, there's no question about it. However, what I always argued was never guilt or innocence of someone.  Even during the O.J. thing when they did tons of commentary on that, that was never the issue, it was a double standard in how black men are treated that do commit--either commit crimes or accused of it.  Here's where things kick in how the whole wrath of the nation comes down, kicks in, as opposed to white men that you know bad behaving white guys that do things too, and it's never quite the same.  So my thing was always just the double standards, (unclear) I never really got into you know he said, she said--that, that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --we never went there, that was not the point in my books, the point was just to expose stereotypes and double standards.
Speaker 2: Do you have an opinion as to why--
Speaker 1: See I felt that was a minefield; once you start getting into, well do you think O.J. did it, you think Ty- (unclear), you're never gonna win on that one.
Speaker 2: Well on, in terms of, of how you know Johnnie Cochran won the O.J. case [People of the State of California v. Orenthal James Simpson, 1995], did you have an opinion about that?
Speaker 1: No, because you know what, in my book, and my other book is 'Beyond O.J.: Race, Sex, and Class Lessons' ['Beyond O.J.: Race, Sex, and Class Lessons for America,' Earl Ofari Hutchinson], all my commentary, they never knew where I stood because never once did I ever take a position. Guilt or innocence is not why I'm here, I'm here just to comment on the issues in the trial.  And as far as Cochran goes, all I ever said about that was a jury decided, a jury of twelve men and true, I mean the old thing, of course obviously not.  They decided, so the jury's verdict is, he's not guilty, whether he actually did it and whether--that's between him and his maker.  And the other thing is as far as Johnnie Cochran, it was brilliant, his defense, he did everything a defense attorney was supposed to do.  Create reasonable doubt, and he did, and it wasn't very hard with a bumbling prosecution.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what I was really asking about his defense you know (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was brilliant.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know Johnnie had help, he had, he had a team around it too, but he was the face of it.  And you know he took some heat for it all the way to his dying day, but nonetheless, it was tailor made for O.J. and the times.  Johnnie Cochran today couldn't, wouldn't have a breath with O.J. today; he wouldn't work a day (laughter).  No matter how mu- he could be Clarence Darrow coming back, it wouldn't work today, it's, the whole climate's changed.  But we always had a, I always had a great respect for Johnnie.
Speaker 2: Okay, I always suspect that the public in Los Angeles [California], black people knew that police department and had such contempt for it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: --that, that it was hard to--you know if they actually had a chance to vote--
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: --against him, they--
Speaker 1: You know we always used to say about the LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department] and O.J.? The scuttlebutt was this is one of those cases where they framed a guilty man.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, it did appear that way, that's exactly what I was getting at you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they framed a guilty man, and suffered for it as a result (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Lost because of it.
Story_ID: 485910
Speaker 1: How about now in 1995, I don't have my glasses on I'm squinting like this (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You published like Black, 'Blacks and Reds: Race' (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ah.
Speaker 1: --'and Class in Conflict,' okay now, '1919- 1990' ['Blacks and Reds: Race and Class in Conflict, 1919-1990,' Earl Ofari Hutchinson].
Speaker 2: Right, history of the cog, got in--that was another one of my academic pursuits.  I was always fascinated with left-wing radicalism, always fascinated with the Communist Party.  And particularly coming out of the '30s [1930s], the Communist Party, all the stories, discussions I ever had and people I've met.  I had a long-term relationship with Dorothy Healey [Dorothy Ray Healey], you know before she passed.  Dorothy Healey many years lived in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and of course you know she was like, like the grand dame of the Communist Party, West Coast going through the, into the '30s [1930s] and all those years.  So they were always there and Dorothy never, you know she lived in the neighborhood, so conversations, discussions got interested going to the--never, they had a bookstore here, I did a lot of material from that.  So, you know the influence was there and the interest was there.  I decided I wanted to do a full-blown, big bodied academic look at the history of the Communist Party from the formation in 1919--U.S. Communist Party, and this relationship with black America.  Because I thought it was such a rich and untold story, particularly in the '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s].  You know that was the only party that ever, that I know of I mean really, really made a principled stand when it wasn't fashionable against race, institutional racism.  With all of its towering flaws that it had, still was a party that actually went on record, we oppose segregation and everything around that, I mean when it wasn't fashionable.  So I spent two years researching, studying, collecting materials and then I had the fortune--Michigan State University [Michigan State University Press, East Lansing, Michigan], they picked up the book, the manuscript, did it.  I don't think that was my best work, though.
Story_ID: 485911
Speaker 1: The next year my best work was, god, let me see his- (makes sounds) 'Betrayed: The History of Presidential Betrayal of African Americans'--'A Failure To Protect Black Lives' [sic. 'Betrayed: A History of Presidential Failure To Protect Black Lives,' Earl Ofari Hutchinson].  I still think that's my, my best academic work and also blend of populist work, populist/academic, slash.  And that was published by Westview Press, and then Harper and Collins [sic. HarperCollins Publishers LLC] picked up on it.
Speaker 2: Now that's--it's interesting, I think a lot of black people have a general view that white people are not really paying them any attention.  They really don't--not as concerned about the- about them as black people as they are concerned about white people as white people.  Or, politically otherwise, and just as your mother [Nina Brown Hutchinson], you know, would hear conversations that she couldn't imagine taking place if she hadn't been there to hear 'em (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: You know I mean I think did your book have a similar effect on black people who read it about the concern that presidents had in not protecting, or I mean they were consciously not protecting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --the rights of black people.
Speaker 1: Yes, I think it was kind of a hybrid book, originally it was an academic press book and as you well know they always have very limited, limited scope circulation.  Primarily among academics and intellectuals and specialized college, college researchers and certain departments--political, social.  Political science departments, or history, so it was pretty limited until Harpers picked it up and then it got some legs.  It got some discussion, it got some look, it got some tongues wagging, it got some pretty good reviews.  And at that point in time, I think it made an impact. How big an impact, I can't say.  But it certainly made some people take notice. Because one of the areas I was fascinated with in the research process was how presidents and attorneys general, how they flagrantly violated the law during the whole period of lynchings, and during the whole period of racially motivated violence.  Primarily we're looking at the '20s [1920s] '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s] through successive administrations.  Basically just essentially flouted their own law, and how the federal government never, ever at any point intervened.  As you know there was a huge battle for years at the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] (unclear) to get an ant- a federal anti-lynching law.  Never, never happened, to this day we still don't have one on the books.
Speaker 2: We had a Dyer Anti-Lynching [Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill]--I mean a proposed bill but it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Shakes head) It was killed every year.
Speaker 2: --killed every, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know northern, conservative northern Republicans, southern Dixiecrats, killed it every year with the president's help.  Didn't lift a finger to support it because their thing was we can't--Democratic presidents, we can't lose the support of the South on other stuff, and Republicans they weren't interested.  So of course you know nothing really changed until the '60s [1960s] and probably, so anyway that was an area which I felt was neglected part of history, and I felt needed to be exposed.  And that's a book that I really take a great deal of pride in.
Story_ID: 485912
Speaker 1: Are you doing any teaching at this point?
Speaker 2: No, actually--not--well, yes and no.  I am, I'm not teaching for a very brief period, I was at Cal State, Dominguez [California State University, Dominguez Hills, Carson, California] very brief, for one semester.  Left there, got numbers of offers, but primarily my thing has been working in broadcasting media, and the writing.  And then of course you know I had another, I mean my other world that I already told you about.  So I mean that, it doesn't leave a lot for that.  I even if I didn't have the other world, I'd probably would not have been interested in, 'cause I turned positions down.  I never wanted the burden of a classroom, students, come some, I don't mean to sound that, but it just seem like it would hamper me.  It would tie up things I didn't, tie up time and, and energy which I didn't want to do.  So what I did want to do was be in a position of being a visiting lecturer where basically I didn't have the burdens of classroom.  Didn't have the burdens of office hours, didn't have the burdens of grading papers, and dealing with every student problem and hang up under the sun.  Didn't have that problem, basically I can just come in and lecture.  So for a while, actually I hit the lecture circuit, and came very close, last year at UC, San Diego [University of California, San Diego, San Diego, California], they have a visiting lecturer chair, and we talked about that.  But at that point I'm still working, you know, for the state [at the State Compensation Insurance Fund], so I just let that go.  I am teaching now classes that I've set up in adult programs and I call it, I have my roundtables that I do every Saturday, the--.  My other, yet the other world is Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, which I set-up.   And we've been, I've had that for four years where every Saturday we have public, public issues discussions at different venues.  So what I have done has spun off from that, and I have a Contemporary Issues Roundtable that I have at two venues now.  Under the auspice of two adults, senior citizen, two adult, senior citizen centers.  And I find that more comfortable and relaxing because at my, you know my age now and the stage of my life, don't give me anything I gotta (laughter) I gotta work--I mean twenty-seven years of juggling, no.
Story_ID: 485913
Speaker 1: You worked for the state [at the State Compensation Insurance Fund] until 2007, but--
Speaker 2: Well until--yeah, 2007 (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Okay, okay so, but during--even, even before you leave you're a blogger for The Huffington Post, got another book, 'Crisis in Black and, and Black' ['The Crisis in Black and Black,' Earl Ofari Hutchinson]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well and two more since then.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, yeah the, 'The Emerging Black GOP Majority' [Earl Ofari Hutchinson].
Speaker 2: Ye- right.
Speaker 1: Another book, 'The Latino Challenge'--
Speaker 2: 'To Black America' ['The Latino Challenge to Black America: Towards a Conversation Between African Americans and Hispanics,' Earl Ofari Hutchinson].
Speaker 1: --'to Black America.'  Well you want, let's, let's touch on some of these and see what their, what your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And don't forget 'The Ethnic Presidency: How Race Decides the Race' ['The Ethnic Presidency: How Race Decides the Race to the White House,' Earl Ofari Hutchinson]--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, yeah, that's the latest, latest one?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, well actually there's one since then.
Speaker 1: Since then okay what's the latest?
Speaker 2: It's right over there (gesture).
Speaker 1: Okay, I can't see it, but (laughter) I don't have my glasses on, I can't I know I'd seen a book, but I can't see--
Speaker 2: Stack of them right there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You'll have one walking out the door.
Speaker 1: All right, okay, all right, good, good.
Speaker 2: In fact you'll have copies of all of them.
Speaker 1: Well walk us through those last four.
Speaker 2: Okay first of all 'The Crisis in Black and Black' that looked at a whole range of issues in terms of internally.  It was a play on Charles Silberman's [Charles E. Silberman] book, the classic book that was written in the '60s [1960s], the 'Crisis in Black and White.'
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well in twenty--in a quarter century, things have changed now, remember before, things aren't as, as simple as they used to be.  Race in America now is not just white and black; it's a whole series of different paradigms now and one had, has always fascinated me in the internal dynamics, the conflicts that we have had.  Black on black crime, family issues, stereotyping each other, you know the rappers the hip hoppers, so began looking at that, those issues.  Filmmakers, so 'The Crisis in Black and Black' was to look at basically how we stereotype and how we salvage our image in many different ways.  The, the next one that came out was actually one other 'The Disappearance of Black Leadership' [Earl Ofari Hutchinson], it came out in 2000.  And that was a look basically now at what's happen with the disintegration of the Civil Rights Movement.  The old civil rights organizations, now changes there, leadership--I mean now we're seeing shifts and changes.  And who are they leading; what are they leading; how are they leading, looking at those issues.   Then the next book was, after that, 'The Latino Challenge to Black America' title and the subtitle almost explaining itself.  'Towards a Conversation Between African Americans and Hispanics,' now we have yet another dynamic, now the black/Latino conflict.  You know the gang violence, especially we sensitive, extremely sensitive to it in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], front line out here.  Immigration issues that came in, how that impacts black America, jobs, housing, services, yada, dada, dada.  Gangs, prisons, education, competition for services, political empowerment you know the clash, the ancient clash of, of ethnic groups now jockeying for power.  The next one was the 'The Ethni-' 'The Ethnic Presidency,' almost self-explanatory with Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], the rise of tha- but it was a series of--because I'm a political analyst, so it's a series of things I'm doing looking at the political process.  Looking at race, class, gender issues and so that brought to bear in that book.  This book now, 'How the GOP Can Take Back the White House,' excuse me, 'How the GOP Can Keep the White House, and How the Democrats Can Take Back the White House' [sic. 'How the GOP Can Keep the White House, How the Democrats Can Take it Back,' Earl Ofari Hutchinson], title almost tells the story too.  Again assessing both sides, Democrats, Republicans, all the issues there, all the, the dynamic of this election, and always a lot of history too.  Republican Party, relationship with blacks, Democratic Party, relationship with African Americans and others, Latinos and Asians.  So those are a (unclear) tour of those four books.
Story_ID: 485914
Speaker 1: Oh, and the other one 'The Emerging'--five books. 'The Emerging GO-' 'The Emerging Black GOP Majority' [Earl Ofari Hutchinson]. Story about that one, bad luck on that.  That was gonna be a takeoff on Kevin Thomas' [sic. Kevin Phillips] book, very--political analyst you know very well thought of and I respect.  His book was written back in 1968, 'The Emerging GOP Majority' [sic. 'The Emerging Republican Majority,' Kevin Phillips], the rise of Richard Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon], how Nixon came along and you know fused that GOP [Republican Party] again to begin to make it once again a dominant force in America.  Didn't do a bad job, we'll see how it works out this time.  So it was gonna be a play on that because at that point in time, Bush [President George Walker Bush] was making this big pitch about we want you know blacks in the Republican Party.  Party of diversity, we're changing the party, the rise of black conservatism, black GOPers now becoming more and more prominent.  So I'm thinking this title would be a great one, a marketing title, could get people's attention, 'The Emerging Black GOP Majority.'  That was not my first choice for a title, the first choice was gonna keep it simple, 'The Republican Party in Black America' [ph.].  But everybody said that's too bland, has no value whatsoever, boy were they wrong and was I right. Why?  Because my dumb luck the book came out, was scheduled to come out in August of 2005. What happened August 29, 2005?  Katrina [Hurricane Katrina].  And what happened to George Bush and his, in black America, and his dream of all these black GOPers and another party, boom.  And guess what happened to my book with that title, tons of them in the garage now (laughter). Well, you win some, you lose some (laughter) so I can't even give the book away.  That's the second time bad luck followed me. Another one with the O.J. [O.J. Simpson] book, now that I think about it.  'Beyond O.J.: Race, Sex and Class Lessons for America' [Earl Ofari Hutchinson], the book was scheduled to come out, it had been written, it was ready to go.  It was scheduled to come out in--the verdict [in the People of the State of California v. Orenthal James Simpson] came in on October of 1995, we had the book ready to go in the (laughter) spring of 1995.  We held it, who could, you know who has a crystal ball and can see the future?  Held it, listened to some bad advice, and by the way, we had so much money that we made coming out of 'The Assassination' ['The Assassination of the Black Male Image,' Earl Ofari Hutchinson], we sold fifty thousand copies of 'The Assassination' it was--couldn't keep it in, it was just rolling out, the dollars were flowing in.  We were, (laughter) we had so much money and then made, and Simon Schuster [Simon and Schuster, Inc.] picked it up and then you know they paid through the nose for it.  We felt so good, 'cause my wife [Barbara Bramwell Hutchinson], we formed a little publishing house [Middle Passage Press].  So, we got greedy and cocky, what we did was, we're gonna print hardcover--we're gonna print twenty thousand hardcover 'Beyond O.J.' and we're gonna be on easy street for the rest of our lives.  Because the whole world is looking at O.J., books are selling you know, be- bestsellers all this and that.  So we're thinking, we'll cash in on that, we gonna bring it out in October.  I don't know why October, anyway the verdict comes in and guess what, we had published the book.  Invested a lot of money in it, hardcover, twenty thousand; that's not cheap.  The first signing I knew we were in trouble, right after the O.J. verdict and America reacted the way it did (laughter), I mean the mania.
Speaker 2: So the book was out before the verdict?
Speaker 1: Well it was written, but we didn't go to publish it, we could publish anytime.  We brought it out in October after the verdict came in, we did one book signing over there, and I never will forget, little things.  Somebody walked by, we had the books out and they did like this (gesture) and kept going, I knew we were in trouble.  Wasn't scientific, I just knew at that look and that (gesture) and guess what (laughter) we spent the next five years, couldn't give the book away, we tried everything.  Literacy programs, we went to South Africa, take--nobody wanted it, couldn't give it away.  Finally one of my accounts is a recycler, I had to beg the man: "I got all these boxes in the garage, would you take them and just recycle them?"  He took the books as a favor to me, said, "My machine cannot recycle hardcover" 'cause it would tear some of the machines.  He said, "But because Earl [HistoryMaker Earl Ofari Hutchinson], you've been, you've helped us out, you've been a great guy with our account, you know, you've consulted with us, you did all this.  I'm gonna t- I'm gonna bring the truck over and I'll take the books off your--."  One year later when I called on his account, guess where I saw the books and the boxes, stuck in the back of his (laughter) facility, he just took them as a favor.  Couldn't do anything, even the recycler couldn't do anything with them, that's my story.
Story_ID: 485915
Speaker 1: Now your latest book, what's your, what's the title of your latest book, the--?
Speaker 2: 'How the GOP Can Keep the White House, How the Democrats Can Take It Back' [Earl Ofari Hutchinson], by the way this book, I've learned some, I'd like to think I learned a few lessons in the publishing world.  And we were very much a part of that for almost ten years, this one is not a commercial book.  Was not--I only had fifty copies, 'cause now with print on demand, you can just you know many as you want, whenever you want.  We never again, we're gonna print a, a mass volume, we used to do two and three thousand at a time, I did fifty the last two times.  And the book is only for one reason, it's not for a commercial sell, it's basically a calling card for producers at the big talk shows.  You know, CNN, MSNBC, so I basically I send it to them because when they want an expert, "We have Dr. Hutchinson who is--," or "[HistoryMaker] Earl Ofari Hutchinson, political analyst" (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you have appeared on quite a number of those, those shows.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah, and so that's what it is.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite show to go on or--?
Speaker 2: Well I went on O- I went on O'Reilly's [Bill O'Reilly] show ['The O'Reilly Factor'] let's see about thirteen or fourteen times, and everybody asked and you know, "How do you get along with this guy?"
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.
Speaker 2: I said, it's simple, it's easy; don't challenge him, and let the big wind past, and when it does, if he likes you, you'll get a one word in, maybe two.  But these shows--so anyway that's the books are for that, and this will probably be my last book.  I do not see another book unless some- something happens I can't foresee now.  But I wanna go back now into what th- I like to do, in fact I'm getting ready to come out of retirement now, I left the station [KPFK Radio, Los Angeles, California].  I did a Pacifica [Pacifica Radio Network] show, which is very popular in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] called 'Tuesday Live' for eight years.  And I left it in August 2005, because they were having problems with management at the station, so I just left.  Gave it up after eight years, it was probably the pop- most popular public radio talk show in the city.  Built up a huge audience, and I'm going back next month, we have a new management there, and I've been waiting just bidding my time, so I'm going back on Pacifica again.  And, and I'm gonna jumpstart the show again, but this time I'm gonna do it three different ways.  One, it's gonna be a national show, it's going to be Ustreamed using the new technology now; I'm just awed by it.  We're gonna Ustream it, we'll broadcast it and then we'll hit blog talk radio, we'll do it, we'll do a national simulcast with it.  We'll do the podcast, I'll do my commentaries, we'll piggyback that around.  And essentially I'm gonna do it with a live audience where we do our roundtables out of, Lucy Florence [Lucy Florence Coffee House and Cultural Center, Los Angeles, California].  I wanna make this the first national talk show out of Los Angeles, they're all from the East, but there's nothing here, so that's the plan.
